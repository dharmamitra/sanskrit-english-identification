If they feel so moved they can practice it tooThats the way the Buddha taught and there hasnt been any improvement on it sinceSo theres nothing wrong with having a goalAs the Buddha said the anguish that comes from realizing that you havent reached your goal is much better than the pleasure that comes from indulging in sensual pleasuresHe talks about worldly or householder grief and renunciate griefHouseholder joy and renunciate joyHouseholder equanimity and renunciate equanimityHouseholder grief is realizing that youd like to have pleasant sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas but youve got unpleasant onesFor most people the antidote to that is to find pleasant ones ie householder joyBut thats not the path the Buddha recommendsHe recommends that if you have householder grief try to replace it with renunciate griefIn other words even though things are uncomfortable outside thats not the real problemThe real problem is that you havent found a deathless happiness insideThe grief that comes when you reflect on the fact that you havent reached the deathless yet motivates you in the right direction to follow the path leading to renunciate joyThats the joy that comes when you realize that the qualities youve developed inside really have led to AwakeningFrom there you go to renunciate equanimity the peace of mind that comes when youve attained your goalPeople often have immature attitudes about goals which is why some teachers say to drop all idea of goals when you meditateThat may be a useful attitude for shortterm meditation but for the long term it leads to experienced meditators whose experience of meditation is of going nowhere and who develop a perverse pride around their nowhere as wellThe longterm solution is to develop a mature attitude toward your goal one that realizes that even though the path may take time you can take comfort in the fact that its a good path and its headed in the right directionThis is the mature kind of attitude that really does yield resultsThere is a deathless happiness and it can be found through your effortsDont let anyone else tell you otherwiseWhen you first look at a teaching like dependent coarising it seems very abstract and very far away from anything you might be doing in the practiceBut if you look at it more carefully you see that it makes a whole series of important statements that have an immediate bearing on what youre doing right hereTo begin with when the Buddha talks about the causes of suffering he doesnt trace it back to what you areHe doesnt say you suffer because youre basically bad or because youre basically good but somehow have been socially conditioned to forget your true inner goodnessHe comes back instead to what you doThat right there is a radical statement and it opens huge possibilitiesIts hard to change what you are but you can change your actions simply through knowledge through understanding which things you do are going to cause suffering which states of mind lead to sufferingYou can look for those and you can change themTo the extent the Buddha does talk about what you are its far along the path of dependent coarising way up there in whats called bhava or becomingIts not a question of what you inherently are good or badVery simply your being comes about from what you doThats the reverse of the way most of us thinkMost of us think that our basic nature is a certain way and we act in certain ways because of our basic natureThe Buddha says instead that what you are  in the sense of how you identify yourself on a sensual level on the level of form or on a formless level  can be traced back to what you doYou can learn to do things in a more skillful way which will lead to a change in your sense of what you are and that in turn will be less and less likely to cause sufferingThis is why the Buddhas teaching is a training because the kind of ignorance its meant to overcome is not an ignorance of what you are its simply a practical ignorance of which kinds of actions work for true happiness and which kinds dontThats the basic principle of the four noble truthsEach of the knowledges in the four noble truths deals with a task that you develop as a skillThat in and of itself is another important statementIf the ignorance at the root of the problem were simply a matter of not knowing your true nature it would be an allornothing sort of thingYoud know it or you wouldntBut skills can be developed graduallyYour sensitivity develops your dexterity at shaping things more skillfully more appropriately develops over timeSo the path overcoming this practical ignorance isnt a sudden allornothing sort of pathIts a gradual path a gradual training in gaining more and more skillIts in this way that the teachings of dependent coarising are directly connected to what youre doing right nowYoure focusing on your breathYoure directing your thoughts to the breath and evaluating the breathYou use certain perceptions and certain feelings get involvedThese are all elements in the factor of fabrication which comes right after ignoranceWe breathe ignorantlyWe perceive things through ignoranceOur thoughts about things the way we evaluate things and our use of language generally are done with ignoranceAs a result we sufferBut if you bring knowledge to these processes they can actually become a healing kind of fabricationAfter all the path is a path of fabricationThe Buddha doesnt tell you just to drop all activity at once to be totally passive or totally devoid of any kind of intentionWe hear that the goal at the end of the path is to be free from fabrication so we think well just stop fabricating and that should get us thereBut the mind cant do thatThe path doesnt work that wayThe intention to stop fabricating is itself an intentionYou can get very much attached to that kind of passivity and still be stuck with all your problemsSo instead we bring more and more knowledge to the process of breathing and how we use our thoughts around the process of breathingSometimes you hear that our thinking which is based a lot on language is the reason why we suffer that we picked up these bad social influences that taught us to think in dualistic terms or whatever so weve got to drop language entirelyBut again thats not the Buddhas approachHe says that if you use language in ignorance youre going to sufferBut the problem is not with language its with the ignoranceI was talking to a Hindu monk a while back and he told me his response to someone who came up to him and asked How can we get beyond duality His response was Whats wrong with dualityYoure talking to me arent you Language is useful because it makes distinctionsIf you couldnt make distinctions how could we communicateWhat would our language be likeIt would be like speaking in tongues at a Pentecostal Church booahWho knows what it meansIt doesnt mean anything or could mean everything which is a totally useless languageThe mind has to make distinctionsWe feel distinctionsWe have a sense of right and wrong not simply because were taught them by societyIts a deeply ingrained habit that comes from our sense that some things are painful and some things are not and youve got to do something about the things that are painfulThis goes deep into our sense of feeling and perception mental fabrications that are often prelinguisticDeep down inside we know that anything that threatens our existence is bad anything that helps it is goodEven lizards know this muchThats why its embedded in the lizard brain a very strong sense of lizard good and lizard badThe hatred of pain the love of pleasure the ability to perceive an enemy to perceive an escape from an enemy These are really basic to the mind much prior to any kind of social conditioningOur social conditioning our more refined uses of language are actually needed to mitigate some of those lizard fears and kneejerk judgmentsSo instead of throwing out language or throwing out our social conditioning we learn how to use them more skillfullyAnd working with the breath is an ideal place to startYou give space to the mind by breathing in a way that feels goodYou can use your linguistic habits to talk to yourself about the breath How does this breath feelHow does that breath feelWhere would it feel good to breathe right nowWhich part of the body needs a larger dose of good breath energyIn this way you get more and more in touch with the immediate feeling of your body so that your linguistic habits can show immediate benefitsIt feels good to breathe this wayIt feels good to breathe that wayYour mind and your body are getting more intimate so that all the levels of fabrication  physical verbal and mental  start working together around a common sense of wellbeingIn this way they get to communicate with one anotherThe process of focusing on the breath in a skillful way is really a healing processEach time you sit down to meditate dont think of it as a choreThink of it as an opportunity to do some more healing workAnd dont think of it as a time when youre obliged to stop thinkingIn the beginning you have to use directed thought and evaluation to get things to settle down to adjust things to get everybody togetherAnd when everyone is together like this interesting things come upHidden feelings hidden perceptions suddenly show themselvesAnd you can work through themIts almost like dealing with a person whos possessedThe possessed person from the point of view of Western psychology is a schizophrenic There are two different personalities in the one personFrom a more traditional perspective there really are two different people in thereThe problem is that theyre not cooperatingTheyre working at cross purposesIf they can learn to cooperate theres no problemWho cares whether there are two or twenty people in thereIf they get along the problem is goneThats how Ajaan Fuang approached cases of spirit possessionInstead of driving out the spirit hed negotiate with it so that it would stop interfering in the possessed persons lifeWe have the same sort of problem even though we may seem normalOur directed thoughts and evaluations tend to work at cross purposesThe way we feel and our different perceptions can be running off in every direction at onceThis is why we have to meditateTo work with the breath is to create a space where all the different parts of the mind  all the different members of the committee all the different levels of sensation and activity going on  learn how to be with one another in a peaceful spot working on a common goalYoure showing goodwill for one another because youre cooperatingIn that way interesting things come up and you can deal with themYou can learn new habits in how you relate to your body new habits in how you think how you frame an issue in the mind and how you work through the difficulties in whatever issues you encounterWhen you learn how to deal with all the parts of yourself in a healthy way like this its a lot easier then to start dealing in a healthy way with other people tooSo the breath meditation not only helps youIt also helps everybody else you live with because it gives you paradigmsFor one thing it gives you immediate training in how to employ the brahmaviharas the sublime attitudes of limitless goodwill limitless compassion limitless empathetic joy limitless equanimityIn other words you start out with goodwill for yourself allowing yourself to breathe in a comfortable wayWhen you see that your breathing is uncomfortable or that the way you think is causing disease in the body or the mind you have compassion for yourself Lets try to figure out a better way to do this When its going well you dont start feeding on the idea that youre not worthy of this or that you really shouldnt allow yourself to feel this goodYou try to maintain that sense of wellbeingAppreciate itLet the ideas of deserving and not deserving just go by the boardsAgain those attitudes are usually based on an idea of what you are deep down inside that youre the sort of person who deserves to be punished for things you did in the pastThats not how the Buddhas teachings workDifferent actions will inevitably lead to different resultsTheres no question of anyone deserving to sufferSo if youre able to maintain a sense of wellbeing keep at itIf youre operating from a stable sense of wellbeing youre going to start acting in more skillful ways all aroundAnd then theres equanimity for the things that you cant change the bad habits you arent able to fully eradicate or the problems that come in from past kamma that you cant alterThe purpose of equanimity is to keep you focused on the things you can change so that you dont waste energy focusing on the things you cantIn this way as the members of your committee work together on the breath in a skillful way youre gaining some training in what are essentially social virtues the brahmaviharasThen you can apply the same lessons to your dealings with people around youSo instead of being a process of lobotomizing the mind so that you dont think meditation is actually training in learning how to think in more skillful ways how to act in more skillful ways  with knowledge with an understanding of actions and their resultsIn particular its training in learning how to distinguish the types of activities in the mind that would cause a particular situation to produce suffering or notIn the course of this training the question of who you are gets put asideThe question of who youve been gets put asideYou can focus purely on what youre doing what you can do to train yourself to be more sensitive and more effective in bringing about an end to suffering and what you can do to master activities that lead more and more to true happinessAfter all the issue is not what you are its what you doAnd if what you do is not skillful you can learn to make it more skillful with each inandout breathThose are some of the lessons that you can derive from what seems like a very abstract teaching on dependent coarisingIt is abstractIts put out as a list and its a very convoluted oneAs the Buddha himself admitted its not simpleIts like a tangled birds nest he said or a knotted ball of stringBut you can pull on a few strands pull out a few of the twigs and you find that even the individual strands and twigs are really helpful in putting an end to suffering teaching you how to think and act and even breathe in ways that can bring suffering to an endTheres a school of thought that says each present moment is so new and so unpredictable that you shouldnt bring any preconceived notions from the past to apply to itAny conditions you pick up from the past obscure the freshness of the present moment so your duty as a meditator is to be totally present in an unmediated way to the raw data of the sensesBy allowing yourself to be fully immersed in the raw data of the present moment youll instinctively know the proper responseThere are no rulesAll bets are off as to whats going to be the appropriate response to any particular moment any particular situationThat school of thought leaves you pretty high and dry when things get difficultIt throws you into the present moment with no lifesaver at allFortunately thats not how the Buddha taughtThe Buddha said that theres a regularity to the way things happenThats how he describes dependent coarising this regularity of the Dhamma He doesnt say that everything is predetermined from the past or that by knowing the past youll be able to predict whats going to happen in the present or on into the futureHe simply says that theres a regularity to the way things are shaped in your experience and certain things tend to be the shaping factorsIn one analysis of dependent coarising he describes these factors as name and form on the one hand and consciousness on the otherThese two influence each otherForm is the form of the bodyFor example youre sitting here right now with the form of the body your sense of the body how it feels from withinThat sense of form is made up of solidity warmth liquid sensations and energy the four elements or four propertiesAs for name it includes feeling perception attention intention and contactConsciousness he says lands on these factors of name and form and then things proliferate out of thatUnder the heading of name the two most important factors are intention and attentionOther ways of describing dependent coarising draw out this importanceSometimes prior to name and form they list fabrication sankhara which is the intentional element in experience  whether physical verbal or mentalPhysical or bodily fabrication is the breath the intentional element in how you sense the breath how you create the experience of the breathVerbal fabrication is directed thought and evaluation which includes an intentional elementMental fabrication is feeling and perceptionTheres an intentional element there as wellSo the intention is whats important and it plays itself out in feeling perception and formPrior to fabrication comes ignoranceIgnorance means not seeing things in terms of the four noble truths  in other words applying inappropriate attentionWhen you look at things in an inappropriate way you frame issues in an inappropriate way which means that your fabrications are going to lead to sufferingAll the other elements of name and form and consciousness will tend toward suffering and stress as wellBut you can change that way of attending to thingsYou can look at things in terms of the four noble truths Where is the stress what are you doing to cause it where is there freedom from stress and what kind of actions lead to that freedomWhen you look in these terms then the fabrications of your intentions go in a different direction name and form and consciousness all the other factors of your experience go in a different direction toward the end of sufferingThis is the regularity of the DhammaWe tend to think of dependent coarising as an extremely complex and abstruse teaching and as the Buddha pointed out it is complex its not easyStill it does give us guidance in how to approach each present moment where to look how to lookOne of the interesting things about dependent coarising is that all these factors come prior to sensory contactEven before you see sights listen to sounds and so forth theres an intentional element already in playYou have an agenda what youre looking for how youre going to look at thingsYou bring that to each present momentSo its important to bring the right way of framing issues framing questions to everything you senseRemember this as you practiceThese are the important elements intention and attentionEverything else springs from thereWhen things come up in the present moment how do you look at themTry to look at them simply in terms of stress and lack of stressWhich intentions and ways of attending to things lead to stress which ones bring it to an endTry to put aside any ideas of yourself or what lies outside of yourselfPut aside questions of what lies behind all of thisJust look at things as theyre directly experienced as stressThis is a mode of perception thats important to developThe Buddha calls this mode emptiness seeing whats present or whats not present  particularly present or not present in terms of stress or disturbanceThats where the big issue lies and your duties as a meditator come from looking at these things in this wayIf you see stress you try to comprehend itTo do that you need to develop certain qualities of mind Thats the pathYou need to put the mind in a position where it really can look at stress coming and going and not feel threatened by it especially when the stress is really painful really burdensomeOur normal reaction when we feel stress and strain is to say This is happening to me And when something bad happens to you theres a different set of imperativesThe imperative is to get rid of it to get it out of the range of what you identify as me But if you can pull out of that sense of me surrounding your experience and simply look at the stress happening right here right now  from a position of wellbeing the wellbeing that comes from right concentration  then the imperatives are differentThe imperative is to understand the stress to see whats causing it and then to abandon the causeThis is why we practice right concentration to put the mind in a good position to see things clearly and carry out its appropriate dutiesActually when the mind is in right concentration youre standing where the Buddha stood when he discovered all of these thingsIts from this point of view that you can see This is the intention this is the act of attention this is the stress this is the cause of stress You can see them clearly because youre looking at them from the right spotYears back I went on a camping trip to Powell Point which is the southern tip of a plateau in Utah over feet in elevationThe guidebook said that you could see a good third of southern Utah from that spotWe thought we were following the right directions but we made a wrong turn and ended up in an outlook over Henderson CanyonStill we thought we were at Powell PointThe book said the road would end and then from there you had to walk out on a pointWell we found a point that we could walk out toFrom there the book said you could look out and see this that and the other thingSo we identified the sights This was this that was that and this was the other thingBut then there was a huge plateau looming up to our east which wasnt mentioned in the book at allOnly after a good while did we realize that that was Powell PointWe had made a wrong turnWe were standing somewhere elseSo the next day we made our way up to Powell Point and then we saw what the guide book was actually referring toWe realized that the this that and the other thing were not the this that and the other thing we thought we saw yesterdayWe had labeled things wrong because we were standing in the wrong placeIf you want to understand what the Buddha is talking about you have to put yourself here right at the present moment where the mind is immersed in the form the breath energy of the bodyThats where the Buddha stoodIf theres going to be any directed thought and evaluation relate it to the breathAny feelings and perceptions will be the feelings and perceptions of a mind really focused on the breathAs the mind gets more and more still those fabrications fall awayDirected thoughts and evaluations fall awayThe movement of the breath falls awayAll you have is a still breath energy filling the body a clear bright awareness filling the bodyThats Powell PointFrom there you can see the Henry Mountains you can see the Escalante region you can see Bryce Canyon the way theyre described in the bookIn other words from this point you can see stress and youre in a position where you can really comprehend it because you dont feel so threatened by itYoure not compelled by your old imperative which was to get rid of itYou attend to things in the right wayYou see things simply in terms of stress its cause the path leading to its ending and its endingThis is the framework youre supposed to bring to each present momentIn other words you see things in terms of the four noble truths and your intention is to perform the duties appropriate to eachWhen you develop that intention its bound to lead you to the end of all suffering and stressSo this is the regularity of the DhammaYou may not be able to bring purely appropriate attention to every moment of your life but you can get used to looking at each moment in terms of identifying your intention and examining how you frame the events of your lifeDo the narratives get in the way of your seeing things in terms of skillful and unskillful intentionsOr do they actually helpYou should approach each situation with these thoughts in mind Where is the stress hereWhat can you do to at least minimize the stress the harm the disturbance whatever is a burden for you or the people around youThis way you come to each present moment armed with a knowledge of the regularity of the Dhamma where you should focus your attention and what the main priority should be  which is to keep on the pathIn this way the Buddha doesnt leave you high and dry for no matter what the situation this is how to look at it in terms of the four noble truthsYour intention should be to try to comprehend the suffering the stress wherever it may be in that moment and to develop the factors that will enable you to comprehend sufferingYou may have other issues  for example when youre dealing with people its very different from sitting here with your eyes closed  but your basic framework can be the sameOnce youve got this framework firmly in mind you can go wherever you want and deal with any situation that confronts you because youre working from a framework that instead of leading to more suffering and stress actually helps bring them to an endAnd that way whatever the situation youre on the pathThe ability to keep all this in mind is mindfulnessThat combined with appropriate attention and the right intention is what turns each moment into a moment of the practice regardless of the situationSo this is how the complexity of dependent coarising gives you tools for the present moment tools that you can use for the sake of your own wellbeing and the wellbeing of all the people around youEach moment may be new but it follows a patternAlways keep that pattern in mindAn essential aspect of Buddhist practice is that we have to learn how to make use of things well eventually have to learn how to let go ofWe know that at some point the practice involves letting go of desireBut we need to cultivate skillful desire to get to that pointUltimately the practice leads to the total end of fabrication but the noble eightfold path is a type of fabricationAs the Buddha once said its the ultimate level of fabricationIn fact when you look at the factors of the path you realize that theyre made up of the aggregates form feeling perception fabrication consciousnessThese all have to play a role in the path which means we have to learn how to change our attitude toward the aggregatesInstead of just clinging to them as us or ours we learn how to use them as elements in the pathThe important point here is to realize that these things have to be used in a skillful wayWhen you come to the path its useful to reflect on skills youve developed in the past  as an artist a cook a carpenter or a musicianWhatever skills youve worked on in the past its good to reflect on how you became skillful and particularly how you learned how to deal with mistakesLearning from your mistakes is essential to developing any kind of skillIts expected that youre going to make mistakesThe teacher tries to help you avoid the really unnecessary ones by pointing them out in advanceIn other words some mistakes are more avoidable than othersBut a large part of the practice lies in learning how to learn from your mistakes and not get knocked off course by themWe all like to hear that theres a stage in the practice when you finally attain a certain level of awareness a certain level of insight and its guaranteed that from that point on nothing you might do would be a mistakeYou may have heard about the choicelessness of the path You finally get on the path and realize that theres only one thing to doIf you just do what the path tells you to do or what seems right at any one time youre guaranteed that there will be no mistakesBut thats not the way it worksEven arahants make mistakesTheir virtues in terms of the basics of a virtuous life  the five precepts  are unshakeableThey dont make those mistakes any more but simple mistakes in saying the wrong thing to the wrong person Thats humanIt has nothing to do with defilements of the mindIts simply the fact that were human beings with limitationsWhats different about arahants is that they continue to learn from their mistakesThey dont get knocked off course by them because they have no conceit thats going to be challenged by the mistake destroyed by the mistake or feel threatened by the mistakeBut for those of us on the path thats an issue we still have to deal with this issue of conceit our narcissismWe dont like the thought of having to make mistakes but theres no other way were going to learnThis is why the Buddha gives so many instructions on how to learn from your mistakes how to deal with a mistake so that it actually becomes an important element in the pathThere are the instructions to Rahula When you realize youve done something thats been harmful you resolve not to repeat itYou also go talk it over with other people who are on the path to see what insight you can gain from themIn other words you admit the mistake you learn how to recognize it and that involves developing a certain amount of perceptiveness right thereAnd as for learning from the counsel of others We sometimes assume that the Buddhas instructions to the Kalamas tell you to go by your own sense of right and wrongBut in fact if you look carefully at his words you realize that this assumption has nothing to do with what the Buddha actually saidHe said that you cant go totally on the instructions of others but you cant go on your own preconceived ideas about whats right and wrong eitherYou have to look at what youre doing along with the results of what youre doing and what youve doneThen learn to recognize when youve caused harm and when you haventAt the same time you take into consideration the counsel of the wiseThat of course requires you to learn how to recognize whos wise and whos notSo in one way it does throw the whole issue back on you but its not that you have to totally reinvent the Dhamma wheel as you practiceThere is guidance and when you learn how to make the best use of guidance it gives you quite a leg upTheres another passage where a student of the Jains comes to the BuddhaThe Jains were teaching that whoever kills steals has illicit sex tells lies or takes intoxicants is going to go to hellThis person wanted to know what the Buddha had to say about that and the Buddha replied that if you hear that teaching and you realize youve done these things in the past that pretty much consigns you to hell right there it makes things hopelessThis is why the Buddha taught in a different wayHe taught that these activities are unwiseThey should be avoided because they cause harmYou look at what youve done and you realize youve made mistakes like thisSo whats the proper attitude to develop toward those mistakesIts to resolve not to do them againAt the same time you realize that if you let yourself get tied up in remorse about your past mistakes its not going to undo the old mistake and its going to make it less likely that youre going to do well in the future  because remorse saps your strengthThe proper attitude is to learn how to recognize a mistake and simply resolve Im not going to repeat itThe next step is to develop the sublime attitudes limitless goodwill limitless compassion limitless empathetic joy limitless equanimityLearn how to cultivate these emotions because they help keep you on the right track strengthen your resolve not to be harmful and also teach you where your limitations are what you can do what you cant do in terms of correcting the situation within yourself and the world around youAgain these attitudes too are fabricationsIts not that our nature is innately kind or innately badThese attitudes are things you have to learn how to cultivateTheyre fabricationsSo what happens when you come up against some ill will inside you some resentment or an inability to accept the situation as it isWhen you look at that emotion you realize its composed of all the different elements of fabricationTheres the way you breatheThere are the directed thoughts the way you direct your thinking around that topicTheres the way you evaluate whats happening and there are also your feelings and perceptions about whats happeningThese are all the elements of fabrication that go into any thought any emotionSo to begin with you want to learn how to take your unskillful emotions apartWhen you find yourself thinking in an unskillful way when an unskillful emotion comes up with regard either to yourself or somebody else ask yourself What kind of breathing is going on hereHow does the breathing affect that emotionWhat if I were to make the breath more skillful  making it smooth making it full making it restful Will that help get the body out of the grip of the emotionThen look at how youre thinking about the issueIs there some way you could change your thoughts about the issueLook at it from a different perspectiveA lot of the Buddhas teachings say on anger are just thatLook at the situation from another angleLook at the good in the people who make you angryAfter all you need their good as much as they doIf all you can see are the bad traits of other people its like being in a desert Youre hot tired trembling thirsty and the goodness of other people is like waterYoure not in some Olympian position where you can look down on the human race and say Well theyre bad and these people are bad and those people are bad and it doesnt affect you at allIt does affect you to be constantly focusing on other peoples bad habitsIts like that New Yorker cartoon of the two female poodles sitting at a bar with grim sneering looks on their faces saying Theyre all sons of bitches When everyone is a son of a bitch what does that make youSo try to think about the situation in a way that helps you realize that you need the water of their goodnessThis waters the goodness of your own heart this change in the element of perception along with directed thought and evaluationAs for the feelings that come up learn not to identify with themJust watch them Okay these feelings are results of actionsThey in and of themselves are not skillful or unskillful but the way you perceive them and the thoughts you build around them  those can be skillful and unskillful So learn how to step backIn this way you use your understanding of fabrication to deconstruct unskillful emotions unskillful mind states and then to develop skillful emotions and skillful mind states in their placeWe dont usually like the idea of constructing an emotion or fabricating an emotion It seems too artificialBut we do it all the timeIts simply that were not conscious of itSo as youre meditating what are you doingYoure working with the breathThats one form of fabricationTry to make the breath comfortableWhen theres a sense of tension anywhere in the body learn how to breathe around it or breathe through it to relieve as much of the tension as you can without totally losing focusYou direct your thoughts to the breathYou evaluate the breath What kind of breathing feels good right now This is an important part of the practice because it teaches you how to develop your powers of observation on a subtle levelYoure learning to recognize your actions and their resultsYoure learning how to read those actions read those resultsAnd if the results arent what you want you can think of ways of improving themThat all comes under evaluationThen there are feelingsYou try to work with the breath in such a way as to develop feelings of ease and fullnessThere are also perceptionsHow do you perceive your breathWhat mental picture do you have of the breathHow does that mental picture affect the way you actually breatheCan you think of the breath as an energy field in the body that your whole awareness of the body right now is all breath different levels of breath energyIf you apply that perception hold that label in mind and explore the way you feel the body from the inside what does it doYou can think of the body as a big sponge  lots of holes for the breath to come in and out from all directionsThe breath comes in and goes out without any sense of blockage no problem at allIf you perceived it that way what impact would it have on how you actually experience the breathIn other words you learn to take these aspects of fabrication and use them to your advantageAnd of course youre going to make mistakes but you can learn from them  by learning how to notice things on your own knowing how to seek advice from other people learning how to apply their advice in a skillful waySo on the one hand the Buddha gives you a lot of instructions on how to avoid mistakes but he also is very open to the fact that were still going to make mistakes on one level or anotherInstead of forbidding you from making mistakes he gives you advice When you make a mistake this is how you handle it this is how you learn from it so you can become more skillfulThis is how the process of fabrication can take you to the threshold where theres the unfabricatedYou develop your tools and as with any art youre not developing the tools because you want to take the tools with youSay for instance you have some paint brushesYoure not painting for the sake of paint brushes you use the paint brushes for the sake of the artAnd as you master the use of those paint brushes there comes a point where youve finished your artwork and you put the brushes asideIts the same with the path You work on developing these elements of the pathLearn how to notice when youve done it well and when you haventIn that way you develop your skillThis skill though is specialIt takes you to the threshold of the unfabricatedBut you cant use the unfabricated to get to the unfabricatedIt cant be used as a cause at all for it lies totally outside of the realm of causalityBut you can get there through causality through learning fabrication as you learn to fabricate states of mind more and more skillfullySo dont be afraid of mistakesTry to avoid them as much as you can but dont be afraid of the idea that there will be mistakes down the lineAs Ajaan Fuang once said No matter what happens in the meditation theres always a cure for it  if you develop the right attitude So the conceit that says I dont want to make any mistakes and simply wanting to will your way to a mistakefree life without doing anything That youve got to put asideThe narcissism of not wanting anyone to be able to criticize you That youve got to put asideAs the Buddha once said If someone points out your faults regard that person as someone whos pointed out treasureSo learn to live with the fact that yes we all make mistakesEven arahants make some mistakesBut a mistake is not the end of the worldIts a startIts a treasure in that its your opportunity to learnOne of the most important principles in meditating on the breath is learning how to experiment with itTry different kinds of breathing to see which rhythm which texture of breathing feels best for the body right now and which is also best for the mindSome ways of breathing can put you to sleep other ways of breathing get you irritated so you want to check and see what kind of breathing is going to make it easiest for the mind to settle down in a state of mindful alertness and want to stay thereIf the body is uncomfortable because of the way you breathe youre not taking advantage of the fact that the breath can make it comfortableI know a lot of people who are surprised by this aspect of Ajaan Lees instructions for breath meditationThey come to meditation with the idea that youre supposed to let things simply happen on their own and not do anything to them  that you just watch the breath however it comes in however it goes outBut even the Buddhas instructions on breath meditation frequently state that you train yourself to do things in a certain wayYou train yourself to be aware of the whole body as you breathe in aware of the whole body as you breath outYou train yourself so that the breath calms down giving rise to the next steps where you can train yourself to breathe in with a sense of ease with a sense of raptureAnd then you can calm those feelingsTheres an element of will in all this an element of fabrication in which you intentionally cause things to happenThats important for not only getting the mind to settle down with a sense of ease but also for developing insight  because insight comes down to a matter of seeing cause and effectI think it was Aristotle who defined intelligence as the ability to see connectionsWhen you do X Y happensWhen you do Z W happensThe ability to see that on your own is a sign of intelligence and that sort of intelligence can be developed by learning to look for causes and effectsThis is how you do it You change certain things and see where the change has an impactYou change other things and see where that has an impactIf changing X causes Y to change every time you know that X is a condition for YThis principle permeates all of the Buddhas teachingsEverything is checked by the results it givesWhen the Buddha was teaching his aunt the basic principles of the Dhamma it came down to this When you adopt a particular teaching what effect does it haveDoes it give rise to passionTo being fetteredTo accumulating to selfaggrandizement to discontent to entanglement to laziness to being burdensomeThen thats a wrong teachingDoes it give rise to the opposite qualities such as dispassion modesty and not being fetteredOkay thats a right teachingThats how you know whats Dhamma and whats notYou take all the Dhamma you hear and you test it in terms of cause and effectYou dont take anything for granted just because youve heard that its soSometimes we hear that the basic Buddhist insight is into the three characteristics  inconstancy stress notself  which doesnt seem to involve many connections between cause and effectBut here you have to remember two thingsOne the Buddha never talked about three characteristics The phrase three characteristics doesnt appear in his teachingsThat was something added later in the commentariesHe taught these three themes  inconstancy stress notself  as perceptions and contemplations as labels you apply to things and aspects you look for in your experience of thingsBut theres a larger context for looking for these things or learning to see things in light of themThe larger context is formed by the four noble truths the fact that there is suffering that theres a cause for suffering that suffering can cease and that theres a path of practice leading to its cessationThese truths in turn relate to a more basic issue that the whole purpose of the Buddhas teachings is for the sake of finding true happinessAnd he brings both the heart and the head together on this projectThe hearts basic desire is for happiness with the least amount of effort whereas the head is the part that recognizes that there are causes and effects and that if you want to get anywhere you have to learn this pattern and work within itIn following the Buddhas teachings these two sides of your awareness heart and head have to learn to work togetherThe heart has to learn respect for the fact that if you want true happiness its going to require some workYoull have to get the causes rightAt the same time the head has to recognize that true happiness is a worthwhile goalYou dont just think about things and analyze them just for the sake of spinning out ideas and showing youre smartYou want to understand cause and effect so that you can find true happinessAnd as the Buddha traces out the causes of suffering one of the big causes is clingingSo one way of learning how to let go of clinging is to see things in light of those three perceptions of inconstancy stress and notselfYou dont stop with just seeing things in terms of those perceptionsAt the same time you have to learn the right time and place to apply them when they actually serve the purpose of leading to a greater happinessAll the teachings have their time and placeYou have to see each teaching in the larger structure of this pursuit of happiness and try to apply it in an intelligent wayA large part of this means that you have to be heedfulYou cant just assume that anything that comes popping up in your mind or any idea that you have is going to lead to true happinessYou cant assume that any teaching you receive from anybody is going to lead to true happiness or that you can apply it willynilly to everything that comes upYou have to test things to learn when and how they workSo a central part of the Buddhas teaching consists of instructions in the best way to test thingsYou start out by getting the mind to be stillGet it into strong states of concentration where everything is very very still so that you can observe when a thought comes into the mind what it does to the mind or when you do an action what it does to the mindIf things arent really still you cant see the impact of a thought the impact of an action very clearlyIts like trying to listen to a very soft piece of music on the stereo at the same time that youve got a lawnmower outside or trucks driving up and down the roadThe background noise is so loud that it obscures the subtleties youre trying to hearThe same way with the mind Unless you can get the mind really really still you cant really watch the effects of your actions the effects of your words the effects of your thoughtsMany actions may seem perfectly harmless in an ordinary state of mind but when the mind gets really really still you begin to see that they actually have an adverse impact on the mindSo this is why we work at bringing the mind to concentrationThis is why the Buddha said that concentration should be developedHe didnt say States of concentration come and goYou just watch their coming and going and say Ah yes this is inconstant stressful notself Thats not the duty that the four noble truths assign to concentrationThe duty they assign is that when you encounter states of mindfulness you try to develop themWhen you encounter states of concentration you try to develop themMake them stronger because youre going to need them as toolsWhatever serves as a tool on the path you want to take care of itYou dont just let it goThe same with the breath You work with it you take care of it because its going to help you get the mind to settle downIts going to help give you a good solid foundationI know someone who went to study in Thailand after shed been doing the Ajaan Lee methodShe met a teacher who said What is this improving the breathYoure supposed to let it go and be on its ownAfter all its just a sankhara just a fabricationWhy try to improve it She reported to me what he had saidMy response was Go back and ask him Why bathe your bodyAfter all its just a sankhara just let it go Of course you cant do thatYouve got to look after the body because youre using it as a toolThe same with the breath You look after the breath tend to it because it helps the mind to settle down with a sense of ease and solidity that youre going to need for deeper insightsAt the same time as youre working with the breath you get insight into cause and effectBecause even when the mind settles down and you see things youve got to test themSometimes you hear the teaching that once the mind settles down you get in touch with your Buddha nature or your Inner Stillness and you can trust whatever your Buddha nature or Inner Stillness tells youThe Buddha never taught that wayEven stream enterers he said have got to be heedfulYou cant trust everything that comes out of the mindHe even said that arahants had to be heedful about their actionsEven totally enlightened beings cant totally assume that everything they see or hear is actually the way it isThey have to test itGo look in the VinayaA couple of the rules were actually formulated because some arahants made some mistakesFor instance theres the rule against monks eating storedup foodVenBelatthasisa who was an arahant figured Well I can just go for alms once a week take the leftover rice and dry itThats a nice frugal way of living and I dont have to go out for alms every dayJust eat the leftover rice from the days before The Buddha found out about it and took him to taskHe said This is not a wise course of action The story doesnt explain what the Buddhas reasoning was but if you look at the history of Buddhism you see that down the line in later centuries when monks stopped going for alms they created a rift in the Buddhist community at largeThe monks lived on their own they had their own kitchens with monastery attendants to fix their foodLay people basically stopped caring about the monksAnd as a result when the Muslims came into India and destroyed the monasteries the lay people didnt really careThe connection had been severedThe Buddha saw that far aheadSo even fully awakened arahants cant always assume that what they think is trueTheyve got to test it and check it just like everybody elseSo when insights arise in your meditation or when you gain an intuitive feel for something the question is not where the insight comes from but what happens when you apply itYou view it as a hypothesis in an experimentYoure developing an experimental intelligence hereYou take the passages you read in the texts and you experiment with themYou take the insights you receive from meditation and you experiment with themTheres a passage in the very first sutta in the Digha Nikaya listing all the different kinds of wrong views that people can develop and not every wrong view comes from people simply thinking things out without having practiced meditationA lot of wrong views come from people who meditate and gain some insights or intuitive knowledge but the knowledge isnt as complete as they thought it wasSo they jump to the wrong conclusionsWhat this means is that whether the source of your insight is something youve learned from the texts something youve thought out on your own an intuitive feeling you have or something that comes up in your meditation you always have to test it to see If I adopt this where does it goWhat does it connect withWhat are the connections here in terms of cause and effect Thats how you test to see in terms of the insights you gain which ones are fools gold and which ones are genuine goldYou put them to use and then see what happensAnd you always adopt the heedful attitude that says Im testing things hereI wont draw any firm conclusions until Ive seen what actually works in freeing the mind As the Buddha says just because you like a particular truth or it seems to fit in with your worldview thats no guarantee that its actually trueWeve all read the Kalama Sutta where the Buddha says not to take religious texts as being necessarily trueThats the part everybody seems to rememberThe other part though is that he also says not to take what you like as necessarily being trueDont take what seems to fit into your worldview as true dont take what seems to work out logically as necessarily being trueYouve got to test thingsWhen you adopt this or that idea this or that practice what happensCheck these things out not only against your own experience but also against the experience of wise peopleIn this way youre much more likely to find truths that really really are true because theyve stood up to the testOf course this means we have to be very careful in how we conduct our tests which again is why we work at developing concentration developing mindfulness all the mental attributes of patience endurance alertness honesty and discernmentThey put us in a position where we can test things and evaluate the results reliably so that were not overcome by bias and we can overcome the limitations of the worldviews and ideas we bring to the practiceAfter all the purpose of the practice is to see things weve never seen before to attain things weve never attained beforeThat means you have to learn how to overcome the limitations of your assumptionsAnd this is how you do it You adopt this experimental way of developing intelligence so that your hearts desire  a true happiness  will get fulfilled even if its not quite in the way you might have wanted itAfter all this does require workBut its a path of work and of effort that leads ultimately to a happiness that once youve attained it doesnt require any effort to maintainOnly through gaining intelligence in terms of cause and effect can you find the happiness that ultimately lies beyond cause and effectSo we work with the nittygritty of just learning to observe whats going on in the mind testing it learning to put away whatever assumptions dont pass the test  because only through working through the details like this do we ultimately break through to something much larger and more lastingAlmost any book on Buddhism will tell you that the three characteristics  the characteristic of inconstancy the characteristic of stress or suffering and the characteristic of notself  were one of the Buddhas most central teachingsThe strange thing though is that when you look in the Pali Canon the word for three characteristics tilakkhana doesnt appearIf you do a search on any computerized version of the Canon and type in say the characteristic of inconstancy aniccalakkhana it comes up with nothingThe words not in the Pali Canon at allThe same with dukkhalakkhana and anattalakkhana Those compounds dont appearThis is not to say that the concepts of anicca dukkha and anatta dont occur in the Canon just that theyre not termed characteristicsTheyre not compounded with the word characteristic The words they are compounded with are perception sañña  as in the perception of inconstancy the perception of stress and the perception of notself  and the word anupassana which means to contemplate or to keep track of something as it occursFor instance aniccanupassana to contemplate inconstancy means to look for inconstancy wherever it happensNow its true that youll frequently find in the Canon the statements that all things compounded or fabricated are inconstant that theyre all stressfulAnd all dhammas  all objects of the mind  are notselfSo if thats the way things are why not just say that these are characteristic features of these thingsWhy make a big deal about the languageBecause words are like fingers and you want to make sure they point in the right direction  especially when theyre laying blame the way these three perceptions doAnd in our practice the direction they point to is important for a number of reasonsOne is that the Buddhas concern is not with trying to give an analysis of the ultimate nature of things outsideHes more interested in seeing how the behavior of things affects our search for happinessAs he once said all he taught was suffering and the end of sufferingThe suffering is essentially an issue of the minds searching for happiness in the wrong places in the wrong wayWe look for a constant happiness in things that are inconstantWe look for happiness in things that are stressful and we look for our happiness in things that are notself that lie beyond our controlThe three perceptions of inconstancy stress and notself are focused on our psychology on how we can recognize when were looking for happiness in the wrong way so that we can learn to look for happiness in the right places in the right waysThe contemplation of these three themes the use of these three perceptions is aimed at finding happiness of a true and lasting sortSo its good to keep reminding ourselves of this point because our prime focus in the meditation should always be on the mindWere not trying to analyze things outside in and of themselvesWere trying to see how the minds quest for happiness relates to the way things behaveYou always want to keep your focus here on the minds quest even when you focus on the breathWhen the breath gets more and more refined with a sense of ease filling the body you reach a stage where the mind and the breath seem to become unified and oneThe mind and its functions become more and more prominent in the meditation and the breath  as it grows more and more subtle  fades into the backgroundThis is just as it should be because the mind is the culprit the breath isnt the culpritThings that are inconstant stressful and notself Theyre not to blameThe problem is the way the mind looks to these things for happinessEven when it looks for happiness in a relatively wise way these issues are relevantAs the Buddha said the beginning of wisdom is when you go to people whove found true happiness and you ask them What should I do that will lead to my longterm welfare and happiness Notice that MyLongtermWelfare and happinessThose three categories are directly related to the three perceptionsThe my is related to notself longterm is related to inconstancy welfareandhappiness is related to stressThe three perceptions act as ways of testing any happiness you find to see if it measures up to the standards youve setBut they follow on the whatshouldIdo That has to come firstIn other words as we look for happiness we focus first on actions that dont constitute ultimate happiness but can be used as the path things like mindfulness persistence and concentrationAt that stage the Buddha doesnt have us focus too much on these three characteristicsHe has us focus primarily on the doingAs part of the doing we hold on to other perceptions the perception of breath say or the perception of whatever our meditation object isWe make that prominentAnd we try to push that perception into a state of solid concentration  which means that were pushing it in the direction of making it constant and easeful and getting it under our controlIn this way were actually fighting the three characteristics as we try to bring the mind into concentrationWe push to see how far we can find a happiness based on conditioned thingsOne reason for this is that if you dont push at a truth until it pushes back you wont know how strong it isAnother reason is that were going to need that conditioned happiness that sense of relatively solid wellbeing to put ourselves in a position where we can look at things very carefully as they come to beThat phrase as they come to be comes into play when were no longer pushingBut weve got to push firstSo you keep working on your concentration in all your activities trying to keep the mind as constantly still as possible no matter what the outside conditions may beYou create the conditions for stillness inside a sense of ease inside and try to maintain that stillness and ease in the face of all sorts of conditions around youYou learn to gain more skill more controlAt this stage in the game the issues of inconstancy stress and notself apply primarily to the things that would distract you from your concentrationYou try to see that no matter how attractive or alluring or interesting other topics might be they dont measure up to concentration as a source for happinessTheyre less constant more stressful less under your controlSo you drop them in favor of the bliss of concentrationYou keep this up gaining these insights until youve fully mastered concentration  which as the Buddha once said happens well after your first taste of the deathlessThis means that theres going to be a long period in which youre essentially working against the three characteristics at least as far as your concentration is concernedYoull use these three perceptions to analyze say any object of lust anger jealousy or fear that would pull you out of concentrationThese perceptions are relevant because theyre ways of reminding yourself that you cant find true happiness in those objectsFor the meantime thats how you use the contemplation of these themesAnd again the focus is not so much on trying to get to the ultimate nature of these outside objects as it is on using the perception as an antidote for a tendency of the mindAfter all these perceptions are not intended to be a statement of the ultimate nature of things out there  for when you think about it the ultimate nature of things out there is really not all that relevant an issueWe dont hang on to things because we think that they have an inherent nature that they inherently exist or dont existWe hang on to them because we think theyre going to provide happiness thats worth whatever effort they involveWhat the Buddha is pointing out is that they really dont provide that happinessThe happiness they do provide doesnt really measure upIts not worth the costSo you apply these three contemplations to things outside of your concentration and then watch to see where the mind resistsIn other words what does it refuse to see as inconstant stressful and notselfWhen you can catch the mind resisting in this way youve gained an insight into its attachmentsYouve found a spot where you need to dig down and question its resistanceWhat deluded fantasy is the mind trying to protect hereWhat attitude is it trying to hide from your scrutinyIn this way the three contemplations keep coming back to the mind as they highlight your attachments and tell you where you still have work to doYou can also apply these three contemplations to the first stages of concentration when you want to go to deeper stagesWhen the mind is settled and quiet on a beginning level is it as quiet as it could beOr is there still some inconstancy thereIf you see that any of the factors of your concentration are stressful or inconstant you drop them and that will take you to deeper stages of concentrationUltimately as your attachments to things outside of the concentration drop away you turn your attention more to applying these three perceptions to contemplating the concentration itselfAs this contemplation gets more refined you see that even the most stable level of concentration you can attain  the one that has formed your highest experience of pleasure and ease  is composed of five aggregates on a very subtle level and even on this subtle level their behavior displays these three features all the timeYou apply the three perceptions to them to pry away even your attachment to concentrationThats when you incline the mind to the deathless  and as the texts say that inclination can take you in either of two directionsOne is to nonreturning where you delight in your taste of nibbana as a dhamma as an object of the mindThe other is full arahantship when you go beyond even that kind of delightIts precisely at this fork in the road where the analysis of sabbe dhamma anatta  all dhammas are notself  applies where you might see nibbana as a dhamma as an object of the mindAs long as you perceive it in that way theres going to be attachment theres going to be a dhamma to hold on toSo you have to learn how to overcome that attachment by applying the perception of notself to the dhamma of the deathlessThen the texts say you let go of all dhammas which allows you to see nibbana in another way  not as a dhamma but as the abandoning of all dhammasThats the ultimateAnd at that point these three perceptions lose their functionTheyve done their work so you can put them asideAfter all theyre conditioned phenomenaWhen youve put all dhammas aside you put them aside tooArahants can continue using these perceptions as a pleasant abiding for the mind to remind them of why theyve got the ultimate happiness but these perceptions are no longer needed in the task of bringing about releaseSo remember Were not here to arrive at the true nature of things in and of themselves aside from seeing how their behavior makes them inadequate as sources for true happinessThe emphasis always points back to using the perceptions to counteract unskillful tendencies in the mind because the issues of the mind are paramountAjaan Fuang once had a student in Singapore who wrote him a letter describing how his meditation had reached the point where it was concerned solely with seeing the three characteristics in everything he encounteredAjaan Fuang had me write in reply Dont focus on things outsideKeep looking back at the mind to see what it is that keeps complaining that theyre stressful inconstant and not self  because the fault lies not with the things The fault lies with the mind thats looking for happiness in the wrong placeSo thats where your attention should always be focused on the machinations of the mindUse whatever perceptions and means of contemplation that can cut through the minds unskillful habits and apply them in a way that leads to the goal of the teachings an unconditioned happiness where you can put all perceptions skillful and unskillful asideWe all practice for the sake of happiness for a happiness that goes deeper than ordinary pleasuresBut in coming to the practice we often bring assumptions about happiness  how it works why were unhappy what we can do to be happier  assumptions that were hardly even aware are assumptions because we assume them so stronglyWe just take it for granted that theyre trueAnd sometimes they get in the wayTwo of the most common assumptions are ones that get most in the wayThe first is that were unhappy because we cant accept the way things are that the purpose of the practice is to learn more acceptanceIn other words were essentially neurotic as in that old distinction between neurosis and psychosis The psychotic person thinks that two plus two equals fiveThe neurotic person knows that two plus two equals four but hates them for itOur problem is that we simply cant accept the way things areIf we could only learn how to accept that two plus two does equal four and its perfectly fine then wed be happyAnd so in that model the purpose of the practice is to learn acceptanceBut even Freud recognized that getting people past their neuroses would not solve the problem of happinessAs he said it would simply lead them to the level of ordinary everyday miseryAnd yet part of the common theory says well you have to learn how to accept that because thats just the way things areAnother model is that were unhappy because we have a sense of separatenessInside were dividedOutside were separate from other people were separate from natureAll we need to learn is how to develop a sense of oneness a sense of interconnectedness and then well be happyBut thats not how the Buddha saw interconnectednessHe saw that the way things are interconnected in terms of cause and effect is actually a cause for sufferingAnd even a sense of oneness he says is inconstantIt contains a subtle sense of stressIf you cling to it youre going to sufferTheres a passage in the Canon where he describes the highest form of oneness which is the oneness or nonduality of consciousness in which you have a sense of consciousness as a totality containing everythingYet even that he says is inconstant stressful and notselfWhat these two ideas about happiness have in common is that the way things are out there is already a given and were simply on the receiving end of whats given so we have to learn how to develop the proper attitude to whats already there Accept and try to find oneness within the way things areBut the Buddhas take on things is differentReality is only partly a givenWe are also shapers of our realityWe have an active role in shaping every present moment that we experienceNow the present moment is not entirely plastic entirely responsive to everything we want out of itSome of it is formed by influences coming in from the past but part of it comes from our intentions in the present momentIn this way we are both producers and consumersWe produce our suffering and then we consume our sufferingWe produce our pleasures and we consume our pleasuresUnderstanding this point helps to open the road to a deeper happiness because there is a happiness the Buddha said that is not produced and not consumedIt just simply isBut the way we keep feeding on the happiness we produce gets in the waySo for him the purpose of the meditation is not to celebrate oneness or to celebrate acceptanceIts to develop two very different kinds of emotions disenchantment and dispassionThe Pali word for disenchantment nibbida also means distaste disgust or revulsion which may sound strong but it needs to be strongIts an antidote to our strong attachment to feeding on thingsThat attachment the Buddha said is the essence of sufferingThe word upadana which means clinging also means the act of eating of taking sustenanceHe says that upadana lies at the essence of suffering and stressSo what we need to learn is how to look at the things we feed on until we develop a strong sense that we dont want to feed on them any moreNow to get to that point the Buddha does have us develop a certain amount of acceptance and a certain sense of onenessThis is what the practice of concentration is all aboutYou start by focusing on one object like the breath and then you stay with it long enough that you start developing a sense of oneness with itYour awareness of the breath and the breath itself seem to become one and the same thingTheres a sense of unification  ekodibhava  which the Buddha has us develop as much as possibleAnd he has us take that sense of oneness as far as it can go through the levels of concentrationWhyBecause he wants us to feed on that and then to start comparing this food with the other things weve been feeding on to see that this is a much more refined pleasure a more satisfying form of nourishmentThe pleasure it gives is blameless the pleasure that comes from just focusing your mindThe pleasures we get from things outside contain a certain amount of blame in that our taking pleasure means that other people other animals have to work have to suffer in one way or anotherAn example is physical foodAs we eat physical food we gain pleasure but to get that food to our plate or into our bowls requires a lot of work and sacrificeSo as the Buddha said thats a pleasure that contains some blameOr in Ajaan Lees terms it contains some kammic debtsWhereas the pleasure that comes simply from learning how to focus on your breath is not placing a burden on anyone so its a type of food for the mind thats really worth developingAs you develop a sense of oneness with the food of concentration you look at the other ways the mind has been feeding on things for its emotional pleasures and you realize that theyre pretty miserableThe image the Buddha gives in the Canon is of a blind person who has been given a soiled oily rag by someone who says LookThis is a nice clean white piece of cloth The blind person takes the oily rag and gets very possessive of it thinking that its a nice clean white piece of clothBut when a doctor eventually cures the blind person of his blindness and he can start seeing the first thing he looks at is his clothHe realizes that its not nice clean and whiteIts a dirty and oily ragHe says Wow I was really fooled by that guyIn the same way the Buddha says that once you attain the first taste of Awakening you look back on your old pleasures and realize how youve been fooled by the mind  that in finding your pleasure what youve been feeding on is just forms and feelings and perceptions and thought constructs and consciousness  which when you really look at them very carefully are not worth feeding on at allTheres a story they tell about the American occupation of Japan after World War There were some cooks in Japanese restaurants who were really upset by the fact that they had lost the war and now they had to prepare food for the occupiersSo to get some revenge they would take human excrement and prepare it with all kinds of wasabi or whatever to mask the taste and then serve it to their American customersThey would feed the occupiers shit basically and the occupiers didnt knowSo the cooks got their perverse pleasure that wayIf you look at what youve been taking as food for the mind you realize that its just the same sort of thing that all the pleasure was in the preparationThis is why we have the contemplation of the parts of the body the analysis of things in terms of the aggregates in terms of the sense media in terms of the properties so we can realize that the food of lust or possessiveness weve been feeding on with regard to the body is really not based on muchIt doesnt give us any real sustenance and the pleasure we get out of it is certainly not worth all the effort that goes into dressing it upThe purpose of this contemplation is to gain that sense of nibbida  disenchantment or revulsion  with the food weve been consuming so that we wont want to eat it anymoreWhen you decide you dont want to eat it you turn around and look at the fact that youve been preparing this food all along and you realize you dont want to prepare it any longer Thats dispassionYouve had a passion for creating this food out of form feeling whateverThats why it was there as foodBut once you gain a sense of dispassion for it you stop creating itAnd when you stop creating it its no longer thereThats when you experience cessationThe mind is no longer entangled either in the process of production or in the process of consumptionThats when its freedIt opens to the happiness thats there when youre not so wound up or enthralled in production and consumption of all these miserable forms of foodSo the Buddhas take on true happiness is very different from a lot of the assumptions we tend to bring to the practiceIts important to keep this fact in mindWere not totally on the receiving end of thingsWere producers and consumers at the same timeAnd the producing and consuming of our ordinary pleasures  or even some of our more refined pleasures  is whats getting in the way of realizing a happiness that goes beyond all this thats not dependent on being connected or unconnectedIts not dependent on accepting or not acceptingIts just thereBut to find it we have to develop a sense of disconnect with our old enthrallmentsAnd we have to decide not to accept the way things have beenIn this way the Buddha has a very different approach to how and where to find true happinessBut the happiness that comes is a lot truer than anything that can come from simply learning how to accept things or learning how to become one with themSo try to keep this point in mind  that youre both a producer and a consumer  and take a good hard look at what youve been producing and how youve been consuming itLook at all the effort that goes into producing happiness out of this body we have out of feelings and perceptions and thought constructs and consciousnessStart asking yourself Is it really worth all the effortMaybe theres something betterMaybe its time to grow upWhen you can develop that sense of disenchantment and dispassion it leads to cessationThen you realize that cessation is not a scary thingIts not like extinctionIts more like learning how to outgrow some old bad habits your old addictions your old intoxications and finding that theres something a lot better there when you put your old feeding habits asideTry to keep track of the breathDont think about the fact that youre going to be here for a whole hourJust think about this breath and then this breath each breath one breath at a timeThink about it and watch it see what it doesWhat do you notice when it comes in what do you notice when it goes outWhat way of coming in feels best for the body what way of letting it go out feels best for the bodyThe breath is called the fabricator of the body or bodily fabrication  kayasankhara  both because the way you breathe has a huge impact on the way you experience your body and because theres an intentional element in the breathIts one of the few bodily processes that can be either voluntary or involuntarySo make the most of the fact that you can exert some voluntary control over itYou can choose when to breathe in you can choose when to breathe outThen its a matter of learning the best reasons for choosing to breathe in or breathe out in any particular wayCan you sense how the body tells you that nows a good time for an inbreath nows a good time for an outbreathIt has its signals you knowThere are certain feelings in the body that you can learn to recognize over time and you can explore how best to respond to themTake their cue in such a way that it leads to a sense of fullnessFor example you can breathe in till the body feels full and then you dont squeeze it outAllow it to stay fullEven though the breath will go out you can still maintain some sense of fullnessWhen the next breath comes in add a little bit more fullnessThe same with the next and the nextIt builds up over timeSimply by approaching the breathing process in a particular way you can create a state of ease you can create a state of fullness  even a sense of fullness thats a bit too muchSometimes people can begin to feel that theyre going to drown in breath energyYou might want to temper that a little bitBut as long as the fullness feels refreshing and blissful stick with itThere was once a senior monk in Bangkok who was learning meditation from Ajaan LeeHe was well read and knew his Buddhist doctrineAfter a while of practicing concentration he complained to Ajaan Lee As we bring the mind to concentration like this arent we developing states of becoming and birth Bhava and jati are the words he usedYou may have noticed as we were chanting the Sutta on Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion just now The craving that leads to further becoming is the craving that leads to suffering as wellThe senior monk was reasoning from this point saying that we should be trying to abandon states of becoming and birth and yet here we are creating themAnd Ajaan Lee said PreciselyThats what were doingIf you want to understand becoming and birth you have to consciously create these statesCreate a state of wellbeing create a state of fullness get good at itThats when you understand the processBefore you take things apart you have to learn how to put them togetherAnd thats what were doing right now creating a state of becoming a state of wellbeing or wellbecomingWe do this both so that we can get good at creating it and so that in the course of creating it we can put the mind in a good spot where it can watch things more carefully more clearlyWhen the mind is comfortable in the present moment at ease in the present moment it can stay firmly in the present moment and watch processes transparently as they come as they goYou get a better sense of your raw materialsThe creating of a state of becoming in the mind like this is the kamma of your meditation right here right nowA lot of people believe that kamma is one of those teachings thats not particularly relevant to their meditation practiceBut essentially kamma is what the practice is all aboutAfter all kamma is what youre doing to create sufferingChanging your kamma is whats going to bring suffering to an endThe Buddha tends to avoid talking about metaphysical issues but kamma is the one big metaphysical issue he talks about a lotThe nature of action what action does when it gives its results the fact that action is real that it gives results both immediately and over time These are metaphysical issuesAnd the reason the Buddha focuses on these and not on other issues is because the nature of action is important for understanding why we suffer and how we can stop sufferingTheres the kamma that leads to suffering theres the kamma that leads to its endSo were here trying to understand what action is all about what action does and what it createsAnd our state of concentration is Exhibit A our primary example of action right hereWere creating a state of wellbeingYou cant let go of states of wellbeing until you learn how to make good onesAjaan Lees example when he was talking to that senior monk was of having a chicken that lays eggsSome of the eggs he said you can take apart and analyze some of the eggs you can eatIf you dont have anything to eat you dont have the strength to take things apart and analyze themWere feeding on the sense of ease that comes from the concentration because that gives us the strength to analyze thingsHow do you analyze thingsYou take things apart in terms of what youre fabricating and of the raw materials with which youre fabricating themFor example we all know the teaching that you create a sense of self out of any of the five aggregates all of which are activitiesWell you can watch yourself as you meditate Exactly how do you create a sense of me or mine around what youre doingOne thing you tend to see very quickly is the way your sense of self gets involved as you watch yourself doing the meditation well or poorlyWhen things arent going well you think youre a hopeless meditatorYou get all tied up in knotsWhen theyre going well you get complacent and think youre a great meditatorEither way you set yourself up for troubleBut when you realize that this is the process of Imaking and mymaking in action you learn to leave things at the level of the raw materialsYou dont have to make an I out of them just notice that there are feelings perceptions fabricationsAs you watch these things even more carefully you begin to realize that even these aggregates have an element of fabrication an element of intention in what you thought was their raw formAs the Buddha says we create form for the sake of formnessYour sense of the form of the body is something you fashion out of sensations so that you can breathe and moveYou can create formless states as wellThis is what you learn when you move from the fourth jhana into the four formless states the infinitude of space the infinitude of consciousness nothingness and neither perception nor nonperceptionYou realize that you do create a sense of form with regard to the body by the way you move the breath aroundWhen the breath is very very still that sense of form begins to disintegrate to dissolve away and you have the choice of not applying the perception of form to the bodyYou become sensitive to the space that permeates between the atoms of sensation making up your sense of the bodyAll the places where you feel space in the body begin to connect and then they connect with the space outsideIts as if you have a mist of atoms hereIn order to breathe you applied perceptions  ie mental labels  to that mass of mist you had an image of the form of the body that allowed you to make it moveBut when you dont have to move the body around  you dont even have to move the breath around  everything grows very still and you can drop that sense of form if you want toYou can choose instead to focus on the perception of space permeating the mistThats when you experience the infinitude of that space  and at that point you begin to realize that even the perception of form or the experience of form contains an element of intentionYou then begin to see this process in relation to the formless realms as well When you drop the perception of space youre left with a perception of knowing Thats how you move from a sense of the infinitude of space to the infinitude of consciousnessThese experiences can be willed and the fact that theyre so subtle allows the willing to be transparentWhat youre doing is to take your experience apart layer by layer seeing where the different levels of intention get involved and learning how to drop themAs you progressively do away with these layers of intention you get down to what the Buddha calls knowledge of things as they have come to beAs he said only when he had gained knowledge of things as they have come to be  in terms of the four noble truths and the three levels of knowledge about each truth  did he claim full AwakeningThats the kind of knowledge were working our way down toAnd the only way you can get down to that level of unintended unshaped unfabricated experience getting down to the absolutely rawest of the raw materials of the present moment is first by consciously putting them together into somethingOtherwise you miss a lot of subtletiesSometimes you hear people say Try to sit with things simply as they are right from the very beginning of the meditation and you can get into a state of equanimity or pure mindfulnessAnd then you realize that that equanimity is unfabricatedEquanimity and mindfulness Thats it thats the unfabricated But thats not the case at allEquanimity and mindfulness when theyre pure constitute the fourth jhana not the unfabricatedTheres an element of fabrication in mindfulness theres even an element of fabrication in equanimityBut unless you learn consciously how to fabricate mindfulness and equanimity for long periods of time and then how to observe them you wont notice thisThis is why you have to build up these states of concentration before you can start taking them apartTheres a sutta where the Buddha talks about the issue of thirsting for becoming thirsting for nonbecoming and seeing things as they have come to beHe starts out with two extremes There are people who just love becoming this becoming that creating states of being as much as they can and there are other people who want to destroy states of beingTheyve gotten sick of what theyve done in terms of creating their world and their experiences and they just want to destroy the whole thingThe Buddha says that neither extreme is properIn creating things you just create more sufferingThat point is obviousBut in destroying these things you create a different kind of state of becoming the process of searching for nonbecomingThat he says simply leads to more becomingYou take on the identity of the destroyer the annihilatorThe trick is to see simply what has come to be ie to see the raw materials youve been shaping into the present simply as that  as raw materials  and then learn to develop dispassion for themIts as if youve been building houses with what you thought were bricksBut if you look carefully at the bricks you realize that theyre actually frozen meatOf course any house built out of frozen meat as it gets exposed to the heat is going to turn into a big pile of rotting fleshWhen you realize that you develop dispassion for the activity of building houses you develop dispassion for the raw materialsThats when you let goYou dont have to destroy the housesThey disintegrate on their ownThe issue here is learning to see the raw materials simply as they are as something thats come into being through your past kammaAnd no matter how skillful you are at building an elaborate house with lots of gingerbread and balconies and whatever its still frozen meat and its going to thawSo when you develop dispassion for whats come to be you find true freedomYou stop this process of fabricating building creating states of beingYou dont have to destroy the states of beingSimply the fact that youve stopped creating them stopped clinging to them lets them fall away on their ownAnd your dispassion means that you wont replace them with new onesIts a subtle skill which means that you cant go straight to the letting goFirst youve got to learn how to build properlyOnly then can you see the subtleties of the intentions in the mind and at the same time get a felt sense for your raw materialsOtherwise you hold to the intention of being equanimous and think that thats itOr to the intention of being totally passive nonreactive and think that thats it  without seeing that that too is an intention that too has an element of will that keeps it goingSo try to be as skillful as you can in staying with the breath in creating a sense of wellbeing through the breathing because it teaches you a lot of important lessons about the element of kamma the element of will and fabrication that goes into the present momentIt teaches you about the raw materials and the many levels of intention there within themYou take these raw materials and turn them into a transparent state that allows you to watch these processes in action so that someday you too can reach that point where after putting things together you can take them apart see things simply as they come into being develop dispassion for them and drop themThat way you can test for yourself When the Buddha said that there is an unfabricated is what he said really trueIt may seem like were going in the opposite direction as we fabricate concentration here but the only way youre going to see whats unfabricated is if youre totally sensitive to every level of fabrication possibleSo although were creating a state of becoming here with the breath  a state of wellbeing a state of rapture ease unification of mind  as Ajaan Lee says youre going to need to eat some of these eggsYou cant take them all apart you cant destroy all of themYouve got to eat some of them in order to keep goingSo feed yourself wellIts good to come back to a place like this where you can hear the crickets chirping in the evening the sound of the doves in the late afternoonTheres something in the body and the mind that responds to being out in nature like thisThe mind gets the chance to settle down to put aside a lot of its caresAnd for those of you whove been living in the city cut off from nature theres often the thought that if only you could get back to nature and stay there that would solve all your problemsBut go ask people who live in nature all the time and they can tell you a long list of problems they still suffer from living out in natureThink about human history as a wholeThe times when people get really romantic about nature are the times when they dont have to live in itThe idea of romanticizing wilderness didnt come into force in America until the frontier had been closed and nature had been tamed to some extent  to the extent that human beings can tame natureIts important to keep this in mind as we practiceComing out here doesnt solve all your problemsWhat it does is that it gives you a place to practice so you can look deeper into where the real problems areWhen the Buddha talked about how conditions cause suffering he wasnt talking just about your social conditioningHe was talking about conditions of natureThat chant we had just now  the world is swept away  doesnt refer just to the human social world or your psychological worldIt also refers to the world as a wholeEverything in nature is marked with inconstancy stress things that lie beyond your controlThis applies not only to human beings but also to animals of every kindYou sometimes hear people romanticizing the mental life of animals that they dont suffer because they dont have a sense of selfThats not the caseAnimals often suffer more than we doThey live in constant fear with no real understanding of whats going on around themAll they know is that theyre hungry all the time yet the need to go out and search for food forces them to place themselves in dangerAnd you can read the writings of the forest monks They certainly dont romanticize natureEven Ajaan Lee when he talks about the advantages of living in the forest and the lessons you learn there doesnt talk about how nice it is to get back and be one with natureHis focus is more on how nature is a dangerous place where you have to learn to be heedful all the timeWe dont suffer only because of our social conditioningWe suffer because we live in a world of intereating where beings are constantly feeding on one anotherWe have this inner desire this inner need to survive to feedTo create to keep these worlds that they call bhava  our emotional worlds our mental worlds and the physical world we live in  to keep our experience of these worlds going to survive requires that we feed on one another emotionally mentally physicallyAnd theres suffering not only in being eaten but also in having to eatSo the conditions the Buddhas talking about are not just social conditionsWe dont suffer only because were neurotic about our cravingsCraving in itself is a cause of sufferingIts also the cause of continued being and becomingThis is how nature keeps going Animals cravePeople craveThis is how we keep going this is how we survive this is how we die how we get rebornSo the ways of nature are not an ideal to which were trying to returnThey exemplify the problem which is that as long as you have to feed theres going to be sufferingAs long as your happiness depends on conditions of any kind theres going to be suffering and stressThe advantage of coming to a place like this is that you get to look deep inside the mind to see where the wellsprings of these cravings come from this process of fabrication that lies deep within the mindAs we meditate were trying to study fabrication as we experience itThis is the conditioning process in the mind and in the bodyThe basic fabrication in terms of the body is the breathAnd as for the mind there are two types of fabrication verbal and mentalVerbal fabrication is directed thought and evaluationThese are the processes with which you put sentences together in the mindYou focus on a topic and then you make comments about itThat conditions the mindThen theres purely mental fabrication which is feeling and perception perception here meaning the labels you apply to things while feeling means the different feelingtones of pleasure pain and neither pleasure nor painNormally the way we put these things together causes stress and sufferingIf you do this with ignorance you sufferIf you can learn how to do it with knowledge you can turn these processes of fabrication into the pathThis doesnt mean that when youre on the path you dont sufferIts simply a different type of sufferingIts a suffering that leads to the end of suffering the kamma that leads to the end of kammaTheres still going to be a subtle level of suffering in the breath even when youre concentrated on itThe breath can get very subtle and very pleasant even rapturous but theres still an element of stress thereBut for the time being youre going to use that as a pathIn fact you put all three types of fabrication together to get the mind into concentrationYou think about the breath  thats directed thought  and you evaluate the breathYou explore to see which ways of perceiving the breath help in the process of making it feel more comfortable so youve got perception and feeling there as wellIn this way youre taking the process of fabrication and turning it into a path to the end of fabricationAs you do this you begin to see how much your intentions really do shape these thingsThe Buddhas picture of your experience is not that youre simply a passive observer of things commenting on themIn other words its not like watching a TV showThe TV show is a given and you simply like it or dislike it or youre neutral about itThats allBut thats not the Buddhas picture of experienceHe says that youre actively engaged in shaping your experience all the timeIn fact the extent to which your intentions are shaping your experience goes a lot deeper and is a lot more radical than you might imagineThis is one of the insights of Awakening how much your present intentions are needed for you to experience even the present momentAs the Buddha points out all of the aggregates  form feeling perception fabrication and consciousness  have an element of intention in themThere are lots of different potentials from your past kamma that you can focus on in any given momentYour choice of what to focus on is going to determine what you experienceFor instance there are potentials for different kinds of feelingsThere are places in the body that if you focused on them could get you really tied up in anguish or painYou could take the germs of a pain and build them into something really overwhelmingThere are other places in the body where theres a potential for pleasureIf you learn how to focus there you can develop a strong sense of refreshment rapture wellbeingThen you can let that pleasure and refreshment permeate and fill the body in the same way that the cool water in a spring coming from the bottom of a lake can fill the whole lake with its coolnessSo you have the choice of what youre going to focus on now  which sensations in the body help create a sense of wellbeing which ones could create a sense of disease what youre going to think about what youre going to focus onThose are choices you make all the timeYou take these potentials and turn them into an actual experienceWhen you realize how you do this you can learn how to make your choices more skillfullyThis is the advantage of coming out into a relatively natural place like thisIts not totally naturalIf we turned off the water the avocado trees would die and the chaparral would take overThere wouldnt be any shade during the daySo even here in the orchard its not totally naturalBut at least theres enough peace and quiet for you to look into the mind and see that the source of trouble is not your social conditioning as much as its just the plain old fact of conditioning or fabrication  this process of becoming which is fed by cravingWhen you hear those crickets cricketing out there theyre not doing it in total pleasure and joyTheyre hungryWhen you watch the animals around in the orchard you see that theyre hungryThey have to be wary as they venture out for foodAs a meditator you have to be wary as wellEven when you create good states of concentration thats still a type of becomingIt still depends on causes and conditionsAt least it puts the mind in a position where it can observe the process of becoming and dig deeper to watch the conditioning to see how it happens  and ultimately to dig down to an area where theres no conditioning any more which is something that stands outside of nature as we know itIts not the case that the conditioned comes from the unconditionedThe way the Buddha explained causality is that causes and effects influence each otherAn effect turns around and has an influence on its causeSo theres no prime mover or first cause or ground of being in the Buddhas teachings at all for every cause can get shaped by its effectsAnd if anybody had been qualified to talk about Buddha nature the Buddha would have been the oneBut he never talked about Buddha nature at all never said that Buddha nature was the ground of beingHe simply noted that there are causes and conditions that affect one anotherSo if something is going to be unconditioned it has to lie outside of the causal process entirely  something thats already there but as long as youre entangled in fabrication youre not going to see itThe only way you can see it is if you turn the fabrication in the direction of the path so that the way you breathe the way you think and the way you feel and perceive things is conditioned not by ignorance but by knowledge by awareness  in particular awareness of which activities cause stress and which activities dontThat kind of awareness you develop graduallyIts a skill you work on as you get more and more sensitive both to the process of fabrication and to the stress that it causes even at very subtle levelsUltimately you bring the mind to the point where you realize that no matter which direction you fabricate which direction you intend theres going to be stressIf your discernment is sharp you drop all intention at that pointThats when the mind opens up to this other dimension which is totally separateSo its not the case that were returning to a place weve come fromAfter all as the Buddha points out even little babies have their greed anger and delusionIts just that their faculties and bodies arent strong enough to act on those defilements very powerfullyBut they suffer powerfully You can see that very clearlyAs soon as a child comes out of the womb it criesA lot of the childs early life is spent in crying because it has all sorts of desires and yet cant fulfill themIt has all sorts of pains but doesnt know what to do about themSo were not trying to return to that state or to a state of nature like an animalWere trying to find something that goes beyond nature as we know itAfter all if we were simply returning to a state where we were before whats to prevent us from coming back out of that state againIf we could forget our true wonderful nature was it really all that wonderful or trueAnd what would prevent us from forgetting it againSo instead of returning to something old we look at this process of fabrication thats going on all the time to see if we can learn something new about itLearn how to understand it learn how to take it apart use it as a pathLearn how once its taken you as far as it can take you you can let it goThat as the Buddha said allows us to see something weve never seen before to attain the as yet unattained to realize the as yet unrealizedIn other words were heading into totally new territoryKeep that in mind as you practiceYou can create wonderful luminous states in the mind but remember that those too are fabricatedNo matter what comes up in the practice always learn how to familiarize yourself with itAnd then learn to look for where theres still a level of inconstancy and stress in here  because that perception of stress and inconstancy will be your way outSit comfortably erect without leaning forward or backward left or rightClose your eyes and think thoughts of good willThoughts of good will go first to yourself because if you cant think good will for yourself  if you cant feel a sincere desire for your own happiness  theres no way you can truly wish for the happiness of othersSo just tell yourself May I find true happiness Remind yourself that true happiness is something that comes from within so this is not a selfish desireIn fact if you find and develop the resources for happiness within you youre able to radiate it out to other peopleIts a happiness that doesnt depend on taking anything away from anyone elseSo now spread good will to other peopleFirst people who are close to your heart  your family your parents your very close friends May they find true happiness as wellThen spread those thoughts out in ever widening circles people you know well people you dont know so well people you like people you know and are neutral about and even people you dont likeDont let there be any limitations on your good will for if there are there will be limitations on your mindNow spread thoughts of good will to people you dont even know  and not just people all living beings of all kinds in all directions east west north south above and below out to infinityMay they find true happiness tooThen bring your thoughts back to the presentIf you want true happiness you have to find it in the present for the past is gone and the future is an uncertaintySo you have to dig down into the presentWhat do you have right hereYouve got the body sitting here and breathingAnd youve got the mind thinking and awareSo bring all these things togetherThink about the breath and then be aware of the breath as it comes in and goes outKeeping your thoughts directed to the breath thats mindfulnessBeing aware of the breath as it comes in and out thats alertnessKeep those two aspects of the mind togetherIf you want you can use a meditation word to strengthen your mindfulnessTry Buddho which means awake Think bud with the inbreath dho with the outTry to breathe as comfortably as possibleA very concrete way of learning how to provide for your own happiness in the immediate present  and at the same time strengthening your alertness  is to let yourself breathe in a way thats comfortableExperiment to see what kind of breathing feels best for the body right nowIt might be long breathing short breathing in long out short or in short out longHeavy or light fast or slow shallow or deepOnce you find a rhythm that feels comfortable stay with it for a whileLearn to savor the sensation of the breathingGenerally speaking the smoother the texture of the breath the betterThink of the breath not simply as the air coming in and out of the lungs but as the entire energy flow that courses through the body with each inandout breathBe sensitive to the texture of that energy flowYou may find that the body changes after a whileOne rhythm or texture may feel right for a while and then something else will feel more comfortableLearn how to listen and respond to what the body is telling you right nowWhat kind of breath energy does it needHow can you best provide for that needIf you feel tired try to breathe in a way that energizes the bodyIf you feel tense try to breathe in a way thats relaxingIf your mind wanders off gently bring it right backIf it wanders off ten times a hundred times bring it back ten times a hundred timesDont give inThis quality is called ardencyIn other words as soon as you realize that the mind has slipped away you bring it right backYou dont spend time aimlessly sniffing at the flowers looking at the sky or listening to the birdsYouve got work to do work in learning how to breathe comfortably how to let the mind settle down in a good space here in the present momentWhen the breath starts feeling comfortable you can start exploring it in other areas of the bodyIf you simply stay with the comfortable breath in a narrow range youll tend to doze offSo consciously expand your awarenessA good place to focus first is right around the navelLocate that part of the body in your awareness where is it right nowThen notice how does it feel there as you breathe inHow does it feel when you breathe outWatch it for a couple of breaths and notice if theres any sense of tension or tightness in that part of the body either with the inbreath or with the outbreathIs it tensing up as you breathe inAre you holding onto the tension as you breathe outAre you putting too much force on the outbreathIf you catch yourself doing any of these things just relaxThink of that tension dissolving away in the sensation of the inbreath the sensation of the outbreathIf you want you can think of the breath energy coming into the body right there at the navel working through any tension or tightness that you might feel thereThen move your awareness to the right  to the lower righthand corner of your abdomen  and follow the same three steps there  locate that general part of the body in your awareness  notice how it feels as you breathe in how it feels as you breathe out and  if you sense any tension or tightness in the breath just let it relax Now move your awareness to the left to the lower lefthand corner of your abdomen and follow the same three steps thereNow move your awareness up to the solar plexus and then to the right to the right flank to the left flank to the middle of the chest After a while move up to the base of the throat and then to the middle of the headBe very careful with the breath energy in the headThink of it very gently coming in not only through the nose but also through the eyes the ears down from the top of the head in from the back of the neck very gently working through and loosening up any tension you may feel say around your jaws the back of your neck around your eyes or around your faceFrom there you can move your attention gradually down the back out the legs to the tips of the toes the spaces between the toesAs before focus on a particular part of the body notice how it feels with the inbreath and outbreath relax any sensation of tension or tightness you might feel there so that the breath energy can flow more freely and then move on until youve reached the tips of the toesThen repeat the process beginning at the back of the neck and going down the shoulders through the arms past your wrists and out through your fingersYou can repeat this survey of the body as many times as you like until the mind feels ready to settle downThen let your attention return to any spot in the body where it feels most naturally settled and centeredSimply let your attention rest there at one with the breathAt the same time let the range of your awareness spread out so that it fills the entire body like the light of a candle in the middle of a room the candle flame is in one spot but its light fills the entire roomOr like a spider on a web the spiders in one spot but it knows the whole webBe keen on maintaining that broadened sense of awarenessYoull find that it tends to shrink like a balloon with a small hole in it so keep broadening its range thinking whole body whole body breath in the whole body from the top of the head down into the tips of the toes Think of the breath energy coming in and out of the body through every poreMake a point of staying with this centered broadened awareness as long as you canTheres nothing else you have to think about right now nowhere else to go nothing else to doJust stay with this centered broadened awareness of the presentWhen the time comes to leave meditation remind yourself that theres a skill to leavingIn other words you dont just jump right outMy teacher Ajaan Fuang once said that when most people meditate its as if theyre climbing a ladder up to the second story of a building stepbystepbystep rungbyrung slowly up the ladderBut as soon as they get to the second story they jump out the windowDont let yourself be that wayThink of how much effort went into getting yourself centeredDont throw it awayThe first step in leaving is to spread thoughts of good will once more to all the people around youThen before you open your eyes remind yourself that even though youre going to have your eyes open you want your attention to stay centered in the body at the breathTry to maintain that center as long as you can as you get up walk around talk listen whateverIn other words the skill of leaving meditation lies in learning how not to leave it regardless of whatever else you may be doingAct from that sense of being centeredIf you can keep the mind centered in this way youll have a standard against which you can measure its movements its reactions to the events around it and within itOnly when you have a solid center like this can you gain insight into the movements of the mindThe Theravada tradition dominant in Sri Lanka Myanmar and Thailand regards the Pali suttas as the authentic and authoritative record of the Buddhas own wordsWhen Western scholars  piqued by issues of authority and authenticity  first learned of these claims in the th century they began employing the historical method to test themAnd although every conceivable scrap of literary or archeological evidence seems to have been examined no airtight historical proof or disproof of these claims has surfacedWhat has surfaced is a mass of minor facts and probabilities  showing that the Pali canon is probably the closest detailed record we have of the Buddhas teachings  but nothing more certain than thatArcheological evidence shows that Pali was probably not the Buddhas native language but is this proof that he didnt use Pali when talking to native speakers of that languageThe canon contains grammatical irregularities but are these signs of an early stage in the language before it was standardized or a later stage of degenerationAnd in which stage of the languages development did the Buddhas life fallFragments of other early Buddhist canons have been found with slight deviations from the Pali canon in their wording but not in their basic doctrinesIs their unanimity in doctrine a sign that they all come from the Buddha himself or was it the product of a later conspiracy to remake and standardize the doctrine in line with changed beliefs and tastesScholars have proven eager to take sides on these issues but the inevitable use of inference conjecture and probabilities in their arguments lends an air of uncertainty to the whole processMany have seen this uncertainty as sign of the inadequacy of the Theravadin claims to authenticityBut simply to dismiss the teachings of the suttas for this reason would be to deprive ourselves of the opportunity to test their most remarkable assertion that human effort properly directed can put an end to all suffering and stressPerhaps we should instead question the methods of the historians and view the uncertainty of their conclusions as a sign of the inadequacy of the historical method as a tool for ascertaining the DhammaThe suttas themselves make this point in their own recommendations for how the authenticity and authority of the Dhamma is best ascertainedIn a famous passage they quote the Buddha as sayingKalamas dont go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by logical conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought This contemplative is our teacher When you know for yourselves that These dhammas are unskillful these dhammas are blameworthy these dhammas are criticized by the wise these dhammas when adopted and carried out lead to harm and to suffering  then you should abandon them When you know for yourselves that These dhammas are skillful these dhammas are blameless these dhammas are praised by the wise these dhammas when adopted and carried out lead to welfare and to happiness  then you should enter and remain in themBecause this passage is contained in a religious scripture the statements attracting the most attention have been those rejecting the authority of religious teachers legends traditions and scripture along with those insisting on the importance of knowing for oneselfThese remarkably antidogmatic statements  sometimes termed the Buddhas Charter of Free Inquiry  have tended to divert attention from the severe strictures that the passage places on what knowing for oneself entailsIn questioning the authority of reports it dismisses the basic material on which the historical method is basedIn questioning the authority of inference and probability it dismisses some of the methods basic techniquesIn questioning the authority of logical conjecture analogies and agreement through pondering views it dismisses the methods of freethinking rationalism in generalThis leaves only two methods for ascertaining the Dhamma both of them related to the question raised in this passage and central to other teachings in the canon What is skillful what is unskillfulIn developing any skill you must pay attention to the results of your own actions and listen to those who have already mastered the skillSimilarly in ascertaining the Dhamma you must examine the results that come from putting a particular teaching in practice and check those results against the opinions of the wiseTwo aspects of the Dhamma however make it a skill apartThe first is reflected in the fact that the word Dhamma means not only teaching but also quality of the mindThus the above passage could also be translatedWhen you know for yourselves that These qualities are unskillful these qualities are blameworthy these qualities are criticized by the wise these qualities when adopted and carried out lead to harm and to suffering  then you should abandon them When you know for yourselves that These qualities are skillful these qualities are blameless these qualities are praised by the wise these qualities when adopted and carried out lead to welfare and to happiness  then you should enter and remain in themIn fact this is more likely the correct translation as the discussion following this passage focuses on the results of acting on qualities of the mind greed aversion and delusion in the unskillful set and lack of greed lack of aversion and lack of delusion in the skillful oneThis points to the fact that Dhamma practice is primarily a skill of the mindThe second aspect that sets the Dhamma apart as a skill is its goal nothing less than the total ending of sufferingWhile this second aspect of the Dhamma makes it an attractive skill to master the first aspect makes it hard to determine who has mastered the skill and is thus qualified to speak about it with authorityAfter all we cant look into the minds of others to see what qualities are there and what the internal results of the practice areAt best we can detect hints of these things in their actions but nothing moreThus if we look to others for the last word on the Dhamma we will always be in a position of uncertaintyThe only way to overcome uncertainty is to practice the Dhamma to see if it brings about an end to suffering within our own mindsTraditionally the texts state that uncertainty about the Dhamma ends only with the attainment of streamentry the first of the four levels of AwakeningEven though a person who has reached this level of Awakening isnt totally immersed in the ending of suffering he or she has seen enough of the end of suffering to know without a doubt that thats where the practice of the Dhamma leadsSo its not surprising that the four factors the suttas identify as bringing about streamentry are also the four methods they recommend for ascertaining whether they themselves are a truly authoritative and authentic guide to the end of sufferingThose factors listed in SN arePassages from the suttas dealing with each of these factors help show how the two sources of skill  the counsel of the wise and the lessons learned by observing the results of your own actions  can be properly balanced and integrated so as to ascertain what the true Dhamma isAnd because listening to the true Dhamma now includes reading the true Dhamma a knowledge of these factors and their interrelationships gives guidance in how to read the suttasIn particular these factors show how the suttas themselves say they should be read and what other actions provide the skillful context for getting the most benefit from reading themAs you explore the explanations of these factors you find that their presentation as a short list is deceptively simple inasmuch as each factor contains elements of the other factors as wellFor instance associating with people of integrity is of great help in practicing the Dhamma but for a person to recognize people of genuine integrity requires that he or she have some prior experience in practicing the DhammaThus although the form of the list suggests a simple linear progression the individual factors of the list are interrelated in complex waysWhat this means in practice is that the process of ascertaining the Dhamma is a complex one requiring sensitivity and discernment in balancing and integrating the factors in an appropriate wayBecause the Dhamma consists primarily of qualities of the mind any written account of the Dhamma is only a pale shadow of the real thingThus to gain a sense of the Dhammas full dimensions you must find people who embody the Dhamma in their thoughts words and deeds and associate with them in a way that enables you to absorb as much of the Dhamma as possibleThe passages explaining this factor thus offer advice in two areas how to recognize people of integrity and how best to associate with them once you have found themThe immediate sign of integrity is gratitudeA person of integrity is grateful and acknowledges the help given to himThis gratitude this acknowledgment is second nature among admirable peopleIt is entirely on the level of people of integrityGratitude is a necessary sign of integrity in that people who do not recognize and value the goodness and integrity in others are unlikely to make the effort to develop integrity within themselvesOn its own though gratitude doesnt constitute integrityThe essence of integrity lies in three qualities truth harmlessness and discernmentThere is the case where a monk lives in dependence on a certain village or townThen a householder or householders son goes to him and observes him with regard to three mental qualities  qualities based on greed qualities based on aversion qualities based on delusion Are there in this venerable one any such qualities based on greed aversion delusion that with his mind overcome by these qualities he might say I know while not knowing or say I see while not seeing or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for hisher longterm harm and pain As he observes him he comes to know There are in this venerable one no such qualities His bodily and verbal behavior are those of one not greedy aversive deludedAnd the Dhamma he teaches is deep hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wise As this passage shows knowledge of a persons truthfulness requires that you be so observant of his or her behavior that you can confidently infer the quality of his or her mindThis level of confidence in turn requires that you not only be observant but also discerning and willing to take time for as another passage points out the appearance of spiritual integrity is easy to fakeThen King Pasenadi Kosala went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideThen seven coiledhair ascetics seven Jain ascetics seven naked ascetics seven onecloth ascetics and seven wanderers  their nails grown long their bodyhair grown long  walked past not far from the Blessed One On seeing them King Pasenadi arranged his upper robe over one shoulder knelt down with his right knee on the ground saluted the ascetics with his hands before his heart and announced his name to them three times I am the king venerable sirs Pasenadi KosalaI am the king venerable sirs Pasenadi KosalaI am the king venerable sirs Pasenadi Kosala Then not long after the ascetics had passed he returned to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Of those in the world who are arahants or on the path to arahantship are these among themYour majesty as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures living crowded with wives and children using Kasi fabrics and sandalwood wearing garlands scents and creams handling gold and silver it is hard for you to know whether these are arahants or on the path to arahantshipIts through living together that a persons virtue may be known and then only after a long period not a short period by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive by one who is discerning not by one who isnt discerningIts through trading with a person that his purity may be knownIts through adversity that a persons endurance may be knownIts through discussion that a persons discernment may be known and then only after a long period not a short period by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive by one who is discerning not by one who isnt discerningHow amazing lordHow awesomeHow well that was put by the Blessed One These men lord are my spies my scouts returning after going out through the countrysideThey go out first and then I goNow when they have scrubbed off the dirt and mud are wellbathed and wellperfumed have trimmed their hair and beards and have put on white clothes they will go about endowed and provided with the five strings of sensualityANexpands on these points indicating that the ability to recognize a person of integrity requires you to have a strong sense of integrity yourselfIn fact MN insists that you must be a person of integrity in your actions views and friendships if you are to recognize integrity in anotherOnce youve determined to the best of your ability that certain people embody integrity the suttas advise listening to their Dhamma both to learn about them  to further test their integrity  and to learn from them to gain a sense of what the Dhamma might beAnd again the suttas recommend both how to listen to the Dhamma and how to recognize true Dhamma when you hear itMN advises that you spend time near people of integrity develop a sense of respect for them and pay close attention to their DhammaSNand ANexplain the purpose for respect here its a prerequisite for learningNeither passage elaborates on this point but its truth is fairly obviousYou find it easier to learn from someone you respect than from someone you dontRespect opens your mind and loosens your preconceived opinions to make room for new knowledge and skillsAt the same time a person with a valuable teaching to offer will feel more inclined to teach it to someone who shows respect than to someone who doesntHowever respect doesnt necessarily mean giving your full approval to the teachingAfter all part of the purpose in listening to the Dhamma is to test whether the person teaching it has integrity in his views or hersFull approval can come only when youve put the teaching in practice and tasted its resultsThis is why the Vinaya the monastic discipline never requires that a student take vows of obedience to a teacherHere respect means in the words of Sn a lack of stubbornnessOr in the words of AN the patience to comply with the teaching the willingness to listen with an open mind and to take the time and effort needed to give any teachings that seem reasonable a serious tryThe reasonability of the teaching can be gauged by the central principle in views of integrity as explained above in MNThat principle is conviction in kamma the efficacy of human action that people are responsible for their actions that their intentions determine the quality  the skillfulness or unskillfulness  of their actions that actions give results and that the quality of the action determines the quality of the resultA person who doesnt believe in these principles cannot be trustedBecause the distinction between skillfulness and unskillfulness is central to the principle of kamma  and also to the project of putting an end to suffering and stress  MN recommends approaching potential teachers and asking themWhat is skillfulWhat is unskillfulWhat is blameworthyWhat is blamelessWhat should be cultivatedWhat should not be cultivatedWhat having been done by me will be for my longterm harm and sufferingOr what having been done by me will be for my longterm welfare and happinessThe texts give a few examples of what might be called the lowest common denominator for judging whether answers to this question embody integrityIn essence these teachings constitute what works in eliminating blatant levels of suffering and stress in ones lifeNow what is unskillfulTaking life is unskillful taking what is not given sexual misconduct lying abusive speech divisive talebearing idle chatter is unskillfulCovetousness ill will wrong views are unskillfulThese things are termed unskillfulAnd what are the roots of unskillful thingsGreed is a root of unskillful things aversion is a root of unskillful things delusion is a root of unskillful thingsThese are termed the roots of unskillful thingsAnd what is skillfulAbstaining from taking life is skillful abstaining from taking what is not given from sexual misconduct from lying from abusive speech from divisive talebearing abstaining from idle chatter is skillfulLack of covetousness lack of ill will right views are skillfulThese things are termed skillfulAnd what are the roots of skillful thingsLack of greed is a root of skillful things lack of aversion is a root of skillful things lack of delusion is a root of skillful thingsThese are termed the roots of skillful thingsThese three things have been promulgated by wise people by people who are truly goodWhich threeGenerosity goingforth and service to ones mother and fatherThese three things have been promulgated by wise people by people who are truly goodHowever the true Dhamma has a dimension that goes far beyond the lowest common denominatorTo repeat the words of MN it is deep hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wise The principle of skillfulness  of cause and effect that can be tested in your own actions  still applies in this dimension but the standards for what works on this level are correspondingly subtler and more refinedTwo famous passages indicate what these standards areGotami the dhammas of which you may know These dhammas lead  to passion not to dispassion to being fettered not to being unfettered to accumulating not to shedding to selfaggrandizement not to modesty to discontent not to contentment to entanglement not to seclusion to laziness not to aroused persistence to being burdensome not to being unburdensome You may categorically hold This is not the Dhamma this is not the Vinaya this is not the Teachers instructionAs for the dhammas of which you may know These dhammas lead  to dispassion not to passion to being unfettered not to being fettered to shedding not to accumulating to modesty not to selfaggrandizement to contentment not to discontent to seclusion not to entanglement to aroused persistence not to laziness to being unburdensome not to being burdensome You may categorically hold This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teachers instructionUpali the dhammas of which you may know These dhammas do not lead to utter disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening nor to Unbinding You may categorically hold This is not the Dhamma this is not the Vinaya this is not the Teachers instructionAs for the dhammas of which you may know These dhammas lead to utter disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding You may categorically hold This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teachers instructionANexpands on some of the principles in the first of these two passagesBut here we will focus on the points where these two passages intersect  in the requirement that the Dhamma lead to dispassion and to being unfettered  for the standard test for a genuine experience of Awakening is that it arises from dispassion and cuts the fetters of the mindThere are these ten fetters Selfidentity views uncertainty grasping at precepts and practices sensual desire and ill willThese are the five lower fettersAnd which are the five higher fettersPassion for form passion for what is formless conceit restlessness and ignoranceThese are the five higher fettersAs MN explains streamentry cuts the first three fetters oncereturning the second level of Awakening weakens passion aversion and delusion nonreturning the third level cuts the fetters of sensual desire and ill will and arahantship the final level of Awakening cuts the remaining fiveUltimately of course the only proof for whether a teaching leads in this direction comes when having put the teaching into practice you actually begin to cut these fetters from the mindBut as a preliminary exercise you can contemplate a teaching to make sense of it and to see if there are good reasons for believing that it will lead in the right directionHearing the Dhamma one remembers itRemembering it one penetrates the meaning of those dhammasPenetrating the meaning one comes to an agreement through pondering those dhammasThere being an agreement through pondering those dhammas desire arisesWith the arising of desire one becomes willingWilling one contemplatesThe process of pondering weighing and comparing the teachings is based on adopting the right attitude and asking the right questions about themAs ANpoints out some of the teachings are meant to have their meaning inferred whereas others are not and to misapprehend which of these two classes a particular teaching belongs to is a serious mistakeThis is where the next factor for streamentry plays a roleMN draws the line between appropriate and inappropriate attention on the basis of the questions you choose to pursue in contemplating the DhammaThere is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person doesnt discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attention This is how he attends inappropriately Was I in the pastWas I not in the pastWhat was I in the pastHow was I in the pastHaving been what what was I in the pastShall I be in the futureShall I not be in the futureWhat shall I be in the futureHow shall I be in the futureHaving been what what shall I be in the future Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present Am IAm I notWhat am IHow am IWhere has this being come fromWhere is it boundAs he attends inappropriately in this way one of six kinds of view arises in him The view I have a self arises in him as true and established or the view I have no self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive notself or the view It is precisely by means of notself that I perceive self arises in him as true and established or else he has a view like this This very self of mine  the knower that is sensitive here and there to the ripening of good and bad actions  is the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will endure as long as eternityThis is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of viewsBound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging and death from sorrow lamentation pain distress and despairHe is not freed I tell you from stressThe wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attention He attends appropriately This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stressAs he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him selfidentity views doubt and grasping at precepts and practicesSome of the most useless controversies in the history of Buddhist thought have come from ignoring this teaching on what is and is not an appropriate object for attentionBuddhists have debated fruitlessly for centuries and continue to debate today on how to define a persons identity  the answer to the question What am I  or whether a person does or doesnt have a self  the answer to the questions Am IAm I not The fruitlessness of these arguments has proven repeatedly the point made by this passage that any answer to these questions leads to entanglement in the fetters that the Dhamma is meant to cut awayTo avoid these controversies the passage recommends focusing on four truths that constitute the appropriate object for attention  stress its origination its cessation and the way leading to its cessationThese truths are directly related to the question of skillfulness which divides reality into two sets of variables cause and effect skillful and unskillfulThe origination of stress is an unskillful cause and stress its resultThe way leading to the cessation of stress is a skillful cause and the cessation of stress its resultTo look at experience in these terms is to attend appropriately in a way that can help cut the fetters underlying unskillfulness in the mindFor instance SNdefines the truth of stress as the five clingingaggregates  clinging to form feeling perception fabrications and consciousness  and maintains that this truth should be comprehended in such a way as to lead to dispassion for the clingingThis too is a function of appropriate attentionA virtuous monk should attend in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notselfFor it is possible that a virtuous monk attending in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant notself would realize the fruit of streamentryThus appropriate attention entails a way of looking at the Dhamma not only as it is presented in a teaching but also as it presents itself directly as experience to the mindOnce youve gained a sense of the Dhamma through appropriate attention the remaining step is to practice in accordance with the DhammaAs with the first two factors for streamentry this process is twofold adapting your actions to follow in line with the Dhamma and refining your understanding of the Dhamma as it is tested in experienceMN offers explicit instructions on how this is to be doneWhat do you think Rahula What is a mirror forFor reflection sirIn the same way Rahula bodily acts verbal acts and mental acts are to be done with repeated reflectionWhenever you want to perform a bodily act you should reflect on it This bodily act I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to bothIs it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then any bodily act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to doBut if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction it would be a skillful bodily action with happy consequences happy results then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to doWhile you are performing a bodily act you should reflect on it This bodily act I am doing  is it leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to bothIs it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results If on reflection you know that it is leading to selfaffliction to affliction of others or both you should give it upBut if on reflection you know that it is not you may continue with itHaving performed a bodily act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then you should confess it reveal it lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy lifeHaving confessed it you should exercise restraint in the futureBut if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful bodily action with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed and joyful training day and night in skillful mental qualitiesHaving performed a mental act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful mental act with painful consequences painful results then you should feel distressed ashamed and disgusted with itFeeling distressed you should exercise restraint in the futureBut if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful mental action with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed and joyful training day and night in skillful mental qualitiesThe process of selfexamination recommended in this passage includes the principles discussed under the first three factors for streamentryYou pay appropriate attention to your own intentions and actions and to their results to see whether they qualify as skillful or unskillfulIf you notice that any of your bodily or verbal actions have led to harmful results you approach a person of integrity and listen to hisher adviceIn this way you combine the two principles that Iti  recommend as the most helpful internal and external principles for awakening appropriate attention and friendship with admirable peopleIt is no coincidence that these are precisely the two principles recommended in the discourse to the KalamasSelfexamination of this sort however shares yet another feature with the first factor for streamentry the need for integrityJust as your integrity is a prerequisite for your ability to detect integrity in others so it is a prerequisite for your ability to gauge the true nature of your intentions and the results of your actionsThese are commonly the two areas of experience where people are least honest with themselvesYet for your practice to accord with the Dhamma you must resist any habitual tendency to be less than totally scrupulous about themThis is why as a preface to the above advice the sutta shows the Buddha lecturing on the importance of truthfulness as the most essential quality for a person on the pathAlthough Rahula reportedly received the above advice when he was a child MN maintains that the principles it contains can lead all the way to full AwakeningThis means of course that they can lead to the first level of Awakening which is streamentryStreamentry is often called the arising of the Dhamma eyeWhat streamenterers see with this Dhamma eye is always expressed in the same terms Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation A passage in the Vinaya shows that the concept all that is subject to origination occurs in conjunction with a glimpse of what stands in opposition to all that is subject to origination  in other words the Unfabricated deathlessnessSariputta the Wanderer went to where Moggallana the Wanderer was stayingMoggallana the Wanderer saw him coming from afar and on seeing himsaid Your faculties are bright my friend your complexion pure  clearCould it be that you have attained the DeathlessYes my friend I haveThe suttas describe the experience of the Deathless in only the sketchiest termsWhat little description there is is intended to show that the Deathless lies beyond most linguistic categoriesHowever there are a few indicators to show what the Deathless is notTo begin with it cannot be described as a state of either being nor nonbeingWith the remainderless stopping and fading of the six spheres of contact is it the case that there is anything elseSariputta Dont say that my friendMahaKotthita With the remainderless stopping and fading of the six spheres of contact is it the case that there is not anything elseSariputta Dont say that my friendMahaKotthitais it the case that there both is and is not anything elseSariputta Dont say that my friendMahaKotthitais it the case that there neither is nor is not anything elseSariputta Dont say that my friendMahaKotthita Being asked if there is anything else you say Dont say that my friend Being asked if there is not anything else if there both is and is not anything else if there neither is nor is not anything else you say Dont say that my friend Now how is the meaning of this statement to be understoodSariputta Saying is it the case that there is anything else is it the case that there is not anything else is it the case that there both is and is not anything else is it the case that there neither is nor is not anything else one is objectifying nonobjectificationHowever far the six spheres of contact go that is how far objectification goesHowever far objectification goes that is how far the six spheres of contact goWith the remainderless fading and stopping of the six spheres of contact there comes to be the stopping the allaying of objectificationSecond the dimension of the Deathless is not devoid of awareness although the awareness here must by definition lie apart from the consciousness included in the five aggregates of fabricated experienceMonks that dimension should be known where the eye stops and the perception of form fadesThat dimension should be known where the ear stops and the perception of sound fades where the nose stops and the perception of aroma fades where the tongue stops and the perception of flavor fades where the body stops and the perception of tactile sensation fades where the intellect stops and the perception of ideaphenomenon fades That dimension should be knownHaving directly known the extent of designation and the extent of the objects of designation the extent of expression and the extent of the objects of expression the extent of description and the extent of the objects of description the extent of discernment and the extent of the objects of discernment the extent to which the cycle revolves Having directly known that the monk is releasedThe monk released having directly known that does not see does not know is his opinion that would be mistakenConsciousness without feature without end luminous all around does not partake of the solidity of earth the liquidity of water the radiance of fire the windiness of wind the divinity of devas the allness of the AllEven so Vaccha any form feeling perception fabrication consciousness by which one describing the Tathagata would describe him That the Tathagata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingFreed from the classification of form feeling perception fabrication consciousness Vaccha the Tathagata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the seaFreed dissociated and released from ten things Bahuna the Tathagata dwells with unrestricted awarenessWhich tenFreed dissociated and released from form the Tathagata dwells with unrestricted awarenessFreed dissociated and released from feeling from perception from fabrications from consciousness from birth from aging from death from stress Freed dissociated and released from defilement the Tathagata dwells with unrestricted awarenessJust as a red blue or white lotus born in the water and growing in the water rises up above the water and stands with no water adhering to it in the same way the Tathagata  freed dissociated and released from these ten things  dwells with unrestricted awarenessThese are not the words of a person who has found release in unconsciousnessFinally although the Deathless is sometimes called consciousness without feature without end it is not to be confused with the formless stage of concentration called the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessOne of the main differences between the two is that the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness is fabricated and willedThe element of will though can be very attenuated while one is in that dimension and only discernment at an extremely subtle level can ferret it outOne way of testing for it is to see if there is any sense of identification with the knowingIf there is then there is still the conceit of Imaking and mymaking applied to that stateAnother test is to see if there is any sense that the knowing contains all things or is their sourceIf there is then there is still fabrication in that state of mind for when the Deathless is fully comprehended the sense of unrestricted awareness as containing or acting as the source of other things is seen to be an ignorant conceitThere is the case monks where an uninstructed runofthemill person perceives Unbinding as UnbindingPerceiving Unbinding as Unbinding he conceives things about Unbinding he conceives things in Unbinding he conceives things coming out of Unbinding he conceives Unbinding as mine he delights in UnbindingWhy is thatBecause he has not comprehended it I tell youA monk who is an arahant devoid of mental fermentations  who has attained completion finished the task laid down the burden attained the true goal destroyed the fetters of becoming and is released through right knowledge directly knows Unbinding as UnbindingDirectly knowing Unbinding as Unbinding he does not conceive things about Unbinding does not conceive things in Unbinding does not conceive things coming out of Unbinding does not conceive Unbinding as mine does not delight in UnbindingWhy is thatBecause he has comprehended it I tell youHowever in line with the instructions to Gotami and Upali the true test of an experience of streamentry is not in its description but in the results it producesThe texts describe these in two ways four factors that characterize a person who has entered the stream and three fetters that streamentry automatically cutsThe four factors according to AN unwavering conviction in the Buddha unwavering conviction in the Dhamma unwavering conviction in the Sangha and virtues that are appealing to the noble ones  untorn unbroken unspotted unsplattered liberating praised by the wise untarnished leading to concentration The three fetters are selfidentity views doubt and grasping at precepts and practicesThe two lists have their common ground in the experience of the path to streamentryAs the path  the noble eightfold path  yields to the fruit of streamentry you see that although ordinary action can lead to pleasant unpleasant or mixed results on the level of fabricated experience the noble eightfold path is a form of action that produces none of these results but instead leads to the end of actionThis experience cuts through any doubt about the truth of the Buddhas Awakening thus ensuring that your conviction in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha will not waverHaving seen the results that ordinary actions do have on the fabricated level however you wouldnt dare transgress the five precepts that embody the virtues appealing to the noble onesStill because the Deathless is the end of action you dont grasp at precepts and practices as the goal in and of themselvesAnd because you have seen the aggregates of form feeling perception fabrication and consciousness fade away in the experience of the Deathless you would never construct an identity view around themAlthough the traditional lists of the results of streamentry provide stringent standards for judging ones own attainment the texts  and living Buddhist traditions today  record many instances of people who have overestimated their attainmentThus when you have what seems to be an attainment of this sort you have to examine it carefully and test the mind to see if the three fetters are actually cutAnd because the attainment itself is what proves or disproves the authority and authenticity of the texts as well as the integrity of your teachers you are ultimately left with only one guarantee of your attainment your own integrity which you hope has been adequately developed along the pathIn keeping with the principle that the Dhamma is ultimately a quality of the mind as embodied in the entire person the only way you can ultimately gauge the truth of the Dhamma is if you as a person are trueBecause the attainment of streamentry can make such an enormous difference in your life it is worth every ounce of integrity needed to attain it and to ascertain the attainmentThen the Blessed One picking up a little bit of dust with the tip of his fingernail said to the monks What do you think monksWhich is greater the little bit of dust I have picked up with the tip of my fingernail or the great earthThe great earth is far greater lordThe little bit of dust the Blessed One has picked up with the tip of his fingernail is next to nothingIts not a hundredth a thousandth a one hundredthousandth when compared with the great earthIn the same way monks for a disciple of the noble ones who is consummate in view an individual who has broken through the suffering and stress totally ended and extinguished is far greaterThat which remains in the state of having at most seven remaining lifetimes is next to nothing its not a hundredth a thousandth a one hundredthousandth when compared with the previous mass of sufferingThats how great the benefit is of breaking through to the Dhamma monksThats how great the benefit is of obtaining the Dhamma eyeFor a person who has been relieved of this much suffering the question of the historical Buddha becomes irrelevantIf the genuine Deathless is not the historical Buddhas attainment its what a genuine Buddha would have attainedThe Dhamma leading to this attainment could not have come from anyone elseAs SNquotes the Buddha as saying One who sees the Dhamma sees me ie the aspect of the Buddha that really matters the aspect signaling that total freedom the total end of suffering is an attainable goalThese are audacious claims and they obviously require an approach more audacious than the historical method to test themAs the suttas indicate nothing less than genuine integrity of character developed through careful training and practice will sufficeGiven that dhamma means both teaching and quality of mind it stands to reason that truth of character is needed to measure the truth of the teachingOnly true people can know the truth of the suttas claimsThis may seem an exclusionary or elitist thing to say but actually its notThe sort of education needed to master the historical method isnt open to everyone but integrity is  if you want to develop itThe suttas say that the best things in life are available to those who are trueThe only question is whether youre true enough to want to know if theyre rightThe Buddhas teachings like the principles they describe are interrelated in complex waysIt is difficult to point out any one teaching that underlies everything else as all the teachings are mutually dependentNevertheless there are a number of possible entry points into their pattern and one of those points is the Buddhas observation that it is possible to master a skillUnlike many of his contemporaries  and many thinkers before and since  the Buddha did not try to reason from abstract principles down to direct experienceAs we noted in the Introduction the Buddhas contemporaries were influenced by the premier science of their time  astronomy  in the way they viewed experience and it is easy to see prejudices derived from astronomy at work in their thought that the universe is composed of discrete bodies acting in line with regular linear causes and that human knowledge of these processes has no impact on the way they behaveThese prejudices when applied to human experience resulted in what the Buddha called theories of being or what we today would call theories of order that the processes of the universe can be totally explained in terms of physical principles that follow linear causal patterns unaffected by human interventionThe various conclusions that developed out of this approach differed primarily in how ones soul  viewed in various ways either as a discrete thing or as a more abstract principle  was to look for release from this vast cosmic machineSome insisted that action was illusory others that action was real but totally determined by fixed rules serving only to bind one to the impersonal cycleIn reaction to the theories of being the Lokayatans proposed a theory of nonbeing or absolute chaos that like all reactionary ideologies was defined largely by what it deniedAlthough it admitted the primacy of the physical universe it denied that any causal laws operated on the observable human levelEverything the Lokayatans said was totally spontaneous random and chaoticNo personal souls were observable and thus human identity was composed only of the temporary conjunction of elements that made up the body terminating when those elements separated at deathIn a manner typical of his approach to problems the Buddha avoided both sides of this argument by focusing directly on the level of immediate experience and exploring the implications of truths that both sides overlookedInstead of fixing on the content of the views expressed he considered the actions of those who were expressing the viewsThe logic either of total determinism or of total chaos must end in the conclusion that purposeful action is pointless and yet adherents of both schools continued to act in purposeful waysThe fact that each side advanced an interpretation of reality implied that both agreed that there were skillful and unskillful ways of approaching the truth for each insisted that the other used unskillful forms of observation and argumentation to advance its viewsThus the Buddha looked directly at skillful action in and of itself worked out its implications in viewing knowledge itself as a skill  rather than a body of facts  and found that those implications carried him all the way to releaseWe have already touched on how implications drawn from the fact of skillful action shaped the major outlines of the Buddhas teachingsIt will be useful to review those implications hereTo begin with the fact that skills can be developed implies that action is not illusory that it actually gives resultsOtherwise there would be no such thing as skill for no actions would be more effective than othersThe fact of skillfulness also implies that some results are preferable to others for otherwise there would be no point in trying to develop skillsIn addition the fact that it is possible to learn from mistakes in the course of developing a skill so that ones future actions may be more skillful implies that the cycle of action result and reaction is not entirely deterministic and that acts of perception attention and intention can actually provide new input as the cycle goes through successive turnsThe important element in this input is attentionAnyone who has mastered a skill will realize that the process of attaining mastery requires attention to three things to preexisting conditions to what one is doing in relation to those conditions and to the results that come from ones actionsThis threefold focus enables one to monitor ones actions and adjust them accordinglyIn this way ones attention to conditions actions and effects allows the results of an action to feed back into future action thus allowing for refinement in ones skillBy working out the implications of these requirements the Buddha arrived at the principle of thisthat conditionality in which multiple feedback loops  sensitive to preexisting conditions to present input and to their combined outcome  account for the incredible complexity of the world of experience in a way similar to that of modern theories of deterministic chaos In this sense even though thisthat conditionality may seem somewhat alien when viewed in the abstract it is actually a very familiar but overlooked assumption that underlies all conscious purposeful actionThe Buddha simply explored the implications of this assumption much further than anyone else all the way to the disbanding of space time and the present together with their inherent stressThese implications of the fact of skillfulness account for the main framework of the Buddhas doctrine as expressed in the teachings on the four noble truths dependent coarising and thisthat conditionalityOther facets of skillful action also account for more detailed points within this frameworkFor instance the Buddhas exploration of stress and its origination in the light of skillful action provided the analysis of mental and physical events that played a central role in the second noble truth as expressed in terms of dependent coarisingThe first lesson of skillfulness is that the essence of an action lies in the intention motivating it an act motivated by the intention for greater skillfulness will give results different from those of an act motivated by greed aversion or delusionIntention in turn is influenced by the appropriateness or inappropriateness of the act of attention to ones circumstancesThe less an act of attention is clouded by delusion the more clearly it will see things in appropriate termsThe combination of attention and intention in turn determines the quality of the feeling and the physical events that result from the actThe more skilled the action the more refined the feelings and physical events that resultPerceptions arise with regard to those results some more appropriate than othersThe act of attention selects which ones to focus on thus feeding back into another round in the cycle of action with all its inherent instabilities and uncertaintiesUnderlying the entire cycle is the fact that all its factors are in contact with consciousnessThis constellation of factors came to form the central causal connection in one of the Buddhas most basic formulations of dependent coarising in which the mutual dependence of name and form on the one hand and consciousness on the other accounted for the arising of all stressThe interplay of name form and consciousness also plays a role in the formulation of the third and fourth noble truths providing an answer to the quandary of how the stress and suffering inherent in the cycle of action can be endedIf one tried simply to stop the cycle through a direct intention the intention itself would count as a factor to keep the cycle goingThis double bind can be dissolved however if one can watch as the contact between consciousness and the cycle naturally falls awayThis possibility requires not an attempt at inaction but even greater skillfulness in all the factors of actionConvinced that the only way to true happiness would be to find a way out of the cycle that there had to be such a way and that this was it the Bodhisatta developed each of the factors of skillful action to an even higher degree of skillThe most skillful form of attention he discovered was to view all of experience in terms of the four noble truths stress its origination its cessation and the path of practice leading to its cessationThese truths not only formed his most basic teaching but also played a role in the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress as the factor of right viewThe most skillful form of intention was to engage in the directed thoughts and evaluations that would lead the mind to the stillness of mental absorptionThese factors played a role both as aspects of the path factor of right concentration and as the highest form of path factor of right resolveThe most refined forms of feeling and perception were the feelings of pleasure and equanimity and their accompanying levels of perception in the highest states of mental absorption later included in the path factor of right concentration as wellThe Wings to Awakening  as alternate expressions of the path to the cessation of stress  are also shaped by the implications of the fact of skillfulnessThese implications account directly for the main factors in the Wings  the qualities of equanimity concentration and discernment that are needed to develop skillfulness  and indirectly for all the other qualities on which these qualities dependAs expressed in the nonlinear pattern of thisthat conditionality these implications also account for the way in which the factors in the Wings must act as supports for one another in a pattern of mutual feedbackAnd in the most general terms the fact that skillfulness leads ultimately to a dimension where skillfulness is transcended accounts for a paradoxical dynamic common to all seven sets that form the Wings the meditator must intentionally make use of qualities from which heshe wants to escape gaining familiarity with them in the course of mastering them to the point where they are naturally stilledThere the transcendent paths and their fruitions take overThis is the sense in which even the path of right practice must eventually be abandoned but only after it has been brought to the culmination of its developmentMany people have misunderstood this point believing that the Buddhas teachings on nonattachment require that one relinquish ones attachment to the path of practice as quickly as possibleActually to make a show of abandoning the path before it is fully developed is to abort the entire practiceAs one teacher has put it a person climbing up to a roof by means of a ladder can let go of the ladder only when safely on the roofIn terms of the famous raft simile one abandons the raft only after crossing the floodIf one were to abandon it in midflood to make a show of going spontaneously with the flow of the floods many currents one could drownWhen the factors of the path are mutually brought to a state of consummation however there occurs a point of equipoise called nonfashioning in which their contact with consciousness  still fully conscious  naturally becomes disengagedIn terms of chaos theory this compares to a point of resonance where the equations defining a nonlinear system interact in such a way that one of their members is divided by zero meaning that anything entering such a point would be undefined in terms of the system and so releasedThe moon for instance if it entered one of the resonances in the combined gravitational fields of the earth and the sun would be freed from its orbit around bothAnd just as the forces of gravity would be required to bring the moon to this freedom from gravity in the same way the path of skillful action would be required to bring the mind to the point of nonfashioning where the cycle of action is brought to an endThis is how all experience of stress suffering and the entire cosmos conditioned by time and the present is brought to an end as well leaving the limitless freedom of consciousness without feature the endpoint of all human strivingThus we can say that the Dhamma  in terms of doctrine practice and attainment  derives from the fully explored implications of one observation that it is possible to master a skillThis point is reflected not only in the content of the Buddhas teachings but also in the way they are expressedThe Buddha used many metaphors explicit and implicit citing the skills of craftsmen artists and athletes to illustrate his pointsThe texts abound with explicit similes referring to acrobats archers bathmen butchers carpenters farmers fletchers herdsmen musicians painters etc pointing out how their skills correspond either to the way the mind fashions stress and suffering for itself or to the skills a meditator needs to develop in order to master the path to releaseOn the implicit level the passages dealing with meditation are filled with terms derived from music theoryIn his younger days as a prince the Bodhisatta  like other young aristocrats of his time  was undoubtedly a connoisseur of the musical arts and so was naturally familiar with the theory that lay behind themBecause the terminology of this theory is so pervasive in the teachings he formulated as a Buddha it will be useful to discuss it here brieflyUnfortunately we do not have a full treatise on the theory of musical performance as practiced during the Buddhas time but there are enough references to music scattered through the texts for us to piece together the outlines of that theoryThe first step in performance was to tune ones instrument establishing ones tonic note to make it onpitch then to finetune or attune the remaining notes of the scale in relation to the tonicThis required a great deal of skill sensitivity and some mathematical knowledge as the welltempered scale had not yet been developed and many different ways of calculating the scale were in use each appropriate to a different emotionThe musician then picked up the theme of the compositionThe theme functioned in several ways and thus the word theme carried several meaningsOn the one hand it was the essential message of the piece the image or impression that the performer wanted to leave in the listeners mindOn the other hand it was the governing principle that determined what ornamentation or variations would be suitable to the pieceThese musical terms recur throughout the Buddhas discussion of meditationFor instance in one context the Buddha says that one should establish ones persistence to the right pitch attune the remaining faculties to that pitch and then pick up ones themeIn other contexts he says that one should become attuned to a particular theme or that one should develop meditation in tune with a particular objectImpossibilities are said to be nonbase analogous to tones that cannot function as musical notesThere are enough passages to show that the Buddha used this terminology conscious of its musical connotations and that he wanted to make the point that the practice of meditation was similar to the art of musical performanceWe should thus try to be sensitive to these terms and their implications for the comparison between music and meditation is a useful oneIn the most general sense this comparison underlines the fact that the knowledge needed for release from suffering is the same sort as that involved in mastering a skill  a continued focus on the present a sensitivity to ones context ones own actions and their combined consequences rather than a command of an abstract body of factsTo develop the path is to become more and more sensitive to the present  in particular more sensitive to ones own sensitivity and its consequencesThis is similar to the way in which a musician must learn to listen to hisher own performance a process that ultimately involves listening to the quality of ones listening itselfThe greater ones sensitivity in listening the more profound ones performances becomeIn the same way the greater ones sensitivity to ones own mind in the development of skillful qualities the more one abandons the causes of suffering and realizes its cessationIn addition to this general observation the comparison between music and meditation highlights a number of practical points in the development of meditative skillFirst it underscores the need for flexibility and ingenuity in the practice tempered by an awareness of the limits of how far that flexibility can goA skilled musician in the Buddhas time had to master not one but many tuning systems so as to handle a full range of musical themes while simultaneously knowing which ways of tuning were unworkableIn the same way a skilled meditator should know of many valid ways of tuning the mind to the theme of its meditation  and should have a command of them all so as to deal with various contingencies as they arise  but at the same time must be aware that some varieties of meditation simply do not lead to AwakeningIn this light the seven sets of the Wings to Awakening can be viewed as the Buddhas complete list of workable systems for tuning the mindrecognized in the Buddhas time The implication here is that any path of practice deviating from these systems would be like an instrument tuned to a discordant scale and would not be in harmony with the way of the contemplative who aims at a life in tune with the DhammaA second point is that the musical analogy makes vivid the need for balance in meditative practice a lesson that appears repeatedly in the textsJust as a musical instrument should neither be too sharp nor too flat the mind on the path has to find a balance between excessive energy and excessive stillnessAt the same time it must constantly watch out for the tendency for its energy to slacken in the same way that stringed instruments tend to go flatThe rightness of right view and other factors of the path thus carries the connotation not only of being correct but also of being just rightA third point is that this analogy helps clarify passages in the texts that speak of attaining the goal without effortTaken out of context these passages seem to contradict or totally negate the many other passages that focus on the need for effort in the practiceViewed in context of the music analogy however they make perfect senseLike a musical virtuoso one develops skill to the point where it becomes effortless but the perfection of the skill does not negate the fact that it took a great deal of effort to reach that level of masteryIn fact the Buddhas path is a metaskill  the full art or science of skillfulness in and of itself  in which one focuses on the mind as the source of what is skillful and unskillful learns to deal skillfully with unskillful states of mind then to deal more skillfully even with skillful states to the point of focusing not on the skill but on the skill of acquiring a skill so that one ultimately sees what lies both in the skillfulness and beyondThe passages included in this first section cover three themes how the distinction between what is skillful and not is fundamental to the practice how to determine what is skillful and not and how to become skillful in developing skillful states of mindBecause these issues are so basic the passages are fairly selfexplanatoryA few of their facets however are easy to overlookFirst it is important to note that the definition of skillful states of mind as free of greed aversion and delusion provides a convenient rule of thumb for distinguishing between intentions that are merely good and those that are actually skillfulSometimes good intentions are colored by ignorance as when one tries to help another person without knowing the true source of that persons problemThis would qualify as a good but not a skillful intentionAs we have noted the processes of causality are sensitive and complexThus there is no getting by on wellmeaning intentions aloneOne must monitor ones actions continually to make sure that they are in fact appropriate to the present situation and not based on ignoranceDelusion even wellmeaning delusion is a source for unskillful actsFor this reason one needs to be constantly observant of ones actions and their effects so that ones good intentions can truly become skillful and ones actions can actually do justice to the specific conditions in the here and now produced by the process of thisthat conditionalitySecond the distinction between skillful and unskillful provides an insightful explanation for the causes for good and evil behaviorThis distinction is not limited to the values of any particular society and it avoids the issue of whether beings are inherently good or badWhen people act in evil ways it is because they lack skill in the way they think when they think in skillful ways they naturally will do goodBecause skill is something that can be acquired the way to goodness is open for all people who want to be good no matter how badly they have behaved in the pastThe Canon tells of people who had committed misdeeds and upon realizing their mistakes confessed them to the BuddhaThe most striking instance was King Ajatasattu who had killed his father in order to secure his position on the throneIn spite of the gross nature of the deed the Buddha approved of the kings confession and  instead of playing on any feelings of guilt the king might have had  encouraged him in his determination to mend his ways adding that it is a cause for progress in the noble way if one realizes ones mistakes as such and resolves not to repeat themThus it is always possible to make a fresh start in life aware of ones past bad kamma and resolving to mend ones ways unburdened with any feelings that one might be inherently unworthy or badThird it is important to note the two basic factors internal and external that enable one to tell what is skillful and unskillfulThe main internal factor is appropriate attention which is well illustrated in One learns to view ones thoughts objectively without partiality in terms of their actual consequencesAs this factor develops from a sense of conviction in the principle of kamma it turns into the ability to view all of experience in terms of the four noble truthsThe main external factor is friendship with admirable people defined as those who live by the principle of kammaFrom their teachings one can learn the advisability of trying to develop skillfulness in the first place in their behavior one can see skillfulness in actionThese internal and external factors reinforce one another in that skillful attitudes lead one to seek out admirable people to begin with and admirable people lead one by word and example to see the less obvious advantages of skillful attitudesFortunately every human being alive has some skillful qualities in his or her mind as well as access to people who are admirable on at least some levelThus no one consciously starting on the Buddhist path is starting from scratchRather each person is advised to make the most of opportunities that have already been present and to search for further opportunities to develop the mind in a skillful directionThe two prerequisites for skillfulness are amplified in The discourse from which this passage comes  the Discourse to the Kalamas  is often referred to as the Buddhas charter of free inquiry because of the emphasis it lays on seeing the truth for oneself without reliance on outside authorityThis interpretation however misses one of the important clauses in the discourse where the Buddha says that one must take note of what wise people censure and praiseIn other words one must check ones own perceptions against those of people of upright character and solid experience for until one gains Awakening ones perceptions are bound to be partial and biasedThis is why the Buddha says that friendship with admirable people  which begins with the ability to recognize admirable people  is the whole of the life of practiceThe interaction between appropriate attention and friendship with admirable people in mastering skillful mental qualities is wellillustrated in This passage in which the Buddha shortly after his Awakening is instructing his sevenyearold son shows very explicitly how one develops appropriate attention by reflecting on the consequences of ones actions before while and after actingIf one realizes after acting that what looked like a proper action before and while acting actually turned out to have unfavorable consequences one should confess the mistake to ones experienced friends on the pathThis allows one to benefit from their counsel and also to make public ones resolve not to make the same mistake againIn this way although one is responsible for treading the path oneself one can benefit from the wisdom and encouragement of those already familiar with the wayBefore my selfawakening when I was still just an unawakened Bodhisatta the thought occurred to me Why dont I keep dividing my thinking into two classes So I made thinking imbued with sensuality thinking imbued with ill will  thinking imbued with harmfulness one class and thinking imbued with renunciation thinking imbued with nonill will  thinking imbued with harmlessness another classAnd as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with sensuality arose in meI discerned that Thinking imbued with sensuality has arisen in me and that leads to my own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of bothIt obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to UnbindingAs I noticed that it leads to my own affliction it subsidedAs I noticed that it leads to the affliction of others to the affliction of both it obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding it subsidedWhenever thinking imbued with sensuality had arisen I simply abandoned it destroyed it dispelled it wiped it out of existenceWhatever a monk keeps pursuing with his thinking  pondering that becomes the inclination of his awarenessIf a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with sensuality abandoning thinking imbued with renunciation his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with sensualityJust as in the last month of the Rains in the autumn season when the crops are ripening a cowherd would look after his cows he would tap  poke  check  curb them with a stick on this side  thatWhy is thatBecause he foresees flogging or imprisonment or a fine or public censure arising from thatIn the same way I foresaw in unskillful qualities drawbacks degradation  defilement and I foresaw in skillful qualities rewards related to renunciation  promoting cleansingAnd as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with renunciation arose in meI discerned that Thinking imbued with renunciation has arisen in me and that leads neither to my own affliction nor to the affliction of others nor to the affliction of bothIt fosters discernment promotes lack of vexation  leads to UnbindingIf I were to think  ponder in line with that even for a night even for a day even for a day  night I do not envision any danger that would come from it except that thinking  pondering a long time would tire the bodyWhen the body is tired the mind is disturbed and a disturbed mind is far from concentration So I steadied my mind right within settled unified  concentrated itWhy is thatSo that my mind would not be disturbedWhatever a monk keeps pursuing with his thinking  pondering that becomes the inclination of his awarenessIf a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with renunciation abandoning thinking imbued with sensuality his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with renunciationJust as in the last month of the hot season when all the crops have been gathered into the village a cowherd would look after his cows while resting under the shade of a tree or out in the open he simply keeps himself mindful of those cows In the same way I simply kept myself mindful of those mental qualitiesUnflagging persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness establishedMy body was calm  unaroused my mind concentrated  singleQuite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities I entered  remained in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationWith the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations I entered  remained in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceWith the fading of rapture I remained equanimous mindful  alert and sensed pleasure with the bodyI entered  remained in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of joys  distresses  I entered  remained in the fourth jhāna purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past livesI recollected my manifold past lives ie one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction  expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose here Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes  detailsThis was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away  reappearance of beingsI saw  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  I saw beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kammaThis was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the effluentsI discerned as it had come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are effluents This is the origination of effluents This is the cessation of effluents This is the way leading to the cessation of effluents My heart thus knowing thus seeing was released from the effluent of sensuality released from the effluent of becoming released from the effluent of ignoranceWith release there was the knowledge Released I discerned that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThis was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteAs they were sitting to one side the Kālāmas of Kesaputta said to the

Blessed Ones wordsThe Buddhas doctrine of kamma takes the fact of skillful action which can be observed on the ordinary sensory level and gives it an importance that for a person pursuing the Buddhist goal must be accepted on faithAccording to this doctrine skillful action is not simply one factor out of many contributing to happiness it is the primary factorIt does not lead simply to happiness within the dimensions of time and the present if developed to the ultimate level of refinement it can lead to an Awakening totally released from those dimensionsThese assertions cannot be proven prior to an experience of that Awakening but they must be accepted as working hypotheses in the effort to develop the skillfulness needed for AwakeningThis paradox  which lies at the heart of the act of taking refuge in the Triple Gem  explains why the serious pursuit of the Buddhist path is a sustained act of faith that can become truly firm and verified only with the first glimpse of Awakening called streamentryIt also explains why a strong desire to gain release from the stress and suffering inherent in conditioned existence is needed for such a pursuit for without that desire it is very difficult to break through this paradox with the necessary leap of faithThe basic context for the doctrine of kamma was provided by the first two insights on the night of the Buddhas Awakening  remembrance of previous lives and insight into the death and rebirth of beings throughout the cosmosThis context was expressed in terms of personal narrative and cosmologyThe possibility of rebirth accounted for the way in which kamma could shape experiences in life such as the situation into which a young child is born for which no kammic cause in the present lifetime could be foundThe pattern of death and rebirth for all beings in which the quality of the state of rebirth depends on the moral quality of actions performed in previous lifetimes presented the possibility that moral standards instead of being mere social conventions were intrinsic to the workings of any and all experience of the cosmosEssential to the Buddhas second insight was his realization of the minds role in determining the moral quality of actionsHis analysis of the process of developing a skill showed him that skillfulness depended not so much on the physical performance of an act as on the mental qualities of perception attention and intention that played a part in itOf these three qualities the intention formed the essence of the act  as it constituted the decision to act  while attention and perception informed itThus the skillfulness of these mental phenomena accounted for the acts kammic consequencesThe less greed aversion and delusion motivating the act the better its resultsUnintentional acts would have kammic consequences only when they resulted from carelessness in areas where one would reasonably be held responsibleIntentional actions performed under the influence of right view  which on this level means conviction in the principle of kamma conviction in the principle of kamma  led inherently to pleasant states of rebirth while those performed under the influence of wrong view led to unpleasant statesThus the quality of the views on which one acts  ie the quality of the perception and attention informing the intention  is a major factor in shaping experienceThis observation undercuts the radical distinction between mind and material reality that is taken for granted in our own culture and was also assumed by many of the Samana schools of the Buddhas timeFrom the Buddhas viewpoint mental and physical phenomena are two sides of a single coin with the mental side of prior importanceMost descriptions of the Buddhas teachings on kamma tend to stop here but there are many passages on kamma in the Canon  and included in this section  that do not fit into the neat picture based merely the first two insights on the night of the AwakeningThe only way to account for these passages is to note the simple fact that Buddhas teachings on kamma were shaped not only by these two insights but also by the third insight and the resulting knowledge of UnbindingThe third insight explored the possibility of a fourth kind of kamma  in addition to good bad and a mixture of the two  that was skillful enough to bring about the ending of kammaAt the same time in the course of developing the level of skillfulness needed to bring kamma to an end the Buddha learned a great deal about the nature of action that forced him to recast his understanding of kamma in much more subtle termsThe knowledge of Unbinding  which followed on the full development of this fourth type of kamma and the realizations that accompanied it  acted as proof that the understandings comprising the three insights were trueTo explore these points will not only help give us a more complete understanding of the Buddhas teachings on kamma but will also show why conviction in the principle of skillful kamma is essential to Buddhist practiceIn his effort to master kamma in such a way as to bring kamma to an end the Buddha discovered that he had to abandon the contexts of personal narrative and cosmology in which the issue of kamma first presented itselfBoth these forms of understanding deal in categories of being and nonbeing self and others but the Buddha found that it was impossible to bring kamma to an end if one thought in such termsFor example narrative and cosmological modes of thinking would lead one to ask whether the agent who performed an act of kamma was the same as the person experiencing the result someone else both or neitherIf one answered that it was the same person then the person experiencing the result would have to identify not only with the actor but also with the mode of action and thus would not be able to gain release from itIf one answered that it was another person both oneself and another or neither then the person experiencing the result would see no need to heighten the skill or understanding of hisher own kamma in the present for the experience of pleasure and pain was not his or her own full responsibilityIn either case the development of the fourth type of kamma would be abortedTo avoid the drawbacks of the narrative and cosmological mindsets the Buddha pursued an entirely different tack  what he called entry into emptiness and what modern philosophy calls radical phenomenology a focus on the events of present consciousness in and of themselves without reference to questions of whether there are any entities underlying those eventsIn the Buddhas case he focused simply on the process of kammic cause and result as it played itself out in the immediate present in the process of developing the skillfulness of the mind without reference to who or what lay behind those processesOn the most basic level of this mode of awareness there was no sense even of existence or nonexistence but simply the events of stress its origination its cessation and the path to its cessation arising and passing awayThrough this mode he was able to pursue the fourth type of kamma to its end at the same time gaining heightened insight into the nature of action itself and its many implications including questions of rebirth the relationship of mental to physical events and the way kamma constructs all experience of the cosmosBecause the Buddha gained both understanding of and release from kamma by pursuing the phenomenological mode of attention his fulldress systematic analysis of kamma is also expressed in that modeThis analysis is included in his teachings on thisthat conditionality dependent coarising and the four noble truths the three levels of refinement in the type of right view without effluents that underlay his mastery of the fourth type of kammaHere we will consider in turn how each of these teachings shaped the Buddhas teachings on kamma how the knowledge of Unbinding confirmed those teachings and how the success of the phenomenological mode of analysis shaped the Buddhas use of narrative and cosmological modes in instructing othersWe will conclude with a discussion of how these points show the need for conviction in the principle of kamma as a working hypothesis for anyone who wants to gain release from suffering and stressTo begin with thisthat conditionality This principle accounts not only for the complexity of the kammic process but also for its being regular without at the same time being rigidly deterministicThe nonlinearity of thisthat conditionality also accounts for the fact that the process can be successfully dismantled by radical attention to the present momentUnlike the theory of linear causality  which led the Vedists and Jains to see the relationship between an act and its result as predictable and titfortat  the principle of thisthat conditionality makes that relationship inherently complexThe results of kamma experienced at any one point in time come not only from past kamma but also from present kammaThis means that although there are general patterns relating habitual acts to corresponding results there is no set oneforone titfortat relationship between a particular action and its resultsInstead the results are determined by the context of the act both in terms of actions that preceded or followed it and in terms ones state of mind at the time of acting or experiencing the resultAs we noted in the Introduction the feedback loops inherent in thisthat conditionality mean that the working out of any particular causeeffect relationship can be very complex indeedThis explains why the Buddha says in  that the results of kamma are imponderableOnly a person who has developed the mental range of a Buddha  another imponderable itself  would be able to trace the intricacies of the kammic networkThe basic premise of kamma is simple  that skillful intentions lead to favorable results and unskillful ones to unfavorable results  but the process by which those results work themselves out is so intricate that it cannot be fully mappedWe can compare this with the Mandelbrot set a mathematical set generated by a simple equation but whose graph is so complex that it will probably never be completely exploredAlthough the precise working out of the kammic process is somewhat unpredictable it is not chaoticThe relationship between kammic causes and their effects is entirely regular when an action is of the sort that it will be felt in such and such a way that is how its result will be experiencedSkillful intentions lead to favorable results unskillful ones to unfavorable resultsThus when one participates in the kammic process one is at the mercy of a pattern that ones actions put into motion but that is not entirely under ones present controlDespite the power of the mind one cannot reshape the basic laws of cosmic causality at whimThese laws include the physical laws within which ones kamma must ripen and work itself outThis is the point of passage  in which the Buddha explains that present pain can be explained not only by past kamma but also by a host of other factors the list of alternative factors he gives comes straight from the various causes for pain that were recognized in the medical treatises of his timeIf we compare this list with his definition of old kamma in  we see that many if not all of the alternative causes are actually the result of past actionsThe point here is that old kamma does not override other causal factors operating in the universe  such as those recognized by the physical sciences  but instead finds its expression within themHowever the fact that the kammic process relies on input from the present moment means that it is not totally deterministicInput from the past may place restrictions on what can be done and known in any particular moment but the allowance for new input from the present provides some room for free willThis allowance also opens the possibility for escape from the cycle of kamma altogether by means of the fourth type of kamma the development of heightened skillfulness through the pursuit of the seven factors for Awakening and the noble eightfold path  and by extension all of the Wings to AwakeningThe nonlinearity of thisthat conditionality explains why heightened skillfulness when focused on the present moment can succeed in leading to the end of the kamma that has formed the experience of the entire cosmosAll nonlinear processes exhibit what is called scale invariance which means that the behavior of the process on any one scale is similar to its behavior on smaller or larger scalesTo understand say the largescale pattern of a particular nonlinear process one need only focus on its behavior on a smaller scale that is easier to observe and one will see the same pattern at workIn the case of kamma one need only focus on the process of kamma in the immediate present in the course of developing heightened skillfulness and the largescale issues over the expanses of space and time will become clear as one gains release from themThe teaching on dependent coarising helps to provide more detailed instructions on this point showing precisely where the cycle of kamma provides openings for more skillful present inputIn doing so it both explains the importance of the act of attention in developing the fourth type of kamma and acts as a guide for focusing attention on present experience in appropriate waysDependent coarising shows how the cosmos when viewed in the context of how it is directly experienced by a person developing skillfulness is subsumed entirely under factors that are immediately present to awareness the five aggregates of form feeling perception mental fabrication and consciousness and the six sense mediaIncluded in this description is the Buddhas ultimate analysis of kamma and rebirthThe nexus of kamma clinging becoming and birth accounts for the realm in which birth takes place whereas the nexus of nameandform with consciousness accounts for the arising and survival of the kammically active organism within that realmAlso included in dependent coarising is a detailed analysis of the way in which kamma can  but does not necessarily have to  lead to bondage to the cycle of rebirthUnlike the Jains the Buddha taught that this bondage was mental rather than physicalIt was caused not by sticky substances created by the physical violence of an act but by the fact that when there is ignorance of the four noble truths the feeling that results from kamma gives rise to craving clinging and becoming and these in turn form the conditions for further kammaThus the results of action in the presence of ignorance breed the conditions for more action creating feedback loops that keep the kammic processes in motionFor this reason the Buddha defined the effluents as clinging  expressed in some lists as sensuality in others as sensuality and views  together with becoming and the ignorance that underlies them allIf ignorance of the four truths can be ended however feeling does not form a condition for craving or clinging and thus there is no becoming to provide a realm for further kammaThus the mastery of the fourth type of kamma requires discernment of the four noble truthsIt is important to note that dependent coarising makes no statements as to the existence or lack of existence of any entity to which these events pertain or to whom they belongAs we noted above such terms of analysis as being nonbeing self or other pertain properly to the modes of cosmology and personal narrative and have no place in a radically phenomenological analysisQuestions and terms that derive from the conventions of narrative and the construction of a worldview have no place in the direct awareness of experience in and of itselfThis is one reason why people who have not mastered the path of practice and who thus function primarily in terms of a worldview or a sense of their own personal story find the teaching of dependent coarising so inscrutableEven though the Buddhas phenomenological approach answered his questions as to the nature of kamma it also reshaped his questions so that they had little in common with the questions that most people bring to the practiceAs with all insights gained on the phenomenological level dependent coarising is expressed in terms closest to the actual experience of eventsOnly when a person has become thoroughly familiar with that level of experience is the analysis fully intelligibleThus although the detailed nature of dependent coarising is one of its strengths it is also one of its weaknesses as a teaching tool for the subtlety and complexity of the analysis can be intimidating even to advanced practitionersFor this reason the Buddha most often expressed the right view underlying the fourth type of kamma in terms of the four noble truthsThese truths provide a more congenial entry point into the phenomenological mode of awareness for they focus the analysis of kamma directly on the question of stress and suffering issues that tie in immediately with the narratives that people make of their own life experiencesAs the Buddha noted in his second insight his memory of previous lives included his experience of pleasure and pain in each life and most people  when recounting their own lives  tend to focus on these issues as wellThe four truths however do not stop simply with tales about stress they approach it from the problemsolving perspective of a person engaged in developing a skillWhat this means for the meditator trying to master the fourth type of kamma is that these truths cannot be fully comprehended by passive observationOnly by participating sensitively in the process of developing skillfulness and gaining a practical feel for the relationship of cause and effect among the mental factors that shape that process can one eradicate the effluents that obstruct the ending of kammaThis point is underscored by a fact noted above the ignorance and craving that are needed to keep the cycle of kamma in motion are subtle forms of the roots of unskillfulnessThus only through developing skillfulness to the ultimate degree can the cycle be brought to equilibrium and as a result disbandThe truth of the Buddhas understanding of the processes of kamma  as informed by thisthat conditionality dependent coarising and the four noble truths  was proven by the knowledge of Unbinding that followed immediately on his mastery of the fourth type of kammaHe found that when skillfulness is intentionally brought to a point of full consummation as expressed in the direct awareness of thisthat conditionality it leads to a state of nonaction or nonfashioning that forms the threshold to a level of consciousness in which all experience of the cosmos has fallen awayWhen ones experience of the cosmos resumes after the experience of Awakening one sees clearly that it is composed entirely of the results of old kamma with no new kamma being added to the process all experience of the cosmos will eventually run out  or in the words of the texts will grow cold right here This discovery proved the basic premise that kamma not only plays a role in shaping experience of the cosmos it plays the primary roleIf this were not so then even when kamma was ended there would still remain the types of experience that came from other sourcesBut because no experience of the cosmos remained when all present kamma disbanded and none would resume after all old kamma ran out kamma would have to be the necessary factor accounting for all such experienceThis fact implies that even the limiting factors that one encounters in terms of sights sounds etc are actually the fruit of past kamma in thought word and deed  committed not only in this but also in many preceding lifetimesThus even though the Buddhas development of the fourth type of kamma focused on the present moment the resulting Awakening gave insights that encompassed not only the present but also all of timeHaving used the phenomenological mode to solve the problem of kamma and reach Unbinding however the Buddha was not limited to that modeAfter his Awakening he was free to return at will to the narrative and cosmological modes of thought and speech without being caught up in their presuppositionsFor most people he found even the four noble truths were too alien to form an entry point into the teachingThus he had to use the narrative and cosmological modes of discourse to bring such people step by step to the point where they were ready to comprehend those truthsWhat he had learned in the final stage of his Awakening did not negate the validity of the first and second insights into kamma and rebirth instead it perfected themThe main change that the experience of Awakening made in his view of personal narrative and cosmology is that it opened them both to the dimension of releaseThe drama of kamma in the cosmos is not a closed cycle the principles of kamma can be mastered to the point where they open to the way out just as the gravity of the sun and earth could bring the moon to a point of resonance where it is freed from their powerThe narrative of a persons course through the cosmos is not doomed to aimless and endlessly repeated death and rebirth the person can tread the path of practice to Unbinding and so bring the narrative to an endThus the Buddha used narrative and cosmological explanations to persuade his listeners to explore the phenomenology of skillful action so that they too might gain release his descriptions of the role of action in shaping the vast expanses of space time and existence was designed to focus the listeners attention on the liberating potential of what heshe was doing in the here and nowSome of his most poignant teachings are narratives devoted to just this purposeWhat do you think monksWhich is greater the tears you have shed while transmigrating  wandering this long time  crying  weeping from being joined with what is displeasing from being separated from what is pleasing  or the water in the four great oceans This is the greater The tears you have shed Why is thatFrom an inconceivable beginning monks comes transmigrationA beginning point is not evident although beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering onLong have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries  long enough to become disenchanted with all fabrications enough to become dispassionate enough to be releasedThe cosmological discourses  such as DN DN MN and MN  are aimed at a similar pointDN describes how the evolution and devolution of the cosmos derive from the skillful and unskillful kamma of the beings who inhabit it and ends with the admonition that one should make an island for oneself safe from the process of the ups and downs of the cosmosThis island is nothing other than the practice of the four frames of reference which as we will see in IIB are precisely the training aimed at familiarizing oneself with the phenomenology of skillful actionDN shows how kamma accounts for the evolution of human society ending with the statement that the most exalted member of society is the Arahant who has gained release through highest discernmentMN and MN give graphic descriptions of the levels of heaven and hell into which beings may be reborn after death through the power of good and bad kamma MN ending with a verse on the need to practice the path to nonclinging to escape the dangers of birth and death entirelyThus the experience of his Awakening gave a new purpose to narrative and cosmology in the Buddhas eyes they became tools for persuading his listeners to adopt the training that would lead them to the phenomenological modeThis accounts for the ad hoc and fragmentary nature of the narratives and cosmological sketches in his teachingsThey are not meant to be analyzed in a systematic wayIt is a mistake to tease out their implications to see what they may say about such metaphysical questions as the existence or lack of existence of entities or identities underlying the process of kamma and rebirth the relationship between the laws of kamma and the laws of the physical sciences or the nature of the mechanism by which kamma makes its results felt over timeThe search for systematic answers to such issues is not only invalid or irrelevant from the Buddhist point of view it is actually counterproductive in that it blocks one from entering the path to releaseAnd we should note none of the modes of discourse  narrative cosmological or phenomenological  is capable of describing or even framing proper questions about what happens after Awakening for such issues which lie beyond the conditions of time and the present cannot be properly expressed by the conventions of language and analysis which are bound by those conditionsOnly a person who has mastered the skill of release has the mental skills needed to comprehend such mattersThe Buddha reserved his systematic explanations for the particular phenomenological mode to be used in viewing the process of kamma in its own terms as it is being mastered so that the actual problem of kamma and its retribution will be solvedThe right way to listen to the narratives and cosmological sketches then is to see what they imply about ones own need to master the kammic process on the level of awareness in and of itselfFrom these points it should become clear why kamma as an article of faith is a necessary factor in the path of Buddhist practiceThe teaching on kamma in its narrative and cosmological forms provides the context for the practice giving it direction and urgencyBecause the cosmos is governed by the laws of kamma those laws provide the only mechanism by which happiness can be foundBut because good and bad kamma consisting of good and bad intentions simply perpetuate the ups and downs of experience in the cosmos a way must be found out of the mechanism of kamma by mastering it in a way that allows it to disband in an attentive state of nonintentionAnd because there is no telling what sudden surprises the results of ones past kamma may still hold in store one should try to develop that mastery as quickly as possibleIn its phenomenological mode the teaching on kamma accounts for the focus and the terms of analysis used in the practiceIt also accounts for the mental qualities needed to attain and maintain that level of focus and analysisIn terms of focus the principle of scale invariance at work in the complexities of kamma means that their essential processes can be mastered by focusing total attention on them right at the mind in the immediate presentThis focus accounts for the practice of framesofreference meditation in which attention is directed at present phenomena in and of themselvesThese phenomena are then analyzed in terms of the four noble truths the phenomenological terms in which appropriate attention and discernment direct and observe the experience of developing the qualities of skillful actionThe most immediate skillful kamma that can be observed on this level is the mastery of the very same mental qualities that are supporting this refined level of focus and analysis mindfulness concentration and discernment together with the more basic qualities on which they are basedThus these mental qualities act not only as supports to the focus and analysis but also as their objectUltimately discernment becomes so refined that the focus and analysis take as their object the act of focusing and analyzing in and of themselvesThe cycle of action then shortcircuits as it reaches culmination and Unbinding occursThese elements of focus analysis and mental qualities together with the dynamic of their development to a point of culmination are covered by the teachings on the Wings to Awakening discussed in detail in Parts II and Thus the Wings can be viewed as a direct expression of the role of skillful kamma in the path to releaseIt is entirely possible that a person with no firm conviction in the principle of kamma can follow parts of the Buddhist path including mindfulness and concentration practices and gain positive results from themFor instance one can pursue mindfulness practice for the sense of balance equanimity and peace it gives to ones daily life or for the sake of bringing the mind to the present for the purpose of spontaneity and going with the flow The full practice of the path however is a skillful diverting of the flow of the mind from its habitual kammic streams to the stream of UnbindingAs the Buddha said this practice requires a willingness to develop and abandon to an extreme degreeThe developing requires a supreme effort aimed at full and conscious mastery of mindfulness concentration and discernment to the point of nonfashioning and on to releaseA lack of conviction in the principle of kamma would undercut the patience and commitment the desire persistence intent and refined powers of discrimination needed to pursue concentration and discernment to the most heightened levels beyond what is needed for a general sense of peace or spontaneityThe abandoning involves uprooting the most deeply buried forms of clinging and attachment that keep one bound to the cycle of rebirthSome of these forms of clinging  such as views and theories about selfidentity  are so entrenched in the narrative and cosmological modes in which most people function that only firm conviction in the benefits to be had by abandoning them will be able to pry them looseThis is why the Buddha insisted repeatedly  and we will have occasion to return to this theme at several points in this book  that conviction in the fact of his Awakening necessarily involves conviction in the principle of kamma and that both forms of conviction are needed for the full mastery of the kamma of heightened skillfulness leading to releaseThe Canon contains many wellknown passages where the Buddha asks his listeners not to accept his teachings simply on faith but these remarks were directed to people just beginning the practiceSuch people need only accept the general principles of skillful action on a trial basis focusing on the input of their actions into the causal system at the present moment and exploring the connection between skillful intentions and favorable resultsThe more complex issues of kamma come into play at this level only in forcing one to be patient with the practiceMany times skillful intentions do not produce their favorable results immediately aside from the sense of wellbeing  sometimes clearly perceptible sometimes barely  that comes with acting skillfullyWere it not for this delay the principle of kamma would be selfevident no one would dare act on unskillful intentions and there would be no need to take the principle on faithAs we noted in the Introduction the complexity of thisthat conditionality is the major cause for the confusion and lack of skill with which most people live their livesThe ability to master this process takes timeAs one progresses further on the path however  and as the process of developing skillfulness in and of itself comes more and more to take center stage in ones awareness  the actual results of developing skillfulness should give greater and greater reason for conviction in the principle of kammaExcept in cases where people fall into the trap of heedlessness or complacency these results can spur and inspire one to hold to the principle of kamma with the increasing levels of firmness focus and refinement needed for AwakeningBeings are owners of kamma heir to kamma born of kamma related through kamma and have kamma as their arbitratorKamma is what creates distinctions among beings in terms of coarseness

person takes life holds wrong views on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the good destinations in the heavenly worldAnd there is the case where a certain person abstains from taking life abstains from taking what is not given is not covetous does not have a hostile mind  holds right viewsOn the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the good destinations in the heavenly

of the body after death he reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellIn the case of the person who takes life on the breakup of the body after death reappears in the good destinations in the heavenly world either earlier he performed fine kamma that is to be felt as pleasant or later he performed fine kamma that is to be felt as pleasant or at the time of death he acquired  adopted right viewsBecause of that on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the good destinations in the heavenly worldBut as for the results of taking life holding wrong views he will feel them either right here  now or later or following thatIn the case of the person who abstains from taking life on the breakup of the body after death reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell either earlier he performed evil kamma that is to be felt as painful or later he performed evil kamma that is to be felt as painful or at the time of death he acquired  adopted wrong viewsBecause of that on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut as for the results of abstaining from taking life holding right views he will feel them either right here  now or later or following thatThese four imponderables are not to be speculated aboutWhoever speculates

is not to be speculated aboutWhoever speculates about these things would go mad  experience vexationThe Buddha For anyone who says In whatever way a person makes kamma that is how it is experienced there is no living of the holy life there is no opportunity for the right ending of stressBut for anyone who says When a person makes kamma to be felt in such  such a way that is how its result is experienced there is the living of the holy life there is the opportunity for the right ending of stressThere is the case where a trifling evil act done by a certain individual takes him to hellThere

fabricates an injurious bodily fabrication an injurious verbal fabrication an injurious mental fabrication He rearises in an injurious world where he is touched by injurious contacts He experiences feelings that are exclusively painful like those of the beings in hellThis is called kamma that is black with black resultAnd what is kamma that is white with white resultThere is the case where a certain person fabricates an uninjurious bodily fabrication an uninjurious verbal fabrication an uninjurious mental fabrication He rearises in an uninjurious world where he is touched by uninjurious

important oneSadly its only when people are face to face with a fatal illness that they start thinking about these issues and often by that point its too late to get fully preparedAlthough todays conference centers around what medicine can do for AIDS we shouldnt be complacentEven if AIDS or its adventitious infections dont get you something else will so its best to be prepared to practice the skills youll need when medicine  Chinese Western or whatever  can no longer help you and youre on your ownAs far as Ive been able to determine the only way to develop these skills is to train the mindAt the same time if you are caring for someone with a fatal disease meditation offers you one of the best ways to restore your own spiritual and emotional batteries so that you can keep going even when things are toughA lot has appeared in the media  books newspapers magazines TV  about the role of meditation in treating illness and emotional burnoutAs usually happens when the media get hold of a topic they have tended to over or underestimate what meditation is and what it can do for youThis is typical of the mediaListening to them is like listening to a car salesmanHe doesnt have to know how to drive the car or care for itHis only responsibility is to point out its selling points what he thinks he can get you to believe and shell out your money forBut if youre actually going to drive the car you have to study the owners manualSo thats what Id like to present today a users manual for meditation to help you when the chips are downIve had a fair amount of firsthand experience in this areaThe year before I left Thailand I was stricken with malaria  a very different sort of disease from AIDS but still the number one killer in the worldAt present every year more people die of malaria than any other disease this in spite of the massive WHO campaign to wipe it out back in the sHuge supplies of chloroquine were handed out to Third World villagersSwamps and homes were sprayed with lethal doses of DDT to kill off the mosquitoesBut now new strains of the malaria parasite have developed for which Western medicine has no cure the mosquitoes have become resistant to DDT and the malaria death rate is back on the riseRemember this when you think of pinning your hopes on NIH or the Salk Institute to come up with a cure or vaccine for AIDSI was fortunateAs you can see I survived but only after turning to traditional medicine when the best treatment that tropical disease specialists could offer me failedAt the same time while I was sick I was able to fall back on the meditation I had been practicing for the past several years to help get me through the worst bouts of pain and disorientationThis is what convinced me of its value in cases like thisIn addition to my own experience Ive been acquainted with a number of meditators both here and in Thailand who have had to live with cancer and other serious illnesses and from them I have learned how the meditation helped them to handle both the illness and the cures  which are often more dreadful than the cancer itselfIll be drawing on their experiences in the course of this talkBut first Id like us all to sit in meditation for a few minutes so that you can have a firsthand taste of what Im talking about and so you can have a little practical experience to build on when you go back homeThe technique Ill be teaching is breath meditationIts a good topic no matter what your religious backgroundAs my teacher once said the breath doesnt belong to Buddhism or Christianity or anyone at allIts common property that anyone can meditate onAt the same time of all the meditation topics there are its probably the most beneficial to the body for when were dealing with the breath were dealing not only with the air coming in and out of the lungs but also with all the feelings of energy that course throughout the body with each breathIf you can learn to become sensitive to these feelings and let them flow smoothly and unobstructed you can help the body function more easily and give the mind a handle for dealing with painSo lets all meditate for a few minutesSit comfortably erect in a balanced positionYou dont have to be ramrod straight like a soldierJust try not to lean forward or back to the left or the rightClose your eyes and say to yourself May I be truly happy and free from suffering This may sound like a strange even selfish way to start meditating but there are good reasons for itOne if you cant wish for your own happiness there is no way that you can honestly wish for the happiness of othersSome people need to remind themselves constantly that they deserve happiness  we all deserve it but if we dont believe it we will constantly find ways to punish ourselves and we will end up punishing others in subtle or blatant ways as wellTwo its important to reflect on what true happiness is and where it can be foundA moments reflection will show that you cant find it in the past or the futureThe past is gone and your memory of it is undependableThe future is a blank uncertaintySo the only place we can really find happiness is in the presentBut even here you have to know where to lookIf you try to base your happiness on things that change  sights sounds sensations in general people and things outside  youre setting yourself up for disappointment like building your house on a cliff where there have been repeated landslides in the pastSo true happiness has to be sought withinMeditation is thus like a treasure hunt to find what has solid and unchanging worth in the mind something that even death cannot touchTo find this treasure we need toolsThe first tool is to do what were doing right now to develop good will for ourselvesThe second is to spread that good will to other living beingsTell yourself All living beings no matter who they are no matter what they have done to you in the past  may they all find true happiness too If you dont cultivate this thought and instead carry grudges into your meditation thats all youll be able to see when you look insideOnly when you have cleared the mind in this way and set outside matters aside are you ready to focus on the breathBring your attention to the sensation of breathingBreathe in long and out long for a couple of times focusing on any spot in the body where the breathing is easy to notice and your mind feels comfortable focusingThis could be at the nose at the chest at the abdomen or any spot at allStay with that spot noticing how it feels as you breathe in and outDont force the breath or bear down too heavily with your focusLet the breath flow naturally and simply keep track of how it feelsSavor it as if it were an exquisite sensation you wanted to prolongIf your mind wanders off simply bring it backDont get discouragedIf it wanders times bring it back timesShow it that you mean business and eventually it will listen to youIf you want you can experiment with different kinds of breathingIf long breathing feels comfortable stick with itIf it doesnt change it to whatever rhythm feels soothing to the bodyYou can try short breathing fast breathing slow breathing deep breathing shallow breathing  whatever feels most comfortable to you right nowOnce you have the breath comfortable at your chosen spot move your attention to notice how the breathing feels in other parts of the bodyStart by focusing on the area just below your navelBreathe in and out and notice how that area feelsIf you dont feel any motion there just be aware of the fact that theres no motionIf you do feel motion notice the quality of the motion to see if the breathing feels uneven there or if theres any tension or tightnessIf theres tension think of relaxing itIf the breathing feels jagged or uneven think of smoothing it out Now move your attention over to the right of that spot  to the lower righthand corner of the abdomen  and repeat the same process Then over to the lower lefthand corner of the abdomen Then up to the navel right left to the solar plexus right left the middle of the chest right left to the base of the throat right left to the middle of the head If you were meditating at home you could continue this process through your entire body  over the head down the back out the arms  legs to the tips of your finger  toes  but since our time is limited Ill ask you to return your focus now to any one of the spots weve already coveredLet your attention settle comfortably there and then let your conscious awareness spread to fill the entire body from the head down to the toes so that youre like a spider sitting in the middle of a web Its sitting in one spot but its sensitive to the entire webKeep your awareness expanded like this  you have to work at this for its tendency will be to shrink to a single spot  and think of the breath coming in  out your entire body through every poreLet your awareness simply stay right there for a while  theres no where else you have to go nothing else you have to think about And then gently come out of meditationAfter my talk well have time to answer any questions you may have but right now Id like to return to a point I made earlier the ways meditation and its role in dealing with illness and death tend to be under and overestimated for only when you have a proper estimation of your tools can you put them to use in a precise and beneficial wayIll divide my remarks into two areas what meditation is and what it can do for youFirst what meditation is This is an area where popular conceptions tend to underestimate itBooks that deal with meditation in treating illness tend to focus on only two aspects of meditation as if that were all it had to offerThose two aspects are relaxation and visualizationIts true that these two processes form the beginning stages of meditation  you probably found our session just now very relaxing and may have done some visualization when you thought of the breath coursing through the body  but theres more to meditation than just thatThe great meditators in human history did more than simply master the relaxation responseMeditation as a complete process involves three stepsThe first is mindful relaxation making the mind comfortable in the present  for only when it feels comfortable in the present can it settle down and stay thereThe important word in this description though is mindfulYou have to be fully aware of what youre doing of whether or not the mind is staying with its object and of whether or not its drifting off to sleepIf you simply relax and drift off thats not meditation and theres nothing you can build on itIf however you can remain fully aware as the mind settles comfortably into the present that develops into the next stepAs the mind settles more and more solidly into the present it gains strengthYou feel as if all the scattered fragments of your attention  worrying about this remembering that anticipating whatever  come gathering together and the mind takes on a sense of wholeness and unificationThis gives the mind a sense of powerAs you let this sense of wholeness develop you find that it becomes more and more solid in all your activities regardless of whether youre formally meditating or not and this is what leads to the third stepAs you become more and more singleminded in protecting this sense of wholeness you become more and more sensitive and gain more and more insight into the things that can knock it off balanceOn the first level you notice that if you do anything hurtful to yourself or others that destroys itThen you start noticing how the simple occurrence in the mind of such things as greed lust anger delusion and fear can also knock it off balanceYou begin to discern ways to reduce the power that these things have over the mind until you can reach a level of awareness that is untouched by these things  or by anything at all  and you can be free from themAs I will show in a few moments its these higher stages in meditation that can be the most beneficialIf you practice meditation simply as a form of relaxation thats okay for dealing with the element of your disease that comes from stress but theres a lot more going on in AIDS physically and mentally than simply stress and if you limit yourself to relaxation or visualization youre not getting the full benefits that meditation has to offerNow we come to the topic of what meditation can do for you as you face serious illness and deathThis is an area where the media engage both in overestimation and underestimationOn the one hand there are books that tell you that all illness comes from your mind and you simply have to straighten out your mind and youll get wellOnce a young woman about suffering from lung cancer came to visit my monastery and she asked me what I thought of these booksI told her that there are some cases where illness comes from purely mental causes in which case meditation can cure it but there are also cases where it comes from physical causes and no amount of meditation can make it go awayIf you believe in karma there are some diseases that come from present karma  your state of mind right now  and others that come from past karmaIf its a presentkarma disease meditation might be able to make it go awayIf its a pastkarma disease the most you can hope from meditation is that it can help you live with the illness and pain without suffering from itAt the same time if you tell ill people that they are suffering because their minds are in bad shape and that its entirely up to them to straighten out their minds if they want to get well youre laying an awfully heavy burden on them right at the time when theyre feeling weak miserable helpless and abandoned to begin withWhen I came to this point the woman smiled and said that she agreed with meAs soon as she had been diagnosed with cancer her friends had given her a whole slew of books on how to will illness away and she said that if she had believed in bookburning she would have burned them all by nowI personally know a lot of people who believe that the state of their health is an indication of their state of mind which is fine and good when theyre feeling wellAs soon as they get sick though they feel that its a sign that theyre failures in meditation and this sets them into a tailspinYou should be very clear on one point The purpose of meditation is to find happiness and wellbeing within the mind independent of the body or other things going on outsideYour aim is to find something solid within that you can depend on no matter what happens to the bodyIf it so happens that through your meditation you are able to effect a physical cure thats all fine and good and there have been many cases where meditation can have a remarkable effect on the bodyMy teacher had a student  a woman in her fifties  who was diagnosed with cancer more than years agoThe doctors at the time gave her only a few months to live and yet through her practice of meditation she is still alive todayShe focused her practice on the theme that although her body may be sick her mind doesnt have to be A few years ago I visited her in the hospital the day after she had had a kidney removedShe was sitting up in bed bright and aware as if nothing happened at allI asked her if there was any pain and she said yes hours a day but that she didnt let it make inroads on her mindIn fact she was taking her illness much better than her husband who didnt meditate and who was so concerned about the possibility of losing her that he became ill and she had to take care of himCases like this are by no means guaranteed though and you shouldnt really content yourself just with physical survival  for as I said earlier if this disease doesnt get you something else will and youre not really safe until youve found the treasure in the mind that is unaffected even by deathRemember that your most precious possession is your mindIf you can keep it in good shape no matter what else happens around you then you have lost nothing for your body goes only as far as death but your mind goes beyond itSo in examining what meditation can do for you you should focus more on how it can help you to maintain your peace of mind in the face of pain aging illness and death for these are things youre going to have to face someday no matter whatActually they are a normal part of life although we have come to regard them as abnormalitiesWeve been taught that our birthright is eternal youth health and beautyWhen these things betray us we feel that something is horribly wrong and that someone is at fault  either ourselves or othersActually though theres no one at faultOnce we are born there is no way that aging illness and death cant happenOnly when we accept them as inevitable can we begin to deal with them intelligently in such a way that we wont suffer from themLook around youThe people who try hardest to deny their aging  through exercise diet surgery makeup whatever  they are the ones who suffer most from agingThe same holds true with illness and deathSo now I would like to focus on how to use meditation to face these things and transcend themFirst painWhen it happens you first have to accept that its thereThis in itself is a major step since most people when they encounter pain try to deny it its right to existThey think they can avoid it by pushing it away but thats like trying to avoid paying taxes by throwing away your tax return You may get away with it for a little while but then the authorities are bound to catch on and youll be worse off than you were beforeSo the way to transcend pain is first to understand it to get acquainted with it and this means enduring itHowever meditation can offer a way of detaching yourself from the pain while you are living with it so even though its there you dont have to suffer from itFirst if you master the technique of focusing on the breath and adjusting it so that its comfortable you find that you can choose where to focus your awareness in the bodyIf you want you can focus it on the pain but in the earlier stages its best to focus on the parts of the body that are comfortableLet the pain have the other partYoure not going to drive it out but at the same time you dont have to move in with itSimply regard it as a fact of nature an event that is happening but not necessarily happening to youAnother technique is to breathe through the painIf you can become sensitive to the breath sensations that course through the body each time you breathe you will notice that you tend to build a tense shell around the pain where the energy in the body doesnt flow freelyThis although its a kind of avoidance technique actually increases the painSo think of the breath flowing right through the pain as you breathe in and out to dissolve away this shell of tensionIn most cases you will find that this can relieve the pain considerablyFor instance when I had malaria I found this very useful in relieving the mass of tension that would gather in my head and shouldersAt times it would get so great that I could scarcely breath so I just thought of the breath coming in through all the nerve centers in my body  the middle of the chest the throat the middle of the forehead and so forth  and the tension would dissolve awayHowever there are some people though who find that breathing through the pain increases the pain which is a sign that they are focusing improperlyThe solution in that case is to focus on the opposite side of the bodyIn other words if the pain is in the right side focus on the leftIf its in front focus on the backIf its in your head  literally  focus on your hands and feetAs your powers of concentration become stronger and more settled you can begin analyzing the painThe first step is to divide it into its physical and mental componentsDistinguish between the actual physical pain and the mental pain that comes along with it The sense of being persecuted  justly or unjustly  the fear that the pain may grow stronger or signal the end whateverThen remind yourself that you dont have to side with those thoughtsIf the mind is going to think them you dont have to fall in with themThen when you stop feeding them youll find that after a while theyll begin to go away just like a crazy person coming to talk with youIf you talk with the crazy person after a while youll go crazy tooIf however you let the crazy person chatter away but dont join in the conversation after a while the crazy person will leave you aloneIts the same with all the garbage thoughts in your mindAs you strip away all the mental paraphernalia surrounding your pain  including the idea that the pain is yours or is happening to you  you find that you finally come down to the label that simply says This is a pain and its right thereWhen you can get past this thats when your meditation undergoes a breakthroughOne way is to simply notice that this label will arise and then pass awayWhen it comes it increases the painWhen it goes the pain subsidesThen try to see that the body the pain and your awareness are all three separate things  like three pieces of string that have been tied into a knot but which you now untieWhen you can do this you find that there is no pain that you cannot endureAnother area where meditation can help you is to live with the simple fact of your body being illFor some people accepting this fact is one of the hardest parts of illnessBut once you have developed a solid center in your mind you can base your happiness there and begin to view illness with a lot more equanimityWe have to remember that illness is not cheating us out of anythingIts simply a part of lifeAs I said earlier illness is normal health is miracleThe idea of all the complex systems of the body functioning properly is so improbable that we shouldnt be surprised when they start breaking downMany people complain that the hardest part of living with a disease like AIDS or cancer is the feeling that they have lost control over their bodies but once you gain more control over you mind you begin to see that the control you thought you had over you body was illusory in the first placeThe body has never entered into an agreement with you that it would do as you likedYou simply moved in forced it to eat walk talk etc and then thought you were in chargeBut even then it kept on doing as it liked  getting hungry urinating defecating passing wind falling down getting injured getting sick growing oldWhen you reflect on the people who think they have the most control over their bodies like bodybuilders theyre really the most enslaved having to eat enough each day to keep ten Somalians alive having to push and pull on metal bars for hours expending all their energy on exercises that dont go anywhere at allIf they dont their pumpedup bodies will deflate in no time flatSo an important function of meditation  in giving you a solid center that provides you a vantage point from which to view life in its true colors  is that it keeps you from feeling threatened or surprised when the body begins to reassert its independenceEven if the brain starts to malfunction the people who have developed mindfulness through meditation can be aware of the fact and let go of that part of their bodies tooOne of my teachers students had to undergo heart surgery and apparently the doctors cut off one of the main arteries going to his brainWhen he came to he could tell that his brain wasnt working right and it wasnt long before he realized that it was affecting his perception of thingsFor instance he would think that he had said something to his wife would get upset when she didnt respond when actually he had only thought of what he wanted to say without really saying anything at allWhen he realized what was happening he was able to muster enough mindfulness to keep calm and simply watch what was going on in his brain reminding himself that it was a tool that wasnt working quite right and not getting upset when things didnt jiveGradually he was able to regain his normal use of his faculties and as he told me it was fascinating to be able to observe the functioning and malfunctioning of his brain and to realize that the brain and the mind were two separate thingsAnd finally we come to the topic of deathAs I said earlier one of the important stages of meditation is when you discover within the mind a knowing core that does not die at the death of the bodyIf you can reach this point in your meditation then death poses no problem at allEven if you havent reached that point you can prepare yourself for death in such a way that you can die skillfully and not in the messy way that most people dieWhen death comes all sorts of thoughts are going to come crowding into your mind  regret about things you havent yet been able to do regret about things you did do memories of people you have loved and will have to leaveI was once almost electrocuted and although people who saw it happening said that it was only a few seconds before the current was cut off to me it felt like five minutesMany things went through my mind in that period beginning with the thought that I was going to die of my own stupidityThen I made up my mind that if the time had come to go Id better do it right so I didnt let my mind fasten on any of the feelings of regret etc that came flooding through the mindI seemed to be doing OK and then the current ceasedIf you havent been practicing meditation this sort of experience can be overwhelming and the mind will latch on to whatever offers itself and then will get carried away in that directionIf though you have practiced meditation becoming skillful at letting go of your thoughts or knowing which thoughts to hang onto and which ones to let pass youll be able to handle the situation refusing to fall in line with any mental states that arent of the highest qualityIf your concentration is firm you can make this the ultimate test of the skill you have been developingIf theres pain you can see which will disappear first the pain or the core of your awarenessYou can rest assured that no matter what the pain will go first for that core of awareness cannot dieWhat all this boils down to is that as long as you are able to survive meditation will improve the quality of your life so that you can view pain and illness with equanimity and learn from themWhen the time comes to go when the doctors have to throw up their hands in helplessness the skill you have been developing in your meditation is the one thing that wont abandon youIt will enable to handle your death with finesseEven though we dont like to think about it death is going to come no matter what so we should learn how to stare it downRemember that a death well handled is one of the surest signs of a life well livedSo far Ive been confining my remarks to the problems faced by people with AIDS and other life threatening illnesses and havent directly addressed the problems of people caring for themStill you should have been able to gather some useful points for handling such problemsMeditation offers you a place to rest and gather your energiesIt also can help give you the detachment to view your role in the proper lightWhen an ill person relapses or dies its not a sign of failure on the part of the people caring for himYour duty as long as your patient is able to survive is to do what you can to improve the quality of hisher lifeWhen the time comes for the patient to go your duty is to help improve the quality of his deathAn old man who had been meditating for many years once came to say farewell to my teacher soon after he had learned that he had an advanced case of cancerHis plan was to go home and die but my teacher told him to stay and die in the monasteryIf he went home he would hear nothing but his nieces and nephews arguing over the inheritance and it would put him in a bad frame of mindSo we arranged a place for him to stay and had his daughter who was also a meditator look after himIt wasnt long before his body systems started breaking down and on occasion it looked like the pain was beginning to overwhelm him so I had his daughter whisper meditation instructions into his ear and to chant his favorite Buddhist chants by his bedsideThis had a calming effect on him and when he did die  at amone night  he seemed calm and fully awareAs the daughter told me the next morning she didnt feel any sadness or regret for she had done her very best to make his death as smooth a transition as possibleIf you can have a situation where both the patient and the caregiver are meditators it makes things a lot easier on both sides and the death of the patient does not necessarily have to mean the death of the caregivers ability to care for anyone elseThat covers the topics I wanted to deal withIm afraid that some of you will find my remarks somewhat downbeat but my purpose has been to help you look clearly at the situation facing you either as an ill person or as someone caring for oneIf you avoid taking a good hard look at things like pain and death they can only make you suffer more since youve refused to prepare yourself for themOnly when you see them clearly get a strong sense of whats important and whats not and hold firmly to your priorities only then can you transcend themMany people find that the diagnosis of a fatal illness enables them to look at life clearly for the first time to get some sense of what their true priorities areThis in itself can make a radical improvement in the quality of their lives  its simply a shame that they had to wait to this point to see things clearlyBut whatever your situation I ask that you try to make the most of it in terms of improving the state of your mind for when all else leaves you that will stayIf you havent invested your time in developing it it wont have much to offer you in returnIf youve trained it and cared for it well it will repay you many times overAnd as I hope I have shown meditation has much to offer as a tool in helping you to solidify your state of mind and enable it to transcend everything else that may come its wayThank you for your attentionWhen you go to study meditation with any group or teacher who is experienced in a particular form of meditation you should first make your heart confident that your teacher is fully experienced in that form of meditation and be confident that the form of meditation he teaches is the right path for sureAt the same time show respect for the place in which you are to meditateOnly then should you begin practicingTeachers in the past used to require a dedication ceremony as a means of inspiring confidence before you were to study meditationThey would have you make an offering of five pairs of beeswax candles and five pairs of white flowers  this was called the five khandha  or eight pairs of beeswax candles and eight pairs of white flowers  this was called the eight khandha  or one pair of beeswax candles each weighing grams and an equal number of white flowersThen they would teach you their particular form of meditationThis ancient custom has its good pointsThere are many other ceremonies as well but I wont go into themIll mention only a very simple easytofollow ceremony a little further onOnly after you have inspired confidence in your heart as already mentioned should you go to the teacher experienced in that form of meditationIf he is experienced in repeating samma araham he will teach you to repeat samma araham samma araham samma arahamThen hell have you visualize a bright clear jewel two inches above your navel and tell you to focus your mind right there as you continue your repetition without letting your mind slip away from the jewelIn other words you take the jewel as the focal point of your mindIf you go to a teacher experienced in meditating on the rising and falling of the abdomen hell have you meditate on rising and falling and focus your mind on the different motions of the bodyFor instance when you raise your foot you think raisingWhen you place your foot you think placing and so on or else hell have you focus continually on being preoccupied with the phenomenon of arising and passing away in every motion or position of the bodyIf you go to a teacher experienced in psychic powers hell have you repeat na ma ba dha na ma ba dha and focus the mind on a single object until it takes you to see heaven and hell deities and brahmas of all sorts to the point where you get carried away with your visionsIf you go to a teacher experienced in breath meditation hell have you focus on your inandout breath and have you keep your mind firmly preoccupied with nothing but the inandout breathIf you go to a teacher experienced in meditating on buddho hell have you repeat buddho buddho buddho and have you keep the mind firmly in that meditation word until youre fully skilled at itThen hell have you contemplate buddho and what it is thats saying buddhoOnce you see that they are two separate things focus on whats saying buddhoAs for the word buddho it will disappear leaving only what it is that was saying buddhoYou then focus on what it is that was saying buddho as your objectPeople of our time  or of any time for that matter  regardless of how educated or capable they may be and especially those of us who are Buddhists Buddhism teaches causes and effects that are entirely true but why is it that we have to fall for the claims and advertisements we hear everywhereIt must be because people at present are impatient and want to see results before theyve completed the causes in line with the fact that were supposed to be in an atomic ageBuddhism teaches us to penetrate into the heart and mind which are mental phenomenaAs for the body its a physical phenomenonPhysical phenomena have to lie under the control of mental phenomenaWhen we begin to practice meditation and train the mind to be quiet and untroubled I cant see that were creating any problems at that moment for anyone at allIf we keep practicing until were skilled then well be calm and at peaceIf more and more people practice this way there will be peace and happiness all over the worldAs for the body we can train it to be peaceful only as long as the mind is in full controlThe minute mindfulness lapses the body will get back to its old affairsSo lets try training the mind by repeating buddhoBefore practicing meditation on the word buddho you should start out with the preliminary stepsIn other words inspire confidence in your mind as already mentioned and then bow down three times sayingNamo tassa bhagavato arahato sammasambuddhassaNote These preliminary steps are simply an exampleTheres nothing wrong with chanting more than this if you have more to chant but you should bow down to the Buddha as the first step each time you meditate unless the place in which youre meditating is unconduciveNow sit in meditation your right leg on top of left your hands palmup in your lap your right hand on top of your leftSit straightRepeat the word buddho in your mind focusing your attention in the middle of your chest at the heartDont let your attention stray out ahead or behindBe mindful to keep your mind in place steady in its onepointedness and youll enter into a state of concentrationWhen you enter into concentration the mind may go so blank that you dont even know how long you are sittingBy the time you come out of concentration many hours may have passedFor this reason you shouldnt fix a time limit for yourself when sitting in meditationLet things follow their own courseThe mind in true concentration is the mind in a state of onepointednessIf the mind hasnt reached a state of onepointedness it isnt yet in concentration because the true heart is only oneIf there are many mental states going on you havent penetrated into the heartYouve only reached the mindBefore you practice meditation you should first learn the difference between the heart and the mind for they arent the same thingThe mind is what thinks and forms perceptions and ideas about all sorts of thingsThe heart is what simply stays still and knows that its still without forming any further thoughts at allTheir difference is like that between a river and waves on the riverAll sciences and all defilements are able to arise because the mind thinks and forms ideas and strays out in search of themYoull be able to see these things clearly with your own heart once the mind becomes still and reaches the heartWater is something clean and clear by its very natureIf anyone puts dye into the water it will change in line with the dyeBut once the water is filtered and distilled it will become clean and clear as beforeThis is an analogy for the heart and the mindActually the Buddha taught that the mind is identical with the heartIf there is no heart there is no mindThe mind is a conditionThe heart itself has no conditionsIn practicing meditation no matter what the teacher or method If its correct itll have to penetrate into the heartWhen you reach the heart you will see all your defilements because the mind gathers all defilements into itselfSo now how you deal with them is up to youWhen doctors are going to cure a disease they first have to find the cause of the diseaseOnly then can they treat it with the right medicineAs we start meditating longer and longer repeating buddho buddho buddho the mind will gradually let go of its distractions and restlessness and gather in to stay with buddhoIt will stay firm with buddho its sole preoccupation until you see that the state of mind that says buddho is identical with the mind itself at all times regardless of whether youre sitting standing walking or lying downNo matter what your activity youll see the mind bright and clear with buddhoOnce youve reached this stage keep the mind there as long as you canDont be in a hurry to want to see this or be that  because desire is the most serious obstacle to the concentrated mindOnce desire arises your concentration will immediately deteriorate because the basis of your concentration  buddho  isnt solidWhen this happens you cant grab hold of any foundation at all and you get really upsetAll you can think of is the state of concentration in which you used to be calm and happy and this makes the mind even more agitatedPractice meditation the same way farmers grow riceTheyre in no hurryThey scatter the seed plow harrow plant the seedlings step by step without skipping any of the stepsThen they wait for the plants to growEven when they dont yet see the rice appearing theyre confident that the rice is sure to appear some day in the futureOnce the rice appears theyre convinced that theyre sure to reap resultsThey dont pull on the rice plants to make them come out with rice when they want itAnyone who did that would end up with no results at allThe same holds true with meditationYou cant be in a hurryYou cant skip any of the stepsYou have to make yourself firmly confident that This is the meditation word that will make my mind concentrated for sure Dont have any doubts as to whether the meditation word is right for your temperament and dont think that That person used this meditation word with these or those results but when I use it my mind doesnt settle downIt doesnt work for me at all Actually if the mind is firmly set on the meditation word youre repeating then no matter what the word its sure to work  because you repeat the word simply to make the mind steady and firm thats allAs for any results apart from that they all depend on each persons individual potential and capabilitiesOnce in the Buddhas time there was a monk sitting in meditation near a pond who saw a heron diving down to catch fish and eat themHe took that as his meditation subject until he succeeded in becoming an arahantIve never seen a heron eating fish mentioned as a subject in any of the meditation manuals but he was able to use it to meditate until he attained arahantship  which illustrates what Ive just saidWhen the mind is intent on staying within the bounds of its meditation word buddho with mindfulness in control its sure to grow out of its rebelliousnessWe have to train and restrain it because were looking for peace and contentment for the mindOrdinarily the mind tends to be preoccupied with looking for distraction as Ive already explained and for the most part it strays off to this sort of distraction When we start meditating buddho buddho buddho as soon as we focus the mind on buddho it wont stay thereItll run out to think of whatever work we are about to start or have left undoneIt thinks about doing this and doing that until it gets all worked up afraid that the work wont come out well or wont succeedThe work weve been assigned by other people or that were doing on our own will be a waste of time or will cause us to lose face if we dont do as weve been toldThis is one of the distractions that prevent new meditators from attaining concentrationYou have to pull your mind back to buddho buddho buddho and tell yourself Thoughts of this sort arent the path to peace the true path to peace is to keep the mind with buddho and nothing else  and then keep on repeating buddho buddho buddhoAfter a moment the mind will go straying out again this time to your family  your children your wife or husband How are they getting alongAre they healthyAre they eating wellIf youre far apart you wonder about where theyre staying what theyre eatingThose who have left home think about those at homeThose at home think about those who have gone far away  afraid that they arent safe that other people will molest them that they have no friends that theyre lonely  thinking in different ways whatever the mind can imagine all of which exaggerate the truthOr if youre still young and single you think about having fun with your friends  the places you used to go together the good times you had the things you used to do  to the point where you actually say something or laugh out loudThis sort of defilement is the worst of the bunchWhen youre meditating buddho buddho buddho your defilements see that the situation is getting out of hand and that youll escape from their control so they look for things to tie you down even more tightly all the timeNever from the day of your birth have you ever practiced concentration at allYouve simply let the mind follow the moods of the defilementsOnly now have you begun to practice so when you repeat buddho buddho buddho to get the mind to settle down with buddho its going to wriggle away in the same way that fish try to wriggle back into the water when theyre tossed up on landSo you have to pull the mind back to buddhoBuddho is something cool and calmIts the path for giving rise to peace and contentment  the only path that will release us from the suffering and stress in this worldSo you pull the mind back to buddhoThis time it begins to settle downAs soon as you feel that its staying put you begin to get a sense that when the mind stays put its rested and at ease in a way different from when its not still when its restless and upsetYou make up your mind to be careful and alert to keep the mind in that state and OopsThere it goes againNow its taking your financial interests as an excuse saying that if you dont do this or search for that youll miss out on a really great opportunitySo you focus your mind on that instead of your meditation wordAs for where buddho has gone you havent the least ideaBy the time you realize that buddho has disappeared its already too late  which is why they say that the mind is restless slippery and hard to control like a monkey that can never sit stillSometimes after youve been sitting in meditation a long time you begin to worry that your blood wont be flowing properly that your nerves will die from lack of blood that youll grow numb and end up paralyzedIf youre meditating far from home or in a forest its even worse Youre afraid that snakes will bite you tigers will eat you or ghosts will haunt you making all kinds of scary facesYour fear of death can whisper to you in all sorts of way all of which are simply instances of you yourself scaring yourselfThe truth is nothing at all like what you imagineNever from the day of your birth have you ever seen a tiger eat even a single personYouve never once seen a ghost  you dont even know what it would look like but you fashion up pictures to scare yourselfThe obstacles to meditation mentioned here are simply examplesThere are actually many many moreThose who meditate will find this out for themselvesIf you hold buddho close to the heart and use your mindfulness to keep the mind with nothing but buddho no dangers will come your waySo have firm faith in buddhoI guarantee that there will be no dangers at all  unless youve done bad kamma in the past which is something beyond anyones power to protect you fromEven the Buddha himself cant protect you from itWhen people begin meditating their confidence tends to be weakNo matter what their meditation subject these sorts of defilements are sure to interfere because these defilements form the basis of the world and of the mindThe minute we meditate and make the mind onepointed the defilements see that were going to get away from them so they come thronging around so that we wont be able to escape from the worldWhen we see how really serious and harmful they are we should make our minds forthright and our confidence solid and strong telling ourselves that weve let ourselves be deceived into believing the defilements for many lifetimes its time now that we be willing to believe the Buddhas teachings and take buddho as our refugeWe then make mindfulness solid and fix the mind firmly in buddhoWe give our lives to buddho and wont let our minds slip away from itWhen we make this sort of commitment the mind will drop straight into onepointedness and enter concentrationWhen you first enter concentration this is what its like Youll have no idea at all of what concentration or onepointedness of mind is going to feel likeYoure simply intent on keeping mindfulness firmly focused on one object  and the power of a mind focused firmly on one object is what will bring you to a state of concentrationYou wont be thinking at all that concentration will be like this or like that or that you want it to be like this or like thatIt will simply take its own way automaticallyNo one can force itAt that moment youll feel as if you are in another world with a sense of ease and solitude to which nothing else in the world can compareWhen the mind withdraws from concentration youll regret that that mood has passed and youll remember it clearlyAll that we say about concentration comes from the mind that has withdrawn from that stateAs long as its still gathered in that state we arent interested in what anyone else says or doesYou have to train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often so as to become skilled and adept but dont try to remember your past states of concentration and dont let yourself want your concentration to be like it was before  because it wont be that way and youll just be making more trouble for yourselfSimply contemplate buddho buddho and keep your mind with your mental repetitionWhat it does then is its own businessAfter the mind has first attained to concentration it wont be the same way the next time around but dont worry about itWhatever its like dont worry about itJust make sure that you get it centeredWhen the results come out in many different ways your understanding will broaden and youll come to develop many different techniques for dealing with the mindWhat Ive mentioned here is simply to be taken as an exampleWhen you follow these instructions dont give them too much weight or they will turn into allusions to the past and your meditation wont get anywhereSimply remember them as something to use for the sake of comparison after your meditation has begun to progressNo matter what method you use  buddho rising  falling or samma araham  when the mind is about to settle down in concentration you wont be thinking that the mind is about to settle down or is settling down or anything at allItll settle down automatically on its ownYou wont even know when you let go of your meditation wordThe mind will simply have a separate calm and peace that isnt in this world or another world or anything of the sortTheres no one and nothing at all just the minds own separate state which is called the world of the mindIn that state there wont be the word world or anything elseThe conventional realities of the world wont appear there and so no insight of any sort will arise in there at allThe point is simply that you train the mind to be centered and then compare it to the state of mind that isnt centered so that you can see how they differ how the mind that has attained concentration and then withdraws to contemplate matters of the world and the Dhamma differs from the mind that hasnt attained concentrationThe heart and the mindLets talk some more about the heart and mind so that youll understandAfter all were talking about training the mind in concentration If you dont understand the relationship between the heart and the mind you wont know where or how to practice concentrationEveryone born  human or animal  has a heart and mind but the heart and mind have different dutiesThe mind thinks wanders and forms ideas of all sorts in line with where the defilements lead itAs for the heart its simply what knowsIt doesnt form any ideas at allIts neutral  in the middle  with regard to everythingThe awareness thats neutral Thats the heartThe heart doesnt have a bodyIts a mental phenomenonIts simply awarenessYou can place it anywhere at allIt doesnt lie inside or outside the bodyWhen we call the heartmuscle the heart thats not the true heartIts simply an organ for pumping blood throughout the body so as to keep it aliveIf the heartmuscle doesnt pump blood throughout the body life cant lastPeople in general are always talking about the heart My heart feels happy sad heavy light down Everything is a matter of the heartAbhidhamma experts however speak in terms of the mind the mind in a wholesome state the mind in an unwholesome state the mind in a neutral state the mind on the level of form the mind on the formless level the mind on the transcendent level and so on but none of them know what the real heart and mind are likeThe mind is what thinks and forms ideasIt has to make use of the six senses as its toolsAs soon as the eye sees a visual object the ear hears a sound the nose smells an aroma the tongue tastes a flavor the body comes into contact with a tactile sensation  cold hot hard or soft  or the intellect thinks of an idea in line with its defilements good or bad If any of these things are good the mind is pleased if theyre bad its displeasedAll of this is an affair of the mind or of defilementAside from these six senses theres nothing the mind can make use ofIn the texts they are analyzed into the six faculties the six elements the six forms of contact and all sorts of other things but all these things lie within the six sensesSo these are characteristics of the mind that which can never sit stillWhen you train the mind  or in other words practice concentration  you have to get control over the mind thats wriggling after the six senses as already explained and make it stop still with one thing its meditation word buddhoDont let it go straying out ahead or behindMake it stay still and know that its staying still Thats the heartThe heart has nothing to do with any of the six senses which is why its called the heartWhen people in general talk about the heart of something theyre referring to its centerEven when they talk about their own hearts they point to the center of the chestActually the heart doesnt lie in any particular place at all  as I have already explained  although it lies right in the center of everythingIf you want to understand what the heart is you can try an experimentBreathe in deeply and hold your breath for a momentAt that point there wont be anything at all except for one thing neutral awarenessThats the heart or what knows But if you try to catch hold of the heart in this way you cant hold on to it for very long  only as long as you can hold your breath  but you can give it a try just to see what the true heart is likeOnce you realize that the heart and mind have different duties and characteristics like this youll find it easier to train the mindActually the heart and the mind are really the same thingAs the Buddha said the mind is identical with the heartWhen we practice concentration its enough just to train the mind once the mind is trained thats where well see the heartOnce the mind has been fully trained by using mindfulness to keep it with buddho as its only preoccupation it wont go straying after different things and instead will gather into onenessThe meditation word will disappear without your being aware of it and youll feel a sense of peace and ease that nothing else can equalThose who have never experienced this ease before when they first experience it wont be able to describe it because no one else in the world has ever experienced that kind of peace and easeEven though other people have experienced it its not the sameFor this reason you find it hard to describe  although you can describe it to yourselfIf you try to describe it to others you have to use similes and analogies before theyll understand youThings of this sort are personal Only you can know them for yourselfIn addition if youve developed a lot of potential in previous lifetimes all sorts of amazing things can happenFor example you may gain knowledge of heavenly beings or hungry ghostsYou may learn about your own past and future and that of other people In that particular lifetime you were like this in the future youll be like thatEven though you didnt intend to know these things when the mind attains concentration it can know on its own in a very amazing wayThis sort of thing is something that really fascinates beginning meditatorsWhen it happens to them they like to brag to other peopleWhen those people try to meditate but dont get the knowledge or abilities they become discouraged thinking that they dont have the merit or potential to meditate and they begin to lose faith in the practiceAs for those who see these sorts of things when that knowledge or ability deteriorates  because theyve been carried away by external things and havent taken the heart as their foundation  they wont be able to grab hold of anything at allWhen they think of the things they used to know their minds become even more stirred upPeople who like to brag will take the old things they used to see and talk about them in glowing termsAvid listeners really love to listen to this sort of thing but avid meditators are unimpressed  because true meditators like to listen only to things that are present and trueThe Buddha taught that whether his teachings will flourish or degenerate depends on those who practice themThe teachings degenerate when meditators get just a little bit of knowledge and then go bragging to other people talking about external matters with no substance at all instead of explaining the basic principles of meditationWhen they do this they make the religion degenerate without their even realizing itThose who make the religion flourish are those who speak about things that are useful and trueThey dont speak just for the fun of itThey speak in terms of cause and effect When you meditate like this repeating the meditation word in this way it will make the mind gather into one and snuff out its defilements and restlessness like this When you meditate on buddho be patientDont be in a hurryBe confident in your meditation word and use mindfulness to keep the mind with its buddhoYour confidence is what will make the mind firm and unwavering able to let go of all its doubts and uncertaintiesThe mind will gather in on its meditation word and mindfulness will keep it solely with buddho at all timesWhether you sit stand walk lie down or whatever work you do mindfulness will be alert to nothing but buddhoIf your mindfulness is still weak and your techniques still few you have to hold on to buddho as your foundationOtherwise your meditation wont progress or even if it does progress it wont have any foundationFor concentration to be strong the mind has to be resoluteWhen mindfulness is strong and the mind resolute you decide that this is what you want If I cant catch hold of buddho or see buddho in my heart or get the mind to stay put solely with buddho I wont get up from my meditationEven if my life will end I dont care When you do this the mind will gather into one faster than you realize itThe meditation word buddho or whatever it is that may have been bothering or perplexing you will vanish in the flash of an eyeEven your body which youve been attached to for so long wont appear to youAll that remains is the heart  simple awareness  cool calm and at easePeople who practice meditation really like it when this happensThe next time around they want it to happen again and so it doesnt happen againThats because the desire keeps it from happeningConcentration is something very subtle and sensitiveYou cant force it to be like this or that  and at the same time you cant force the mind not to enter concentration eitherIf youre impatient things get even more fouled upYou have to be very patientWhether or not the mind is going to attain concentration youve meditated on buddho in the past so you just keep meditating on buddhoAct as if you had never meditated on buddho beforeMake the mind neutral and even let the breath flow gently and use mindfulness to focus the mind on buddho and nothing elseWhen the time comes for the mind to enter concentration it will do it on its ownYou cant arrange the way it will happenIf it were something you could arrange all the people in the world would have become arahants long agoKnowing how to meditate but not doing it right having done it right once and wanting it to be that way again and yet it doesnt happen All of these things are obstacles in practicing concentrationIn meditating on buddho you have to get so that youre quick and adeptWhen a good or a bad mood strikes you you have to be able to enter concentration immediatelyDont let the mind be affected by that moodWhenever you think of buddho the mind gathers immediately When you can do this your mind will be solid and able to rely on itselfWhen youve practiced so that youre adept and experienced in this way after a while youll find that your defilements and attachments to all things will gradually disappear on their ownYou dont have to go clearing away this or that defilement telling yourself that this or that defilement has to be removed with this or that teaching or this or that methodBe content with whatever method you find works for youThats plenty enoughTo have the defilements gradually disappear with the method Ive just explained is better than trying to arrange things entering the four levels of absorption abandoning directed thought evaluation rapture and pleasure leaving just onepointedness and equanimity or trying to arrange the first stage of the path to nibbana by abandoning selfidentity views uncertainty and attachment to precepts  practices or by looking at your various defilements telling yourself With that defilement I was able to contemplate in suchandsuch a way so Ive gone beyond that defilementI have soandso many defilements leftIf I can contemplate in suchandsuch a way my defilements will be finished  but you dont realize that the state of mind that wants to see and know and attain these things is a defilement fixed firmly in the mindWhen you finish your contemplation the mind is back in its original state and hasnt gained anything at allOn top of that if someone comes along and says something that goes against the way you see things you start disagreeing violently like a burning fire into which someone pours keroseneSo hold firmly to your meditation word buddhoEven if you dont attain anything else at least youve got your meditation word as your foundationThe various preoccupations of the mind will lessen or may even disappear which is better than not having any foundation to hold to at allActually all meditators have to hold firmly to their meditation wordOnly then can they be said to be meditating with a foundationWhen their meditation deteriorates theyll be able to use it as something to hold toThe Buddha taught that people who make the effort to abandon defilement have to act like oldtime warriorsIn the past theyd have to build a fortress with strong walls moats gates and towers to protect themselves from enemy attackWhen an intelligent warrior went out to battle and saw that he was no match for the enemy he would retreat into his fortress and defend it so that the enemy couldnt destroy itAt the same time hed gather enough troops weapons and food and then go out to resume his fight with the enemyConcentration is a very important strengthIf you dont have concentration where will your discernment gain any strengthThe discernment of insight meditation isnt something that can be fashioned into being by arrangementInstead it arises from concentration that has been mastered until it is good and solidEven those who are said to attain Awakening with dry insight If they dont have any mental stillness where will they get any insightIts simply that their stillness isnt fully masteredOnly when we put the matter this way does it make any senseWhen your concentration is solid and steady to the point where you can enter and leave it at will youll be able to stay with it long and contemplate the body in terms of its unattractiveness or in terms of its physical elementsOr if you like you can contemplate the people of the world until you see them all as skeletonsOr you can contemplate the entire world as empty spaceOnce the mind is fully centered then no matter whether you are sitting standing walking or lying down the mind will be centered at all timesYoull be able to see clearly how your own defilements  greed anger and delusion which arise from the mind  arise from this and that cause how they remain in this or that way and youll be able to find means to abandon them with this or that techniqueThis is like the water in a lake that has been muddy for hundreds and hundreds of years suddenly becoming clear so that you can see all the things lying along the lakebottom  things you never dreamed were there beforeThis is called insight  seeing things as they truly areWhatever sort of truth they have thats the truth you see without deviating from that truthForcing the mind to be still can make it let go of defilement but it lets go in the same way a person cuts grass cutting just the part above ground without digging up the rootsThe roots are sure to send up new shoots when rain falls againIn other words you do see the harm of the preoccupations that arise from the six senses but as soon as you see it you retreat into stillness without contemplating those preoccupations as carefully as you do when the mind is in concentrationIn short you simply want stillness without wanting to spend any time in contemplation  like a ground lizard that relies on its hole for safetyAs soon as it sees an enemy coming it runs into its hole escaping danger only for a whileIf you want to uproot your defilements then when you see that defilement springs from the six senses  for instance the eye sees a visual object or the ear hears a sound contact is made that causes you to be pleased or displeased happy or sad and then you grab onto it as your preoccupation making the mind murky disturbed and upset sometimes to the point where you cant eat or sleep and can even commit suicide  when you see this clearly make your concentration firm and then focus your mind exclusively on examining that particular preoccupationFor instance if the eye sees an attractive visual object that makes you feel pleased focus on examining just that sense of pleasure to find out whether it arises from the eye or from the visual objectIf you examine the visual object you see that its just a physical phenomenonWhether its good or bad it doesnt try to persuade you to be pleased or displeased or to make you love it or hate itIts simply a visual object that appears and then disappears in line with its own natureWhen you turn to examine the eye that sees the visual object you find that the eye goes looking for objects and as soon as it finds one light gets reflected into the optic nerves so that all kinds of visible forms appearThe eye doesnt try to persuade you to be pleased or displeased to love or to hate anythingIts duty is simply to seeOnce it has seen a visible form the form disappearsAs for the other senses and their objects attractive or unattractive they should be examined in just the same wayWhen you contemplate in this way youll see clearly that all the things in the world that become objects of defilement do so because of these six sensesIf you contemplate the six senses so that you dont tag along after them defilements wont arise within youOn the contrary Insight and discernment will arise instead all because of these same six sensesThe six senses are the media of goodness and evilWell head for a good or a bad destination in the next life because of the way we use themThe world seems broad because the mind isnt centered and is left free to wander among the objects of the six sensesThe world will narrow down when the mind has been trained in concentration so that it lies under your control and can contemplate the six senses exclusively within itIn other words when the mind is fully concentrated the outer senses  the eye seeing forms the ear hearing sounds and so on  wont appear at allAll that will appear are the forms and sounds that are mental phenomena present exclusively in that concentrationYou wont be paying any attention to the outer senses at allWhen your concentration is fully solid and strong youll be able to contemplate this world of the mind which gives rise to sensory contact perceptions preoccupations and all defilementsThe mind will withdraw from everything leaving just the heart or simple awarenessThe heart and the mind have different characteristicsThe mind is what thinks forming perceptions and preoccupations to the point of latching on holding them to itselfWhen it sees the suffering harm and stress that come from holding onto all the defilements it will go and withdraw from all preoccupations and defilementsThe mind will then be the heartThis is how the heart and mind differThe heart is whats neutral and stillIt doesnt think anything at allIts simply aware of its stillnessThe heart is a genuinely neutral or central phenomenonNeutral with no past no future no good no evil Thats the heartWhen we talk about the heart of anything we mean its centerEven the human heart which is a mental phenomenon we say lies in the center of the chestBut where the real heart is we dont knowTry focusing your attention on any part of the body and youll feel the awareness of that spotOr you can focus your attention outside the body  on a post or the wall of a house for example  and thats the spot youll be aware ofSo we can conclude that the true heart is still and neutral awarenessWherever theres neutral awareness thats where the heart isWhen people in general talk about the heart thats not the true heartIts simply a set of muscles and valves for pumping blood throughout the body to keep it aliveIf this pump doesnt send blood throughout the body the body cant liveItll have to dieThe same holds true with the brainThe mind thinks of good and evil by using the brain as its toolThe nervous system of the brain is a physical phenomenonWhen its various causal factors are cut off this physical phenomenon cant lastIt has to stopBut as for the mind which is a mental phenomenon Buddhism teaches that it continues to exist and can take birth againThis mental phenomenon will stop only when insight discerns its causal factors and uproots their underlying causesNone of the various subjects and sciences of the world have an end pointThe more you study them the more they fan outOnly Buddhism can teach you to reach an endIn the first stage it teaches you to acquaint yourself with your body to see how its made up of various things put together and what their duties areAt the same time Buddhism teaches you to see that the body is inherently unattractiveIt teaches you to acquaint yourself with this world which is made up of suffering and stress and which will ultimately have to fall apart by its very natureSo now that weve received this body  even though its full of foul and unattractive things and even though its made up of all kinds of suffering and stress  were still able to depend on it for a while so we should use it to do good to repay our debts to the world before we leave it at deathThe Buddha teaches that although the nature of a person is to fall apart and die the mind  the overseer of this world  must come back to be reborn as long as it still has defilementsThus he teaches us to practice concentration which is an affair exclusively of the mindOnce we have practiced concentration we will feel every sensory contact inside just at the mindWe wont be concerned with our seeing and hearing at the eye or the earInstead well be aware of the sensory contact right at the mindThis is what it means to narrow down the worldThe senses are the best means for taking the measure of your own mindWhen sensory contact strikes the mind does it have an impact on youIf it has a lot of impact that shows that your mindfulness is weak and your foundation is still shakyIf it has only a little impact or no impact at all that shows that your mindfulness is strong and youre fully able to care for yourselfThese things are like Devadatta who created trouble for the Bodhisattva all alongIf not for Devadatta the Bodhisattva wouldnt have been able to bring his character to full perfectionOnce his character had been fully perfected he was able to gain Awakening and become the BuddhaBefore gaining Awakening he had to withstand the massive armies of temptation and right after his Awakening the three daughters of temptation came to test him once moreAs a result the people of the world have praised him ever since for having conquered defilement in this world once and for allAs long as the inner senses still exist mental contact is still a preoccupationThus those who know having seen the harm of these things are willing to withdraw from them leaving just the heart thats neutral neutral neutral with no thinking no imagining no fashioning of anything at allWhen this is the case where will this world be formedThis is how the Buddha teaches us to reach the worlds endBack in the days of the Buddha nirvana had a verb of its own nibbutiIt meant to go out like a flameBecause fire was thought to be in a state of entrapment as it burned  both clinging to and trapped by the fuel on which it fed  its going out was seen as an unbindingTo go out was to be unboundSometimes another verb was used  parinibbuti  with the pari meaning total or allaround to indicate that the person unbound unlike fire unbound would never again be trappedNow that nirvana has become an English word it should have its own English verb to convey the sense of being unbound as wellAt present we say that a person reaches nirvana or enters nirvana implying that nibbana is a place where you can goBut nirvana is most emphatically not a placeIts realized only when the mind stops defining itself in terms of place of here or there or between the twoThis may seem like a wordchoppers problem  what can a verb or two do to your practice but the idea of nirvana as a place has created severe misunderstandings in the past and it could easily create misunderstandings nowThere was a time when some philosophers in India reasoned that if nirvana is one place and samsara another then entering into nirvana leaves you stuck youve limited your range of movement for you cant get back to samsaraThus to solve this problem they invented what they thought was a new kind of nirvana an unestablished nirvana in which one could be in both places  nirvana and samsara  at onceHowever these philosophers misunderstood two important points about the Buddhas teachingsThe first was that neither samsara nor nirvana is a placeSamsara is a process of creating places even whole worlds and then wandering through themNirvana is the end of this processYou may be able to be in two places at once  or even develop a sense of self so infinite that you can occupy all places at once  but you cant feed a process and experience its end at the same timeYoure either feeding samsara or youre notIf you feel the need to course freely through both samsara and nirvana youre simply engaging in more samsaraing and keeping yourself trappedThe second point is that nirvana from the very beginning was realized through unestablished consciousness  one that doesnt come or go or stay in placeTheres no way that anything unestablished can get stuck anywhere at all for its not only nonlocalized but also undefinedThe idea of a religious ideal as lying beyond space and definition is not exclusive to the Buddhas teachings but issues of locality and definition in the Buddhas eyes had a specific psychological meaningThis is why the nonlocality of nirvana is important to understandJust as all phenomena are rooted in desire consciousness localizes itself through passionPassion is what creates the there on which consciousness can land or get established whether the there is a form feeling perception thoughtconstruct or a type of consciousness itselfOnce consciousness gets established on any of these aggregates it becomes attached and then proliferates feeding on everything around it and creating all sorts of havocWherever theres attachment thats where you get defined as a beingYou create an identity there and in so doing youre limited thereEven if the there is an infinite sense of awareness grounding surrounding or permeating everything else its still limited for grounding and so forth are aspects of placeWherever theres place no matter how subtle passion lies latent looking for more food to feed onIf however the passion can be removed theres no more there thereOne sutta illustrates this with a simile the sun shining through the eastern wall of a house and landing on the western wallIf the western wall the ground beneath it and the waters beneath the ground were all removed the sunlight wouldnt landIn the same way if passion for form etc could be removed consciousness would have no where to land and so would become unestablishedThis doesnt mean that consciousness would be annihilated simply that  like the sunlight  it would now have no localityWith no locality it would no longer be definedThis is why the consciousness of nirvana is said to be without surface for it doesnt landBecause the consciousnessaggregate covers only consciousness that is near or far past present or future  ie in connection with space and time  consciousness without surface is not included in the aggregatesIts not eternal because eternity is a function of timeAnd because nonlocal also means undefined the Buddha insisted that an awakened person  unlike ordinary people  cant be located or defined in any relation to the aggregates in this life after death heshe cant be described as existing not existing neither or both because descriptions can apply only to definable thingsThe essential step toward this nonlocalized undefined realization is to cut back on the proliferations of consciousnessThis first involves contemplating the drawbacks of keeping consciousness trapped in the process of feedingThis contemplation gives urgency to the next steps bringing the mind to oneness in concentration gradually refining that oneness and then dropping it to zeroThe drawbacks of feeding are most graphically described in SN A Sons FleshThe process of gradually refining oneness is probably best described in MN The Lesser Discourse on Emptiness while the drop to zero is best described in the Buddhas famous instructions to Bahiya In reference to the seen there will be only the seenIn reference to the heard only the heardIn reference to the sensed only the sensedIn reference to the cognized only the cognized That is how you should train yourselfWhen for you there will be only the seen in reference to the seen only the heard in reference to the heard only the sensed in reference to the sensed only the cognized in reference to the cognized then Bahiya there is no you in connection with thatWhen there is no you in connection with that there is no you thereWhen there is no you there you are neither here nor yonder nor between the twoThis just this is the end of stressWith no here or there or between the two you obviously cant use the verb enter or reach to describe this realization even metaphoricallyMaybe we should make the word nirvana into a verb itself When there is no you in connection with that you nirvana That way we can indicate that unbinding is an action unlike any other and we can head off any mistaken notion about getting stuck in total freedomAll beings subsist on nutriment Then VenRadha went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one

were to carve it up with a sharp carving knife so that  without damaging the substance of the inner flesh without damaging the substance of the outer hide  he would cut sever  detach only the skin muscles connective tissues  attachments in betweenHaving cut severed  detached the outer skin and then covering the cow again with that very skin if he were to say that the cow was joined to the skin just as it had been would he be speaking rightlyNo venerable sirWhy is thatBecause if the skilled butcher or butchers apprentice having killed a cow were to cut sever  detach only the skin muscles connective tissues  attachments in between and having covered the cow again with that very skin then no matter how much he might say that the cow was joined to the skin just as it had been the cow would still be disjoined from the skinThis simile sisters I have given to convey a messageThe message is this The substance of the inner flesh stands for the six internal media the substance of the outer hide for the six external mediaThe skin muscles connective tissues  attachments in between stand for passion  delightAnd the sharp knife stands for noble discernment  the noble discernment that cuts severs  detaches the defilements fetters  bonds in betweenThen the Blessed One went with a large number of monks to the Black Rock on the slope of IsigiliFrom afar he saw VenVakkali lying dead on

allness of the AllIs a mountain heavyIt may be heavy in and of itself but as long as we dont try to lift it up it wont be heavy for usThis is a metaphor that one of my teachers Ajaan Suwat often used when explaining how to stop suffering from the problems of lifeYou dont deny their existence  the mountains are heavy  and you dont run away from themAs he would further explain you deal with problems where you have to and solve them where you canYou simply learn how not to carry them aroundThats where the art of the practice lies in living with real problems without making their reality burden the heartAs a beginning step in mastering that art its useful to look at the source for Ajaan Suwats metaphor  the Buddhas teachings on dukkha  to get a fuller idea of how far the metaphor extendsDukkha is a word notoriously hard to translate into EnglishIn the Pali canon it applies both to physical and to mental pain and disease ranging from intense anguish to the subtlest sense of being burdened or confinedThe Pali commentaries explain dukkha as that which is hard to bear Ajaan MahaBoowa a Thai forest master translates it as whatever puts a squeeze on the heart Although no single English term covers all of these meanings the word stress  as a strain on body or mind  seems as close as English can get to the Pali term suffering can be used in places where stress seems too mildThe Buddha focused his teachings on the issue of stress because he had found a method for transcending itTo understand that method we have to see which parts of our experience are marked by stressFrom his perspective experience falls into two broad categories compounded  put together from causal forces and processes  and uncompoundedAll ordinary experience is compoundedEven such a simple act as looking at a flower is compounded in that it depends on the physical conditions supporting the flowers existence together with all the complex physical and mental factors involved in the act of seeingThe only experience that isnt compounded is extraordinary  nirvana  for it doesnt depend on causal factors of any kindStress is totally absent from uncompounded experienceIts relation to compounded experience though is more complexWhen the Buddha talked about dukkha in terms of the three common characteristics  inconstancy stress and notself  he said that all compounded experiences are innately stressfulFrom this point of view even flowergazing is stressful despite the obvious pleasure it provides for it relies on a fragile tension among the combined factors making up the experienceThus if we want to go beyond stress well have to go beyond compounded experienceBut this presents a problem what will we use to reach the uncompoundedWe cant use uncompounded experience to get us there because  by definition  it cant play a role in any causal processIt cant be used as a toolSo we need a way of using compounded experience to transcend itselfTo meet this need the Buddha talked about dukkha in another context the four noble truthsHere for strategic purposes he divided compounded experience into three truths  stress its cause and the way to its cessationUncompounded experience he left as the remaining truth the cessation of stressIn defining the first truth he said that compounded experiences were stressful only when accompanied by clingingIn this sense flowergazing isnt stressful unless we cling to the experience and try to base our happiness on itSo its obvious that in these two contexts the Buddha is speaking of dukkha in two different sensesAjaan Suwats mountain metaphor helps to explain how they are relatedThe heaviness of the mountain stands for dukkha as a common characteristic the stress inherent in all compounded experiencesThe fact that the mountain is heavy only for those who try to lift it stands for dukkha as a noble truth the stress that comes only with clinging  the clinging that turns physical pain into mental pain and turns aging illness and death into mental distressThe Buddha taught dukkha as a common characteristic to make us reflect on the things we cling to are they really worth holding ontoIf not why keep holding onIf life offered no pleasures better than those we already get from clinging the Buddhas insistence on the stress in things like flowergazing might seem churlish and negativeBut his purpose in getting us to reflect on the flip side of ordinary pleasures is to open our hearts to something very positive the higher form of happiness totally devoid of suffering and stress that comes only with total letting goSo he also taught dukkha as a noble truth in order to focus our attention on where the real problem lies not in the stressfulness of experiences but in our ignorance in thinking we have to cling to themAnd its a good thing too that this is where the issue liesAs long as there are mountains theres not much we can do about their inherent weight but we can learn to break our habit of lifting them up and carrying them aroundWe can learn to stop clingingThat will put an end to our sufferingsTo understand how to let go effectively its helpful to look at the Pali word for clinging  upadana  for it has a second meaning as well the act of taking sustenance as when a plant takes sustenance from the soil or a fire from its fuelThis second meaning for upadana applies to the mind as wellWhen the mind clings to an object its feeding on that objectIts trying to gain nourishment from sensory pleasures possessions relationships recognition status whatever to make up for the gnawing sense of emptiness it feels insideUnfortunately this mental nourishment is temporary at best so we keep hungering for moreYet no matter how much the mind may try to possess and control its food sources to guarantee a constant supply they inevitably break downThe mind is then burdened with searching for new places to feedSo the issue of stress comes down to the feeding habits of the mindIf the mind didnt have to feed it wouldnt sufferAt the same time it would no longer create hardships for the people and things it consumes  through possession and control  as foodIf we want to end suffering for ourselves and at the same time relieve the hardships of others we thus have to strengthen the mind to the point where it doesnt have to feed and then sharpen its discernment so that it doesnt want to feedWhen it neither needs nor wants to feed it will let go without our having to tell it toThe practice to end dukkha would be quick and easy if we could simply go straight for the discernment that puts an end to clingingThe feeding analogy though helps to explain why simply seeing the drawbacks of clinging isnt enough to make us let goIf were not strong enough to go without sustenance the mind will keep finding new ways to feed and clingSo we first have to learn healthy feeding habits that will strengthen the mindOnly then will it be in a position where it no longer needs to feedHow does the mind feed and clingThe Pali canon lists four waysTheres rarely a moment when the ordinary mind isnt clinging in at least one of these waysEven when we abandon one form of clinging its usually in favor of anotherWe may abandon a puritanical view because it interferes with sensual pleasure or a sensual pleasure because it conflicts with a view about what we should do to stay healthy and fitOur view of who we are may vary depending on which of our many senses of I is most pained expanding into a sense of cosmic oneness when we feel confined by our small mindbody complex and contracting into a small shell when we feel wounded from identifying with a cosmos so filled with cruelty and wasteWhen the insignificance of our finite self becomes oppressive again we may jump at the idea that we have no self but then that becomes oppressiveSo our minds jump from clinging to clinging like a bird trapped in a cageWhen we realize were captive we naturally search for a way out but everywhere we turn seems to be another side of the cageWe may begin to wonder whether there is a way out or whether talk of full release is simply an old archetypal ideal that has nothing to do with human realityBut the Buddha was a great strategist he realized that one of the walls of the cage is actually a door and that if we grasp it skillfully itll swing wide openIn other words he found that the way to go beyond clinging is to turn our four ways of clinging into the path to their own abandoningWell need a certain amount of sensory pleasure  in terms of adequate food clothing and shelter  to find the strength to go beyond sensual passionWell need right view  seeing all things including views in terms of the four noble truths  to undermine our clinging to viewsAnd well need a regimen of the five ethical precepts and the practice of meditation to put the mind in a solid position where it can drop its clinging to precepts and practicesUnderlying all this well need a healthy sense of selflove selfresponsibility and selfdiscipline to master the practices leading to the insight that cuts through our clinging to doctrines of the selfSo we start the path to the end of suffering not by trying to drop our clingings immediately but by learning to cling more strategicallyIn terms of the feeding analogy we dont try to starve the mindWe simply change its diet weaning it away from junk food in favor of health food developing inner qualities that will make it so strong that it wont need to feed ever againThe canon lists these qualities as fiveOf these concentration  at the level of jhana or intense absorption  is the strength that the Buddhist tradition most often compares to good healthy foodA discourse in the Anguttara Nikaya compares the four levels of jhana to the provisions used to stock a frontier fortressAjaan Lee one of the Thai forest masters compares them to the provisions needed on a journey through a lonely desolate forestOr as Dhammapada says about the rapture of jhanaAs for discernment When the mind is strengthened with the food of good concentration it can begin contemplating the drawbacks of having to feedThis is the part of the Buddhas teaching that  for many of us  goes most directly against the grain because feeding in every sense of the word is our primary way of relating to and enjoying the world around usOur most cherished sense of interconnectedness with the world  what some people call our interbeing  is at its most basic level intereatingWe feed on others and they feed on usSometimes our relationships are mutually nourishing sometimes not but either way its hard to imagine any lasting relationship where some kind of physical or mental nourishment wasnt being consumedAt the same time feeding is the activity in which we experience the most intimate sense of ourselvesWe define ourselves through the pleasures people ideas and activities we keep returning to for nourishmentSo its hard for us to imagine a world any possibility of enjoyment  even our very self  where we wouldnt intereatOur common resistance to the idea of no longer feeding  one of the Buddhas most radically uncommon teachings  comes largely from a failure of the imaginationWe can hardly conceive of what hes trying to tell usSo he has to prescribe some strong medicine to jog our minds into new perspectivesThis is where his teachings on dukkha or stress come into playWhen the mind is strong and well fed it can begin to look objectively at the stress involved in having to feedThe teachings on dukkha as a common characteristic focus on the drawbacks of what the mind takes for foodSometimes it latches onto outandout sufferingIt clings to the body even when racked with painIt clings to its preferences and relationships even when these bring anguish grief and despairSometimes the mind latches onto pleasures and joys but pleasures and joys turn stressful when they deteriorate and changeIn any event everything the mind latches onto is by its very nature compounded and theres always at least a subtle level of stress inherent in keeping the compound goingThis applies not only to gross external conditions but even to the most subtle levels of concentration in the mindWhen we see stress as a characteristic common to all the things we latch onto it helps dispel their allurePleasures begin to ring hollow and falseEven our sufferings  which we can often glamorize with a perverse pride  begin to seem banal when reduced to their common characteristic of stressThis helps cut them down to sizeOf course some people object to the idea of contemplating the dukkha inherent in the minds food on the grounds that this contemplation doesnt do justice to the many joys and satisfactions in lifeThe Buddha however never denies the existence of pleasureHe simply points out that if you focus on the allure of your food youll never be able to outgrow your eating addictionsIt would be like asking an alcoholic to muse on the subtle good flavors of scotch and wineDukkha is inherent not only in the things on which we feed but also in the very act of feedingThis is the focal point for the Buddhas teaching on dukkha as a noble truthIf we have to feed were a slave to our appetitesAnd can we trust ourselves to behave in honorable ways when the demands of these slave drivers arent metIntereating is not always a pretty thingAt the same time as long as we need to feed were prey to any uncertainties in our food sources at the mercy of any people or forces with power over themIf we cant do without them were chained to themThe mind isnt free to go places where there isnt any foodAnd as the Buddha guarantees those are precisely the places  beyond our ordinary mental horizons  where the greatest happiness liesThe purpose of these two contemplations  on the stress inherent both in the minds food and in the way it feeds  is to sensitize us to limitations that we otherwise accept sometimes blithely always blindly without thoughtOnce the realization finally hits home that theyre not worth the price they entail we lose all infatuation with our desire to feedAnd unlike the body the mind can reach a level of strength where it no longer needs to cling or take in sustenance even from the path of practiceWhen it becomes strong enough in conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment it can open to a dimension  the deathless  where there is neither feeding nor being fed uponThat puts an end to the feeder and theres no more suffering with regard to foodIn other words once weve fully penetrated the deathless dukkha as a common characteristic is no longer an issue dukkha as a noble truth no longer existsThis is where you discover something unexpected the mountains youve been trying to lift are all a byproduct of your feedingWhen you stop feeding no new mountains are formedAlthough there may still be some pastkarma mountains remaining around you theyll eventually wear away and no new ones will take their placeIn the meantime their weight is no longer a problemOnce youve finally stopped trying to lift them up theres nothing to hold you downUpasika Kee Nanayon also known by her penname KKhaosuanluang was arguably the foremost woman Dhamma teacher in twentiethcentury ThailandBorn in to a Chinese merchant family in Rajburi a town to the west of Bangkok she was the eldest of five children  or counting her fathers children by a second wife the eldest of eightHer mother was a very religious woman and taught her the rudiments of Buddhist practice such as nightly chants and the observance of the precepts from an early ageIn later life she described how at the age of six she became so filled with fear and loathing at the miseries her mother went through in being pregnant and giving birth to a younger sibling that on seeing the newborn child for the first time  sleeping quietly a little red thing with black black hair  she ran away from home for three daysThis experience plus the anguish she must have felt when her parents separated probably lay behind her decision made when she was still quite young never to submit to what she saw as the slavery of marriageDuring her teens she devoted her spare time to Dhamma books and to meditation and her working hours to a small business to support her father in his old ageHer meditation progressed well enough that she was able to teach him meditation with fairly good results in the last year of his lifeAfter his death she continued her business with the thought of saving up enough money to enable herself to live the remainder of her life in a secluded place and give herself fully to the practiceHer aunt and uncle who were also interested in Dhamma practice had a small home near a forested hill Khao Suan Luang outside of Rajburi where she often went to practiceIn as life disrupted by World War II had begun to return to normal she gave up her business joined her aunt and uncle in moving to the hill and there the three of them began a life devoted entirely to meditationThe small retreat they made for themselves in an abandoned monastic dwelling eventually grew to become the nucleus of a womens practice center that has flourished to this dayLife at the retreat was frugal in line with the fact that outside support was minimal in the early yearsHowever even now that the center has become wellknown and wellestablished the same frugal style has been maintained for its benefits in subduing greed pride and other mental defilements as well as for the pleasure it offers in unburdening the heartThe women practicing at the center are all vegetarian and abstain from such stimulants as tobacco coffee tea and betel nutThey meet daily for chanting group meditation and discussion of the practiceIn the years when Upasika Kees health was still strong she would hold special meetings at which the members would report on their practice after which she would give a talk touching on any important issues that had been brought upIt was during such sessions that most of the talks recorded in this volume were givenIn the centers early years small groups of friends and relatives would visit on occasion to give support and to listen to Upasika Kees Dhamma talksAs word spread of the high standard of her teachings and practice larger and larger groups came to visit and more women began to join the communityWhen tape recording was introduced to Thailand in the mids friends began recording her talks and in a group of them printed a small volume of her transcribed talks for free distributionBy the mids the stream of free Dhamma literature from Khao Suan Luang  Upasika Kees poetry as well as her talks  had grown to a floodThis attracted even more people to her center and established her as one of the bestknown Dhamma teachers male or female in ThailandUpasika Kee was something of an autodidactAlthough she picked up the rudiments of meditation during her frequent visits to monasteries in her youth she practiced mostly on her own without any formal study under a meditation teacherMost of her instruction came from books  the Pali canon and the works of contemporary teachers  and was tested in the crucible of her own relentless honestyHer later teachings show the influence of the writings of Buddhadasa Bhikkhu although she transformed his concepts in ways that made them entirely her ownIn the later years of her life she developed cataracts that eventually left her blind but she still continued a rigorous schedule of meditating and receiving visitors interested in the DhammaShe passed away quietly in after entrusting the center to a committee she appointed from among its membersHer younger sister Upasika Wan who up to that point had played a major role as supporter and facilitator for the center joined the community within a few months of Upasika Kees death and soon became its leader a position she held until her death inNow the center is once again being run by committee and has grown to accommodate membersMuch has been written recently on the role of women in Buddhism but it is interesting to note that for all of Upasika Kees accomplishments in her own personal Dhamma practice and in providing opportunities for other women to practice as well sociohistorical books on Thai women in Buddhism make no mention of her name or of the community she foundedThis underscores the distinction between Buddhism as practice and mainstream Buddhism as a sociohistorical phenomenon a distinction that is important to bear in mind when issues related to the place of women in Buddhism are discussedStudy after study has shown that mainstream Buddhism both lay and monastic has adapted itself thoroughly to the various societies into which it has been introduced  so thoroughly that the original teachings seem in some cases to have been completely distortedFrom the earliest centuries of the tradition on up to the present groups who feel inspired by the Buddhas teachings but who prefer to adapt those teachings to their own ends rather than adapting themselves to the teachings have engaged in creating what might be called designer BuddhismThis accounts for the wide differences we find when we compare say Japanese Buddhism Tibetan and Thai and for the variety of social roles to which many women Buddhists in different countries have found themselves relegatedThe true practice of Buddhism though has always been countercultural even in nominally Buddhist societiesSocietys main aim no matter where is its own perpetuationIts cultural values are designed to keep its members useful and productive  either directly or indirectly  in the ongoing economyMost religions allow themselves to become domesticated to these values by stressing altruism as the highest religious impulse and mainstream Buddhism is no differentWherever it has spread it has become domesticated to the extent that the vast majority of monastics as well as lay followers devote themselves to social services of one form or another measuring their personal spiritual worth in terms of how well they have loved and served othersHowever the actual practice enjoined by the Buddha does not place such a high value on altruism at allIn fact he gave higher praise to those who work exclusively for their own spiritual welfare than to those who sacrifice their spiritual welfare for the welfare of others  a teaching that the mainstream especially in Mahayana traditions has tended to suppressThe true path of practice pursues happiness through social withdrawal the goal being an undying happiness found exclusively within totally transcending the world and not necessarily expressed in any social functionPeople who have attained the goal may teach the path of practice to others or they may notThose who do are considered superior to those who dont but those who dont are in turn said to be superior to those who teach without having attained the goal themselvesThus individual attainment rather than social function is the true measure of a persons worthMainstream Buddhism because it can become so domesticated often seems to act at crosspurposes to the actual practice of BuddhismWomen sense this primarily in the fact that they do not have the same opportunities for ordination that men do and that they tend to be discouraged from pursuing the opportunities that are available to themThe Theravadin Bhikkhuni Sangha the nuns order founded by the Buddha died out because of war and famine almost a millennium ago and the Buddha provided no mechanism for its revivalThus the only ordination opportunities open to women in Theravadin countries are as lay nuns observing eight or ten preceptsBecause there is no formal organization for the lay nuns their status and opportunities for practice vary widely from location to locationIn Thailand the situation is most favorable in Rajburi and the neighboring province of Phetburi both of which  perhaps because of the influence of Mon culture in the area  have a long tradition of highlyrespected independent nunneriesEven there though the quality of instruction varies widely with the nunnery and many women find that they prefer the opportunities for practice offered in nuns communities affiliated with monasteries which is the basic pattern in other parts of ThailandThe opportunities that monasteries offer for lay nuns to practice  in terms of available free time and the quality of the instruction given  again vary widely from place to placeOne major drawback to nuns communities affiliated with monasteries is that the nuns are relegated to a status clearly secondary to that of the monks but in the better monasteries this is alleviated to some extent by the Buddhist teachings on hierarchy that it is a mere social convention designed to streamline the decisionmaking process in the community and based on morally neutral criteria so that ones place in the hierarchy is not an indication of ones worth as a personOf course there are sexist monks who mistake the privileged position of men as an indication of supposed male superiority but fortunately nuns do not take vows of obedience and are free to change communities if they find the atmosphere oppressiveIn the better monasteries nuns who have advanced far in the practice are publicly recognized by the abbots and can develop large personal followingsAt present for instance one of the most active Dhamma teachers in Bangkok is a woman Amara Malila who abandoned her career as a medical doctor for a life in a nuns community connected with one of the meditation monasteries in the NortheastAfter several years of practice she began teaching with the blessings of the abbot and now has a healthy shelf of books to her nameSuch individuals though are a rarity and many lay nuns find themselves relegated to a celibate version of a housewifes life  considerably freer in their eyes than the life of an actual housewife but still far from conducive to the fulltime practice of the Buddhist pathAlthough the opportunities for women to practice in Thailand are far from ideal it should also be noted that mainstream Buddhism often discourages men from practicing as wellOpportunities for ordination are widely available to men but it is a rare monk who finds himself encouraged to devote himself entirely to the practiceIn village monasteries monks have long been pressured to study medicine so that they can act as the village doctors or to study astrology to become personal counselorsBoth of these activities are forbidden by the disciplinary rules but are very popular with the laity  so popular that until recent times a village monk who did not take up either of these vocations was regarded as shirking his dutiesScholarly monks in the cities have long been told that the path to nibbana is no longer open that fulltime practice would be futile and that a life devoted to administrative duties with perhaps a little meditation on the side is the most profitable use of ones monastic careerOn top of this parents who encourage their sons from early childhood to take temporary ordination often pressure them to disrobe soon after ordination if they show any inclination to stay in the monkhood permanently and abandon the family businessEven families who are happy to have their sons stay in the monkhood often discourage them from enduring the hardships of a meditators life in the forestIn some cases the state of mainstream Buddhism has become so detrimental to the practice that institutional reforms have been attemptedIn the Theravada tradition such reforms have succeeded only if introduced from the top down when senior monks have received the support of the political powers that beThe Canonical example for this pattern is the First Council called with royal patronage in the first year after the Buddhas passing away for the express purpose of standardizing the record of the Buddhas teachings for posterityDuring the days of absolute monarchy reforms that followed this pattern could be quite thoroughgoing and on occasion were nothing short of draconianIn more recent years though they have been much more limited in scope gaining a measure of success only when presented not as impositions but as opportunities access to more reliable texts improved standards and facilities for education and greater support for stricter observance of the disciplinary rulesAnd of course however such reforms may be carried out they are largely limited to externals because the attainment of the Deathless is not something that can be decreed by legislative fiatA modern example of such a reform movement is the Lay Nun Association of Thailand an attempt to provide an organizational structure for all lay nuns throughout the country sponsored by Her Majesty the Queen and senior monks in the national hierarchyThis has succeeded chiefly in providing improved educational opportunities for a relatively small number of nuns while its organizational aims have been something of a failureEven though the association is run by highly educated nuns most of the nuns I know personally have avoided joining it because they do not find the leaders personally inspiring and because they feel they would be sacrificing their independence for no perceivable benefitThis view may be based on a common attitude in the outlying areas of Thailand the less contact with the bureaucratic powers at the center the betterAs for confrontational reforms introduced from the bottom up these have never been sanctioned by the tradition and Theravadin history has no record of their ever succeedingThe only such reform mentioned in the Canon was Devadattas attempted schism introduced as a reform to tighten up the disciplinary rulesThe Canon treats his attempt in such strongly negative terms that its memory is still very much alive in the Theravada mind set making the vast majority of Buddhists reluctant to take up with confrontational reforms no matter how reasonable they might seemAnd with good reason Anyone who has to fight to have hisher ideas accepted inevitably loses touch with the qualities of dispassion selfeffacement unentanglement with others contentment with little and seclusion  qualities the Buddha set forth as the litmus test for gauging whether or not a proposed course of action and the person proposing it were in accordance with the DhammaIn addition there have been striking instances where people have proposed religious reforms as a camouflage for their political ambitions leaving their followers in a lurch when their ambitions are thwartedAnd even in cases where a confrontational reformer seems basically altruistic at heart he or she tends to play up the social benefits to be gained from the proposed reform in the effort to win support thus compromising the relationship of the reform to true practiceExperiences with cases such as this have tended to make Theravadin Buddhists in general leery of confrontational reformsThus given the limited opportunities for institutional reform the only course left open to those few men and women prepared to break the bonds of mainstream Buddhism in their determination to practice is to follow the example of the Buddha himself by engaging in what might be called personal or independent reform to reject the general values of society go off on their own put up with societys disapproval and the hardships of living on the frontier and search for whatever reliable meditation teachers may be living and practicing outside of the mainstreamIf no such teachers exist individuals intent on practice must strike out on their own adhering as closely as they can to the teachings in the texts  to keep themselves from being led astray by their own defilements  and taking refuge in the example of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha in a radical wayIn a sense there is a sort of folk wisdom to this arrangementAnyone who would take on the practice only when assured of comfortable material support status and praise  which the Buddha called the baits of the world  would probably not be up to the sacrifices and selfdiscipline the practice inherently entailsThus from the perspective of the practice mainstream Buddhism serves the function of inspiring individuals truly intent on the practice to leave the mainstream and to go into the forest which was where the religion was originally discoveredAs for those who prefer to stay in society the mainstream meets their socialreligious needs while at the same time making them inclined to view those who leave society in search of the Dhamma with some measure of awe and respect rather than viewing them simply as dropoutsWhat this has meant historically is that the true practice of Buddhism has hovered about the edges of society and history  or from another perspective that the history of Buddhism has hovered about the edges of the practiceWhen we look at the historical record after the first generation of the Buddhas disciples we find only a few anecdotal references to practicing monks or nunsThe only teachers recorded were scholarly monks participants in controversies and missionariesSome people at present have taken the silence on the nuns as an indication that there were no prominent nun teachers after the first generation of disciplesHowever inscriptions at the Theravada stupa at Sañci in India list nuns among the prominent donors to its construction and this would have been possible only if the nuns had large personal followingsThus it seems fair to assume that there were prominent nun teachers but that they were devoted to meditation rather than scholarship and that  like the monks devoted to meditation  their names and teachings slipped through the cracks in the historical record inasmuch as true success at meditation is something that historians are in no position to judgeSo for the period from Canonical up to modern times one can only make conjectures about the opportunities for practice open to men and women at any particular timeStill based on observations of the situation in Thailand before Western influences made themselves strongly felt the following dynamic seems likely Meditation traditions tend to last only two or three generations at mostThey are started by charismatic pioneers willing to put up with the hardships of clearing the Buddhist pathBecause the integrity of their efforts takes years to be tested  not all pioneers are free from delusion and dishonesty  their role requires great sacrificesIn fact if largescale support comes too early it may abort the movementIf over time the pioneers do embody the practice faithfully then as word of their teachings and practices spread they begin to attract a following of students and supportersWith the arrival of support the hardships become less demanding and as life softens so does the practice and within a generation or two it has deteriorated to the extent that it no longer inspires support and eventually dies out together with any memory of the founders teachingsIn some cases before the tradition dies out its example may have a reforming influence at large shaming or inspiring the mainstream at least temporarily into becoming more favorable to true practiceIn other cases the practice tradition may influence only a limited circle and then disappear without a rippleFor those who benefit from it of course the question of its historical repercussions is of no real consequenceEven if only one person has benefited by realizing the Deathless the tradition is a successAt present in Thailand we are watching this process work itself out in several strands with the major difference being that modern media have given us a record of the teachings and practices of many figures in the various meditation traditionsAmong the monks the most influential practice tradition is the Forest Tradition which was started against great odds at the end of the last century by Phra Ajaan Sao Kantasilo and Phra Ajaan Mun Bhuridatto sons of peasants at a time when the central Thai bureaucracy was very active in stamping out independent movements of any sort political or religiousWe have no direct record of Ajaan Saos teachings only a booklet or two of Ajaan Muns but volume upon volume of their students teachingsAmong women the major practice tradition is Upasika Kee NanayonsAlthough she herself has passed away the women at her center still listen to her tapes nightly and keep her teachings alive throughout society by printing and reprinting books of her talks for free distributionBoth traditions are fragile The Forest Tradition is showing signs that its very popularity may soon lead to its demise and the women at Khao Suan Luang are faced with the problem of seeing how long they can maintain their standard of practice without charismatic leadershipOn top of this the arrival of the mass media  and especially television with its tendency to make image more consequential than substance and personality more important than character  is sure to change the dynamic of Buddhist mainstream and the practice not necessarily for the betterStill both traditions have at least left a record  part of which is presented in this book  to inspire future generations and to show how the Buddhist path of practice may be reopened by anyone male or female no matter what forms of designer Buddhism may take over the mainstream and inevitably lead it astrayBuddhism takes a familiar American principle  the pursuit of happiness  and inserts two important qualifiersThe happiness it aims at is true ultimate unchanging and undeceitfulIts pursuit of that happiness is serious not in a grim sense but dedicated disciplined and willing to make intelligent sacrificesWhat sort of sacrifices are intelligentThe Buddhist answer to this question resonates with another American principle an intelligent sacrifice is any in which you gain a greater happiness by letting go of a lesser one in the same way youd give up a bag of candy if offered a pound of gold in exchangeIn other words an intelligent sacrifice is like a profitable tradeThis analogy is an ancient one in the Buddhist traditionIll make a trade one of the Buddhas disciples once said aging for the Ageless burning for the Unbound the highest peace the unexcelled safety from bondageTheres something in all of us that would rather not give things upWed prefer to keep the candy and get the goldBut maturity teaches us that we cant have everything that to indulge in one pleasure often involves denying ourselves another perhaps better oneThus we need to establish clear priorities for investing our limited time and energies where theyll give the most lasting returnsThat means giving top priority to the mindMaterial things and social relationships are unstable and easily affected by forces beyond our control so the happiness they offer is fleeting and undependableBut the wellbeing of a welltrained mind can survive even aging illness and deathTo train the mind though requires time and energyThis is one reason why the pursuit of true happiness demands that we sacrifice some of our external pleasuresSacrificing external pleasures also frees us of the mental burdens that holding onto them often entailsA famous story in the Canon tells of a former king who after becoming a monk sat down at the foot of a tree and exclaimed What blissWhat bliss His fellow monks thought he was pining for the pleasures he had enjoyed as king but he later explained to the Buddha exactly what bliss he had in mindBefore I had guards posted within and without the royal apartments within and without the city within and without the countrysideBut even though I was thus guarded thus protected I dwelled in fear  agitated distrustful and afraidBut now on going alone to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling I dwell without fear unagitated confident and unafraid  unconcerned unruffled my wants satisfied with my mind like a wild deerA third reason for sacrificing external pleasures is that in pursuing some pleasures  such as our addictions to eyecandy earcandy nose tongue and bodycandy  we foster qualities of greed anger and delusion that actively block the qualities needed for inner peaceEven if we had all the time and energy in the world the pursuit of these pleasures would lead us further and further away from the goalThey are spelled out in the path factor called Right Resolve the resolve to forego any pleasures involving sensual passion ill will and harmfulnessSensual passion covers not only sexual desire but also any hankering for the pleasures of the senses that disrupts the peace of the mindIll will covers any wish for suffering either for oneself or for othersAnd harmfulness is any activity that would bring that suffering aboutOf these three categories the last two are the easiest to see as worth abandoningTheyre not always easy to abandon perhaps but the resolve to abandon them is obviously a good thingThe first resolve though  to renounce sensual passion  is difficult even to make to say nothing of following it throughPart of our resistance to this resolve is universally humanPeople everywhere relish their passionsEven the Buddha admitted to his disciples that when he set out on the path of practice his heart didnt leap at the idea of renouncing sensual passion didnt see it as offering peaceBut an added part of our resistance to renunciation is peculiar to Western cultureModern pop psychology teaches that the only alternative to a healthy indulgence of our sensual passions is an unhealthy fearful repressionYet both of these alternatives are based on fear repression on a fear of what the passion might do when expressed or even allowed into consciousness indulgence on a fear of deprivation and of the underthebed monster the passion might become if resisted and driven undergroundBoth alternatives place serious limitations on the mindThe Buddha aware of the drawbacks of both had the imagination to find a third alternative a fearless skillful approach that avoids the dangers of either sideTo understand his approach though we have to see how Right Resolve relates to other parts of the Buddhist path in particular Right View and Right ConcentrationIn the formal analysis of the path Right Resolve builds on Right View in its most skillful manifestation it functions as the directed thought and evaluation that bring the mind to Right ConcentrationRight View provides a skillful understanding of sensual pleasures and passions so that our approach to the problem doesnt go offtarget Right Concentration provides an inner stability and bliss so that we can clearly see the roots of passion and at the same time not fear deprivation at the prospect of pulling them outThere are two levels to Right View focusing on the results of our actions in the narrative of our lives and on the issues of stress and its cessation within the mindThe first level points out the drawbacks of sensual passion sensual pleasures are fleeting unstable and stressful passion for them lies at the root of many of the ills of life ranging from the hardships of gaining and maintaining wealth to quarrels within families and wars between nationsThis level of Right View prepares us to see the indulgence of sensual passion as a problemThe second level  viewing things in terms of the four noble truths  shows us how to solve this problem in our approach to the present momentIt points out that the root of the problem lies not in the pleasures but in the passion for passion involves attachment and any attachment for pleasures based on conditions leads inevitably to stress and suffering in that all conditioned phenomena are subject to changeIn fact our attachment to sensual passion tends to be stronger and more constant than our attachments to particular pleasuresThis attachment is what has to be renouncedHow is this doneBy bringing it out into the openBoth sides of sensual attachment  as habitual patterns from the past and our willingness to give into them again in the present  are based on misunderstanding and fearAs the Buddha pointed out sensual passion depends on aberrant perceptions we project notions of constancy ease beauty and self onto things that are actually inconstant stressful unattractive and notselfThese misperceptions apply both to our passions and to their objectsWe perceive the expression of our sensuality as something appealing a deep expression of our selfidentity offering lasting pleasure we see the objects of our passion as enduring and alluring enough as lying enough under our control to provide us with a satisfaction that wont turn into its oppositeActually none of this is the case and yet we blindly believe our projections because the power of our passionate attachments has us too intimidated to look them straight in the eyeTheir special effects thus keep us dazzled and deceivedAs long as we deal only in indulgence and repression attachment can continue operating freely in the dark of the subconsciousBut when we consciously resist it it has to come to the surface articulating its threats demands and rationalizationsSo even though sensual pleasures arent evil we have to systematically forego them as a way of drawing the agendas of attachment out into the openThis is how skillful renunciation serves as a learning tool unearthing latent agendas that both indulgence and repression tend to keep undergroundAt the same time we need to provide the mind with strategies to withstand those agendas and to cut through them once they appearThis is where Right Concentration comes inAs a skillful form of indulgence Right Concentration suffuses the body with a nonsensual rapture and pleasure that can help counteract any sense of deprivation in resisting sensual passionsIn other words it provides higher pleasures  more lasting and refined  as a reward for abandoning attachment to lower onesAt the same time it gives us the stable basis we need so as not to be blown away by the assaults of our thwarted attachmentsThis stability also steadies the mindfulness and alertness we need to see through the misperceptions and delusions that underlie sensual passionAnd once the mind can see through the processes of projection perception and misperception to the greater sense of freedom that comes when they are transcended the basis for sensual passion is goneAt this stage we can then turn to analyze our attachment to the pleasures of Right ConcentrationWhen our understanding is complete we abandon all need for attachment of any sort and thus meet with the pure gold of a freedom so total that it cant be describedThe question remains how does this strategy of skillful renunciation and skillful indulgence translate into everyday practicePeople who ordain as monastics take vows of celibacy and are expected to work constantly at renouncing sensual passion but for many people this is not a viable optionThe Buddha thus recommended that his lay followers observe daylong periods of temporary renunciationFour days out of each month  traditionally on the new full and halfmoon days  they can take the eight precepts which add the following observances to the standard five celibacy no food after noon no watching of shows no listening to music no use of perfumes and cosmetics and no use of luxurious seats and bedsThe purpose of these added precepts is to place reasonable restraints on all five of the sensesThe day is then devoted to listening to the Dhamma to clarify Right View and to practicing meditation to strengthen Right ConcentrationAlthough the modern workweek can make the lunar scheduling of these daylong retreats impractical there are ways they can be integrated into weekends or other days off from workIn this way anyone interested can at regular intervals trade the cares and complexities of everyday life for the chance to master renunciation as a skill integral to the serious pursuit of happiness in the truest sense of the wordAnd isnt that an intelligent tradeNowhere in the Canon does the Buddha list the seven sets of teachings under the name of Wings to AwakeningHe mentions the seven sets as a group many times when he is summarizing his main teachings but there is no firm evidence as to whether he ever actually gave a name to the groupIn one passage he applies the term wings to selfAwakening to the five faculties and in two passages he makes reference to the seven Wings to Awakening which may or may not denote the seven setsNevertheless given the fact that the Buddha called the five faculties wings to selfAwakening and all seven sets are equivalent to the five faculties the name Wings to Awakening for all seven seems appropriateThis was the name that they definitely had in early postcanonical texts such as the Petakopadesa and that they have maintained ever sinceThe seven sets have played an important role throughout the history of Buddhism in all of its various branchesThey provided the framework for the earliest Abhidhamma texts systematic presentations of the doctrine that were added to the early Canons a few centuries after the Buddhas passing awayThey were also part of the first Buddhist text translated into Chinese and later came to exemplify Hinayana teachings in Tientai and other Chinese doctrinal systemsTantric Buddhism features mandalas containing deities symbolic of the factors making up the seven setsTibetan architecture probably following the treatises of the medieval Indian universities identifies the various parts of standard stupa design as symbols of the seven setsThus the Wings provide one of the few common threads that in actual or symbolic form run through all the traditions claiming descent from the BuddhaOne of the peculiarities of the Wings viewed as a whole is that two sets are duplicates the five faculties and the five strengths contain the same five factorsSeveral theories have been advanced as to why the Buddha included what is essentially the same set twiceOne is that he wanted to indicate that the five factors that make up each set could exist in the mind in two distinct levels of intensity one sufficient for the path to streamentry the first level of Awakening and the other needed for Arahantship the highest levelThis may parallel the passage where the Buddha makes a similar distinction between the noble eightfold path of streamentry and the tenfold path of ArahantshipThere is some disagreement among later writers as to which of the two sets the faculties or the strengths should be considered the more intense although there is one canonical passage where the term faculty seems to rank on a higher level than strengthAnother hypothesis  not necessarily at odds with the first  is that the Buddha wanted the number of factors to total because the number had symbolic meaningIn ancient times before the development of the decimal system multiplication tables were arranged in hexagonal patternsThe complete table used to calculate the ratios used in tuning musical instruments to reciprocal scales  scales that played the same notes going up as going down  had one member in the middle surrounded by three hexagonal rings containing in ascending order six twelve and eighteen members giving a total of membersThe table of wholenumber ratios that formed the basis for trigonometry and thus for the study of astronomy contained membersThus the number carried connotations of basic completenessThis principle is at work in Platos Laws where the ideal city has guardians and it may also be at work hereA related consideration may be that the number seven in the seven sets was symbolic of treasureThe universal monarch was said to have seven treasures that formed his spontaneous regalia and noble wealth consists of seven qualitiesThe Buddha explicitly borrows this number symbolism when he states that the seven sets are the treasures of his teachingAnother possibility which we have already noted is that musicians in the Buddhas time recognized seven systems for tuning the musical scale  all other systems being rejected as discordant  and the Buddha may have borrowed this numerical symbolism to suggest that his teachings formed a complete guide to all the possible ways in which a Samana  a person in tune  could tune his or her mind to the truthFrom a less historical and more practical point of view the important question about the seven sets is how they fit into the general plan of Buddhist practiceTheir role is most succinctly stated in  the development of the seven sets follows on the development of virtue and leads naturally into the development of transcendent discernment thus filling the role that other passages assign to concentration practiceThis suggests  and again the suggestion is borne out by passages that deal with the issue in more detail  that the seven sets are to be developed in the course of a concentration practice based on a moral life and aimed at the development of discernmentWhen  ends its list of preconditions for the practice of the seven sets with four meditation practices  actually three as the perception of inconstancy is an integral part of mindfulness of inandout breathing  it is simply listing the concentration practices most frequently recommended in the texts as focal points for developing the skills of the seven setsNevertheless although the seven sets focus most specifically on the practice of concentration the close interconnections among virtue concentration and discernment mean that the sets include the factors of virtue and discernment as well thus encompassing the entire path of Buddhist practiceA virtuous and moral life is an absolute prerequisite for practicing the setsThis is a point that cannot be overstated a fact reflected in the large number of canonical passages that hammer it home far too many to include in this anthologySome of the sets  the five facultiesstrengths and the noble eightfold path  actually include the practice of a virtuous life in their factors under the facultystrength of conviction and under the factors of right speech right action and right livelihood in the eightfold pathThe remaining sets the texts tell us are meant to follow on the development of personal virtue in the same way that sunrise follows on the predawn colors in the eastern skyThe texts explain the precepts that underline a virtuous life not as rules imposed by an outside authority but as guidelines for action that a person would voluntarily undertake when accepting the importance of the principles of kamma and skillful action in shaping the course of ones experiencesKilling for instance is obviously an unskillful action when viewed in the full light of its kammic consequencesThe same holds true with other actions forbidden by the precepts such as drinking alcohol stealing illicit sex lying and abusive languagePassage  shows that the Buddhas teachings on virtue consist not only of the donts of the precepts but also of the dos of such positive standards as sympathy reliability and genuine helpfulnessSkillfulness is not simply a matter of avoiding bad consequences it also actively cultivates the goodIn keeping with the teaching that kamma is essentially intention the precepts are designed to focus on the state of mind motivating the actA precept is broken only when one does so intentionallyThus the practice of observing the precepts requires constant attention to the factor of intention in ones actions it also requires that one develop the sublime attitudes of good will compassion empathetic joy and equanimity which strengthen ones ability to side with skillful intentionsIn this way the Buddhas approach to morality is to use the realm of personal action as an arena for the comprehensive training of the mindThese three aspects of the Buddhist approach to morality  the avoidance of bad kamma the development of skillful mental states and the purification of intention  follow the pattern of the heart of the Buddhas teachings as presented in the first verse of They also explain why virtue is a necessary foundation for the practice of concentration A moral life brings about absence of remorse people who in all honesty have no reason for remorse over their actions or for anxiety over the consequences of those actions feel a natural sense of inner joyThis joy is intensified when they reflect on the positive acts of kindness and generosity that they have performed for othersThus intensified this joy then provides the basis for the inner pleasure that allows for concentrationIn this way a healthy sense of selfworth is a necessary precondition for a stable mindIn addition the practice of virtue forces one to develop a number of the concentration factors in the sets themselves on a preliminary level of skill thus making them strong and fit for formal concentration practiceTo maintain a precept one must keep it constantly in mind this strengthens mindfulnessOne must stick to ones determination to abide by ones principles this strengthens persistenceOne must pay attention to the present moment for that is where the decision to keep or break a precept is made and one must remain firm in ones cultivation of the sublime attitudes these factors strengthen concentrationOne must be clear about ones motives for acting and at the same time be sensitive in knowing how to apply a particular precept to ones present situation eg being quick to see how to avoid an issue in which telling the truth might be harmful yet without telling a lieThis strengthens ones ability to analyze the mind in the present moment intensifying ones powers of discernment in generalThese four factors  mindfulness effort concentration and discernment  are the central elements in all of the seven setsThus the practice of virtue exercises on a rudimentary level the qualities of mind needed for concentration practiceA close look at the seven sets will show that a similar relationship exists between these qualities as they are developed in concentration practice and the transcendent discernment toward which they leadOn the one hand concentration is needed as a basis for discernment on the other hand discernment is exercised in developing concentration becoming more precise and penetrating as a resultTo understand how this happens we must first note that the seven sets fall into two typesThe first type consists of the four frames of reference the four right exertions and the four bases of powerEach of these sets focuses on a single factor in the concentration aggregate of the noble eightfold path the frames of reference on mindfulness the right exertions on effort and the bases of power on concentrationTheir factors are defined in such a way that the proper development of any one set involves the other two sets together with the factor of discernmentIn this sense they point out the holographic nature of the path each part must include the whole just as every piece of a hologram can reproduce the entire holographic imageThe sets included in the second type are the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for Awakening and the noble eightfold pathEach of these sets lists its factors in a causal chain progressing through a spiraling loopThe five faculties and strengths start with conviction which then leads naturally to persistence mindfulness concentration and then discernmentDiscernment in turn provides a basis for even firmer convictionSimilarly the seven factors for Awakening start with mindfulness which develops into an analysis of mental qualities persistence rapture serenity concentration and finally equanimityEquanimity in turn provides a steady basis for the further development of mindfulnessThe noble eightfold path starts out with right view and right resolve which together constitute discernment leading to right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationConcentration in turn forms a basis for the clearer development of discernmentIn this way the various factors of the path are mutually reinforcing in an upward spiral that leads to AwakeningComparing the sets in the second type with one another however we find a certain complexity in their feedback loopsIn terms of their most important factors we see that the faculties and strengths depict the causal sequence asAlthough the sequences differ they have one pattern in common concentration always follows after right effort and mindfulnessThis suggests not only that concentration depends on these two factors but also that effort and mindfulness when properly developed are meant to lead to concentrationThis suggestion is borne out in the texts that deal with these factors in detailThe two factors with the most variegated roles in these lists are mindfulness and discernmentMindfulness is essential at every step along the wayThere are passages teaching that mindfulness is a prerequisite for virtue which  together with right view  is in turn a prerequisite for right mindfulnessSimilarly mindfulness is necessary for concentration which in turn can be devoted to the development of greater mindfulness which can lead further to discernmentAs for discernment If we look at the lists placing discernment after the other factors we find that certain aspects of discernment are presumed by the earlier factorsIn the five faculties for instance conviction includes belief in the principle of kamma which is one of the elements of right discernmentIn the lists that place discernment toward the beginning of the process we find transcendent discernment added on to the end the seven factors for Awakening when fully developed lead to clear knowing and release when the noble eightfold path reaches the point of full Awakening it leads to right knowledge and right releaseThe implication here is that discernment functioning on different levels keeps adding feedback loops of ever greater sensitivity every step along the wayThis point is made explicit in For this reason skillfulness  as a constant sensitive mindfulness and discernment toward ones own actions  lies at the essence of every moment in the continued development of the pathOn the one hand it creates the conditions necessary for the path to develop knowledge of what is skillful and unskillful must necessarily precede right effort and mindfulness and must help mindfulness lead to concentrationOn the other hand the factors of mindfulness and concentration are necessary for discernment to become even more sensitive to the present momentThus as the path spirals through its many feedback loops it exercises discernment making it stronger in the same way that muscles are strengthened with exerciseAt the same time the development of the path steadies the conditions that provide discernment with the solid basis it needs to become more and more precise just as a solid foundation is necessary for sensitive measuring equipmentIn this way discernment develops from a knowledge of what is skillful and unskillful first gained through the advice and example of others on through a more intuitive understanding of skillfulness gained through repeated action and reflection on ones actions to a knowledge in terms of the four noble truths and the duties appropriate to each and finally to the knowledge that those duties have been fulfilledThe Wings thus put mundane discernment to use and in so doing make it transcendentAll of this explains why the Buddha said that of all the wings to selfAwakening discernment is chiefIn its more rudimentary forms it provides the conditions and feedback necessary for each step along the way its transcendent form at the culmination of the path leads directly to AwakeningThe experience of Awakening according to the texts can take any one of four levelsIn all four levels the basic dynamic is the same virtue concentration and discernment bring the mind skillfully to a state of nonfashioning where all present input into the cycle of kamma is suspendedThis state of nonfashioning then opens the way for the experience of the UnfabricatedTo put this in terms of the two knowledges that constitute Awakening the skillful mastery of the processes of kamma to the point of nonfashioning corresponds to the knowledge of the regularity of the Dhamma the experience of the Unfabricated corresponds to the knowledge of UnbindingAlthough all four levels require mature levels of the path factors of virtue concentration and discernment to bring about the two knowledges that constitute Awakening they differ in the relative maturity of the path factors that lead up to themStreamentry occurs at the full maturation of virtue nonreturning at the full maturation of concentration and Arahantship at the full maturation of discernmentThus they also differ in the depth to which they penetrate the two knowledges of Awakening and in their ability to cut the fetters that perpetuate bondage to the cycle of kamma and rebirthThe texts report a few cases where meditators go straight through all four levels to the level of Arahantship but in most cases the meditator will pass through the four levels stepbystep sometimes over course of many years or even several lifetimesIn this book except where otherwise noted discussions of the Awakening experience as described in the discourses focus on the level where virtue concentration and discernment are all fully mature the Awakening total and the resulting freedom absolutely unlimitedThis is the point where all seven sets of the Wings to Awakening ultimately aimPahārāda just as the ocean has these many treasures of various kinds  pearls sapphires lapis lazuli shells quartz coral silver gold rubies  cats eyes  in the same way this doctrine  discipline has these many treasures of various kinds the four frames of reference the four right exertions the four

having known them directly You should grasp them thoroughly cultivate them develop them  pursue them so that this holy life may long endure  remain steadfast for the benefit welfare  happiness of the multitude out of sympathy for the world for the benefit welfare  happiness of human  celestial beingsAnd what are those qualitiesThe four frames of reference the four right exertions the four bases of

spiked claws or beaks and hatch out safelyWhy is thatBecause the hen has not covered them rightly warmed them rightly or incubated them rightlyIn the same way even though this wish may occur to a monk

down that much or the day before yesterday it wore down this much still he knows it is worn through when it is worn throughIn the same way when a monk dwells devoting himself to development he does not know Today my effluents wore down this much or yesterday they wore down that much or the day before yesterday they wore down this much still he knows they are worn through when they are worn throughJust as when an oceangoing ship rigged with masts  stays after six months on the water is left on shore for the winter Its stays weathered by the heat  wind moistened by the clouds of the rainy season easily wither  rot awayIn the same way when a monk dwells devoting himself to development his fetters easily wither  rot awayA certain monk went to his preceptor and on arrival said to him My body sir now feels like its druggedIve lost my bearingsThings are unclear to meSloth  drowsiness surround my mind at all timesI am unhappy in leading the holy lifeI have doubts about mental qualitiesThen the preceptor taking his student went to see the Buddha Thats the way it is for a person who doesnt guard the doors to his sense faculties who doesnt know moderation in eating who isnt devoted to wakefulness who doesnt clearly understand skillful qualities and who isnt devoted day after day to the development of the wings to Awakening Thus you should train yourself monk I will guard my senses will know moderation in eating will devote myself to wakefulness will clearly understand skillful qualities and will devote myself day after day to the development of the wings to awakening Thats how you should train yourselfThen the monk having received this instruction from the Blessed One got up from his seat bowed down circled the Blessed One keeping him on his right and then went awayDwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing it  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus he became another one of the ArahantsEndowed with three qualities a monk is one who follows the way that cannot be faulted and he has aroused the basis for ending the effluentsWhich threeThere is the case where a monk guards the doors to his sense faculties knows moderation in eating  is devoted to wakefulnessAnd how does a monk guard the doors to his sense facultiesThere is the case where a monk on seeing a form with the eye does not grasp at any theme or variations by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail himHe practices with restraintHe guards the faculty of the eyeHe achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the eyeThis is how a monk guards the doors to his sense facultiesAnd how does a monk know moderation in eatingThere is the case where a monk considering it appropriately takes his food not playfully nor for intoxication nor for putting on bulk nor for beautification but simply for the survival  continuance of this body for ending its afflictions for the support of the holy life thinking I will destroy old feelings  not create new feelingsThus I will maintain myself be blameless  live in comfort This is how a monk knows moderation in eatingAnd how is a monk devoted to wakefulnessThere is the case where a monk during the day sitting  pacing back  forth cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in checkDuring the first watch of the night sitting  pacing back  forth he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in checkDuring the second watch of the night reclining on his right side he takes up the lions posture one foot placed on top of the other mindful alert with his mind set on getting upDuring the last watch of the night sitting  pacing back  forth he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in checkThis is how a monk is devoted to wakefulnessEndowed with these three qualities a monk is one who follows the way that cannot be faulted and he has aroused the basis for ending the effluentsMonks if wanderers who are members of other sects should ask you What friend are the prerequisites for the development of the wings to selfawakening you should answer There is the case where a monk has admirable people as friends companions  colleaguesThis is the first prerequisite for the development of the wings to

this doctrine  discipline he is called one who is complete fulfilled supreme among menThe four frames of reference are a set of teachings that show where a meditator should focus attention and howThis dual role  the where and the how  is reflected in the fact that the term satipatthana can be explained etymologically in two waysOn the one hand it can be regarded as a compound of sati and patthana thus referring to the object kept in mind as a frame of reference for giving context to ones experienceAlternatively satipatthana can be seen as a compound of sati and upatthana thus referring to the approach of keeping something closely in mind of establishing and maintaining a solid frame of referenceScholars are divided as to which interpretation is right but for all practical purposes they both areThe Buddha was more a poet than a strict etymologist and he may have deliberately chosen an ambiguous term that would have fruitful meanings on more than one levelIn the practice of the frames of reference both the proper object and the proper approach are crucial for getting the proper resultsIn fact as we shall see the taking of a proper object entails the beginning of the proper approach and the approach ends by taking as its objects the qualities of mind developed in the course of pursuing the approach itselfIn other words as we mentioned in the Introduction concerning the Buddhas Awakening the what merges with the how as the how of the investigation ultimately becomes what gets investigatedThe texts give two different pictures of the role that the frames of reference play in the practiceSome state that developing the frames of reference is a precondition for jhāna which then forms a basis for transcendent discernmentOthers make no mention of jhāna stating that one goes directly from the frames of reference to the transcendentOn the surface this would seem to indicate that there are two alternate paths one with and one without jhānaThis reading though contradicts the many passages maintaining that jhāna is necessary for the development of transcendent discernmentThus we must look for an alternative reading and we find one suggested by passages indicating that the development of the frames of reference implicitly entails the full development of the seven factors for AwakeningBecause these factors are closely associated with jhāna this would indicate that the proper development of the frames of reference necessarily incorporates in and of itself the practice of jhānaThis reading is confirmed by  which states that the way to develop the frames of reference is through the noble eightfold path which includes jhānaIt is also confirmed by  which describes how the frames of reference relate to the sixteen steps of breath meditationAs we shall see in IIIE these sixteen steps are also a description of how jhāna is developed and then used as a vehicle for fostering discernment and ending the effluents of the mindThus we can view the outline of framesofreference practice as a description of the stages in the mindful mastery of jhāna and its application to the ending of the effluentsThe proper objects that act as frames of reference are four the body in and of itself feelings in and of themselves the mind in and of itself and mental qualities in and of themselvesThe in and of itself here is importantTo take the body as a frame of reference in this way for instance means that one views it not in terms of its function in the world  for then the world would be the frame of reference  but simply on its own terms as it is directly experiencedIn other words one is not concerned with its relative worth or utility in terms of the values of the world  its beauty strength agility etc but simply how it appears when regarded in and of itselfThe four objects that act as frames of reference fall into two classesThe first class  the body feelings and the mind  act as the given objects of meditation practice what experience presents on its own as an object for meditationThe meditator takes any one of these objects as a frame of reference relating all of experience to hisher chosen frameFor example although one will experience feelings and mind states in the course of taking the body as a frame of reference one tries to relate them to the experience of the body as their primary frameA feeling is viewed as it affects the body or the body affects itThe same holds for a mind stateAn analogy for this practice is holding an object in ones handWhen other objects come into contact with the hand one is aware that they are making contact but one does not let go of the object in ones hand in order to grasp after themThe second class of objects  mental qualities  denotes the qualities of mind that are developed and abandoned as one masters the meditationThe list of dhammas given in  would seem to belie the translation mental qualities here as they include not only the five hindrances and seven factors for Awakening which are obviously mental qualities but also the five aggregates the six sense media and the four noble truths which would seem to fit better with another meaning of the word dhamma ie phenomena However if we look more closely at each of these other classes we will see that they actually deal with variant forms of abandoning the hindrances and developing the factors for AwakeningThe section on the sense media focuses less on the media than on the abandoning of the fetters  passion and delight  associated with those mediaThe section on the aggregates describes a state of practice that is elsewhere identified as a developed form of concentration in which the aggregates that comprise the state of jhāna form the object of analysisThe section on the noble truths describes a state of practice that elsewhere is said to require the sort of mental stability and clarity found only in jhānaThus all the approaches to dhammas in and of themselves would appear to be variations on the abandoning of the hindrances and the development of the factors for AwakeningBecause the stated function of the frames of reference is to bring about the culmination of the factors for Awakening and through them the development of clear knowing and release the translation of dhamma as mental quality seems an appropriate way to keep that function in mind and to avoid getting lost in the details of its different aspectsThere is historical support for this interpretation as wellThe Vibhanga an ancient Abhidhamma text includes only the hindrances and the factors for Awakening in its discussion of this headingThe same holds true with the Sarvastivadin version of this discourse preserved in Chinese translationScholars have questioned whether these two texts should be taken as evidence that the original discussion of dhamma here included only these two topicsThe issue is impossible to decide from the texts available to us but a case can be made for concluding that regardless of what the original version may have been the early tradition regarded the abandoning of the hindrances and the development of the factors for Awakening as encompassing all the factors that might be included under this headingEach of the four objects of mindfulness is said to be sufficient for bringing about AwakeningThis point is easy to understand if we look at the approach taken to each of the objects for then it becomes clear that the approach ultimately involves the development of mental qualities in and of themselves regardless of what object is first taken up for meditationThat approach falls into three stagesThe first stage  here taking the body as an example  is simply called the frame of referenceFour terms in this passage are keyRemaining focused can also be translated as keeping track This denotes the element of concentration in the practice as one tries to stay with one particular theme in the midst of the welter of experienceArdent denotes the factor of effort or exertion in the practice the Commentary equates this with right exertion which contains an element of discernment in its ability to distinguish skillful from unskillful mental qualitiesAlert means being clearly aware of what is happening in the presentThis too relates to discernmentMindful literally means being able to remember or recollectHere it means keeping ones task in mindThe task here is a dual one  remaining focused on ones frame of reference and putting aside the distractions of greed and distress that would come from shifting ones frame of reference back to the worldIn other words one tries to stay with the phenomenology of immediate experience without slipping back into the narratives and world views that make up ones sense of the worldIn essence this is a concentration practice with the three qualities of ardency alertness and mindfulness devoted to attaining concentrationMindfulness keeps the theme of the meditation in mind alertness observes the theme as it is present to awareness and also is aware of when the mind has slipped from its themeMindfulness then remembers where the mind should be focused and ardency tries to return the mind to its proper theme  and to keep it there  as quickly and skillfully as possibleIn this way these three qualities help to seclude the mind from sensual preoccupations and unskillful mental qualities thus bringing it to the first jhānaPassage  confirms this reading by equating the successful performance of this first stage in the practice with the first jhāna whereas  give advice on how to bring the mind to concentration if this method does not work focus on the problem of the minds not settling down and bring the mind to an inspiring theme that will accomplish the desired endWhen the method does work  describes the next step as a variation on the basic exerciseThis it says takes the mind to the second jhāna where directed thoughts and evaluations are abandonedFrom there the mind can go up to the third jhāna and the fourthThese points may be illustrated with some meditation techniques that are currently popular in the West In a mental noting practice mindfulness is a matter of remembering to keep up the noting alertness means seeing whatever phenomena arise to be noted and ardency is a matter of sticking with the noting relentlessly and being ever more quick and precise in ones alertnessIn terms of the factors constituting jhāna practice the mindfulness and alertness here would be related to directed thought ardency to singleness of preoccupation while alertness aimed at evaluating the results of the noting  and ardency in keeping the pressure of the noting just right  would be related to evaluationIf this practice is then conducted in line with the texts it should reach a stage where the mind settles down into the singleness of the first jhānaThen the meditator would be encouraged to stop the noting so that the mind could engage in the subtler mindfulness and alertness leading to the second jhānaIn a scanning or body sweep practice mindfulness means remembering to stick with the process of scanning the body while alertness would mean seeing the subtle sensations of the body being scannedArdency would mean sticking with the scanning process and trying to be ever more sensitive to the subtlest sensationsAs in the previous case these activities are related to factors of jhāna and the process if conducted in line with the texts should culminate in a state of fullbodied singleness at which time the motion of the scanning can be brought to stillness and the mind can enter deeper concentrationIn breath practice mindfulness means keeping the breath in mind as the theme of the meditation alertness means being sensitive to the sensations of the breathArdency means sticking with the process relentlessly as well as taking up the stages of training in which one tries to be aware of the entire body with each in and out breath and to let the breath sensations grow calmIn terms of jhāna factors mindfulness would be related to directed thought alertness to evaluation and ardency to singleness of preoccupationAs awareness fills the body and the breath grows calm ones alertness stays steadily with the breath and the mind enters the singleness of jhānaAt this point one no longer needs consciously to direct the mind to the breath or to enlarge ones awareness any furtherThus the mind as above can develop subtler mindfulness and alertness to enter the second jhānaAccording to  once concentration has been established on ones own body in this way it may give rise to a similar knowledge and vision of the bodies of other peopleKnowledge and vision here seems to denote intuitive knowledge through the psychic powers that some people develop through concentrationIf used properly this knowledge can help develop a sense of dispassion toward the processes of existence as one sees that all bodies even the most desirable are subject to the same common shortcomings of being inconstant stressful and notselfWhether one pursues this meditation with ones own body or the bodies of others it comes under the first stage of practice as indicated by the following phraseIn this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or externally on the body in  of itself or both internally  externally on the body in  of itselfOnce the first stage has produced a solid state of concentration the second stage  the development of the frame of reference  can beginOne remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to the bodyThe phenomenon of origination and passing away covers three sorts of events conditioned occurrences in the object that forms ones frame of reference itself events in the other two object frames of reference or events in the approach frame of reference ie the mental qualities that are developed in the process of taking a frame of reference to begin withFor instance when focused on the body one may notice the arising and passing away of breath sensations in the bodyOr one might notice the arising and passing away of feelings of pleasure or mental states of irritation while one remains anchored in the bodyOr one might notice lapses of mindfulness in ones focus on the bodyIn each of these cases if the origination and passing away is of neutral events such as the aggregates one is directed simply to be aware of them as events and to let them follow their natural course unimpeded so as to see what factors accompany them and lead to their originationAs for events connected with the presence or absence of skillfulness however one is encouraged to manipulate and experiment with them so as to observe and further understand their causal interrelationshipsThis will enable one to become skillful in maximizing skillful mental qualities and minimizing unskillful onesIn other words one develops insight into the process of origination and passing away by taking an active and sensitive role in the process just as one learns about eggs by trying to cook with them gathering experience from ones successes and failures in attempting increasingly difficult dishesThe need for active participation in the practice explains why meditation must begin by mastering a particular technique rather than passively watching whatever may arise in the presentThe technique gives shape to ones present input into the present moment and makes one more sensitive to this aspect of thisthat conditionalityIt also provides an active context for appreciating mental qualities as they help or hinder ones success in the techniqueEventually when ones sensitivity is sufficiently well developed one can go beyond the technique to explore and master the process of causality as it functions in developing skillful qualities in the mindThis process can be illustrated with the passage devoted to equanimityIn the first step as one is still in the beginning stages of observing the mind in its attempts at meditation one simply discerns the presence and absence of equanimityThere is the case where there being equanimity as a factor for Awakening present within he discerns that Equanimity as a factor for Awakening is present within me Or there being no equanimity as a factor for Awakening present within he discerns that Equanimity as a factor for Awakening is not present within meIn watching the course of this arising and passing away as one tries to bring the mind to the equanimity of jhāna one should begin to see patterns of cause and effect in what does and doesnt workThis enables one skillfully to give rise to equanimity even when it is not present of its own accord and  once it is present  can strengthen it until it reaches the point of utmost developmentHe discerns how there is the arising of unarisen equanimity as a factor for AwakeningAnd he discerns how there is the culmination of the development of equanimity as a factor for Awakening once it has arisenA similar process is recommended for events in the object frames of referenceThis is shown by the standard description of the sixteen steps of breath meditationOne trains oneself to breathe conscious of the entire body or to breathe sensitive to feelings of rapture and pleasure as this training fosters the factors of jhānaOne trains oneself to satisfy steady and release the mind as this training brings mastery over the stages of jhānaPassage  makes a similar point directing the meditator to replace unskillful forms of distress joy and equanimity with more skillful versions of the same emotions and then replacing skillful distress with skillful joy and skillful joy with skillful equanimityAs this process leads to stronger and more refined states of concentration it refines ones sensitivity to the fact that the grosser ones participation in the process of origination and passing away in the mind the grosser the level of stress that resultsThis leads one to let go of the grosser levels of ones participation as one is able to detect themThis can have one of two resultsIt may lead to even more refined states of concentration as one abandons the factors that obscure equanimity or as one focuses ones equanimity on ever more refined objectsOr as one becomes able to focus on the activity involved even in refining equanimity one comes to realize that it too is a process of input into the present fabricated for the sake of nonbecomingThus as a sense of dispassion develops toward equanimity one goes beyond it to the state of nonfashioning through the third and final stage of framesofreference practiceOr his mindfulness that There is a body  is maintained to the extent of knowledge  recollectionAnd he remains independent unsustained by anything in the worldThis stage corresponds to a mode of perception that the Buddha in MN terms entry into emptinessThus he regards it as empty of whatever is not thereWhatever remains he discerns as present there is thisThis is the culminating equipoise where the path of the practice leads unmediated to a state of nonfashioning and from there to the fruit of Awakening and releaseSome meditators reading the two preceding passages try to step immediately to the stage of nonfashioning without first having gained the inner sensitivity to cause and effect action and nonaction that comes from developing concentrationIn practice though this doesnt workOnly through that sensitivity can the basic causal relationships of dependent coarising and thisthat conditionality be discoveredThis discovery is needed to give rise to a sense of dispassion as one grows more and more disenchanted with the inconstant and artificial nature of all mental phenomena and develops a strong desire to gain release from themIt is also needed to uncover the precise point of nonfashioning between becoming and nonbecoming where that release can be foundAs we shall see in later sections the basic pattern of the three stages in framesofreference meditation is basic to all aspects of Buddhist meditation practiceAmong other things it underlies the stages in breath meditation the mastery of concentration and the strategy of discernment leading to the transcendentThus it should be kept firmly in mind when reading passages not only in this section but also throughout the entire bookThe texts contained in this section for the most part provide added details to the outline sketched hereFor example  provide a variation on stage two by showing how mindfulness can be developed into equanimity by manipulating perceptions viewing loathsome objects as unloathsome and unloathsome objects as loathsome etcAnyone attempting these perception games needs firm powers of concentration and sharp discernment so as not to become obsessed with perceptual distortionsIf handled properly though the process of manipulation gives important insights into the way the mind labels its objects and can drive home lessons on the arbitrary nature of perception and the need not to be deceived by itThe same point holds true for the contemplation of body parts mentioned in This contemplation has been denounced in Western circles for promoting a negative selfimage but here it is necessary to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy negative images of ones own bodyAn unhealthy negative image is one that views the bodies of other people as attractive and ones own as unattractiveThis is unhealthy in that it creates feelings of inferiority concerning ones own body compounded by lust and desire for the bodies of othersA healthy negative image sees that all bodies no matter how attractive young or healthy they may seem at the skin level are composed of the very same parts all equally unattractiveThe livers and intestines of even the most attractive people if paraded down a walkway would never capture a title in a beauty contest if featured in an advertisement they wouldnt sellThus there is no real reason to feel that ones body is inherently inferior to theirsThis perception of the equality of all bodies if handled properly is healthy in that it helps liberate one not only from feelings of inferiority and superiority but also from the disease of lust and desire promoting a sense of dispassion toward lustful thoughts in generalAs this theme of contemplation is developed through handson manipulation of ones perception of the body it enables one to realize that when reduced to their simple bodyness as bodies in and of themselves all bodies are on a par and that questions of attractiveness and unattractiveness derive ultimately from the context of ones frame of referenceOne sees that the obstacles to equanimity and higher insights in the practice are not so much the objects of lust or hatred as they are the terms and contexts in which those objects are perceivedThis insight can form the basis for perceptual skills that can act as a very liberating antidote to the minds tendency to selfdelusionOne passage contained here that does not deal with the stages of framesofreference meditation is This passage focuses on a charge that has been often leveled at Early Buddhism that the practice it recommends is essentially selfish in that one is striving simply for ones own welfareThe Buddha answers this charge by denying any radical distinction between ones own true welfare and that of othersTo work for the true welfare of others is to work for ones own true welfare to work for ones own is to work for theirsThe first point can be illustrated by a number of passages in this collection  showing for example how expressions of gratitude to ones parents can foster ones own true happiness how support for contemplatives enables one to hear the Dhamma how virtuous conduct toward other people and their possessions strengthens mindfulness and how attitudes of good will compassion empathetic joy and equanimity foster concentration and release the mind from obstructive mental qualitiesThus the quality of ones assistance to others cannot help but have an effect on the development of ones own mindAs for the reverse dynamic  the way in which working for ones own welfare also works for the welfare of others  the Buddha illustrates this point with a perceptive analogy for the interaction of living beings two acrobats balancing on the end of a poleIf one acrobat loses balance both will fallFor both to stay balanced each must maintain his or her own balanceThis analogy indicates that the act of developing good qualities in ones own mind is in itself an act of kindness to othersOne protects them from the detrimental effects of ones uncontrolled anger etc and exposes them to the beneficial effects of ones own mindfulness equanimity and other skillful qualitiesThus it is not possible to practice the frames of reference properly without the rest of the worlds benefiting to a greater or lesser degreeAnd in a world where no one can keep the balance of another person the example of ones own skill in keeping balance is an instructive gift for those with the eyes to see and the intelligence to take ones example to heartOnce one has attained full Awakening and needs to do nothing more for ones own welfare one continues to act for the welfare of others within the framework of three frames of reference different from the four discussed in this sectionThe three are the ability to remain untroubled mindful and alert when others do not respond to ones teachings equanimous mindful and alert when some do and some do not respond to ones teachings and untroubled mindful and alert when others do respond to ones teachingsIn other words ones mental balance is so firm that others success or failure in responding to ones help cannot disturb the mindIt is only in this context  the three frames of reference following full Awakening  that the Buddha allows for the possibility of helping others with no thought for ones own welfare for at that point ones true welfare has no further needsThe Awakened person lives out the remainder of hisher life insofar as hisher kamma allows for the welfare of the many the happiness of the many out of compassion for the worldImagine a tree devoid of branches  leaves Its buds dont grow to maturity its bark doesnt grow to maturity its sapwood doesnt grow to maturity its heartwood doesnt grow to maturityIn the same way when  there being no mindfulness or alertness  a person is devoid of mindfulness or alertness the prerequisite for a sense of shame  compunction becomes spoiledThere being no sense of shame  compunction the prerequisite for restraint of the senses becomes spoiledThere being no restraint of the senses the prerequisite for virtue becomes spoiledThere being no virtue the prerequisite for right concentration becomes spoiledThere being no right concentration the prerequisite for knowledge  vision of things as they have come to be becomes spoiledThere being no knowledge  vision of things as they have come to be the prerequisite for disenchantment  dispassion becomes spoiledThere being no disenchantment  dispassion the prerequisite for knowledge  vision of release becomes spoiledNow imagine a tree abundant in its branches  leaves Its buds grow to maturity its bark grows to maturity its sapwood grows to maturity its heartwood grows to maturityIn the same way when  there being mindfulness  alertness  a person is abundant in mindfulness  alertness the prerequisite for a sense of shame  compunction becomes abundantThere being a sense of shame  compunction the prerequisite for restraint of the senses becomes abundantThere being restraint of the senses the prerequisite for virtue becomes abundantThere being virtue the prerequisite for right concentration becomes abundantThere being right concentration the prerequisite for knowledge  vision of things as they have come to be becomes abundantThere being knowledge  vision of things as they have come to be the prerequisite for disenchantment  dispassion becomes abundantThere being disenchantment

gone to the wilderness to the foot of a tree or to an empty building  sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes outBreathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long Or breathing in short he discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns I am breathing out short He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication Just as a skilled turner or his apprentice when making a long turn discerns I am making a long turn or when making a short turn discerns I am making a short turn in the same way the monk when breathing in long discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long He trains himself I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out calming bodily fabricationIn this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or externally on the body in  of itself or both internally  externally on the body in  of itselfOr he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to the bodyOr his mindfulness that There is a body is maintained to the extent of

standing he discerns I am standing When sitting he discerns I am sitting When lying down he discerns I am lying down Or however his body is disposed that is how he discerns itIn this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or focused externally unsustained by anything in the worldThis is how a monk remains focused on the body in  of itselfFurthermore when going forward  returning he makes himself fully alert when looking toward  looking away when bending  extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe  his bowl when eating drinking chewing  savoring

full of various kinds of unclean things In this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small

remnant of clingingsustenance  nonreturnLet alone seven yearsIf anyone would develop these four frames of reference in this way for six years five four three two years one year seven months six months five four three two months one month half a month then one of two fruits can be expected for him either gnosis right here  now or  if there be any remnant of clingingsustenance  nonreturnLet alone half a monthIf anyone would develop these four frames of reference in this way for seven days then one of two fruits can be expected for him either gnosis right here  now or  if there be any remnant of clingingsustenance  nonreturnThis is the direct path for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow  lamentation for the disappearance of pain  distress for the attainment of the right method  for the realization of Unbinding  in other words the four frames of reference Thus was it said and in reference to this was it saidIn practiceNow how does mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued bring the four frames of reference to culminationOn whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long discerns I am breathing out long or breathing in short discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short discerns I am breathing out short trains himself I will breathe inout sensitive to the entire body trains himself I will breathe inout calming bodily fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldI tell you monks that this  the inout breath  is classed as a body among bodies which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldOn whatever occasion a monk trains himself I will breathe inout sensitive to rapture trains himself I will breathe inout sensitive to pleasure trains himself I will breathe inout sensitive to mental fabrication trains himself I will breathe inout calming mental fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldI tell you monks that this  close attention to inout breaths  is classed as a feeling among feelings which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldOn whatever occasion a monk trains himself I will breathe inout sensitive to the mind trains himself I will breathe inout gladdening the mind trains himself I will breathe inout steadying the mind trains himself I will breathe inout releasing the mind On that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldI dont say that there is mindfulness of inout breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no alertness which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldOn whatever occasion a monk trains himself I will breathe inout focusing on inconstancy trains himself I will breathe inout focusing on dispassion trains himself I will breathe inout focusing on cessation trains himself I will breathe inout focusing on relinquishment On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldHe who sees clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed  distress is one who oversees with equanimity which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldThis is how mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued brings the four frames of reference to culminationInternal  ExternalThere is the case where a monk remains focused internally on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldAs he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself he becomes rightly concentrated there and rightly clearRightly concentrated there and rightly clear he gives rise to

with reference to the worldHe remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldJust as if an elephant trainer were to plant a large post in the ground and were to bind a forest elephant to it by the neck in order to break it of its forest habits its forest memories  resolves its distraction fatigue  fever over leaving the forest to make it delight in the town and to inculcate in it habits congenial to human beings in the same way these four frames of reference are bindings for the awareness of the disciple of the noble ones to break him of his household habits his household memories  resolves his distraction fatigue  fever over leaving the household life for the attainment of the right method and the realization of UnbindingThen the Tathāgata trains him further Come monk remain focused on the body in  of itself but do not think any thoughts connected with the bodyRemain

by you to develop the four frames of referenceTaking NoteSuppose that there is a foolish inexperienced unskillful cook who has presented a king or a kings minister with various kinds of curry mainly sour mainly bitter mainly peppery mainly sweet alkaline or nonalkaline salty or nonsaltyHe does not take note of his master thinking Today my master likes this curry or he reaches out for that curry or he takes a lot of this curry or he praises that curry As a result he is not rewarded with clothing or wages or giftsWhy is thatBecause the foolish inexperienced unskillful cook does not pick up on the theme of his own masterIn the same way there are cases where a foolish inexperienced unskillful monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldAs he remains thus focused on the body in  of itself his mind does not become concentrated his defilements are not abandonedHe does not take note of that factHe remains focused on feelings in  of themselves the mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldAs he remains thus focused on mental qualities in  of themselves his mind does not become concentrated his defilements are not abandonedHe does not take note of that factAs a result he is not rewarded with a pleasant abiding here  now nor with mindfulness  alertnessWhy is thatBecause the foolish inexperienced unskillful monk does not take note of his own mindNow suppose that there is a wise experienced skillful

mindDirecting  Not Directing the Mindnanda if a monk or nun remains with mind well established in the four frames of reference heshe may be expected to realize greaterthanever distinctionThere is the case of a monk who remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldAs he remains thus focused on the body in  of itself a fever based on the body arises within his body or there is sluggishness in his awareness or his mind becomes scattered externallyHe should then direct his mind to any inspiring themeAs his mind is directed to any inspiring theme delight arises within himIn one who feels delight rapture arisesIn one whose mind is enraptured the body grows sereneHis body serene he feels pleasureAs he feels pleasure his mind grows concentratedHe reflects I have attained the aim to which my mind was directedLet me withdraw He withdraws  engages neither in directed thought nor in evaluationHe discerns I am not thinking or evaluatingI am inwardly mindful  at easeFurthermore he remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldAs he remains thus focused on mental qualities in  of themselves a fever based on mental qualities arises within his body or there is sluggishness in his awareness or his mind becomes scattered externallyHe should then direct his mind to any inspiring themeAs his mind is directed to any inspiring theme delight arises within himIn one who feels delight rapture arisesIn one whose mind is enraptured the body grows sereneHis body serene he is sensitive to pleasureAs he feels pleasure his mind grows concentratedHe reflects I have attained the aim to which my mind was directedLet me withdraw He withdraws  engages neither in directed thought nor in evaluationHe discerns I am not thinking or evaluatingI am inwardly mindful  at easeThis nanda is development based on directingAnd what is development based on not directingA monk when not directing his mind to external things discerns My mind is not directed to external thingsIt is unconstricted front  back  released  undirectedAnd furthermore I remain focused on the body in  of itselfI am ardent alert mindful  at easeWhen not directing his mind to external things he discerns My mind is not directed to external thingsIt is unconstricted front  back  released  undirectedAnd furthermore I remain focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselvesI am ardent alert mindful  at easeThis nanda is development based on not directingNow nanda I have taught you development based on directing and development based on not directingWhat a teacher should do out of compassion for his disciples seeking their welfare that I have done for youOver there are the foot of treesOver there are empty dwellingsPractice jhāna nandaDo not be heedlessDo not be remorseful in the futureThat is our instruction to you allProper RangeOnce a hawk suddenly swooped down on a quail and seized itThen the quail as it was being carried off by the hawk lamented O just my bad luck and lack of merit that I was wandering out of my proper range and into the territory of othersIf only I had kept to my proper range today to my own ancestral territory this hawk would have been no match for me in battleBut what is your proper range the hawk askedWhat is your own ancestral territoryA newly plowed field with clumps of earth all turned upSo the hawk without bragging about its own strength without mentioning its own strength let go of the quailGo quail but even when you have gone there you wont escape meThen the quail having gone to a newly plowed field with clumps of earth all turned up and climbing up on top of a large clump of earth stood taunting the hawk Now come and get me you hawkNow come and get me you hawkSo the hawk without bragging about its own strength without mentioning its own strength folded its two wings and suddenly swooped down toward the quailWhen the quail knew The hawk is coming at me full speed it slipped behind the clump of earth and right there the hawk shattered its breastThis is what happens to anyone who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of othersFor this reason you should not wander into what is not your proper range and is the territory of othersIn one who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of others Māra gains an opening Māra gains a footholdAnd what for a monk is not his proper range and is the territory of othersThe five strings of sensualityWhich fiveForms cognizable by the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingSounds cognizable by the ear Smells cognizable by the nose Tastes cognizable by the tongue Tactile sensations cognizable by the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingThese for a monk are not his proper range and are the territory of othersWander monks in what is your proper range your own ancestral territoryIn one who wanders in what is his proper range his own ancestral territory Māra gains no opening Māra gains no footholdAnd what for a monk is his proper range his own ancestral territoryThe four frames of reference This for a monk is his proper range his own ancestral territoryProper RangeThere are in the Himalayas the king of mountains difficult uneven areas where neither monkeys nor human beings wanderThere are difficult uneven areas where monkeys wander but not human beingsThere are level stretches of land delightful where both monkeys and human beings wanderIn such spots hunters set a tar trap in the monkeys tracks in order to catch some monkeysThose monkeys who are not foolish or careless by nature when they see the tar trap avoid it from afarBut any monkey who is foolish  careless by nature comes up to the tar trap and grabs it with its pawHe gets stuck thereThinking Ill free my paw he grabs it with his other pawHe gets stuck thereThinking Ill free both of my paws he grabs it with his footHe gets stuck thereThinking Ill free both of my paws and my foot he grabs it with his other footHe gets stuck thereThinking Ill free both of my paws and my feet as well he grabs it with his mouthHe gets stuck thereSo the monkey snared in five ways lies there whimpering having fallen on misfortune fallen on ruin a prey to whatever the hunter wants to do with himThen the hunter without releasing the monkey skewers him right there picks him up and goes off as he likesThis is what happens to anyone who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of othersFor this reason you should not wander into what is not your proper range and is the territory of othersMindfulness of the BodyThere is the case where a monk seeing a form with the eye is obsessed with pleasing forms is repelled by unpleasing forms and remains with bodymindfulness unestablished with limited awarenessHe does not discern as it has come to be the awarenessrelease the discernmentrelease where any evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without traceJust as if a person catching six animals of different ranges of different habitats were to bind them with a strong ropeCatching a snake he would bind it with a strong ropeCatching a crocodile a bird a dog a hyena a monkey he would bind it with a strong ropeBinding them all with a strong rope and tying a knot in the middle he would set chase to themThen those six animals of different ranges of different habitats would each pull toward its own range  habitatThe snake would pull thinking Ill go into the anthill The crocodile would pull thinking Ill go into the water The bird would pull thinking Ill fly up into the air The dog would pull thinking Ill go into the village The hyena would pull thinking Ill go into the charnel ground The monkey would pull thinking Ill go into the forest And when these six animals became internally exhausted they would submit they would surrender they would come under the sway of whichever among them was the strongestIn the same way when a monk whose mindfulness immersed in the body is undeveloped  unpursued the eye pulls toward pleasing forms while unpleasing forms are repellent the ear pulls toward pleasing sounds the nose pulls toward pleasing smells the tongue pulls toward pleasing tastes the body pulls toward pleasing tactile sensations the intellect pulls toward pleasing ideas while unpleasing ideas are repellentThis monks is lack of restraintAnd what is restraintThere is the case where a monk seeing a form with the eye is not obsessed with pleasing forms is not repelled by unpleasing forms and remains with bodymindfulness established with immeasurable awarenessHe discerns as it has come to be the awarenessrelease the discernmentrelease where all evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without traceJust as if a person catching six animals of different ranges of different habitats were to bind them with a strong rope and tether them to a strong post or stakeThen those six animals of different ranges of different habitats would each pull toward its own range  habitat And when these six animals became internally exhausted they would stand sit or lie down right there next to the post or stakeIn the same way when a monk whose mindfulness immersed in the body is developed  pursued the eye does not pull toward pleasing forms and unpleasing forms are not repellent the ear does not pull toward pleasing sounds the nose does not pull toward pleasing smells the tongue does not pull toward pleasing tastes the body does not pull toward pleasing tactile sensations the intellect does not pull toward pleasing ideas and unpleasing ideas are not repellentThis monks is restraintThe strong post or stake is a term for mindfulness immersed in the bodyThus you should train yourselves We will develop mindfulness immersed in the bodyWe will pursue it give it a means of transport give it a groundingWe will steady it consolidate it and set about it properly Thats how you should train yourselvesSuppose monks that a large crowd of people comes thronging together saying The beauty queenThe beauty queen And suppose that the beauty queen is highly accomplished at singing  dancing so that an even greater crowd comes thronging saying The beauty queen is singingThe beauty queen is dancing Then a man comes along desiring life  shrinking from death desiring pleasure  abhorring painThey say to him Now look here misterYou must take this bowl filled to the brim with oil and carry it on your head in between the great crowd  the beauty queenA man with a raised sword will follow right behind you and wherever you spill even a drop of oil right there will he cut off your head Now what do you think monksWill that man not paying attention to the bowl of oil let himself get distracted outsideI have given you this parable to convey a meaningThe meaning is this The bowl filled to the brim with oil stands for mindfulness immersed in the bodyThus you should train yourselves We will develop mindfulness immersed in the bodyWe will pursue it give it a means of transport give it a groundingWe will steady it consolidate it and set about it properly Thats how you should train yourselvesWhoever pervades the great ocean with his awareness encompasses whatever rivulets flow down into the oceanIn the same way whoever develops  pursues mindfulness immersed in the body encompasses whatever skillful qualities are on the side of clear knowingWhen one thing is practiced  pursued the body is calmed the mind is calmed thinking  evaluating are stilled and all qualities on the side of clear knowing go to the culmination of their developmentWhich one thingMindfulness immersed in the bodyWhen one thing is practiced  pursued ignorance is abandoned clear knowing arises the conceit I am is abandoned obsessions are uprooted fetters are abandonedWhich one thingMindfulness immersed in the bodyThose who do not taste mindfulness of the body do not taste the DeathlessThose who taste mindfulness of the body taste the DeathlessThose who are heedless of mindfulness of the body are heedless of the DeathlessThose who comprehend mindfulness of the body comprehend the Deathless AN The DeathlessThere are these four frames of referenceWhich fourThere is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldAs he remains focused on the body in  of itself he abandons desire with regard to the bodyAs he abandons desire with regard to the body he realizes the DeathlessHe remains focused on feelings in  of themselves mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldAs he remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves he abandons desire with regard to mental qualitiesAs he abandons desire with regard to mental qualities he realizes the DeathlessIts just as if there were a a great pile of dust at a fourway intersectionIf a cart or chariot came from the east that pile of dust would be totally leveledIf a cart or chariot came from the west from the north from the south that pile of dust would be totally leveledIn the same way when a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself then evil unskillful qualities are totally leveledIf he remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselves then evil unskillful qualities are totally leveledNow when VenAnuruddha was meditating in solitude this train of thought appeared in his awareness Whoever neglects the four frames of reference neglects the noble path going to the right ending of stressWhoever undertakes the four frames of reference undertakes the noble path going to the right ending of stressThen VenMahā Moggallāna as soon as he perceived with his awareness the train of thought in VenAnuruddhas awareness  as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm  appeared in front of VenAnuruddha and said to him To what extent my friend are the four frames of reference undertakenVenAnuruddha There is the case my friend of a monk who internally remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body remains focused on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body remains focused on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to the body  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldExternally he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the bodyInternally  externally he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body remains focused on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body remains focused on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to the body  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldIf he wants he remains percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsomeIf he wants he remains percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsomeIf he wants he remains percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome  what isIf he wants he remains percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome  what is notIf he wants  in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not  cutting himself off from both he remains equanimous alert  mindfulIts to this extent my friend that the four frames of reference are undertakenIts good for a monk if at the appropriate times he remains percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsomeIt is good if at the appropriate times he remains percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome  what is percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome  what is notIt is good if at the appropriate times  in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not  cutting himself off from both he remains equanimous alert  mindfulNow with what purpose should a monk remain percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsomeDont let passion arise within me in the presence of things that excite passion With this purpose should a monk remain percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsomeAnd with what purpose should a monk remain percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsomeDont let aversion arise within me in the presence of things that excite aversionAnd with what purpose should a monk remain percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome  what isDont let passion arise within me in the presence of things that excite passionDont let aversion arise within me in the presence of things that excite aversionAnd with what purpose should a monk remain percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome  what is notDont let aversion arise within me in the presence of things that excite aversionDont let passion arise within me in the presence of things that excite passionAnd with what purpose should a monk  in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not  cutting himself off from both remain equanimous alert  mindfulDont let passion  in any object in any place in any amount  arise within me in the presence of things that excite passionDont let aversion  in any object in any place in any amount  arise within me in the presence of things that excite aversionDont let delusion  in any object in any place in any amount  arise within me in the presence of things that excite delusion With this purpose should a monk  in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not  cutting himself off from both remain equanimous alert  mindfulProtecting Oneself  OthersOnce upon a time monks a bamboo acrobat having erected a bamboo pole addressed his assistant Frying Pan Come my dear Frying PanClimb up the bamboo pole and stand on my shouldersAs you say teacher Frying Pan answered the bamboo acrobat and climbing the bamboo pole stood on his shouldersSo then the bamboo acrobat said to his assistant Now you watch after me my dear Frying Pan and Ill watch after youThus protecting one another watching after one another well show off our skill receive our reward and come down safely from the bamboo poleWhen he had said this Frying Pan said to him But that wont do at all teacherYou watch after yourself and Ill watch after myself and thus with each of us protecting ourselves watching after ourselves well show off our skill receive our reward and come down safely from the bamboo poleWhat Frying Pan the assistant said to her teacher was the right way in that caseMonks a frame of reference is to be practiced with the thought Ill watch after myself A frame of reference is to be practiced with the thought Ill watch after others When watching after oneself one watches after othersWhen watching after others one watches after oneselfAnd how does one when watching after oneself watch after othersThrough pursuing through developing it through devoting oneself to itThis is how one when watching after oneself watches after othersAnd how does one when watching after others watch after oneselfThrough endurance through nonviolence and through a mind of good will  sympathyThis is how one when watching after others watches after oneselfA frame of reference is to be practiced with the thought Ill watch after myself A frame of reference is to be practiced with the thought Ill watch after others When watching after oneself one watches after othersWhen watching after others one watches after oneselfThen when the Blessed One had entered the Rains Retreat there arose a severe illness within himSharp  deadly were the pains but he bore them mindfully alert  unperturbedThe thought occurred to him It would not be proper for me to enter total Unbinding without addressing my attendants  without taking leave of the Community of monksWhy dont I suppressing this illness with persistence remain resolved on the fabrication of life So he suppressed the illness with persistence  remained resolved on the fabrication of lifeHis illness abatedThen he recovered from the illnessSoon after his recovery he came out of his dwelling  sat down in the shade of the building on a seat prepared for himThen Vennanda approached him and on arrival having bowed down to him sat down to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One What a happy sight to see the Blessed One in comfortWhat a happy sight to see the Blessed One at easeBecause of the Blessed Ones sickness my own body felt as if it were druggedI lost my bearingsThings were unclear to meYet I still took a measure of comfort in the thought that the Blessed One would not enter total Unbinding as long as he hadnt given at least some pronouncement concerning the Community of monksWhat more does the Community of monks want from me nandaI have taught the Dhamma without an inner or an outer versionThe Tathāgata has no closed fist with regard to teachingsWhoever has the thought I will rule the Community of monks or The Community of monks is dedicated to me he should give some pronouncement concerning the Community of monksBut the Tathāgata has no such thoughtsSo why should he give some pronouncement concerning the Community of monksI am old now nanda  agedMy years have turned eightyJust as an old cart is kept going with the help of bamboo strips it seems to me as if the Tathāgatas body is kept going with the help of bamboo stripsThe only time the Tathāgatas body feels at ease is when not attending to any theme at all and with the cessation of certain feelings he enters  remains in the themeless concentration of awarenessTherefore each of you should remain with your self as an island your self as your refuge without anything else as a refugeRemain with the Dhamma as an island the Dhamma as your refuge without anything else as a refugeAnd how does a monk remain with his self as an island his self as his refuge without anything else as a refugeHow does he remain with the Dhamma as an island the Dhamma as his refuge without anything else as a refugeThere is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldHe remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldThis is how a monk remains with his self as an island his self as his refuge without anything else as a refuge with the Dhamma as an island the Dhamma as his refuge without anything else as a refugeFor those who  now or after I am gone  remain with their self as an island the Dhamma as their refuge without anything else as a refuge they will be the highest of the monks who desire trainingThe four activities included in this set show how effort can be applied to developing skillful qualities in the mindThe basic formula runs as followsThere is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors arouses persistence upholds  exerts his intentThese four aspects of effort are also termed guarding abandoning developing and maintainingAll four play a necessary role in bringing the mind to Awakening although in some cases they are simply four sides to a single processThe abandoning of unskillful mental qualities can frequently be accomplished simply by focusing on the development of skillful ones such as mindfulnessThe same principle can also act in reverse in the skillful eradication of unskillful qualities the skillfulness of the eradication is in and of itself the development of mindful discernmentAs we will see when we deal with the seven factors for Awakening the act of nourishing a factor for Awakening can in some cases simultaneously starve a hindrance while the conscious starving of a hindrance can foster a factor for AwakeningUltimately though right exertion requires more than simply abstaining from what is unskillful for it must apply the basic factors of skillfulness  mindfulness and discernment  to gain an understanding of how even skillfulness can be transcendedPerhaps the most surprising element in right exertion is the role played by desire which is usually associated with the craving that acts as a cause of sufferingWe will treat this topic in more detail under the bases for success and simply note here that the Buddha recognized that desire can be either skillful or unskillful and that he freely admitted that skillful desire is a necessary factor in the path to the end of suffering and stressThe most important point in developing right exertion is to realize that the effort to abandon unskillful qualities and to develop skillful qualities must be skillful itselfUnskillful efforts at eradicating unskillful states even if well intended can often exacerbate problems instead of solving themTreating hatred with hatred for instance is less effective than treating it with the kind of understanding developed in the second stage of framesofreference meditation which sees into causes and effects and learns how to manipulate causes properly so as to get the desired effectsFor this reason the basic formula for right exertion includes both implicitly and explicitly other factors of the path to ensure that the effort is skillfully appliedThree of the qualities that activate the mind in these exertions  desire persistence and intent  are also members of the bases of power where they function as dominant factors in the attainment of concentrationThe ability to discriminate between skillful and unskillful qualities implicit in all of these exertions requires a certain level of mindfulness and discernmentThe skillful qualities that are mentioned most prominently as worthy of development are the seven factors for Awakening which include mindfulness analysis of mental qualities and the factors of jhāna all of which must be reinvested in the process of right exertion to bring it to higher levels of finessePassage  gives an idea of right exertions range of application by listing seven ways in which unskillful qualities can be abandoned seeing restraining using tolerating avoiding destroying and developingThe passage is deliberately vague as to which types of unskillful qualities respond to which type of treatment for this is a point that each meditator must discover in practice for him or herselfThis emphasis on personal exploration is crucial to the practice of right effort for it encourages one to be sensitive to what can be discovered with ones own mindfulness and discernmentThe same point applies to the question of how much effort must be applied to the practiceThe Buddha notes that some meditators will have to undergo painful and slow practice while others will find that their practice is painful and quick pleasant and slow or pleasant and quickThus each has to adjust the effort applied to the practice accordinglyThis need for differing levels of effort depends not only on the individual but also on the situationIn some cases simply watching an unskillful quality with equanimity will be enough to make it go away in other cases one has to exert a conscious effort to get rid of itThus through observation one will realize that skillful effort has no room for doctrinaire approachesThe polar extremes of constant exertion to the point of exhaustion and its opposite a kneejerk fear of efforting are both misguided here as is the seemingly middle way of moderation in all thingsThe true middle way means tuning ones efforts to ones abilities and to the task at handIn some cases this entails an allout effort in others simple watchfulnessThe ability to sense what kind and what level of effort is appropriate in any given situation is an important element in developing the basic requirements for skill  mindfulness and discernment  by putting them to useWe have already noted that right exertion is equivalent to the factor of ardency in framesofreference meditationIn the first stage of that practice right exertion functions by keeping the mind with its frame of reference and by warding off unskillful mental qualities that would make it abandon that frameIn the second stage the function of exertion becomes more refined warding off the tendency to get involved with what is arising and passing away and keeping the mind applied to its task of manipulating observing and mastering the process of origination and passing away as one steers the mind to the stillness of jhānaIn the third stage the function of exertion becomes finer yet as it maintains a basic empty or radically phenomenological awareness of the frame of reference in order to bring the mind to the state of nonfashioning appropriate for the process of AwakeningThe equipoise of this state  beyond the categories of effort or noneffort  explains the paradox expressed in  which states that the mind crosses the flood of rebirth by neither pushing forward nor staying in place an equipoise that embodies the ultimate skillfulness of right exertion in bringing the mind to a point beyond skillImplicit in this discussion of the effort involved in mastering skill to the point of its own transcendence is the fact that the goal of the practice is not an effort to return to a supposedly pure state of childlike awareness prior to social conditioningsPassage  makes this fact explicitAccording to Buddhist analysis the state of a childs mind is one not of purity but of ignorance filled with the potential for many unskilled qualitiesThese qualities show themselves in seemingly innocent ways simply because the infants intellectual and physical powers are weakOnce those powers are strengthened the minds potentials become manifestAs one modern teacher has stated the childlike mind is the source for the round of rebirthIf it were truly pure and fully aware it would not be susceptible to unskillful social conditioningThus the way to purity lies not in renouncing ones developed intellectual powers but in developing those powers to higher levels of mastery and skillThis explains why right exertion is a necessary part of the practiceThere are these four right exertionsWhich fourThere is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors arouses persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the nonarising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the sake of the abandoning of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the maintenance nonconfusion increase plenitude development  culmination of skillful qualities that have arisenThese are the four right exertionsJust as the River Ganges flows to the east slopes to the east inclines to the east in the same way when a monk develops  pursues the four right exertions he flows to Unbinding slopes to Unbinding inclines to UnbindingThere are these four exertionsWhich fourThe exertion to guard the exertion to abandon the exertion to develop  the exertion to maintainAnd what is the exertion to guardThere is the case where a monk on seeing a form with the eye does not grasp at any theme or variations by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail himHe practices with restraintHe guards the faculty of the eyeHe achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the eyeThis is called the exertion to guardAnd what is the exertion to abandonThere is the case where a monk does not acquiesce to a thought of sensuality that has arisenHe abandons it destroys it dispels it wipes it out of existenceHe does not acquiesce to a thought of ill will a thought of violence any evil unskillful qualities that have arisenHe abandons them destroys them dispels them wipes them out of existenceThis is called the exertion to abandonAnd what is the exertion to developThere is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting goHe develops investigation of qualities persistence rapture serenity concentration equanimity as factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting goThis is called the exertion to developAnd what is the exertion to maintainThere is the case where a monk maintains a favorable theme of concentration  the skeleton perception the wormeaten perception the livid perception the festering perception the fallingapart perception the bloated perceptionThis is called the exertion to maintainThese are the four exertionsThe ending of the effluents is for one who knows  sees I tell you not for one who does not know  does not seeFor one who knows what  sees whatAppropriate attention  inappropriate attentionWhen a monk attends inappropriately unarisen effluents arise and arisen effluents increaseWhen a monk attends appropriately unarisen effluents do not arise and arisen effluents are abandonedThere are effluents that are to be abandoned by seeing those that are to be abandoned by restraining those that are to be abandoned by using those that are to be abandoned by tolerating those that are to be abandoned by avoiding those that are to be abandoned by destroying and those that are to be abandoned by developingAnd what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by seeingThere is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person doesnt discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attentionThis being so he doesnt attend to ideas fit for attention and attends to ideas unfit for attentionAnd what are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends toWhatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen effluent of sensuality arises and the arisen effluent of sensuality increases the unarisen effluent of becoming the unarisen effluent of ignorance arises and the arisen effluent of ignorance increases This is how he attends inappropriately Was I in the pastWas I not in the pastWhat was I in the pastHow was I in the pastHaving been what what was I in the pastShall I be in the futureShall I not be in the futureWhat shall I be in the futureHow shall I be in the futureHaving been what what shall I be in the future Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present Am IAm I notWhat am IHow am IWhere has this being come fromWhere is it boundAs he attends inappropriately in this way one of six kinds of view arises in him The view I have a self arises in him as true  established or the view I have no self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive notself or the view It is precisely by means of notself that I perceive self arises in him as true  established or else he has a view like this This very self of mine  the knower that is sensitive here  there to the ripening of good  bad actions  is the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will endure as long as eternityThis is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of viewsBound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging  death from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairHe is not freed I tell you from stress The welltaught disciple of the noble ones discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attentionThis being so he doesnt attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends to ideas fit for attention And what are the ideas fit for attention that he attends toWhatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen effluent of sensuality doesnt arise and the arisen effluent of sensuality is abandoned the unarisen effluent of becoming the unarisen effluent of ignorance doesnt arise and the arisen effluent of ignorance is abandoned He attends appropriately This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stressAs he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him identityview doubt and grasping at habits  practicesThese are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by seeingAnd what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by restrainingThere is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately dwells restrained with the restraint of the eyefacultyThe effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were to dwell unrestrained with the restraint of the eyefaculty do not arise for him when he dwells restrained with the restraint of the eyefacultyThese are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by restrainingAnd what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by usingThere is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately uses the robe simply to counteract cold to counteract heat to counteract the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles simply for the purpose of covering the parts of the body that cause shameReflecting appropriately he uses alms food not playfully nor for intoxication nor for putting on bulk nor for beautification but simply for the survival  continuance of this body for ending its afflictions for the support of the holy life thinking Thus will I destroy old feelings and not create new feelingsI will maintain myself be blameless  live in comfortReflecting appropriately he uses lodging simply to counteract cold to counteract heat to counteract the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles simply for protection from the inclemencies of weather and for the enjoyment of seclusionReflecting appropriately he uses medicinal requisites for curing illness simply to counteract any pains of illness that have arisen and for maximum freedom from diseaseThe effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to use these things do not arise for him when he uses themThese are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by usingAnd what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by toleratingThere is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately enduresHe tolerates cold heat hunger  thirst the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles illspoken unwelcome words  bodily feelings that when they arise are painful racking sharp piercing disagreeable displeasing  menacing to lifeThe effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to tolerate these things do not arise for him when he tolerates themThese are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by toleratingAnd what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by avoidingThere is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately avoids a wild elephant a wild horse a wild bull a wild dog a snake a stump a bramble patch a chasm a cliff a cesspool an open sewerReflecting appropriately he avoids sitting in the sorts of unsuitable seats wandering to the sorts of unsuitable habitats and associating with the sorts of bad friends that would make his knowledgeable friends in the holy life suspect him of evil conductThe effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to avoid these things do not arise for him when he avoids themThese are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by avoidingAnd what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by destroyingThere is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately does not tolerate an arisen thought of sensualityHe abandons it destroys it dispels it  wipes it out of existenceThe effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to destroy these things do not arise for him when he destroys themThese are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by destroyingAnd what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by developingThere is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately develops mindfulness as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting goHe develops analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening persistence as a factor for Awakening rapture as a factor for Awakening serenity as a factor for Awakening concentration as a factor for Awakening equanimity as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting goThe effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to develop these qualities do not arise for him when he develops themThese are called the effluents that are to be abandoned

an end of suffering  stressThese are the five factors for exertionWhich fiveThere is the case where a monk has conviction is convinced of the Tathāgatas Awakening Indeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed The monk is free from illness  discomfort endowed with good digestion  not too cold not too hot of moderate strength  fit for exertionHe is neither fraudulent nor deceitfulHe declares himself to the Teacher or to his wise friends in the holy life in line with what he actually isHe keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualitiesHe is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualitiesHe is discerning endowed with discernment leading to the arising of the goal  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stressThese are the five factors for exertionWith regard to internal factors I do not envision any other single factor like appropriate attention as being so helpful for a monk in training who has not attained the hearts goal but remains intent on the unexcelled security from bondageA monk who attends appropriately abandons what is unskillful and develops what is skillfulWith regard to external factors I do not envision any other single factor like admirable friendship as being so helpful for a monk in training who has not attained the hearts the goal but remains intent on the unexcelled security from bondageA monk who is a friend with admirable people abandons what is unskillful and develops what is skillfulA person without ardency without compunction is incapable of selfawakening incapable of Unbinding incapable of attaining the unexcelled security from bondageA person ardent  compunctious is capable of selfawakening capable of Unbinding capable of attaining the unexcelled security from bondageVenSāriputta It is said friend that a person without ardency without compunction is incapable of selfawakening incapable of Unbinding incapable of attaining the unexcelled security from bondageNow how is a person without ardency without compunction incapable of selfawakening incapable of Unbinding incapable of attaining the unexcelled security from bondageAnd how is a person ardent  compunctious capable of selfawakening capable of Unbinding capable of attaining the unexcelled security from bondageVenMahā Kassapa There is the case friend where a monk Unarisen evil unskillful qualities arising in me would lead to what is unbeneficial arouses no ardencyArisen evil unskillful qualities not being abandoned in me Unarisen skillful qualities not arising in me Arisen skillful qualities ceasing in me would lead to what is unbeneficial he arouses no ardencyThis is how one is without ardencyAnd how is one a person without compunctionThere is the case where a monk Unarisen evil unskillful qualities arising in me would lead to what is unbeneficial feels no compunctionArisen evil unskillful qualities not being abandoned

owners would neither use nor clean but would throw away in the dustWouldnt that bronze bowl eventually become even more dirty  defiled with timeVenMahā Moggallāna Yes my friendVenSāriputta In the same way when an individual being blemished doesnt discern as it has come to be that I have an internal blemish it can be expected of him that he will not generate desire endeavor or arouse persistence for the abandoning of that blemishHe will die with passion aversion delusion  blemished  with a mind defiledNow imagine a bronze bowl brought back from a shop or a smith all covered with dust  dirt that the owners would both use  clean and would not throw away in the dustWouldnt that bronze bowl eventually become clean  pure with timeVenMahā Moggallāna Yes my friendVenSāriputta In the same way when an individual being blemished discerns as it has come to be that I have an internal blemish it can be expected of him that he will generate desire endeavor  arouse persistence for the abandoning of that blemishHe will die without passion aversion delusion  unblemished  with a mind undefiledNow imagine a bronze bowl brought back from a shop or a smith all clean  pure that the owners would neither

unblemished doesnt discern as it has come to be that I have no internal blemish it can be expected of him that he will attend to the theme of beautyAs he attends to the theme of beauty passion will assault his mindHe will die with passion aversion delusion  blemished  with a mind defiledNow imagine a bronze bowl brought back from a shop or a smith all clean  pure that the owners would both use

being unblemished discerns as it has come to be that I have no internal blemish it can be expected of him that he will not attend to the theme of beautyAs he does not attend to the theme of beauty passion will not assault his mindHe will die without passion aversion delusion  unblemished  with a mind undefiledThis is the reason this is the cause why of the two individuals who are blemished one is reckoned to be inferior and the other superior and why of the two individuals who are unblemished one is reckoned to be inferior and the other superiorVenMahā Moggallāna Blemish blemish its saidWhat does blemish stand forVenSāriputta The influences of evil unskillful wishes Thats what blemish stands forEven if a monk is not skilled in the ways of the minds of others he should train himself I will be skilled in reading my own mindAnd how is a monk skilled in reading his own mindImagine a young woman  or man  fond of adornment examining the image of her own face in a bright clean mirror or bowl of clear water If she saw any dirt or blemish there she would try to remove itIf she saw no dirt or blemish there she would be pleased her resolves fulfilled How fortunate I amHow clean I am In the same way a monks selfexamination is very productive in terms of skillful qualities Do I usually remain covetous or notWith thoughts of ill will or notOvercome by sloth  drowsiness or notRestless or notUncertain or gone beyond uncertaintyAngry or notWith soiled thoughts or unsoiled thoughtsWith my body aroused or unarousedLazy or with persistence arousedUnconcentrated or concentratedIf on examination a monk knows I usually remain covetous with thoughts of ill will overcome by sloth  drowsiness restless uncertain angry with soiled thoughts with my body aroused lazy or unconcentrated then he should put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor relentlessness mindfulness  alertness for the abandoning of those very same evil unskillful qualities just as when a person whose turban or head was on fire would put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor relentlessness mindfulness  alertness to put out the fire on his turban or headBut if on examination a monk knows I usually remain uncovetous without thoughts of ill will  concentrated then his duty is to make an effort in establishing those very same skillful qualities to a higher degree for the ending of the effluentsAnd how is striving fruitful how is exertion fruitfulThere is the case where a monk when not loaded down does not load himself down with pain nor does he reject pleasure that accords with the Dhamma although he is not infatuated with that pleasureHe discerns that When I exert a fabrication against this cause of stress then from the fabrication of exertion there is dispassionWhen I look on with equanimity at that cause of stress then from the development of equanimity there is dispassion So he exerts a fabrication against the cause of stress and develops equanimity with regard to the cause of stress Thus the stress is exhausted  the stress is exhaustedSuppose that a man is in love with a woman his mind ensnared with intense desire intense passionHe sees her standing with another man chatting joking  laughingWhat do you think monks Would sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair arise in himYes lordNow suppose the thought were to occur to him I am in love with this woman When I see her standing with another man chatting joking  laughing sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair arise in meWhy dont I abandon my desire  passion for that woman So he abandons his desire  passion for that woman and afterwards sees her standing with another man chatting joking  laughingWhat do you think monks Would sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair arise in himNo lordIn the same way the monk when not loaded down does not load himself down with pain nor does he reject pleasure that accords with the Dhamma although he is not infatuated with that pleasure He exerts a fabrication against the cause of stress and develops equanimity with regard to the cause of stress Thus the stress is exhausted  the stress is exhaustedFurthermore the monk notices this When I live according to my pleasure unskillful mental qualities increase in me  skillful qualities declineWhen I exert myself with stress  pain though unskillful qualities decline in me  skillful qualities increaseWhy dont I exert myself with stress  pain So he exerts himself with stress  pain and while he is exerting himself with stress  pain unskillful qualities decline in him  skillful qualities increaseThen at a later time he would no longer exert himself with stress  painWhy is thatBecause he has attained the goal for which he was exerting himself with stress  painSuppose that a fletcher were to heat  warm an arrow shaft between two flames making it straight  pliableThen at a later time he would no longer heat  warm the shaft between two flames making it straight  pliableWhy is thatBecause he has attained the goal for which he was heating  warming the shaft In the same way the monk no longer exerts himself with stress  painWhy is thatBecause he has attained the goal for which he was exerting himself with stress  painUdāyin there are these four types of people to be found existing in the worldWhich fourThere is the case where a certain person is practicing for the abandoning  relinquishing of acquisitionsAs he is practicing for the abandoning  relinquishing of acquisitions memories  resolves associated with acquisitions assail himHe tolerates themHe does not abandon them destroy them dispel them or wipe them out of existenceI tell you Udāyin that this sort of person is associated not dissociatedWhy is thatBecause I have known the diversity of faculties with regard to this type of personAgain there is the case where a certain person practicing for the abandoning  relinquishing of acquisitions is assailed by memories  resolves associated with acquisitionsHe does not tolerate themHe abandons them destroys them dispels them  wipes them out of existenceI tell you Udāyin that this sort of person is associated not dissociatedWhy is thatBecause I have known the diversity of faculties with regard to this type of personAgain there is the case where a certain person is practicing for the abandoning  relinquishing of acquisitions Owing to lapses in mindfulness from time to time he is assailed by memories  resolves associated with acquisitionsSlow is the arising of his mindfulness but then he quickly abandons destroys them dispels them  wipes them out of existenceJust as when two or three drops of water fall onto an iron pan heated all day Slow is the falling of the drops of water but they quickly vanish  disappearIn the same way slow is the arising of his mindfulness but then he quickly abandons destroys them dispels them  wipes them out of existenceI tell you Udāyin that this sort of person is associated not dissociatedWhy is thatBecause I have known the diversity of faculties with regard to this type of personAgain there is the case where a certain person realizing that acquisitions are the root of suffering  stress is without acquisitions released in the ending of acquisitionsI tell you Udāyin that this sort of person is dissociated not associatedWhy is thatBecause I have known the diversity of faculties with regard to this type of personThen Pañcakaṅga the carpenter went to Uggāhamāna a follower of Muṇḍikā the contemplative was staying and on arrival greeted him courteouslyAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there Uggāhamāna said to him I describe an individual endowed with four qualities as being consummate in what is skillful foremost in what is skillful an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainmentsWhich fourThere is the case where he does no evil action with his body speaks no evil speech resolves on no evil resolve and maintains himself with no evil means of livelihoodAn individual endowed with these four qualities I describe as being consummate in what is skillful an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainmentsThen Pañcakaṅga the carpenter neither delighted in Uggāhamānas words nor did he scorn themExpressing neither delight nor scorn he got up from his seat  left thinking I will learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of the Blessed OneThen the carpenter went to where the Blessed One was staying and on arrival after bowing down to him sat down to one sideAs he was sitting there he told the Blessed One the entire conversation he had had with UggāhamānaWhen this was said the Blessed One addressed Pañcakaṅga saying In that case then according to Uggāhamānas words a stupid baby boy lying on its back is consummate in what is skillful foremost in what is skillful an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainmentsFor even the thought body does not occur to a stupid baby boy lying on its back so from where would it do any evil action with its body aside from a little kickingEven the thought speech does not occur to it so from where would it speak any evil speech aside from a little cryingEven the thought resolve does not occur to it so from where would it resolve on any evil resolve aside from a little bad temperEven the thought livelihood does not occur to it so from where would it maintain itself with any evil means of livelihood aside from its mothers milkSo according to Uggāhamānas words a stupid baby boy lying on its back is an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainmentsIf an individual is endowed with these four qualities I do not describe him as an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainmentsRather he stands on the same level as a stupid baby boy lying on its backAn individual endowed with ten qualities is one who I describe as being consummate in what is skillful foremost in what is skillful an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainmentsWith regard to that point one should know that These are unskillful habits I sayWith regard to that point

the carpenter delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsA deva Tell me dear sir how you crossed over the floodThe Buddha I crossed over the flood without pushing forward without staying in placeThe deva But how did you cross over the flood without pushing forward without staying in placeThe Buddha When I pushed forward I was whirled aboutWhen I stayed in place I sankAnd so I crossed over the flood without pushing forward without staying in placeIddhi the Pali word translated here as power has so many meanings that no one English equivalent can do them all justiceOther equivalents that have been suggested include success accomplishment and prowessIn the context of the bases for power however the word specifically means the supranormal powers that can be developed through concentration such as levitation walking on water clairaudience clairvoyance remembrance of past lives the ability to read the minds of others and the ending of mental effluentsIn the Buddhist analysis only the last of these powers is transcendentIt is the only one absolutely necessary on the path to AwakeningThe others are optional and not always desirable for an unawakened person might find that the attainment of any one of them can cause supranormal greed aversion or delusion to arise in the mindThe texts record cases where even Arahants not fully sensitive to the effect that their actions might have on others display their powers in inappropriate contextsThis was why the Buddha forbade his monastic disciples from displaying their powers before the laityNone of the displayable powers he said is any match for the wonder of a teaching that like his gave the promised results when put into practiceStill there is no denying that some people acquire these powers in the course of their meditation and they need guidance in how to use them properly so that their powers can actually help rather than hinder their practiceThis is the role that the standard formulae for the bases of power play in the teachingThey show how the mastery of any of the first five powers can be fit into the outline of frameofreference meditation so that the process of mastery can lead to the sixth and most important power the ending of the effluents thus resulting in releaseThe texts explain the bases of power in two standard formulae brief and extendedThe brief formula runs as followsThere is the case where a monk develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire  the fabrications of exertionHe develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on persistence concentration founded on intent concentration founded on discrimination  the fabrications of exertionOne of the texts states that these formulae define the process whereby the bases of power are developed another states that they define the bases of power themselvesThe contradiction here can be resolved by noting that the first text defines the bases of power as whatever practice leads to the attainment of power the winning of power Because these processes definitely lead to the attainment of power they would count as at least part of the bases of powerThe first text is probably alluding to the fact that there is more to the process which is included in the extended formula discussed belowEach of these four bases has three component parts the fabrications of exertion concentration and the mental quality  desire persistence intent or discrimination  on which the concentration is basedAccording to  desire persistence and intent are present in all states of jhānaThus the phrase concentration based on desire refers to a concentration in which all three qualities are present but with desire dominantWe should note here that although the desire here is directed toward a state of concentration  which is a type of becoming  if that becoming is aimed at going beyond becoming this desire shifts from a cause of stress to part of the path to its endingAnd even though the desire for Awakening when not yet realized can be a cause for frustration that frustration counts as a skillful emotion as it leads to further efforts along the pathIt is to be transcended not by abandoning the desire but by acting on it properly as explained below until gaining the desired resultsDiscrimination the fourth mental quality is not always inherent in jhāna although when functioning as evaluation it plays a role in the first jhāna and is definitely present in the fifth factor of noble right concentration which leads to AwakeningFurthermore the extended formula for the bases of power shows that discrimination is necessary for the thorough mastery of concentration based on desire persistence intent or discrimination itself so that  in the course of gaining mastery  one develops mindful discernment into the causal patterns of the mind and so can reach AwakeningWe have already shown that the development of concentration involves the three qualities called for in the first stage of framesofreference meditation ardency alertness and mindfulnessThus the brief formula for the bases of power as a description of concentration practice can be equated with the first stage of framesofreference meditationMany popular Western writings criticize the four qualities listed in the bases of power  desire persistence intent and discrimination  as enemies of proper meditation both in that they interfere with the calming of the mind and are antithetical to the goal of the Unfabricated which lies beyond desire effort and the categories of discriminationThe first part of the extended formula deals with the first of these criticismsThis passage shows that the problem lies not in the desire effort intent or discrimination but in the fact that these qualities can be unskillfully applied or improperly tuned to their taskIf they were absent the practice  if it could be called a practice  would stagnate from loss of direction or motivationIf they ran wild they would interfere with mindful concentrationSo the trick is not to deny them but to tune them skillfully so that they will help focus the mind on the present momentThus for instance in the practice of meditation as with any skill it is important not to focus desire too strongly on the results one hopes to get for that would interfere with the minds ability to focus on giving rise to the causes leading to those resultsIf instead one focuses desire on putting the causes in proper order in the present moment desire becomes an indispensable part of the process of masteryPassage  deals with the second criticism  that desire etc are antithetical to the goal  by showing that these qualities are necessary for anyone who pursues a path but are automatically abandoned on reaching the goal at the paths endThe image of the path is important here for it carries important implicationsFirst the path is not the goal it is simply the way there just as the road to the Grand Canyon should not be confused with the Grand Canyon itselfEven though many stretches of the road bear no resemblance to the Grand Canyon that does not mean that the road does not lead thereSecondly the path of practice does not cause the goal it simply leads there just as neither the road to the Grand Canyon nor the act of walking to the Grand Canyon can cause the Grand Canyon to beThe goal at the end of the Buddhist path is unfabricated so no amount of desire or effort can bring it into beingNevertheless the path to the goal is a fabricated process and in that process desire effort intent and discrimination all have an important role to play just as the effort of walking plays a role in arriving at the Grand CanyonThe final section of the extended formula hints at how these qualities may be directed toward AwakeningHe keeps perceiving what is in front  behind so that what is in front is the same as what is behind what is behind is the same as what is in frontWhat is below is the same as what is above what is above is the same as what is belowby night as by day and by day as by nightBy means of an awareness thus open  unhampered he develops a brightened mindThis passage refers to the total mastery of concentrationFreeing the mind from such distinctions as frontbehind abovebelow and daynight one creates an awareness that is open and bright unhampered by the normal limitations that come with a conscious sense of being located in time and spaceThis is the type of awareness needed for the attainment of the supranormal powersMany meditators tend to stop here satisfied with their newfound powers but the Buddha urges them to go furtherAs  shows the full perfection of this type of awareness requires extreme sensitivity to the presence of mental defilements that might place subtle limitations on itThis process of sensitivity is nothing other than the second stage of framesofreference meditation in which one focuses on the phenomenon of origination and passing away of mind states that are limited and unlimited concentrated and unconcentrated taking the brightness of ones awareness  the mind inandof itself  as ones frame of referenceThe next stage of practice is outlined in a passage that builds on This passage shows that full mastery of power requires an abandoning even of the notion that I am the master of the power or that my mind is concentratedThe proper attitude in the face of the power is to incline the mind to the Deathless Such an attitude according to MN involves simply noting what is present as present without fashioning anything further out of itThis is the third stage of framesofreference meditation the entry into emptiness that simply notes There is this When this level of skilled discrimination is reached the power has been fully mastered at the same time that the mind stands on the verge of nonfashioning and AwakeningBecause of their association with supranormal powers the bases of power have generally been slighted in Western writings on BuddhismIf we count the five strengths as identical with the five faculties the bases of power are the only set in the Wings to Awakening that has not yet been the subject of a book in the English languageThe situation in Asia however is very differentThere the bases of power have been extrapolated from their specific context and are frequently cited as guides to success in generalIn whatever task one may undertake  directed toward worldly ends or toward the Dhamma  one must bring to bear the qualities of desire persistence intent and discrimination skillfully balanced with concentration and right exertion if one wants to succeed at ones taskMonks whoever neglects these four bases of power neglects the noble path going to the right ending of stressWhoever undertakes these four bases of power undertakes the noble path going to the right ending of stressWhich fourThere is the case where a monk develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire

exertionWhoever neglects these four bases of power neglects the noble path going to the right ending of stressWhoever undertakes these four bases of power undertakes the noble path going to the right ending of stressVennanda What venerable sir is powerWhat is the base of powerWhat is the development of the base of powerAnd what is the path of practice leading to the development of the base of powerThe Buddha There is the case nanda where a monk wields manifold supranormal powersHaving been one he becomes many having been many he becomes oneHe appearsHe vanishesHe goes unimpeded through walls ramparts  mountains as if through spaceHe dives in  out of the earth as if it were waterHe walks on water without sinking as if it were dry landSitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged birdWith his hand he touches  strokes even the sun  moon so mighty  powerfulHe exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahmā worldsJust as a skilled potter or his assistant could craft from wellprepared clay whatever kind of pottery vessel he likes or as a skilled ivorycarver or his assistant could craft from wellprepared ivory any kind of ivorywork he likes or as a skilled goldsmith or his assistant could craft from wellprepared gold any kind of gold article he likes in the same way the monk wields manifold supranormal powersHe hears  by means of the divine earelement purified  surpassing the human  both kinds of sounds divine  human whether near or farJust as if a man traveling along a highway were to hear the sounds of kettledrums small drums conchs cymbals  tomtomsHe would know That is the sound of kettledrums that the sound of small drums that the sound of conchs that the sound of cymbals  that the sound of tomtoms In the same way the monk hears both kinds of sounds divine  humanHe knows the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with his own awarenessHe discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passionHe discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversionHe discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusionHe discerns a constricted mind as a constricted mind and a scattered mind as a scattered mindHe discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mindHe discerns an excelled mind as an excelled mind and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mindHe discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mindHe discerns a released mind as a released mind and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mindJust as if a young woman  or man  fond of ornaments examining the reflection of her own face in a bright mirror or a bowl of clear water would know blemished if it were blemished or unblemished if it were notIn the same way the monk knows the awareness of other beingsHe recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction  expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose here Thus he remembers his manifold past lives in their modes  detailsJust as if a man were to go from his home village to another village and then from that village to yet another village and then from that village back to his home villageThe thought would occur to him I went from my home village to that village over thereThere I stood in such a way sat in such a way talked in such a way  remained silent in such a wayFrom that village I went to that village over there and there I stood in such a way sat in such a way talked in such a way  remained silent in such a wayFrom that village I came back home In the same way the monk recollects his manifold past livesHe sees  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kammaJust as if there were a tall building in the central square and a man with good eyesight standing on top of it were to see people entering a house leaving it walking along the street  sitting in the central squareThe thought would occur to him These people are entering a house leaving it walking along the streets  sitting in the central square In the same way the monk sees  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearingThrough the ending of the mental effluents he remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowJust as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen  clear limpid  unsullied  where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells gravel  pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about  resting and it would occur to him This pool of water is clear limpid  unsulliedHere are these shells gravel  pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about  resting In the same way the monk discerns as it has come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are effluents This is the origination of effluents This is the cessation of effluents This is the way leading to the cessation of effluents His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the effluent of sensuality released from the effluent of becoming released from the effluent of ignoranceWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThis is called powerAnd what is the base of powerWhatever path whatever practice leads to the attainment of power the winning of power That is called the base of powerAnd what is the development of the base of powerThere is the case where a monk develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire

bases of power developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit  great benefitThere is the case where a monk develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire  the fabrications of exertion thinking This desire of mine will be neither overly sluggish nor overly active neither inwardly constricted nor outwardly scattered He keeps perceiving what is in front  behind so that what is in front is the same as what is behind what is behind is the same as what is in frontWhat is below is the same as what is above what is above is the same as what is belowNight is the same as day day is the same as nightBy means of an awareness thus open  unhampered he develops a brightened mindHe develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on persistence concentration founded on intent concentration founded on discrimination  the fabrications of exertion thinking This discrimination of mine will be neither overly sluggish nor overly active neither inwardly constricted nor outwardly scattered He keeps perceiving what is in front  behind so that what is in front is the same as what is behind what is behind is the same as what is in frontWhat is below is the same as what is above what is above is the same as what is belowby night as by day and by day as by nightBy means of an awareness thus open  unhampered he develops a brightened mindAnd how is desire overly sluggishWhatever desire is accompanied by laziness conjoined with laziness that is called overly sluggish desireAnd how is desire overly activeWhatever desire is accompanied by restlessness conjoined with restlessness that is called overly active desireAnd how is desire inwardly constrictedWhatever desire is accompanied by sloth  drowsiness conjoined with sloth  drowsiness that is called inwardly constricted desireAnd how is desire outwardly scatteredWhatever desire is stirred up by the five strings of sensuality outwardly dispersed  dissipated that is called outwardly scattered desireAnd how does a monk dwell perceiving what is in front  behind so that what is in front is the same as what is behind and what is behind is the same as what is in frontThere is the case where a monks perception of what is in front  behind is well in hand wellattended to wellconsidered welltuned by means of discernmentThis is how a monk keeps perceiving what is in front and behind so that what is in front is the same as what is behind and what is behind is the same as what is in frontAnd how does a monk dwell so that what is below is the same as what is above and what is above is the same as what is belowThere is the case where a monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up from the crown of the head on down surrounded by skin full of various kinds of unclean things In this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestine small intestines gorge feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears skinoil saliva mucus fluid in the joints urine This is how a monk dwells so that what is below is the same as what is above and what is above is the same as what is belowAnd how does a monk dwell by night as by day and by day as by nightThere is the case where a monk at night develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire  the fabrications of exertion by means of the same modes  signs  themes that he uses by day and by day he develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire  the fabrications of exertion by means of the same modes  signs  themes that he uses by nightThis is how a monk dwells by night as by day and by day as by nightAnd how does a monk  by means of an awareness open  unhampered  develop a brightened mindThere is the case where a monk has the perception of light the perception of daytime well in hand  wellestablishedThis is how a monk  by means of an awareness open  unhampered  develops a brightened mindWhen a monk has thus developed  pursued the four bases of power he experiences manifold supranormal powers He hears  by means of the divine earelement purified  surpassing the human  both kinds of sounds divine  human whether near or far He knows the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with his own awareness He recollects his manifold past lives He sees  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing Through the ending of the mental effluents he remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowThis is how these four bases of power when developed  pursued are of great fruit  great benefitI have heard that on one occasion Vennanda was staying in Kosambī at Ghositas ParkThen the brahman Uṇṇābha went to where Vennanda was staying and on arrival greeted him courteouslyAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to Vennanda Master nanda what is the aim of this holy life lived under the contemplative GotamaVennanda The holy life is lived under the Blessed One with the aim of abandoning desireUṇṇābha But is there a path is there a practice for the abandoning of that desireVennanda Yes there isUṇṇābha What is the path the practice for the abandoning of that desireVennanda There is the case where a monk develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire  the fabrications of exertionHe develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on persistence concentration founded on intent concentration founded on discrimination  the fabrications of exertionThis brahman is the path this is the practice for the abandoning of that desireUṇṇābha If thats so then its an endless path and not one with an end for its impossible that one could abandon desire by means of desireVennanda Well then brahman I will crossquestion you on this matterAnswer as you see fit Didnt you first have desire thinking Ill go to the park and then when you reached the park wasnt the corresponding desire allayedUṇṇābha Yes sirVennanda Didnt you first have persistence thinking Ill go to the park and then when you reached the park wasnt the corresponding persistence allayedUṇṇābha Yes sirVennanda Didnt you first have the intent thinking Ill go to the park and then when you reached the park wasnt the corresponding intent allayedUṇṇābha Yes sirVennanda Didnt you first have discrimination thinking Ill go to the park and then when you reached the park wasnt the corresponding discrimination allayedUṇṇābha Yes sirVennanda So it is with an Arahant whose mental effluents are ended who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who is released through right gnosisWhatever desire he first had for the attainment of Arahantship on attaining Arahantship the corresponding desire is allayedWhatever persistence he first had for the attainment of Arahantship on attaining Arahantship the corresponding persistence is allayedWhatever intent he first had for the attainment of Arahantship on attaining Arahantship the corresponding intent is allayedWhatever discrimination he first had for the attainment of Arahantship on attaining Arahantship the corresponding discrimination is allayedSo what do you think brahmanIs this an endless path or one with an endUṇṇābha Youre right Master nandaThis is a path with an end and not an endless oneVennanda Venerable sir does the Blessed One have direct experience of going to the Brahmā world by means of supranormal power with a mindmade bodyThe Buddha Yes nandaVennanda But does the Blessed One also have direct experience of going to the Brahmā world by means of supranormal power with this very physical body composed of the four great elementsThe Buddha YesVennanda Its amazing  astounding that the Blessed One should have direct experience of going to the Brahmā world by means of supranormal power with a mindmade body and of going to the Brahmā world by means of supranormal power with this very physical body composed of the four great elementsThe Buddha Tathāgatas are both amazing nanda and endowed with amazing qualitiesThey are both astounding and endowed with astounding qualitiesWhenever the Tathāgata merges his body with his mind and his mind with his body and remains having alighted on the perception of ease and buoyancy with regard to the body then his body becomes lighter more pliant more malleable  more radiantJust as when an iron ball heated all day becomes lighter more pliant more malleable  more radiant in the same way whenever the Tathāgata merges his body with his mind and his mind with his body and remains having alighted on the perception of ease and buoyancy with regard to the body then his body becomes lighter more pliant more malleable  more radiantNow whenever the Tathāgata merges his body with his mind and his mind with his body and remains having alighted on the perception of ease and buoyancy with regard to the body then his body rises effortlessly from the earth up into the skyHe then experiences manifold supranormal powersHaving been one he becomes many having been many he becomes oneHe appearsHe vanishesHe goes unimpeded through walls ramparts  mountains as if through spaceHe dives in  out of the earth as if it were waterHe walks on water without sinking as if it were dry landSitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged birdWith his hand he touches  strokes even the sun  moon so mighty  powerfulHe exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahmā worldsJust as a tuft of cotton seed or a ball of thistle down lightly wafted by the wind rises effortlessly from the earth up into the sky in the same way whenever the Tathāgata concentrates his body in his mind  his mind in his body and remains having alighted on the perception of ease and buoyancy then his body rises effortlessly from the earth up into the skyHe then experiences manifold supranormal powers even as far as the Brahmā worldsIndriya  the Pali word translated here as faculty  is connected with the name of the dominant Vedic god IndraThus it carries connotations of dominance or controlBuddhist texts contain several lists of faculties both physical and mental but here the word denotes a list of five mental factors that must reach a state of dominance in the mind for Awakening to occurThis set is one of the most comprehensive in the Wings to Awakening as it covers all of the factors explicitly mentioned in the sets we have covered so far and in addition lists conviction which the other sets imply but never specifically mentionThis is why this set forms the framework for Part III of this book in which all of the main factors of the Wings to Awakening will be discussed in detailAs we noted in IIA the faculties in this set form a loop in the causal progression of the mind along the path as opposed to the holographic formulae of the sets we have discussed so farTwo of the faculties  the frames of reference and right exertion  we have covered in detail alreadyThe other three  conviction concentration and discernment  we will discuss in detail in Part Here we will limit ourselves to some general observations about the set as a wholeIn the causal loop depicted by five faculties the emphasis is on how the elements of the concentration aggregate in the noble eightfold path  right effort right mindfulness and right concentration  can lead the mind from a state of conviction to one of discernmentTo borrow terminology from  this is the process by which the mind goes from the preliminary level to the noble or transcendent level of right viewThis set can also be regarded as a description of how conviction when put into action inherently leads through the concentration aggregate to transcendent discernmentPassage  defines the faculty of conviction as the four factors of streamentryOther passages define these four factors in two separate ways one listing the factors leading to streamentry another giving the factors that characterize the person who has already entered the streamBoth lists are relevant here as the person working toward streamentry must act on conviction while a person who has entered the stream is endowed with the unwavering conviction that comes with the first glimpse of the DeathlessIn both cases the factor of conviction has several dimensions trust in the ability of wise people to know the ideal path of practice belief in their teachings and a willingness to put those teachings into practiceWestern analyses of faith tend to separate these aspects of conviction and some writers have tried to decide which aspect is dominant in the Buddhist traditionIn practice however all three must work together for in Buddhism the object of conviction inherently involves all three at onceThe primary focus of conviction is the Awakening of the Buddha and this in turn ultimately comes down to a conviction in the primacy of the mind in creating kamma a conviction in the efficacy of kamma in shaping experience in the round of rebirth and a belief that the Buddha made use of mental qualities accessible to all in using the laws of kamma to bring about an end to kamma and thus escape from the roundKamma and the use of kamma to transcend kamma constitute both the truth that the Buddha taught and the explanation of how he discovered itThus trust in the Buddha and belief in his teaching are two sides of the same coinAt the same time these truths concerning kamma are also the situation in which the listener is currently placed the causal nexus that determines both the dynamic of continued life in the cycle of rebirth and the way out of that cycleSo by definition conviction in the Buddhas Awakening is something that must be acted onIf one is convinced that one is entangled in a kammic web that can nevertheless be unraveled one will naturally try to learn from the example of the Buddha or his disciples developing the same mental qualities they did and attaining release oneselfThus unlike a religion where trust involves the belief that the deity will provide for ones salvation  either through grace or as a reward for unquestioning obedience  trust in the Buddha and belief in his teachings means that ones salvation is ultimately ones own responsibilityIn this way trust belief and a willingness to act are inseparably combinedThis is why conviction the first member of the set of five faculties leads naturally to persistence the secondPersistence here is equal to right exertion which develops mindfulness as the most essential skillful quality in the mindAs we saw under the frames of reference the proper development of mindfulness leads to concentration or the four jhanas while the jhanas provide the foundation for the arising of discernment the fifth and final member of this setWhen discernment is strengthened to the point of transcendence leading to the attainment of streamentry it then confirms the truths that were previously taken as a matter of conviction and faithThis confirmation feeds back into the causal loop strengthening conviction which provides the basis for developing the faculties still further until Arahantship is attainedAt that point there is no need to be convinced that the practice leads to release into the Deathless for one has fully realized that release through direct experienceThe underlying element throughout the development of this causal loop is the mental quality of heedfulnessThe texts explain heedfulness as a combination of right effort restraint and relentless mindfulness but as a quality of mind it goes deeper than thatHeedfulness realizes the dangers inherent in the round of rebirth and redeath and the fact that those dangers are inherent in each careless act of the mindIt thus fosters conviction in the possibility of a release from those dangers and a sense of urgency and precision in the practiceThis combination of urgency and precision provides the impetus for the full and thorough development of the faculties as one seriously pursues the possibility of release through the skillful development of the mindThis pattern of heedfulness developing the five faculties in the quest of the security of Deathlessness mirrors Prince Siddhatthas own quest which began with his conviction that there was no need to resign himself to the tyranny of aging illness and death and ended with the discernment that brought about his actual escape from that tyrannyThis pattern also calls to mind the famous verse from the Dhammapada that heedfulness is the path to the DeathlessThe five faculties can be taken as an elaboration of that verseBecause the five faculties are means to Deathlessness  rather than ends in themselves  they must not only be developed skillfully but also used skillfully as they are developedThe texts emphasizing this point focus on two of the faculties persistence and discernmentThe passage dealing with persistence is probably the Canons most explicit analogy between the performance of music and the practice of meditationOne should tune ones effort so that it is neither too intense nor too slack just as the main string of a musical instrument should be neither too sharp nor too flatOne then tunes the remaining faculties to the pitch of ones effort just as one would tune the notes of ones scale to the tonicOnly then can one take up the theme of ones meditation  the four frames of reference  just as one would take up and develop the basic theme of ones musical pieceAs for discernment passage  brings out the point that ones mastery of the faculties is not complete until one discerns the escape from themNormally the texts make this comment only about deceptively attractive objects or unskillful qualities in the mind but here they use it in connection with skillful qualitiesWhat this means is that there comes a point in the practice where one must go beyond even such skillful qualities as concentration and discernmentThey are skillful precisely because their full development allows one to go beyond themThis point is made explicit in  which shows exactly why the right view constituting discernment is right it is the only view that opens the way going beyond attachment to viewsDN adds that an awakened person  through regarding views not in terms of their content but in terms of the effect they have on the mind  comes to discern what lies beyond views and yet does not hold even to that act of discernmentAs a result of knowing but not holding the mind experiences Unbinding in the here and nowThis knowing but not holding is yet another reference to the perceptual mode of emptiness verging on nonfashioning the culminating point for each set in the Wings to AwakeningMonks there are these five facultiesWhich fiveThe faculty of conviction the faculty of persistence the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration and the faculty of discernmentNow where is the faculty of conviction to be seenIn the four factors of streamentryAnd where is the faculty of persistence to be seenIn the four right exertionsAnd where is the faculty of mindfulness to be seenIn the four frames of referenceAnd where is the faculty of concentration to be seenIn the four jhānasAnd where is the faculty of discernment to be seenIn the four noble truthsFactors of StreamentryAssociation with good people is a factor of streamentryListening to the true Dhamma is a factor of streamentryAppropriate attention is a factor of streamentryPractice in accordance with the Dhamma is a factor of streamentryNow with what four factors of streamentry is the disciple of the noble ones endowedThere is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One Indeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessedHe is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma The Dhamma is wellexpounded by the Blessed One to be seen here  now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselvesHe is endowed with verified confidence in the Saṅgha The Saṅgha of the Blessed Ones disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straightforwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully  in other words the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types  they are the Saṅgha of the Blessed Ones disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the incomparable field of merit for the worldHe is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones untorn unbroken unspotted unsplattered liberating praised by the wise untarnished leading to concentrationAnalysisAnd what is the faculty of convictionThere is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones has conviction is convinced of the Tathāgatas Awakening Indeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed This monks is called the faculty of convictionAnd what is the faculty of persistenceThere is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualitiesHe is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualitiesHe generates desire endeavors arouses persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the nonarising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the sake of the abandoning of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the maintenance nonconfusion increase plenitude development  culmination of skillful qualities that have arisenThis is called the faculty of persistenceAnd what is the faculty of mindfulnessThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones is mindful is endowed with excellent proficiency in mindfulness remembering  recollecting what was done and said a long time agoHe remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  having sati  subduing greed  distress with reference to the worldHe remains focused on feelings in  of themselves the mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  having sati  subduing greed  distress with reference to the worldThis is called the faculty of mindfulnessAnd what is the faculty of concentrationThere is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones making it his object to let go attains concentration attains singleness of mindQuite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities he enters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationWith the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceWith the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of joys  distresses  he enters  remains in the fourth jhāna purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painThis is called the faculty of concentrationAnd what is the faculty of discernmentThere is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones is discerning endowed with discernment of arising  passing away  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stressHe discerns as it has come to be This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is called the faculty of discernmentJust as a royal frontier fortress has a foundation post  deeply rooted well embedded immovable  unshakable  for the protection of those within and to ward off those without in the same way a disciple of the noble ones has conviction is convinced of the Tathāgatas Awakening Indeed the Blessed One is worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed With conviction as his foundation post the disciple of the noble ones abandons what is unskillful  develops what is skillful abandons what is blameworthy  develops what is blameless and looks after himself with purityJust as a royal frontier fortress has a large army stationed within  elephant soldiers cavalry charioteers bowmen standardbearers billeting officers soldiers of the supply corps noted princes commando heroes infantry  slaves  for the protection of those within and to ward off those without in the same way a disciple of the noble ones keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualitiesWith persistence as his army the disciple of the noble ones abandons what is unskillful  develops what is skillful abandons what is blameworthy  develops what is blameless and looks after himself with purityJust as a royal frontier fortress has a wise experienced intelligent gatekeeper to keep out those he doesnt know and to let in those he does for the protection of those within and to ward off those without in the same way a disciple of the noble ones is mindful highly meticulous remembering  able to call to mind even things that were done  said long agoWith mindfulness as his gatekeeper the disciple of the noble ones abandons what is unskillful  develops what is skillful abandons what is blameworthy  develops what is blameless and looks after himself with purityJust as a royal frontier fortress has ramparts that are high  thick  completely covered with plaster for the protection of those within and to ward off those without in the same way a disciple of the noble ones is discerning endowed with discernment of arising and passing away  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stressWith discernment as his covering of plaster the disciple of the noble ones abandons what is unskillful  develops what is skillful abandons what is blameworthy  develops what is blameless and looks after himself with purityJust as a royal frontier fortress has large stores of grass timber  water for the delight convenience  comfort of those within and to ward off those without in the same way the disciple of the noble ones enters  remains in the first jhāna for his own delight convenience  comfort and to alight on UnbindingJust as a royal frontier fortress has large stores of rice  barley for the delight convenience  comfort of those within and to ward off those without in the same way the disciple of the noble ones enters  remains in the second jhāna for his own delight convenience  comfort and to alight on UnbindingJust as a royal frontier fortress has large stores of sesame green gram  other beans for the delight convenience  comfort of those within and to ward off those without in the same way the disciple of the noble ones enters  remains in the third jhāna for his own delight convenience  comfort and to alight on UnbindingJust as a royal frontier fortress has large stores of tonics  ghee fresh butter oil honey molasses  salt  for the delight convenience  comfort of those within and to ward off those without in the same way the disciple of the noble ones enters  remains in the fourth jhāna for his own delight convenience  comfort and to alight on UnbindingThe Buddha Tell me Sāriputta A disciple of the noble ones who is thoroughly inspired by the Tathāgata who has gone solely to the Tathāgata could he have any doubt or uncertainty concerning the Tathāgata or the Tathāgatas teachingsVenSāriputta No venerable sir With a disciple of the noble ones who has conviction it may be expected that he will keep his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities that he will be steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualitiesWhatever persistence he has is his faculty of persistenceWith a disciple of the noble ones who has conviction who is resolute  persistent it may be expected that he will be mindful highly meticulous remembering and able to call to mind even things that were done  said long agoWhatever mindfulness he has is his faculty of mindfulnessWith a disciple of the noble ones who has conviction who is resolute  persistent and whose mindfulness is established it may be expected that  making it his object to let go  he will attain concentration  singleness of mindWhatever concentration he has is his faculty of concentrationWith a disciple of the noble ones who has conviction who is resolute  persistent whose mindfulness is established and whose mind is rightly concentrated it may be expected that he will discern From an inconceivable beginning comes transmigrationA beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering onThe total fading  cessation of ignorance of this mass of darkness is this peaceful exquisite state the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding Whatever discernment he has is his faculty of discernmentAnd so this convinced disciple of the noble ones thus striving again  again recollecting again  again concentrating his mind again  again discerning again  again becomes thoroughly convinced Those phenomena that once I had only heard about I here  now dwell touching them with my body and through discernment I see them clear through Whatever conviction he has is his faculty of convictionJust as in a house with a ridged roof the rafters are not stable or firm as long as the ridge beam is not in place but are stable  firm when it is in the same way four faculties are not stable or firm as long as noble knowledge has not arisen in a disciple of the noble ones but are stable  firm when it hasWhich fourThe faculty of conviction the faculty of persistence the faculty of mindfulness  the faculty of concentrationWhen a disciple of the noble ones is discerning the conviction that follows from that stands solidThe persistence that follows from that stands solidThe mindfulness that follows from that stands solidThe concentration that follows from that stands solidIts through the development  pursuit of two faculties that a monk whose effluents are ended declares gnosis Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world Through which twoThrough noble discernment  noble releaseWhatever is his noble discernment is his faculty of discernmentWhatever is his noble release is his faculty of concentrationJust as of all scented woods red sandalwood is reckoned the chief even so of all the mental qualities that are wings to selfawakening the faculty of discernment is reckoned the chief in terms of leading to awakeningAnd what are the mental qualities that are wings to selfawakeningThe faculty of conviction is a mental quality that is a wing to selfawakening leading to awakeningThe faculty of persistence mindfulness concentration discernment is a mental quality that is a wing to selfawakening leading to AwakeningWhen one quality is established in a monk the five faculties are developed  developed wellWhich one qualityHeedfulnessAnd what is heedfulnessThere is the case where a monk guards his mind in the midst of mental effluents  their concomitantsWhen his mind is guarded in the midst of mental effluents  their concomitants the faculty of conviction goes to the culmination of its developmentThe faculty of persistence mindfulness concentration discernment goes to the culmination of its developmentThis is how when one quality is established in a monk the five faculties are developed  developed wellJust as the footprints of all legged animals are encompassed by the footprint of the elephant and the elephants footprint is reckoned their chief in terms of size in the same way all skillful qualities are rooted in heedfulness lie gathered in heedfulness and heedfulness is reckoned their chiefJust as all the light of the constellations does not equal one sixteenth of the light of the moon and the light of the moon is reckoned their chief in the same way all skillful qualities are rooted in heedfulness lie gathered in heedfulness and heedfulness is reckoned their chiefThe Buddha Mindfulness of death when developed  pursued is of great fruit  great benefitIt gains a footing in the Deathless has the Deathless as its final endTherefore you should develop mindfulness of deathWhen this was said a certain monk addressed the Blessed One I already develop mindfulness of deathAnd how do you develop mindfulness of deathI think O that I might live for a day  night that I might attend to the Blessed Ones instructionsI would have accomplished a great deal This is how I develop mindfulness of deathThen another monk addressed the Blessed One I too already develop mindfulness of deathAnd how do you develop mindfulness of deathI think O that I might live for a day that I might attend to the Blessed Ones instructionsI would have accomplished a great deal This is how I develop mindfulness of deathThen another monk addressed the Blessed One I too develop mindfulness of death I think O that I might live for the interval that it takes to eat a meal that I might attend to the Blessed Ones instructionsI would have accomplished a great dealThen another monk addressed the Blessed One I too develop mindfulness of death I think O that I might live for the interval that it takes to swallow having chewed up four morsels of food that I might attend to the Blessed Ones instructionsI would have accomplished a great dealThen another monk addressed the Blessed One I too develop mindfulness of death I think O that I might live for the interval that it takes to swallow having chewed up one morsel of food that I might attend to the Blessed Ones instructionsI would have accomplished a great dealThen another monk addressed the Blessed One I too develop mindfulness of death I think O that I might live for the interval that it takes to breathe out after breathing in or to breathe in after breathing out that I might attend to the Blessed Ones instructionsI would have accomplished a great deal This is how I develop mindfulness of deathWhen this was said the Blessed One addressed the monksWhoever develops mindfulness of death thinking O that I might live for a day  night for a day for the interval that it takes to eat a meal for the interval that it takes to swallow having chewed up four morsels of food that I might attend to the Blessed Ones instructionsI would have accomplished a great deal  they are said to dwell heedlesslyThey develop mindfulness of death slowly for the sake of ending the effluentsBut whoever develops mindfulness of death thinking O that I might live for the interval that it takes to swallow having chewed up one morsel of food for the interval that it takes to breathe out after breathing in or to breathe in after breathing out that I might attend to the Blessed Ones instructionsI would have accomplished a great deal  they are said to dwell heedfullyThey develop mindfulness of death acutely for the sake of ending the effluentsTherefore you should train yourselves We will dwell heedfullyWe will develop mindfulness of death acutely for the sake of ending the effluents That is how you should train yourselvesThen the Blessed One addressed the monks I exhort you monks All fabrications are subject to decayAttain consummation through heedfulness Those were the Tathāgatas last wordsThese are the four modes of practiceWhich fourPainful practice with slow intuition painful practice with quick intuition pleasant practice with slow intuition  pleasant practice with quick intuitionAnd what is painful practice with slow intuitionThere is the case where a certain individual is normally of an intensely passionate natureHe perpetually experiences pain  distress born of passionOr he is normally of an intensely aversive natureHe perpetually experiences pain  distress born of aversionOr he is normally of an intensely deluded natureHe perpetually experiences pain  distress born of delusionHis five faculties  the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment  are present in a weak formBecause of their weakness he attains only slowly the immediacy that leads to the ending of the effluentsThis is called painful practice with slow intuitionAnd what is painful practice with quick intuitionThere is the case where a certain individual is normally of an intensely passionate aversive deluded natureHe perpetually experiences pain  distress born

quick intuition pleasant practice with slow intuition  pleasant practice with quick intuitionAnd what is painful practice with slow intuitionThere is the case where a monk remains focused on unattractiveness with regard to the body percipient of loathsomeness with regard to food percipient of nondelight with regard to the entire world focused on inconstancy with regard to all fabricationsThe perception of death is well established within himHe dwells in dependence on these five strengths of a learner  strength of conviction strength of shame strength of compunction strength of persistence  strength of discernment  but his five faculties appear weaklyBecause of their weakness he attains only slowly the immediacy that leads to the ending of the effluentsThis is called painful practice with slow intuitionAnd what is painful practice with quick intuitionThere is the case where a monk remains focused on unattractiveness with regard to the body focused on inconstancy with regard to all fabricationsThe perception of death is well established within himHe dwells in dependence on the five strengths of a learner and his five faculties are present in an intense formBecause of their intensity he attains quickly the immediacy that leads to the ending of the effluentsThis is called painful practice with quick intuitionAnd what is pleasant practice with

intuitionThese are the four modes of practiceAs VenSoṇa was meditating in seclusion this train of thought arose in his awareness Of the Blessed Ones disciples who have aroused their persistence I am one but my mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clingingsustenanceNow my family has enough wealth that it would be possible to enjoy wealth  make meritWhat if I were to disavow the training return to the lower life and to enjoy wealth  make meritThen the Blessed One as soon as he perceived with his awareness the train of thought in VenSoṇas awareness  as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm  disappeared from Mount Vulture Peak appeared in the Cool Wood right in front of VenSoṇa and sat down on a prepared seatVenSoṇa after bowing down to the Blessed One sat down to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Just now as you were meditating in seclusion didnt this train of thought appear to your awareness Of the Blessed Ones disciples who have aroused their persistence I am one but my mind is not released from the effluents What if I were to disavow the training return to the lower life and to enjoy wealth  make meritYes lordNow what do you think SoṇaBefore when you were a housedweller were you skilled at playing the vinaYes lordAnd when the strings of your vina were too taut was your vina in tune  playableNo lordAnd when the strings of your vina were too loose was your vina in tune  playableNo lordAnd when the strings of your vina were neither too taut nor too loose but tuned to be right on pitch was your vina in tune  playableYes lordIn the same way Soṇa overaroused persistence leads to restlessness overly slack persistence leads to lazinessThus you should determine the right pitch for your persistence attune the pitch of the faculties and there pick up your themeYes lord VenSoṇa answered the Blessed OneThen having given this exhortation to VenSoṇa the Blessed One  as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm  disappeared from the Cool Wood and appeared on Mount Vulture PeakSo after that VenSoṇa determined the right pitch for his persistence attuned the pitch of the faculties and there picked up his themeDwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus VenSoṇa became another one of the ArahantsThere is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that I am a learner and whereby a monk who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can discern that I am an adeptThere is the case where a monk is a learnerHe discerns as it has come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that I am a learnerFurthermore the monk who is a learner reflects Is there outside of this any contemplative or brahman who teaches the true genuine  accurate Dhamma like the Blessed One And he discerns No there is no contemplative or brahman outside of this who teaches the true genuine  accurate Dhamma like the Blessed One This too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that I am a learnerFurthermore the monk who is a learner discerns the five faculties the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernmentHe sees having penetrated it with discernment what their destiny excellence rewards  consummation are but he does not dwell touching them with his bodyThis too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that I am a learnerAnd what is the manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can discern that I am an adeptThere is the case where a monk who is an adept discerns the five faculties the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernmentHe sees having penetrated it with discernment what their destiny excellence rewards  consummation are and he dwells touching them with his bodyThis is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can discern that I am an adeptFurthermore the monk who is an adept discerns the six sense faculties the faculty of the eye ear nose tongue body intellectHe discerns These six sense faculties will cease entirely everywhere  in every way without remainder and no other set of six sense faculties will arise anywhere or in any way This too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can discern that I am an adeptWhen a disciple of the noble ones discerns as they have come to be the origination the disappearance the allure the drawbacks  and the emancipation from  these five faculties he is called a disciple of the noble ones who has attained the stream not subject to perdition certain destined for selfawakening When having discerned as they have come to be the origination the disappearance the allure the drawbacks  and the emancipation from  these five faculties he is released from lack of clingingsustenance he is called an ArahantThe Buddha Sāriputta do you take it on conviction that the faculty of conviction when developed  pursued gains a footing in the Deathless has the Deathless as its goal  consummationDo you take it on conviction that the faculty of persistence mindfulness concentration discernment when developed  pursued gains a footing in the Deathless has the Deathless as its goal  consummationVenSāriputta Its not that I take it on conviction in the Blessed One that the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment when developed  pursued gains a footing in the Deathless has the Deathless as its goal  consummationThose who have not known seen penetrated realized or attained it by means of discernment would have to take it on conviction in others that the faculty of conviction discernment has the Deathless as its goal  consummation whereas those who have known seen penetrated realized  attained it by means of discernment would have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction discernment has the Deathless as its goal  consummationAnd as for me I have known seen penetrated realized  attained it by means of discernmentI have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction discernment has the Deathless as its goal  consummationThere are these five strengthsWhich fiveStrength of conviction strength of persistence strength of mindfulness strength of concentration  strength of discernmentThese are the five strengthsJust as the River Ganges flows to the east slopes to the east inclines to the east in the same way when a monk develops  pursues the five strengths he flows to Unbinding slopes to Unbinding inclines to UnbindingAnd how is it that when a monk develops  pursues the five strengths he flows slopes inclines to UnbindingThere is the case where the monk develops strength of conviction dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in letting goHe develops strength of persistence mindfulness concentration discernment dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting goThis is how a monk when developing  pursuing the five strengths flows slopes inclines to UnbindingThere is a manner of reckoning whereby the five faculties are the same as the five strengths and the five strengths the same as the five facultiesAnd what is that methodWhatever is the faculty of conviction that is the strength of convictionWhatever is the strength of conviction that is the faculty of convictionWhatever is the faculty of persistence that is the strength of persistenceWhatever is the strength of persistence that is the faculty of persistenceWhatever is the faculty of mindfulness that is the strength of mindfulnessWhatever is the strength of mindfulness that is the faculty of mindfulnessWhatever is the faculty of concentration that is the strength of concentrationWhatever is the strength of concentration that is the faculty of concentrationWhatever is the faculty of discernment that is the strength of discernmentWhatever is the strength of discernment that is the faculty of discernmentImagine a river  flowing sloping inclining toward the east  in whose midst is an islandThere is a manner of reckoning whereby the river is classified as one current and another manner of reckoning whereby it is classified as twoAnd what is the first manner of reckoningWhatever water lies to the east of the island and whatever water lies to the westThis is the manner of reckoning whereby the river is classified as one currentAnd what is the second manner of reckoningWhatever water lies to the north of the island and whatever water lies to the southThis is the manner of reckoning whereby the river is classified as twoIn the same way whatever is the faculty of conviction that is the strength of convictionWhatever is the strength of conviction that is the faculty of conviction Whatever is the faculty of discernment that is the strength of discernmentWhatever is the strength of discernment that is the faculty of discernmentThe seven factors for Awakening are closely related to the practice of the four frames of referenceThe texts use two patterns to describe this relationshipThe first pattern is a spiral showing how the seven factors for Awakening build on the four frames of referenceThis point is reflected in the position of mindfulness  defined as the practice of any one of the four frames of reference  as the first factor in the listDiscernment in the role of the analysis of mental qualities into skillful and unskillful builds on right mindfulness and leads to persistence which in the form of right effortexertion maximizes the skillful qualities and minimizes the unskillful onesThis in turn leads to four factors associated with jhāna rapture serenity concentration and equanimityEquanimity here is not a neutral feeling but rather a balancing or moderation  an evenness of mind  with regard to any feeling or object that arisesIt is identical with the equanimity in the fourth jhāna and with the inherent equanimity in the fifth factor of fivefactored noble concentration which can develop out of any of the four jhanasAs such it can lead either to greater mastery of meditation  as the purity of mindfulness that accompanies the fourth jhāna provides the basis for even more precise analysis of qualities thus allowing the causal loop to spiral to a higher level  or to the state of nonfashioning that opens to AwakeningAbhidhamma texts seem to contradict the point that equanimity feeds back into mindfulness in this way for they maintain that the factors for Awakening are transcendent  in other words that they come into play only as one reaches the point of Awakening where no temporal feedback would take placeThe discourses however show that the factors for Awakening can function in the development of mundane concentration as wellPassage  shows how the feeding of the factors for Awakening is needed to starve the hindrances mental qualities that have to be suppressed before mundane concentration can be attainedPassage  shows how the factors function in developing the four attitudes that lead to awarenessrelease  a mundane form of release  and indicates the highest state to which those attitudes can lead for one who has penetrated no higher ie who has attained none of the transcendent levelsThese passages demonstrate that the factors for Awakening can function on the level of mundane jhāna in addition to the level at the verge of AwakeningThus equanimity as a factor for Awakening on the mundane plane can feed back into the process of meditation providing a steady basis for more continuous mindfulness and clearer analysis of mental qualities until all the factors of the list ripen to transcendenceThe second pattern for describing the relationship between the factors for Awakening and the four frames of reference is more holographicAs we have already noted all the factors in the list are all implicit in the approach stage of framesofreference meditationThe texts themselves make this point by saying that the development of any one of the frames of reference brings the factors for Awakening to the culmination of their developmentThe differences between these two patterns  a spiraling sequence building on the four frames of reference and a holographic formula implicit in the frames of reference  is largely one of emphasisAs the dual nature of thisthat conditionality indicates  with mental factors building on one another over time and strengthening one another in the present  both aspects act together in actual practiceViewed as a spiraling sequence the factors for Awakening offer some interesting contrasts to the five facultiesBoth sets depict one of the causal loops in the skillful development of the mind but here the emphasis is not on how mindfulness and concentration help to develop discernment but on how mindfulness and discernment help to develop concentrationThis different dynamic is reflected in the mental qualities that act as underlying agents in the development of each setAs we have seen heedfulness underlies the development of the faculties it grows from a sense of conviction in the principle of kamma into members of the concentration aggregate  right effort and right mindfulness  in the noble eightfold pathIn the case of the factors for Awakening appropriate attention is what underlies the development of every element in the set it grows from a component factor of conviction into a member of the discernment aggregate right viewThus in each set the agent underlying its development reflects the intermediate members of the set in their role of fostering the final memberA closer look at the topic of appropriate attention will show how the processes of discernment can foster concentration to the point where both issue in AwakeningBecause this topic is so central to the practice we will have to treat it in detailThe term appropriate attention can also be rendered as wise reflection the proper approach or systematic attention It is essentially the basic insight that enables one to see which issues are worth paying attention to and which ones should be ignoredPassage  gives what is probably the best depiction of this processThe meditator ignores questions that lead to the proliferation of mental effluents and pays attention to questions that help weaken themAs we noted in IB the knowledge that puts an end to the effluents deals with experience in the phenomenological modeThus the best questions for weakening the effluents are ones that lead the mind into that modeNow not all questions are helpful in this waySome deal in terms that focus the mind on narrative or cosmological issues in ways that actually obstruct a phenomenological viewpointFor this reason the Buddha found it necessary to divide questions into four classes those meriting a categorical answer those meriting an analytical answer those deserving a counterquestion and those deserving to be put asideThe first class includes questions that are already wellphrased and can yield straight answers useful in weakening ones mental effluentsThe second class includes those that are poorly phrased but are close enough to becoming useful that they can be clarified by a redefinition of termsThe third class covers instances where the real issue is not the question as phrased but the confused line of thinking or hidden agendas behind the asking of the questionOnce these underlying elements are exposed and corrected by the proper counterquestion fruitful questions can then be framedThe final class of questions covers instances where both the question and the act of asking it are so misguided that any attempt to get involved in the issue would lead only to the proliferation of mental effluents and so the whole issue should be put asideOf these four classes of questions the class meriting categorical answers is of most interest here for its the class that can act as a focal point for appropriate attentionThe vast majority of the questions that the Buddha asks and answers categorically in the texts fall into three general sorts those that seek to identify terms and categories useful for the task of ending stress and suffering those that seek to place particular events in their proper category and those that seek to understand the causal role of events assigned to the various categories how they condition and are conditioned by one anotherA subset of consists of questions concerning the effect that ones questions and ones approach to the practice in general have on the mindAll of these three sorts of question are closely related to the three stages of framesofreference meditation sorts and relate to the first stage and sort to the second whereas the subset of dealing with the questioning approach itself leads directly to the thirdThis last subset also forms the overall principle for delineating all four classes of questions mentioned above the effect that the process of asking and answering has on the mindIn simple terms this principle means viewing experience in terms of cause and effect viewing questions in terms of cause and effect classifying them according to the results that come from trying to answer them and treating them only in ways that will help lead to the ending of suffering and stressThis is the proper function of appropriate attention in its most mature formTo arrive at this mature level however appropriate attention must be developed step by stepThese steps can be shown by taking the passages given in this section and viewing them in the context of the practice of the fourth frame of reference focusing on the mental qualities of the hindrances and the factors for Awakening in and of themselves in the course of developing concentrationThe first step is simply to identify the hindrances and factors for Awakening as they are experienced noting their presence and absence in the mind  a movement toward what the Buddha called entering into emptinessAs IIID makes clear there are several preliminary steps in concentration practice leading up to the ability to do thisWhen these are mastered one can focus on say the hindrance of illwill not in terms of the object of the illwill but on the quality of illwill as a mere event in the mindThe question here is not What am I angry about or What did that person do wrong but simply What is happening in my mindHow can it be classedGiven the wellknown Buddhist teaching on notself some people have wondered why the questions of appropriate attention at this step would use such concepts as me and my but these concepts are essential at this stage  where the mind is still more at home in the narrative mode of self and others  in pointing out that the focus of the inquiry should be directed within rather than withoutThis helps to bring ones frame of reference to the experience of mental qualities as phenomena in and of themselves and away from the narratives that provoked the illwill to begin withOnly when this shift in reference is secure can the concepts of me and my be dispensed with in the third step belowThe second step in appropriate attention  corresponding to the second stage of framesofreference practice  is to inquire into the causal functioning of the hindrances and factors for Awakening to see how they arise and cease in the course of ones concentration practiceThe aim here is to gain insight into the workings of the hindrances and factors for Awakening as one tries to eliminate the former and bring the latter to full developmentThe passages in this section dealing with this step treat the issue in terms of two metaphors  balance on the one hand feeding and starving on the other  and list the desired results of the meditation as a standard of measurement for gauging the success of ones practiceWe have met with the role of balance already in the four bases of power and the five facultiesWhat is special here is that instead of finding a balance within each factor for Awakening the meditator is to use different factors to balance out specific hindrancesThe more active members  analysis of qualities persistence and rapture  can be used to offset sluggish mind states the more calming members  serenity concentration and equanimity  counteract restless mind statesMindfulness is the only member of the set that is inherently skillful at all times for it is the one that keeps the need for balance in mindTo combine the portrayals of balance under this set and under the bases of power we can say that the more active factors for Awakening should be used to prevent specific bases of power  such as desire  from being too sluggish or constricted whereas the more calming factors for Awakening should be used to prevent desire etc from being too active or scatteredIt is interesting also to note that although analysis of qualities is a potential cause for restlessness it is also the factor needed to judge when its own activity is going overboard and needs to be calmed with concentrationUnder the metaphor of feeding and starving the skill of appropriate attention is said to feed all the factors for Awakening just as inappropriate attention starves them and feeds the hindrances in their placeAs  points out the role of appropriate attention at this level is to inquire into the property that acts as a foothold for each hindrance or factor for AwakeningThe feeding process is especially direct with analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening  a near equivalent of appropriate attention  and the hindrance of uncertaintyThese two form a pair in that the feeding of analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening in and of itself starves the hindrance of uncertainty and vice versaAppropriate attention to the effects of skillful and unskillful qualities in the mind  in other words focusing on questions that identify such qualities as the hindrances and the factors for Awakening and inquire into their causes and effects  not only feeds this factor for Awakening but also enables one to develop its fellow factorsInappropriate attention to issues that excite uncertainty  asking questions that can lead only to doubt and perplexity  not only feeds the hindrance of uncertainty but also leads to a sense of confusion that prevents all the factors for Awakening from developingWith some of the other factors for Awakening  such as mindfulness rapture and equanimity  the texts are vague as to exactly which properties form their potential footholdsA few of these properties can be inferred from other texts so they are crossreferenced in the relevant passagesThe remaining instances can serve as challenges for each meditator to explore through practiceChallenges of this sort are valuable in forcing one to become selfreliant at observing cause and effect and asking the right questions two skills that are basic to the development of appropriate attention and the path of practice as a wholeAs one becomes more successful in identifying these properties and attending to them in the appropriate way ones skill at concentration practice improvesConcentration and equanimity then feed back into the loop by purifying mindfulness in the practice of jhāna providing a steady basis for discernment in terms of more precise analysis of qualities and more subtlety in ones attentionThis can lead either to improved abilities at concentration or to a more selfreferential mode away from the object of the practice and turning toward the approach where these activities of discernment become sensitive to themselves as events in the causal networkIn particular they can begin to ask questions about their own acts of questioning to see what latent assumptions are still causing them uncertainty and getting in the way of their further developmentIn this way they come to the third step in their developmentAccording to the texts the most insidious issues that can excite uncertainty are questions that center on the concept of I Do I exist Do I not exist In the cosmological or metaphysical mode this concept leads to such questions as Does the self exist Does it not exist In the psychological or personal narrative mode it leads to a sense of selfidentity attachment to the object with which one identifies and all the suffering that inherently resultsIn either mode this concept leads to uncertainty about the past and future Did I exist in the past Will I exist in the future What will I be All of these questions obviously pull the mind out of the phenomenological mode passage  shows that the Buddha regarded them as leading to mental effluents and thus unworthy of attentionThe one time he was asked pointblank as to whether or not there is a self he refused to answer thus showing that the question deserves to be put asideWhat then of the wellknown Buddhist teachings on notselfFrom the way these teachings are expressed in some of the texts it might be inferred that the Buddha held to the principle that there is no selfHere though it is important to remember the Buddhas own comment on how his teachings are to be interpretedWith some of them he said its proper to draw inferences whereas with others its notUnfortunately he didnt illustrate the distinction between the two types of teachings with specific examplesHowever were apparently safe in assuming that if we try to draw inferences from his statements to give either a categorical answer or an analytical answer to a question that the Buddha showed by example should not be asked or answered we are drawing inferences where they should not be drawnA more fruitful line of inquiry is to view experience not in terms of the existence or nonexistence of the self but in terms of the categories of the four noble truths which  identifies as the truly proper subject of appropriate attentionIf we look at the way the Buddha phrases questions about notself in the context of the duties appropriate to the four noble truths we see that they function as tools for comprehending stress and abandoning the craving and clinging that cause itThus this line of questioning helps bring about the ending of the mental effluentsRather than asking Do I exist one should ask Is this mineIs this meIf these things are regarded as me or mine will there be suffering These questions when properly answered can lead directly to the phenomenological mode and on to release from clinging and from suffering and stressThus they are worth askingWhen applied to the hindrances and factors for Awakening this line of inquiry can bring the mind to the third stage of framesofreference meditation by calling into question the me and my assumed in the first step of questioningThis undermines any sense of selfidentification first with the hindrances  such as Im drowsy  and then with the factors for Awakening  such as My mind is sereneAll that then remains is the radically phenomenological mode that enters fully into the emptiness on the verge of nonfashioning where there are no longer any questions but simply awareness that There are mental qualities There is this This is the threshold to AwakeningThroughout the process of developing appropriate attention in the course of the second and third stages of framesofreference meditation the spiraling loop of the factors for Awakening continually feeds back on itself as the factor of equanimity allows the factors of mindfulness and analysis of qualities to gauge the success of the practice and call for adjustments where neededThe standard of measurementto be used in this evaluation is given in the formula that frequently accompanies the definition of the factors for Awakening in the texts each factor ideally should depend on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting go The terms in this list occur both in mundane and in transcendent contexts which indicates that they have both mundane and transcendent levels of meaningOn the mundane level they play a role in the practice of jhānaAs they develop and reach transcendence they bring the mind to the state of nonfashioningBy basing ones practice on the seclusion dispassion and cessation found in the jhāna that takes letting go as its object and by feeding it through the constant evaluation provided by appropriate attention and analysis of qualities to the point of ever more refined levels of letting go one brings together the mental qualities of attention and intention in a mutually reinforcing way that heads in the direction of AwakeningAt the highest level of letting go  the knowing but not holding that we equated with the perceptual mode of emptiness on the verge of nonfashioning in section IIE  appropriate attention gives way to transcendent clear knowingThe intention underlying the practice of jhāna gives way to the stillness of the resulting transcendent freedomThis is how the factors for Awakening in the words of the texts when developed  pursued lead to the culmination of clear knowing  releaseOnce the Blessed One was staying at Sāketa in the Añjana Forest Game RefugeThen Kuṇḍaliya the wanderer came to where the Blessed One was staying and on arrival greeted him courteously and after engaging in pleasant conversation sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama I like to frequent gatherings in parksIt is my habit at midday after my morning meal to go from park to park from garden to gardenThere I encounter various contemplatives  brahmans discoursing on the rewards of defending their own tenets in debate and the rewards of condemning those of othersNow in the experience of what reward does Master Gotama dwellThe Tathāgata dwells experiencing the reward of the fruits of clear knowing  releaseBut what are the qualities that when developed  pursued lead to the culmination of clear knowing  releaseThe seven factors for AwakeningAnd what are the qualities that lead to the culmination of the seven factors for AwakeningThe four frames of referenceAnd what are the qualities that lead to the culmination of the four frames of referenceThe three courses of right conductAnd what are the qualities that lead to the culmination of the three courses of right conductRestraint of the senses And how does restraint of the senses when developed  pursued lead to the culmination of the three courses of right conductThere is the case where a monk on seeing a pleasant form with the eye doesnt hanker after it doesnt delight in it doesnt give rise to passion for itUnmoved in body  unmoved in mind he is inwardly well composed  well releasedOn seeing an unpleasant form with the eye he is not upset his mind is not unsettled his feelings are not wounded his mind does not become resentfulUnmoved in body  unmoved in mind he is inwardly well composed  well releasedOn hearing a pleasant unpleasant sound with the ear On smelling a pleasant unpleasant smell with the nose On tasting a pleasant unpleasant taste with the tongue On feeling a pleasant unpleasant tactile sensation with the bodyOn cognizing a pleasant idea with the intellect he doesnt hanker after it doesnt delight in it doesnt give rise to passion for itUnmoved in body  unmoved in mind he is inwardly well composed  well releasedOn cognizing an unpleasant idea with the intellect he is not upset his mind is not unsettled his feelings are not wounded his mind does not become resentfulUnmoved in body  unmoved in mind he is inwardly well composed  well releasedThis Kuṇḍaliya is how restraint of the senses when developed  pursued leads to the culmination of the three courses of right conductAnd how are the three courses of right conduct developed  pursued so as to lead to the culmination of the four frames of referenceThere is the case where a monk abandons wrong conduct in terms of his deeds and develops right conduct in terms of his deeds abandons wrong conduct in terms of his speech and develops right conduct in terms of his speech abandons wrong conduct in terms of his thoughts and develops right conduct in terms of his thoughtsThis Kuṇḍaliya is how the three courses of right conduct when developed  pursued lead to the culmination of the four frames of referenceAnd how are the four frames of reference developed  pursued so that the seven factors for Awakening come to completionOn whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world on that occasion his mindfulness is steady  without lapseWhen his mindfulness is steady  without lapse then mindfulness as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its developmentRemaining mindful in this way he examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernmentWhen he remains mindful in this way examining analyzing  coming to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its developmentIn one who examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment unflagging persistence is arousedWhen unflagging persistence is aroused in one who examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then persistence as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its developmentIn one whose persistence is aroused a rapture notoftheflesh arisesWhen a rapture notoftheflesh arises in one whose persistence is aroused then rapture as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its developmentFor one who is enraptured the body grows calm and the mind grows calmWhen the body  mind of an enraptured monk grow calm then serenity as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its developmentFor one who is at ease  his body calmed  the mind becomes concentratedWhen the mind of one who is at ease  his body calmed  becomes concentrated then concentration as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its developmentHe oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimityWhen he oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity equanimity as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its developmentThis Kuṇḍaliya is how the four frames of reference when developed  pursued lead to the culmination of the seven factors for AwakeningAnd how are the seven factors for Awakening developed  pursued so as to lead to the culmination of clear knowing  releaseThere is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting goHe develops analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening persistence as a factor for Awakening rapture as a factor for Awakening serenity as a factor for Awakening concentration as a factor for Awakening equanimity as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting goThis Kuṇḍaliya is how the seven factors for Awakening when developed  pursued lead to the culmination of clear knowing  releaseWhen this had been said Kuṇḍaliya the wanderer said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama magnificentIn many ways has Master Gotama made the Dhamma clear  just as if one were to place upright what has been overturned to reveal what has been hidden to point out the way to one who is lost or to set out a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes might see formsI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma  to the Community of monksMay Master Gotama regard me as a lay follower gone for refuge from this day forth as long as life shall lastNow in what way does a monk develop  pursue mindfulness of inout breathing so that it bears great fruit  great benefitsThere is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for Awakening accompanied by mindfulness of inout breathing  dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting goHe develops analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening persistence as a factor for Awakening rapture as a factor for Awakening serenity as a factor for Awakening concentration as a factor for Awakening equanimity as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting goThis is how mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so that it bears great fruit  great benefitsNow what is the manner of reckoning by which the seven factors for Awakening are fourteenAny mindfulness with regard to internal qualities is mindfulness as a factor for AwakeningAnd any mindfulness with regard to external qualities is also mindfulness as a factor for AwakeningThus this forms the definition of mindfulness as a factor for Awakening and it is in this manner that it is twoAny time one examines investigates  scrutinizes internal qualities with discernment that is analysis of qualities as a factor for AwakeningAnd any time one examines investigates  scrutinizes external qualities with discernment that too is analysis of qualities as a factor for AwakeningThus this forms the definition of analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening and it is in this manner that it is twoAny bodily persistence is persistence as a factor for AwakeningAnd any mental persistence is also persistence as a factor for AwakeningThus this forms the definition of persistence as a factor for Awakening and it is in this manner that it is twoAny rapture accompanied by directed thought  evaluation is rapture as a factor for AwakeningAnd any rapture unaccompanied by directed thought  evaluation is also rapture as a factor for AwakeningThus this forms the definition of rapture as a factor for Awakening and it is in this manner that it is twoAny bodily serenity is serenity as a factor for AwakeningAnd any mental serenity is also serenity as a factor for AwakeningThus this forms the definition of serenity as a factor for Awakening and it is in this manner that it is twoAny concentration accompanied by directed thought  evaluation is concentration as a factor for AwakeningAnd any concentration unaccompanied by directed thought  evaluation is also concentration as a factor for AwakeningThus this forms the definition of concentration as a factor for Awakening and it is in this manner that it is twoAny equanimity with regard to internal qualities is equanimity as a factor for AwakeningAnd any equanimity with regard to external qualities is also equanimity as a factor for AwakeningThus this forms the definition of equanimity as a factor for Awakening and it is in this manner that it is twoThis is the manner of reckoning by which the seven factors for Awakening are fourteenI do not envision any one

inappropriate unarisen factors for Awakening do not arise and arisen factors for Awakening do not go to the culmination of their developmentI do not envision any one quality by which unarisen factors

complete transcending of the dimension of infinitude of space Infinite consciousness he enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessI tell you monks the awarenessrelease through

There is nothing he enters  remains in the dimension of nothingnessI tell you monks the awarenessrelease through equanimity has the dimension of nothingness as its excellence  in the case of one who

knowledgeable gatekeeper to keep out those he didnt know and to let in those he didPatrolling the path around the city he wouldnt see a crack or an opening in the walls big enough for even a cat to slip throughAlthough he wouldnt know that Soandso many creatures enter or leave the city he would know this Whatever large creatures enter or leave the city all enter or leave it through this gateIn the same way the Tathāgata isnt concerned as to whether all the cosmos or half of it or a third of it led by means ofBut he does know this All those who have been led are being led or will be led from the cosmos have done so are doing so or will do so after having abandoned the five hindrances  those defilements of awareness that weaken discernment  having wellestablished their minds in the four frames of reference and having developed as they have come to be the seven factors for AwakeningThe noble eightfold path is the most standard description of the Buddhist way of practiceThe Buddha taught it to his first disciples and to his last as well as to the majority of those in betweenIt is called noble because when all of its factors come together in a fully developed form they stand on the threshold to streamentry the first of the noble or transcendent attainmentsThe image of path used for the factors of this set has two major implications which we have already encountered in IIDFirst the image implies that these factors are means to an end not an end in themselves second they lead to rather than cause the goalIn the context of this set this image has two levels of meaning On the beginning level the path is a series of qualities that one must consciously develop step by step in order to bring oneself nearer to the goalOn the ultimate or noble level it is a convergence of those qualities fully developed within the mind at the point of nonfashioning leading inexorably to the DeathlessOn the beginning level one must work at following the path but on the noble level the path becomes a vehicle that delivers one to the goalThe eight factors of the noble eightfold path fall under the three aggregates of discernment virtue and concentration right view and right resolve fall under the discernment aggregate right speech right action and right livelihood under the virtue aggregate and right effort right mindfulness and right concentration under the concentration aggregatePassage  states that although the factors of the noble path fall under these three aggregates the three aggregates do not fall under the factors of the noble pathWhat this means is that not every instance of discernment virtue or concentration within the mind would count as a factor of the noble pathTo begin with there are such things as wrong virtue wrong concentration and wrong discernmentSecondly even right virtue concentration and discernment count as noble only when brought to a level of advanced developmentThis point is reflected in  which distinguishes mundane and noble levels for each factor of the pathEven though the mundane factors counteract blatant cases of wrong view wrong resolve etc they still are conjoined with subtle levels of mental effluents and can lead to further becomingNevertheless one must first nurture the mundane levels of the eight factors before they can develop into their noble counterpartsOn the mundane level the first five factors of the path correspond to the faculty of convictionRight view on this level means believing in the principle of kamma and trusting that those who have practiced properly truly understand the workings of kamma in this life and the nextIn the Buddhas words this level of right view holds that There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificedThere are fruits  results of good  bad actionsThere is this world  the next worldThere is mother  fatherThere are spontaneously reborn beings there are contemplatives  brahmans who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves What this passage means is that there is merit in generosity the moral qualities of good and bad are inherent parts of the cosmos and not simply social conventions there is life after death one has a true moral debt to ones parents and there are people who have lived the renunciates life properly in such a way that they have gained true and direct knowledge of these mattersThese beliefs are the minimum prerequisites for following the path to skillfulness as they necessarily underlie any solid conviction in the principle of kammaMundane levels of right resolve then build on right view as one resolves to act in ways that will not create bad kamma mundane right speech right action and right livelihood result naturally as one follows through with ones resolveRight effort right mindfulness and right concentration on this level correspond to the faculties of persistence mindfulness and concentrationRight concentration in turn provides a basis for insight into the four noble truths which counts both as the faculty of discernment and the noble level of right viewOnce right view reaches the noble level it brings the remaining factors of the path up to the noble level as wellOne of the striking features of this level of the path is that it consists primarily of discernment and concentration with the boundaries between the two increasingly blurredThe noble level of right resolve part of the discernment aggregate consists of directed thought evaluation and mental singleness all of which are factors of jhānaThe noble level of right speech right action and right livelihood differ from the mundane levels of those factors in that the emphasis here is on the state of mind of the person abstaining from wrong speech action and livelihoodAlthough  does not define the noble levels of right effort mindfulness and concentration it seems safe to assume that they are equivalent to the fifth factor of noble right concentration to be discussed under IIIE and IIIF in which all three of these factors converge with right view and right resolve in a state of full developmentIn fact their mutual reinforcement is what makes these factors all rightThis point is confirmed by  which states that when the noble eightfold path goes to the culmination of its development tranquility and insight act in concertThis point also explains the statement at the beginning of  to the effect that the path consists primarily of right concentration with the remaining factors as its supports and requisite conditions These supports and conditions not only lead to right concentration but when they all become noble all eight factors coalesce in the mind in a state of solid onenessWhereas on the mundane level the path factors though interconnected were separate on the noble level they form a single unified pathWhen the noble eightfold path is attained the mind reaches the level of streamentry the first of the four levels of AwakeningThus the noble eightfold path represents the culmination of all seven sets in the Wings to AwakeningTo attain each of the next two levels of Awakening  oncereturning and nonreturning  the eight noble path factors must converge again in the mindHowever to attain the highest level  Arahantship  the eight noble factors must converge together with two more right knowledge and right releaseRight knowledge is nowhere defined per se in the Canon but  would seem to indicate the following relationship between it and right view Right view is realization of the four noble truths and the duties appropriate to each while right knowledge is the realization that the duties have been brought to fulfillmentThe conjunction of right knowledge and right release reflects on a higher level the conjunction of discernment and concentration on the noble level of the eightfold pathPassage  suggests that release here can be considered as analogous to concentration albeit totally unshakableRight knowledge would include awareness of the unshakability of the release while the release would remain unshaken even in the face of that knowledgeAt this point even the path can be abandoned for one has reached the goalAbandoning here does not mean that one reverts to wrongs views wrong action etc rather one no longer needs to use right view etc as a means to a further attainmentAs MN and SNstate the Awakened one continues practicing meditation and exercising right view as pleasant dwellings for the mind conducive to mindfulness and alertness and leads a moral life both for its inherent pleasure and for the sake of the example it offers to those still on the pathThe noble eightfold path like the seven factors for Awakening is explicitly explained both as a causal loop and as a holographic formulaWe have already described the causal loop above in showing how the development of the mundane and noble path factors follows the pattern of the five facultiesPassage  presents a holographic pattern in which the development of each factor needs three main supporting factors right view which acts as the leader so as to know what the right and wrong versions of the factors are right effort which makes the effort to abandon the wrong version and develop the right and right mindfulness which keeps the task of right effort in mindThus three factors that we have identified as essential to the development of skillfulness  discernment mindfulness and effort  are involved at each step along the pathAs a result of that involvement they grow stronger to the point where they can help turn mundane right concentration  the fourth factor essential to the development of skillfulness  into noble right concentrationIn this sense they play a role analogous to that of heedfulness in the five faculties and appropriate attention in the seven factors for AwakeningIn fact they seem to be a complete working out of the elements implicit in those two qualitiesA quick review of the seven sets will show that all of them develop both in a linear and in a holographic wayEven the holographic sets  the frames of reference right exertions and bases of power  contain implicit versions of causal loops in that all three must follow the three stages of framesofreference meditationEven the linear causalloop sets  the five faculties and strengths the seven factors for Awakening and the noble eightfold path  contain implicit holographic formulae in that the dynamic of their development is inherent in specific qualities or clusters of qualities heedfulness in the case of the faculties and strengths appropriate attention in the case of the factors for Awakening and the cluster of right view right mindfulness and right effort in the case of the noble eightfold pathThis combination of linear and holographic patterns grows more complex as we remember that each of the first two stages of framesofreference meditation can form linear causal loops within themselves while two of the factors in the threepart cluster that develops the eightfold path  right mindfulness and right effort  are equivalent to the holographic sets of the frames of reference and the right exertionsThis formal convergence of two causal patterns in the development of the path reflects not only the dual principle of thisthat conditionality but also a very practical point in the task of developing the skills of the mindThe holographic pattern reflects the fact that all the skillful qualities needed for the path are already there in the mind and continually interact along the pathAll that is needed is for them to be ferreted out and nourished their coordination finetuned and they can deliver the mind to the goalThe causal loop pattern reflects the fact that the process must take place over time as specific qualities are stressed at specific junctures and strengthened by being put to use and as different skillful qualities need to alternate in helping one another step by step along the wayAn analogy can be made with learning how to walk A child who cant yet walk already has all the muscles needed to walk but she must locate them and exercise them in a coordinated way so that the right and left leg can help and receive help from each other in order to move from the first tentative step to the point where walking becomes natural and can be done with graceMonks ignorance is the leader in the attainment of unskillful qualities followed by lack of shame  lack of compunctionIn a unknowledgeable person immersed in ignorance wrong

abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of joys  distresses  he enters  remains in the fourth jhāna purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painThis is called

thatBecause the spike is well aimedIn the same way it is possible that if ones views are well aimed ones development of the path is well aimed they will cut into ignorance give rise to clear knowing and lead to the realization of UnbindingWhy is thatBecause ones views are well aimedAnd how do wellaimed views and a wellaimed development of the path cut into ignorance give rise to clear knowing and

monk develops the noble eightfold path pursues the noble eightfold path he comprehends through direct knowledge whatever qualities are to be comprehended through direct knowledge abandons through direct knowledge whatever qualities are to be abandoned through direct knowledge realizes through direct knowledge whatever qualities are to be realized through direct knowledge and develops through direct knowledge whatever qualities are to be developed through direct knowledgeSuppose a man were traveling along a pathHe would see a great expanse of water with the near shore dubious  risky the further shore secure  free from risk but with neither a ferryboat nor a bridge going from this shore to the otherThe thought would occur to him Here is this great expanse of water with the near shore dubious  risky the further shore secure  free from risk but with neither a ferryboat nor a bridge going from this shore to the otherWhat if I were to gather grass twigs branches  leaves and having bound them together to make a raft were to cross over to safety on the further shore in dependence on the raft making an effort with my hands  feet Then the man having gathered grass twigs branches  leaves having bound them together to make a raft would cross over to safety on the further shore in dependence on the raft making an effort with his hands  feetHaving crossed over to the further shore he might think How useful this raft has been to meFor it was in dependence on this raft that making an effort with my hands  feet I have crossed over to safety on the further shoreWhy dont I having hoisted it on my head or carrying it on my back go wherever I like What do you think monksWould the man in doing that be doing what should be done with the raftNo lordAnd what should the man do in order to be doing what should be done with the raftThere is the case where the man having crossed over would think How useful this raft has been to meFor it was in dependence on this raft that making an effort with my hands  feet I have crossed over to safety on the further shoreWhy dont I having dragged it on dry land or sinking it in the water go wherever I like In doing this he would be doing what should be done with the raftEven so monks I have taught you the Dhamma like a raft for the purpose of crossing over not for the purpose of holding ontoUnderstanding the Dhamma to be taught like a raft you should let go even of dhammas to say nothing of nondhammasThe great expanse of water stands for the fourfold flood the flood of sensuality the flood of becoming the flood of views  the flood of ignoranceThe near shore dubious  risky stands for selfidentityThe further shore safe and free from risk stands for UnbindingThe raft stands for just this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationMaking an effort with hands  feet stands for the arousing of persistenceIf the ways of the mind were simple its problems would be simple and easy to solveThe Buddha in showing how to put an end to its problems could have kept his instructions simple and short  a single blanket approach to whatever happens in the present a noble onefold path just mindfulness just concentration or just nonreactive awarenessOr he might not have bothered to teach much at all knowing that people could easily solve their problems on their ownTrust he might have said your innate nature your innate understanding and left it at thatBut thats not how the mind works and thats not how he taughtEven just a few minutes spent observing the ways of the mind can show how complex and convoluted they areAnd this means that its problems are complex as wellIn particular the problem of suffering As the Buddha noted the causes of suffering are knotted and tangled like a birds nest like the thread in a tangled skeinAs anyone who has solved a complex problem knows the trick to finding its solution lies in how you frame the issue identifying the problem and sorting out the pattern of factors related to itSeeing the pattern you can decide which factors to focus on as crucial to its solution and which ones you have to ignore so as not to get led down blind alleysFraming the issue also means deciding how to approach each of the crucial factors so that instead of maintaining or exacerbating the problem they aid with its solutionWhat this boils down to is when faced with a problem knowing which questions are helpful to ask about it and which questions arentIf for example youre a doctor in an emergency room faced with a patient complaining of chest pains you have many quick decisions to makeYou have to decide which tests to conduct which questions to ask the patient and which physical symptoms to look for before you can diagnose the pains as a sign of indigestion an incipient heart attack or something else entirelyYou also have to decide which questions not to ask so as not to get waylaid by extraneous informationIf you focus on the wrong symptoms the patient might die  or might spend a needless night in the intensive care unit depriving a patient with a genuine heart attack of a bedOnce youve made your diagnosis you have to decide which course of treatment to follow and how to keep tabs on that treatment to see if its really workingIf you frame the symptoms in the wrong light you can do more harm than goodIf you frame them in the right light you can save livesThe same principle applies in solving the problem of suffering which is why the Buddha gave prime importance to the ability to frame the issue of suffering in the proper wayHe called this ability yoniso manasikara  appropriate attention  and taught that no other inner quality was more helpful for untangling suffering and gaining releaseIn giving his most detailed explanation of appropriate attention he starts with examples of inappropriate attention which center on questions of identity and existence Do I exist Do I not What am I Did I exist in the past Will I exist in the future These questions are inappropriate because they lead to a wilderness of views a thicket of views such as I have a self or I have no self all of which lead to entanglement and none to the end of sufferingIn contrast the Buddha then depicts appropriate attention as the ability to identify that This is suffering This is the origination of suffering This is the cessation of suffering and This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of suffering These are the four categories that the Buddha in his first discourse called the four noble truthsThe ability to frame the issue of suffering in line with these categories is what enables you ultimately to put an end to the problem of suffering once and for allThis is why theyre appropriateThe most obvious lesson to be drawn from this way of distinguishing inappropriate from appropriate attention is that inappropriate attention frames the issues of the mind in terms of abstract categories whereas appropriate attention frames them in terms of things that can be directly pointed to in immediate experience as This This This This Ideas of identity and existence are basic to abstract thinking and many philosophers have maintained that they lie at the basis of any spiritual questThe Buddha however noted that the thought I am the thinker lies at the root of all the categories and labels of conceptual proliferation the type of thinking that can turn and attack the person employing itThese categories are notoriously hard to pin down often dissolving into arbitrary semanticsDo I exist  It depends on what you mean by exist Do I have a self  It depends on what you mean by self Thinking driven by definitions like these often falls prey to the hidden motives or agendas behind the definitions which means that its unreliableHowever suffering is something directly knowable preverbal private but universalIn framing the issues of the mind around suffering the Buddha bases his teachings on an intention totally trustworthy  the desire for his listeners to put an end to all their suffering  and focuses on something not dependent on definitionsIn fact he never offers a formal definition of the term suffering at allInstead he illustrates it with examples  such as the suffering of birth aging illness and death  and then points out the functional element that all forms of mental suffering share clinging to the five aggregates of form feeling perception mental fabrication and consciousnessThe clinging is not the totality of the suffering but its the aspect of suffering most useful to focus on for the purpose of bringing the suffering to an endAlthough there is a passage where the Buddha defines clinging as desirepassion he never describes precisely what desirepassion isIn what is apparently the oldest part of the Canon the Atthaka Vagga he fills a long discussion of clinging with puns and word play a style that discourages attempts at systematic set definitions and the conceptual proliferation they can fosterWhat this means is that if you want to refine your understanding of clinging desirepassion and suffering you cant cling to words or textsYou have to look deeper into your present experienceIn pointing repeatedly to direct experience however the Buddha doesnt discourage all thought and conceptsThe ability to distinguish the four categories of appropriate attention requires thought and analysis  the type of thought that questions past understandings and misunderstandings and ponders whats happening in the present the type of analysis that can ferret out connections between actions and their results and can evaluate them as to whether theyre helpful or notThere are desires for instance that act as a cause of suffering and other desires that can form part of the path leading to its endAlthough the Buddha gives a general outline to tell which kind of desire functions in which way you have to learn how to watch your own desires carefully and honestly to tell which kind of desire they areAs you keep analyzing the present under the framework of these four categories youre tracing the Buddhas steps as he approached AwakeningHaving focused on clinging as the functional handle on suffering he looked for the conditions that formed its basis and found them in three types of craving or thirst sensual craving craving for states of being and craving to destroy states of beingThen he identified the cessation of suffering as total dispassion for cessation of and release from those forms of cravingAnd he identified the mental qualities and practices that would lead to that cessation  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration  all of which in potential form can be found in the present momentSo instead of simply throwing the present moment at you as a monolithic whole the Buddha points your attention to four significant things you might find thereThis is because theres a pattern to the changes we experience from moment to momentChange is never so random or radical that knowledge gained from the past is useless in the presentConcepts still serve an important purpose even though they may lack the freshness of the immediate here and nowWhen you stick your finger into fire its bound to burnIf you spit into the wind its bound to come back at youLessons like these are good to keep in mindAlthough the patterns underlying suffering may be more tangled than those underlying fire and wind still they are patternsThey can be learned and mastered and the four categories of appropriate attention are crucial for getting a handle on those patterns and directing them to sufferings endIn practical terms distinguishing among categories is worthwhile only if you have to treat each of the different categories in a different wayA doctor who formulates a theory of sixteen types of headaches only to treat them all with aspirin for example is wasting her timeBut one who noting that different types of headaches respond to different types of medications devises an accurate test to differentiate among the headaches makes a genuine contribution to medical scienceThe same principle applies to the categories of appropriate attentionAs the Buddha stated in his first account of his Awakening once he had identified each of the four categories he saw that each had to be treated in a different waySuffering had to be comprehended its cause abandoned its cessation realized and the path to its cessation fully developedWhat this means is that as a meditator you cant treat everything in the present moment in the same wayYou cant simply stay nonreactive or simply accept everything that comesIf moments of stillness and ease arise in the mind you cant just note them and let them passYou should learn to develop them into jhana  the fullbody pleasure and rapture of right concentration that forms the heart of the pathWhen mental suffering arises you cant just let it goYou should focus whatever powers of concentration and discernment you have to try to comprehend the clinging that lies at its heartThe Buddha and his disciples expand on this point in discourses where they show how appropriate attention should be applied to various aspects of the presentApplied to the five aggregates of form feeling and so forth appropriate attention means viewing them in such a way as to induce a sense of dispassion that will help alleviate clingingApplied to perceptions of beauty or irritation it means viewing them in such a way as to keep them from fostering obstacles to right concentration such as sensual desire or ill willWhen applied to feelings of serenity or the potential for rapture it means viewing them in such a way that helps develop them into factors for AwakeningEven within a particular category theres no one approach that works in all casesIn one of his discourses the Buddha observes that some unskillful mental states wither away if you simply watch them with equanimity while others require an active effort to take them apartIn another discourse he expands on this observation by recommending five ways of dealing with distracting thoughts replacing them with more skillful thoughts focusing on their drawbacks consciously ignoring them relaxing the tension that goes into maintaining them and forcefully suppressing themIn neither discourse though does he give hard and fast rules for telling which type of thought will respond to which approachYou have to find out for yourself by sharpening your discernment through trial and error as to what works and what doesnt in any given situationThe same principle applies to skillful mental statesThe Buddhas final summary of his teachings the wings to Awakening lists seven ways of conceiving the path to the end of suffering  in terms of four establishings of mindfulness four bases for success four right exertions five strengths five faculties seven factors for Awakening and the noble eightfold pathAnd again its up to you to learn through trial and error which way of conceiving the path is most useful at any particular time in your practiceThis means that applying appropriate attention to skillful and unskillful mental states is not a oneshot affairThe tasks connected with each of the four categories of appropriate attention all have to be tested through trial and error and mastered as skillsTo borrow an analogy from the Canon full Awakening is not a matter of picking up a bow and arrow and hoping for a fluke bulls eyeThe insight of Awakening comes in the course of practicing on a straw man until youre able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession and to pierce great masses As the Buddha noted in his first discourse he didnt claim to be awakened until he had fully mastered the tasks appropriate to all four categoriesIn fully developing the factors of the path he fully comprehended the five clinging aggregates to the point of abandoning all passion and craving for themThat was when he fully realized the end of sufferingWith that the categories of appropriate attention had done their work in solving the problem of suffering but even then they still had their usesAs VenSariputta stated even a fully awakened arahant would still apply them to experience to provide a pleasant dwelling for the mind in the here and nowIn all of these cases appropriate attention means seeing things in terms of their function  what they can do  while the act of appropriate attention is itself a type of doing adopted for what it can do for the mindAnd the test for appropriate attention is that it actually works in helping to put an end to sufferingWhen we contrast this with the Buddhas examples of inappropriate attention we see that attention is inappropriate when it frames things in terms of being and identity and appropriate when framing them in terms of actions and their resultsIn fact appropriate attention looks at being itself as an action with each act of being or assuming an identity to be evaluated by the pleasure or pain it producesWhen we look at ourselves with appropriate attention we focus not on what we are but on what were doing  and in particular on whether what were doing is unskillful  leading to suffering  or skillful leading to its endThis point is important to bear in mind when we reflect on the two criticisms often leveled against the four categories of appropriate attentionThe first criticism is that they provide a limited view of the fullness and variety of life that they dont encompass the virtually infinite number of skillful ways of approaching experienceWhen formulating a theory of being you could argue that the more variety it can contain the betterBut when choosing a doctor you wouldnt want one who insists on exploring an infinite variety of approaches to your diseaseYou want one who focuses on the approaches most likely to workThe same holds true with appropriate attentionThe four categories with their attendant tasks are meant not to encompass reality but to focus your attention at the right factors for curing the most basic problem in experienceThe Buddha limits his discussion to these four categories because he doesnt want you to get distracted from the problem at handThe second criticism is that the four categories are dualistic and thus inferior to a nondualistic view of the worldAgain when formulating a theory of being you could argue that a nondualistic theory would be superior to a dualistic one on the grounds that a nondual concept of being is more encompassing than a dualistic one yielding a more unified theoryBut appropriate attention is not a theory of beingIts a guide to what to do in the present momentBecause the present moment is so tangled and complex the multiple categories offered by appropriate attention are a strength rather than a weaknessInstead of limiting you to one way of understanding and approaching events in the present they provide you with a more discerning understanding and a wide variety of options for dealing with the tangles and complexities of sufferingWhen offering options for solving a problem no particular number of options is on principle superior to any otherWhat matters is that the options are enough to be adequate for the problem but not so many as to obscure its solution and become a tangle themselvesIn other words the options are to be judged not against abstract principles but by what they enable you to doAlthough the Buddha describes his path to the end of suffering as the one form of doing that ultimately puts an end to doing as long as youre still doing something in the present moment appropriate attention ensures that what youre doing stays on the path You know which strands in the knot of suffering to pull in which way and which to leave aloneAnd once you can untangle the problem of suffering everything else gets untangled as wellAs we noted in the Introduction all of the factors listed in the Wings to Awakening can be subsumed under the five facultiesWhereas Part II focused on the interrelationships among these various factors this part of the book is devoted to using the five faculties as a framework for discussing the individual factors in and of themselvesOf the five faculties the faculty of conviction covers the most ground as it includes the total context for the practice of the Buddhas teachingsThe many issues related to the attitudes and ethics needed to lead a Buddhist life whether as a lay person or a monastic fall under this categoryPassage  defines the faculty of conviction as the four factors of streamentry so to understand the nature of conviction it is necessary to know what these four factors arePassages  and  give different definitions for the fourThe first list gives prerequisites for streamentry association with good people listening to the true Dhamma appropriate attention and practice in accordance with the DhammaThe second list gives qualities that characterize a person who has entered the stream verified confidence in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and virtues appealing to the noble onesBoth lists are relevant here for conviction is a quality that leads to streamentry whereas the attainment of streamentry is the point where conviction becomes unshakableOnly on the attainment of Arahantship does knowledge become so total that conviction is no longer neededThe two lists of the factors of streamentry are similar in that they both cover all three aspects of conviction social intellectual and practicalBecause conviction is focused not on a descriptive proposition but on a course of action  the skillful mastery of the processes of kamma in a social context  these aspects are inextricably intertwinedThe social aspect comes from the need to associate with people who have already mastered these processes learning from their words and emulating their actionsThe intellectual aspect  belief in the principle of kamma  is necessary because the development of skillfulness within the mind requires that one understand the nature of kamma take responsibility for ones actions and have conviction in ones ability to benefit from developing ones skillsThe practical aspect is necessary for if one does not follow through in developing skill it shows that ones conviction in the development of skillfulness is not genuine and that one is not fully benefiting from ones beliefsThe relationship of these factors to the development of skillfulness is shown in several passagesFor instance  and  cite association with good people and appropriate attention  both of which are members of the first list above  as the primary external and internal prerequisites for the development of what is skillfulAt the same time the intellectual and practical aspects of conviction help to counteract the grosser levels of the roots of unskillfulness belief in the principle of kamma helps to undercut delusion while the practice of virtue helps to weaken the force of greed and aversion in the mindTo understand the detailed interaction of the social intellectual and practical aspects of conviction we first have to examine them separatelyBecause having admirable people as friends is the whole of the holy life we will begin with the social aspect firstThe passages in this section focusing on the social aspect of conviction touch on two major issues how to recognize good people and why one should associate with themPassage  lists three basic teachings of good peopleThese can be taken as criteria for judging whether a person qualifies as goodIf one meets people who criticize the practice of generosity the practice of going forth into the renunciate life or the practice of giving service to ones parents one would do well to avoid associating with them for their wisdom and motives cannot be trustedIf one must associate with them one should not regard them as people to learn from or to emulateThus the social and intellectual aspects of conviction interact in that one way of knowing whether to associate with a person is by listening to what that person teaches at the same time the teachings of good people enable one to know what is goodPassage  carries this point further listing positive qualities to look for in a good person conviction in the principle of kamma generosity virtue and discernmentPeople who teach these qualities and embody them in their lives qualify as goodThe important point here of course is that good people are ultimately recognized by what they habitually do rather than simply by what they sayThese habits can be known only through long association over timeThis is why in the Buddhist monkhood a student does not take a lifetime vow of obedience to a teacherIf he feels that the teacher does not have his best interests at heart  ie if he sees that the teacher does not really embody the above qualities  he is free to leave the teacher in search of anotherA person who has attained streamentry finds it easier to recognize good people for heshe is now a member of the noble Sangha and can recognize the qualities of that attainment in others as wellGood people for a member of the Sangha means the Buddha and the rest of the noble SanghaOf course the Buddha has long been totally unbound but he left his Dhamma and Vinaya as a teacher in his stead and so on that level one may still associate with himThe reason why a person embarking on the path to practice would need to associate with good people rather than trying to be totally selfreliant is that the roots of skillfulness within the mind lie mixed with the roots of unskillfulness and the roots of unskillfulness make it difficult to tell which is whichThus one needs the advice and example of others more experienced on the path to help identify ones own skillful qualities and to give encouragement in the task of developing themEven if one is not yet committed to following the path one would be wise to associate with good people who embody conviction generosity virtue and discernment for they are unlikely to treat one in an unfair or harmful mannerIf they truly embody conviction and virtue one can trust that their sense of shame and compunction will prevent them from acting on unskillful intentionsIf they truly embody generosity and discernment they have wisdom worth acquiring and will be willing to share itThis sharing of wisdom forms the basis for further benefits  as listed in     setting in motion a causal chain leading all the way to the experience of AwakeningThis causal chain requires that one listen to the teachings of good people so as to understand the implications of the principle of kammaIt also requires that one take such people as examples to emulate in ones own lifeIn this way one can become a better person oneself and can enjoy the benefits coming with ones own improved mastery over the principle of kammaThe wide availability of books on Buddhism tends to obscure the fact that the truths of the Buddhas teachings are not simply words or propositions but are qualities of the heart and mind the skillful mastery of thoughts words and deedsThese qualities are best learned not from books but from people who are actually skilledThis is like learning a sportOne can pick up important principles from books written about the sport but there is much more on a nonverbal level that can be learned only by associating with people who have actually mastered the sportThis might include a sense of how much practice is enough a sense of ones own strengths and weaknesses a sense of timing a sense of ones teammates and opponents and so forthANgives a similar list of the principles that characterize a good person many of which cannot be verbalized in simple rules knowledge of the Dhamma knowledge of the meaning of statements a sense of ones own strengths and weaknesses a sense of moderation in the use of the requisites of life a sense of the proper time and season for doing things a sense of different levels of societies and a sense of how to judge peopleAlthough the first two types of knowledge in this list are verbal and can be passed on in words the others are more subliminal and can be picked up only by associating with good people and watching them in actionWith the issue of verbal knowledge we move from the social aspect of conviction to its intellectual aspectThe content of the verbal knowledge that can be picked up from good people begins with what  defines as mundane right viewThere is what is given what is offered what is sacrificedThere are fruits  results of good  bad actionsThere is this world  the next worldThere is mother  fatherThere are spontaneously reborn beings there are contemplatives  brahmans who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselvesAs noted in IIH this passage means that there is merit in generosity that the moral qualities of good and bad are inherent in the universe and not simply social conventions that there is life after death that one has a true moral debt to ones parents and that there are people who have lived the renunciates life properly in such a way that they have gained true and direct knowledge of these mattersThese beliefs form the minimum prerequisite for following the path to skillfulnessIf one doubts them one will find it difficult to muster the energy or commitment needed to develop skillful qualities in the mindOne would be more likely to revert to the selfish gratification of immediate desires with little thought for right or wrongThe willingness to accept these beliefs on faith thus counts as the first step from the stage of mere acquaintance with the Buddhas teachings to the stage of commitmentThese beliefs form the basis for the three points mentioned above as the teachings of good people generosity going forth and service to ones parentsAppreciating the value of these principles and following them to the extent of ones abilities enables one to develop the proper character needed for comprehending the higher levels of the Buddhas teachings culminating in the four noble truthsAs the first list of factors of streamentry points out simply listening to the Dhamma is not enoughOne has to develop appropriate attention as well which as we have already seen involves knowing how to focus on the right questionsIn this context one begins by learning how to ask productive questions of ones teacher and then moves on to using the categories of the four noble truths to ask questions of ones experience in generalIn this sense the act of listening and paying appropriate attention covers the first two levels in the development of discernment  understanding based on listening and on reasoning  and gets one started on the third understanding based on the development of skillful qualities in the mindAlthough listening to the Dhamma is a prerequisite for appropriate attention appropriate attention does not follow automatically from listening to the DhammaIt has to be consciously cultivated otherwise the causal process will not lead to clear knowledge and releaseThis point is expressed in a famous stanza from the DhammapadaThe purpose of meditation in which one consciously develops mindfulness and discernment so as to master and understand the skillful use of the mind is to turn one into the perceptive person who can fully understand the DhammaWith the attainment of streamentry at ones first taste of the Deathless the intellectual aspect of conviction is expressed in terms of verified conviction in the Awakening of the Buddha which branches out into verified conviction in the Triple Gem the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaOnes own taste of Awakening verifies the reality of the Buddhas Awakening and that of the noble Sangha ones understanding of how the Awakening came about through the practice of the Dhamma verifies that the noble eightfold path is the ideal synopsis of that practice with nothing lacking or in excessFrom this comes the standard expression of conviction in the Triple Gem The Buddha is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma well taught and the noble Sangha worthy of honorWhat this means in practical terms is that one is now convinced beyond a doubt that the human ability to develop skillfulness can lead all the way to the Deathless and that the Deathless is the highest excellenceSeveral passages emphasize that the experience of streamentry reinforces ones conviction that the true Dhamma is fully expressed only in the Buddhas teachingsThis point will come as a surprise to many people who are aware of Buddhisms long history of tolerance toward other religions and who assume that the enlightened attitude toward alternative teachings is to endorse the statement that many roads lead to the top of the mountainThis assumption though is based on a confusion between tolerance and endorsement As we have already noted from the streamwinners point of view the noble eightfold path is the ideal expression of the way to AwakeningTo endorse any other path to the same goal would be to concede that the noble eightfold path either lacks something essential or contains something superfluousThe Buddha is quoted as saying that any other supposed path to Awakening would by definition be wrong wrong view wrong resolve wrong speech etcTo try to get results from such a path he says would be like trying to squeeze sesame oil out of gravel or to churn butter out of waterHe did not deny that other teachings advocating virtue and concentration can lead to states of great peace or to rebirth in the higher heavens but if one views those attainments as equivalent to Unbinding one is suffering from wrong viewTo hold to that wrong view puts the total release to be found with Unbinding beyond reachThis unwillingness to endorse other paths however does not necessarily lead to intoleranceBuddhisms basic premise is the principle of kamma that happiness and suffering are the results of ones own past and present actionsThe noble eightfold path grows out of this principle as the most skillful mode of action for escaping from the cycle of kammic retribution and attaining the DeathlessOther paths are either incomplete expressions of the noble eightfold path or are based on other principlesFor example they may state that there is a being who can sidestep the law of kamma and provide for ones happiness without ones having to master the skills of the noble eightfold path or that certain ritual actions or words can provide a similar shortcut to happinessPeople who follow either of these two latter beliefs could well feel threatened by outsiders who do not share their beliefs for the outsiders are in effect denying the existence of a shortcut on which the insiders are placing their hopesThis explains why such people have often been intolerant of outside viewsBut because the principle of kamma is a teaching of full personal responsibility no one who believes in kamma will feel threatened by people who teach shortcuts around kammaBuddhists who have yet to attain streamentry may waver in their conviction  as the path can seem long and arduous and the results slow in coming  and this is one reason why they are encouraged not to associate with anyone who rejects the principle of kammaBut those who have had their first taste of Awakening can in no way be persuaded to doubt the principle for they have seen that the Deathless can be touched only through a process that requires the utmost skill in mindfulness and discernment applied to the processes of ones own mindTheir attitude toward other teachings is that of a skilled artisan toward those with lesser skills or of a woman who has learned how to extract sesame oil from sesame seeds toward those who are still trying to extract it from gravel she will want to teach them the right way if they are willing to listen but if they are unwilling she will tolerate their ignorance and hope that someday they will be ready to learnTo attain this level of unshakable conviction requires that one put the Dhamma into practiceThis shows the intimate relationship between the intellectual and practical aspects of conviction one must have a certain level of intellectual understanding of the doctrinal Dhamma before one can practice it and one must practice it to the point of touching the Dhamma of Deathlessness as an attainment before ones conviction in the teaching of the Dhamma can become unshakably firmThe commentaries bring out this relationship by applying the term Dhamma to all three of these levels doctrine practice and attainment or in other words Dhamma as an object of awareness as a means of releasing awareness from bondage to its objects and as the awareness releasedThe practical aspect of conviction prior to streamentry is covered by the factor of streamentry called practicing in accordance with the Dhamma What this factor means is that one must be willing to put the Dhamma ahead of ones preferences so that one is not practicing simply in line with ones likes and dislikesThis is the true test of ones convictionIt is all too easy to pick and choose from the teachings on the basis of other standards  here in the West it is common to judge the Dhamma against Western psychology or other social sciences and to pick and choose accordingly  but one must ask oneself the same question that Prince Siddhattha posed for himself Which is a more worthwhile use of ones time the pursuit of objects and ideals subject to change and death or the pursuit of the DeathlessAlthough there is a longstanding recognition in the Buddhist tradition that people benefit even if they follow only part of the teaching the Dhamma can give its full results only if one commits oneself fully to developing the skill of release in ones thoughts words and deedsThis training is similar to following a doctors regimenOne will benefit even from following the regimen only occasionally but a full cure requires sticking to the regimen consistently and putting the goal of recovery ahead of ones other preferencesThe skill of release requires ordering ones priorities taking the teachings and example of those who have attained that skill as ones primary guide and regarding everything else as secondaryWith the attainment of streamentry ones conviction in the principle of kamma and its skillful mastery becomes so firm that one would not intentionally break any of the basic precepts that comprise right speech right action or right livelihoodThis is the import of the factor of streamentry called virtues appealing to the noble ones In addition to virtue streamwinners have also begun to develop the other two aggregates in the noble path  concentration and discernment  but those two aggregates are not yet fully maturedAs    make clear conviction cannot become firm until the remaining four faculties including concentration and discernment have been strengthened to at least some extentOnce conviction does becomes firm it can then function to strengthen those faculties even furtherThe streamwinner realizes from the experience of streamentry not only that heshe attained that experience through mastery of the processes of kamma but also that hisher Awakening is not yet complete because there are gaps in that masteryThis realization is what gives impetus for the further development of all five faculties until they issue in the full realization of the DeathlessAs he was seated to one side Vennanda said to the Blessed One This is half of the holy life lord admirable friendship admirable companionship admirable camaraderieDont say that nandaDont say thatAdmirable friendship admirable companionship admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy lifeWhen a monk has admirable people as friends companions  comrades he can be expected to develop  pursue the noble eightfold pathAnd how does a monk who has admirable people as friends companions  comrades develop  pursue the noble eightfold pathThere is the case where a monk develops right view dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in letting goHe develops right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting goThis is how a monk who has admirable people as friends companions  comrades develops  pursues the noble eightfold pathAnd through this line of reasoning one may know how admirable friendship admirable companionship admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life Its in dependence on me as an admirable friend that beings subject to birth have gained release from birth that

people by people of integrityAnd what monks is the treasure of generosityThere is the case of a disciple of the noble ones his awareness cleansed of the stain of stinginess living at home freely generous openhanded delighting in being magnanimous responsive to requests delighting in the distribution of almsThis is called the treasure of generosityIf beings knew as I know the results of giving  sharing they would not eat without having given nor would the stain of miserliness overcome their mindsEven if it were their last bite their last mouthful they would not eat without having shared if there were someone to receive their giftBut because beings do not know as I know the results of giving  sharing they eat without having givenThe stain of miserliness overcomes their mindsMonks brahmans  householders are very helpful to you as they provide you with the requisites of robes alms food lodgings  medical requisites for the sickAnd you monks are very helpful to brahmans  householders as you teach them the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle  admirable in the end as you expound the holy life both in letter  meaning entirely complete surpassingly

mother  fatherEven if you were to carry your mother on one shoulder  your father on the other shoulder for years and were to look after them by anointing massaging bathing  rubbing their limbs and they were to defecate  urinate right there you would not in that way pay or repay your parentsIf you were to establish your mother  father in absolute sovereignty over this great earth abounding in the seven treasures you would not in that way pay or repay your parentsWhy is thatMother  father do much for their childrenThey care for them they nourish them they introduce them to this worldBut anyone who rouses his unbelieving mother  father settles  establishes them in conviction rouses his unvirtuous mother  father settles  establishes them in virtue rouses his stingy mother  father

increase  for the culmination of its development when it hasWhich eightThere is the case where a monk dwells in dependence on the Teacher or another fellow in the holy life worthy of being a teacher under whom he becomes firmly established in a strong sense of shame  compunction love  respectThis is the first cause the first conditionAnd what is the treasure of shameThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones feels shame at bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconductThis is called the treasure of shameAnd what is the treasure of compunctionThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones feels compunction at bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconductThis is called the treasure of compunctionAs he so lives he periodically approaches his teacher to ask  inquire of him How venerable sir does this happenWhat is the meaning of this To him the teacher reveals what is hidden clarifies what is obscure and dispels any doubt he may have about the various things that give him reason to doubtThis is the second cause the second conditionWhen he has heard the Dhamma he accomplishes twofold seclusion seclusion of body  seclusion of mindThis is the third cause the third conditionHe is virtuous  lives restrained by the Pāṭimokkha consummate in his behavior  range of activitySeeing danger in the slightest fault he undertakes  trains himself in the

compassion to people of conviction and not to people without convictionWhen visiting they first visit people of conviction and not people without convictionWhen accepting gifts they will first accept those from people with conviction and not from people without convictionWhen teaching the Dhamma they will first teach those with conviction and not those without convictionA person of conviction on the breakup of the body after death will arise in a good destination the heavenly worldThese are the five rewards of conviction in a lay personJust as a large banyan tree on level ground where four roads meet is a haven for the birds all around even so a lay person of conviction is a haven for many people monks nuns male lay followers  female lay followersA female disciple of the noble ones who grows in terms of these five types of growth grows in the noble growth grasps hold of what is essential what is excellent in the bodyWhich fiveShe grows in terms of conviction in terms of virtue in terms of learning in terms of generosity in terms of discernmentGrowing in terms of these five types of growth the female disciple of the noble ones grows in the noble growth grasps hold of what is essential what is excellent in the bodyFor a disciple who has conviction in the Teachers message  lives to penetrate it what accords with the Dhamma is this The Blessed One is the Teacher I am a discipleHe is the one who knows not I For a disciple who has conviction in the Teachers message  lives to penetrate it the Teachers message is healing  nourishingFor a disciple who has conviction in the Teachers message  lives to penetrate it what accords with the Dhamma is this Gladly would I let the flesh  blood in my body dry up leaving just the skin tendons  bones but if I have not attained what can be reached through human firmness human persistence human striving there will be no relaxing my persistence For a disciple who has conviction in the Teachers message  lives to penetrate it one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis here  now or  if there be any remnant of clingingsustenance  nonreturnSeveral discourses in the Canon state that the first step in concentration practice is to abandon the five hindrances which we have already discussed in conjunction with the seven factors for AwakeningThey are sensual desire ill will sloth  drowsiness restlessness  anxiety and uncertaintyThese hindrances need to be abandoned because they function as intermediate levels of the three roots of unskillfulnessSensual desire is a form of greed ill will a form of aversion and the remaining three hindrances forms of delusionAll five in their various ways block concentration and weaken discernment by making it difficult to realize what is beneficial for oneself for others or for bothThis last point makes them particularly tricky to deal with for one needs to have a sense that they are unbeneficial states of mind before one can work at abandoning them yet while one is overcome with them they impair ones ability to see that they are in fact unbeneficialFor instance when one feels sensual desire for another person it is hard to focus on the unattractive side of that person or on the drawbacks of the desire itselfSimilarly when one feels anger it is hard not to feel that the anger is justified when sleepy it is hard not to feel that one should get some sleep when worried it is hard not to believe that one needs to worry and so forthAlthough the hindrances cannot be totally relinquished prior to the various stages of Awakening they can be lessened on a preliminary level to the point where the mind can settle down in jhānaThis preliminary level is the focus of the passages in this sectionPassage  lists five methods for dealing with unskillful thoughts in the course of meditationThe passages included here focus almost exclusively on using the first two of those methods  replacing the unskillful thoughts with skillful ones and contemplating the drawbacks of the unskillful thoughts until one feels repulsed by them  so as to escape from the power of any hindrances that have overcome the mindExamples of the first method include focusing on the unattractive side of any sensual object to which one may be attracted focusing on the good qualities of a person who has aroused thoughts of ill will focusing on the foolishness of expecting all people to act in line with ones wants and changing ones object of concentration when finding that the current object is inducing sleepinessExamples of the second method include realizing that the hindrance is placing the mind in a state of bondage and limitation and that one can find freedom only by releasing oneself from its powerIn practice these are not the only ways of applying these two general approachesThe examples in the texts can act as inspiration for any similar techniques that a meditator might devise to obtain the desired effectTo escape the double bind mentioned above  the fact that the hindrances blind one to ones own true best interests and yet one needs to see those true interests if one is to overcome the hindrances  one must depend on all five faculties as one has been able to develop themConviction is needed so that one will listen to the advice of those who point out the drawbacks of the hindrancesA certain momentum of persistence as right exertion is needed so that one will make the effort to abandon the hindrance as soon as one is aware that it has arisen and before it grows into anything strongerMindfulness based on the frames of reference is needed so that one can be alert to the arising of the hindrances and can remember why they should be abandoned in the first placeThis mindfulness can be strengthened by remembering the teachings of others who have pointed out the drawbacks of the hindrances  the many similes for the hindrances given in passages  and  serve the purpose of keeping those memories vividIt can also be strengthened by remembering the drawbacks of the hindrances as encountered in ones own personal experience the damage that has come when another person has given in to them and the things that one regrets having done oneself when under their influenceBecause preliminary levels of concentration and discernment are present in right exertion and the practice of the frames of reference these faculties play a role in abandoning the hindrances as wellAs they develop strength they make one more and more skilled in cutting off the hindrances as effectively as possibleThe seven factors for Awakening which are developed in concentration act as direct antidotes to the hindrances while discernment  combined with concentrated mindfulness  helps in mastering what is probably the most effective tool for not being fooled by the hindrances the ability to separate the hindrance as an act of the mind from its objectFor instance discernment makes one able to see the feeling of sensual desire as one thing and the object of the desire as something separateThis ability is crucial in a number of waysTo begin with it helps separate the positive qualities of the object from the act of desiring the object so that one does not confuse the twoThe tendency to confuse the two is what makes it hard to see the drawbacks of the desire when it is present in the mind and at the same time serves to harden the mind in general against the Buddhas admonishments against sensualityThere is a widespread feeling that Buddhism gives an unfair valuation of sensuality and is blind to the positive beauties of sensual objects but this is simply not trueThe Buddha admitted that sensual objects have their beauty and can give a measure of satisfactionHe pointed out however that the beauty of an object is not the whole story for all beautiful objects must decayIf ones happiness is based on them that happiness is in for a fallMore importantly though the Buddha defined sensuality not as the objects of the senses but as the passion and delight that one feels for ones intentions toward such objectsAlthough the objects of the senses are neither good nor evil per se the act of passion and delight forms a bond on the mind disturbing its immediate peace and ensuring its continued entrapment in the round of rebirth and redeathOnly by separating the desire from its object can one directly perceive the truth of these teachingsThis point applies to the other hindrances as wellFor instance when one can separate the object of ones anger from the anger itself as a mental event one can see the obvious drawbacks of allowing anger to take over the mindIn addition the ability to separate the act from its object enables one to become sensitive to the act before it becomes overpowering at the same time allowing one to regard it simply as a mental quality in and of itselfOne can then engage in the practice outlined in   that of observing the coming and going of the hindrances as one tries to bring the mind to concentrationIn this way one eventually becomes so familiar with the patterns underlying their occurrence that one can undercut them and eliminate them from the mind for goodPassage  gives an example of one of the patterns that one will see when sensual desire arises sexual attraction for another person begins with a sense of attraction for ones own sexualityPassage  in a more abstract fashion lists other patterns of mind that feed the hindrancesBy perceiving such patterns one can take ones analysis of the roots of unskillfulness in the mind to ever more subtle levelsIn this way the skill of being able to abandon the hindrances will go beyond simply the preliminary level of concentration practice exercising all five of the faculties to the point where they issue in AwakeningThese are the five hindrances  obstructions that overcome awareness  weaken discernmentWhich fiveSensual desire is a hindrance  obstruction that overcomes awareness  weakens discernmentIll will Sloth  drowsiness Restlessness  anxiety Uncertainty is a hindrance  obstruction that overcomes awareness  weakens discernmentSuppose there were a river flowing down from the mountains going far its current swift carrying everything with it If a man were to open watercourses leading off from both sides the current in the middle of the river would be interrupted diverted  dispersedThe river would not go far its current would not be swift and it would not carry everything with itIn the same way if a monk has not rid himself of these five hindrances there is no possibility that he can know what is for his own benefit or the benefit of others or both or that he should come to realize a superior human attainment a truly noble knowledge  visionBut suppose there were a river flowing down from the mountains going far its current swift carrying everything with it If a man were to close off the watercourses leading off from both sides the current in the middle of the river would not be interrupted diverted or dispersedThe river would go far its current swift carrying everything with itIn the same way if a monk has rid himself of these five hindrances there is the possibility that he can know what is for his own benefit or the benefit of others or both and that he should come to realize a superior human attainment a truly noble knowledge  visionWhen gold is debased by these five impurities it is not pliant malleable or luminousIt is brittle and not ready to be workedWhich fiveIron copper tin lead  silver But when gold is not debased by these five impurities it is pliant malleable  luminousIt is not brittle and is ready to be workedThen whatever sort of ornament one has in mind  whether a belt an earring a necklace or a gold chain  it would serve ones purposeIn the same way when the mind is debased by these five impurities it is not pliant malleable or luminousIt is brittle and not rightly concentrated for the ending of the effluentsWhich fiveSensual desire ill will sloth  drowsiness restlessness  anxiety and uncertainty But when the mind is not debased by these five impurities it is pliant malleable  luminousIt is not brittle and is rightly concentrated for the ending of the effluentsThen whichever of the six higher knowledges one turns ones mind to know  realize one can witness them for oneself whenever there is an openingSimiles for the HindrancesImagine a bowl of water mixed with lac yellow orpiment indigo or crimson such that a man with good eyesight examining the reflection of his face in it would not be able to know or see his face as it has come to beIn the same way when one remains with awareness possessed by sensual passion overcome with sensual passion and neither knows nor sees the escape as it has come to be from sensual passion once it has arisen then one neither knows nor sees what is for ones own benefit or for the benefit of others or for the benefit of bothNow imagine a bowl of water heated on a fire boiling  bubbling over such that a man with good eyesight examining the reflection of his face in it would not be able to know or see his face as it has come to beIn the same way when one remains with

escape as it has come to be from sloth  drowsiness once it has arisen then one neither knows nor sees what is for ones own benefit or for the benefit of others or for the benefit of bothNow imagine a bowl of water ruffled by the wind disturbed  covered with waves such that a man with good eyesight examining the reflection of his face in it would not be able to know or see his face as it has come to beIn the same way when one remains with awareness possessed by restlessness  anxiety overcome with restlessness  anxiety and neither knows nor sees the escape as it has come to be from restlessness  anxiety once it has arisen then one neither knows nor sees what is for ones own benefit or for the benefit of others or for the benefit of bothNow imagine a bowl of water stirred up turbid muddied  left in the dark such that a man with good eyesight examining the reflection of his face in it would not be able to know or see his face as it has come to beIn the same way when one remains with awareness possessed by uncertainty overcome with uncertainty and neither knows nor sees the escape as it has come to be from uncertainty once it has arisen then one neither knows nor sees what is for ones own benefit or for the benefit of others or for the benefit of bothSuppose that a man taking a loan invests it in his business affairsHis business affairs succeedHe repays his old debts and has extra left over for maintaining his wifeThe thought would occur to him Before taking a loan I invested it in my business affairsNow my business affairs have succeededI have repaid my old debts and have extra left over for maintaining my wife Because of that he would gain joy  experience happinessNow suppose that a man falls sick  in pain  seriously illHe does not enjoy his meals and has no measure of strength in his bodyAt a later time he is released from that sicknessHe enjoys his meals and has a measure of strength in his bodyThe thought would occur to him Before I was sick Now I am released from that sicknessI enjoy my meals and have a measure of strength in my body Because of that he would gain joy  experience happinessNow suppose that a man is bound in prisonAt a later time he is released from that bondage safe  sound with no loss of propertyThe thought would occur to him Before I was bound in prisonNow I am released from that bondage safe  sound with no loss of my property

slavery subject to himself not subject to others freed able to go where he likesThe thought would occur to him Before I was a slave Now I am released from that slavery subject to myself not subject to others freed able to go where I like Because of that he would gain joy  experience happinessNow suppose that a man carrying money  goods is traveling by a road through desolate countryAt a later time he emerges from that desolate country safe  sound with no loss of propertyThe thought would occur to him Before carrying money  goods I was traveling by a road through desolate countryNow I have emerged from that desolate country safe  sound with no loss of my property Because of that he would gain joy  experience happinessIn the same way when these five hindrances are not abandoned within him the monk regards it as a debt a sickness a prison slavery a road through desolate countryBut when these five hindrances are abandoned within him he regards it as unindebtedness good health release from prison freedom a place of securitySensual desireI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas ParkNow on that occasion the Blessed One

hunger were to come across a slaughterhouse and there a skilled butcher or butchers apprentice were to fling him a chain of bones  thoroughly scraped without any flesh smeared with bloodWhat do you thinkWould the dog gnawing on that chain of bones  thoroughly scraped without any flesh smeared with blood  appease his weakness  hungerNo lordAnd why is thatBecause the chain of bones is thoroughly scraped without any flesh  smeared with bloodThe dog would get nothing but weariness  vexationIn the same way householder a disciple of the noble ones considers this The Blessed One has compared sensuality to a chain of bones of much stress much despairThe drawback there is greater Seeing this with right discernment as it has come to be then avoiding the equanimity coming from multiplicity

fruit abundant fruit and there is no fruit fallen to the ground but I know how to climb a treeWhy dont I climb the tree eat what I like and fill my clothes with the fruit So having climbed the tree he would eat what he liked and fill his clothes with the fruitThen a second man would come along desiring fruit searching for fruit and carrying a sharp axPlunging into the forest grove he would see the tree and the thought would occur to him  I dont know how to climb a treeWhy dont I chop down this tree at the root eat what I like and fill my clothes with the fruit So he would chop the tree at the

infections devoured by worms picking the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails cauterizing his body over a pit of glowing embersThen suppose his friends companions  relatives brought a doctor to treat himThe doctor would concoct medicine and by means of that medicine he would be cured of his leprosy well  happy free master of himself going wherever he likedThen suppose two strong men having grabbed him with their arms were to drag him to a pit of glowing embersWhat do you thinkWouldnt he twist his body this way and thatMāgandiya Yes Master GotamaWhy is thatThe fire is painful to the touch very hot  scorchingThe Buddha Now what do you thinkIs the fire painful to the touch very hot  scorching only now or was it also that way beforeMāgandiya Both now  before is it painful to the touch very hot  scorchingIts just that when the man was a leper his faculties were impaired which was why even though the fire was actually painful to the touch he had the skewed perception of pleasantThe Buddha In the same way sensuality in the past was painful to the touch very hot  scorching sensuality in the future will be painful to the touch very hot  scorching sensuality at present is painful to the touch very hot  scorching but when beings are not free from passion for sensuality  devoured by sensual craving burning with sensual fever  their faculties are impaired which is why even though sensuality is actually painful to the touch they have the skewed perception of pleasantNow suppose that there was a leper covered with sores  infections devoured by worms picking the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails cauterizing his body over a pit of glowing embersThe more he cauterized his body over the pit of glowing embers the more disgusting foulsmelling  putrid the openings of his wounds would become and yet he would feel a modicum of enjoyment  satisfaction because of the itchiness of his woundsIn the same way beings not free from passion for sensuality  devoured by sensual craving burning with sensual fever  indulge in sensualityThe more they indulge in sensuality the more their sensual craving increases and the more they burn with sensual fever and yet they feel a modicum of enjoyment  satisfaction dependent on the five strings of sensualityNow what do you thinkHave you ever seen or heard of a king or kings minister  enjoying himself provided  endowed with the five strings of sensuality without abandoning sensual craving without removing sensual fever  who has dwelt or will dwell or is dwelling free from thirst his mind inwardly at peaceMāgandiya No Master GotamaThe Buddha Very good MāgandiyaNeither have I But whatever contemplatives or brahmans who have dwelt or will dwell or are dwelling free from thirst their minds inwardly at peace all have done so having realized  as it has come to be  the origination  disappearance the allure the danger  the escape from sensuality having abandoned sensual craving and removed sensual feverAs Subhā the nun was going through Jīvakas delightful mango grove a libertine blocked her path so she said to himIll willThese are five ways of subduing hatred by which when hatred arises in a

ways of subduing hatredSloth  drowsinessOnce the Blessed One was living among the Bhaggas in the Deer Park at Bhesakalā Grove near Crocodile HauntAt that time VenMahā Moggallāna sat nodding near the village of Kallavalaputta in MagadhaThe Blessed One saw this with his purified divine eye surpassing the human and as soon as he saw this  just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm  disappeared from the Deer Park appeared right in front of VenMahā Moggallāna and sat down on a prepared seatAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to VenMahā Moggallāna Are you nodding MoggallānaAre you noddingYes lordWell then Moggallāna whatever perception you have in mind when drowsiness descends on you dont attend to that perception dont pursue itIts possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsinessBut if by doing this you dont shake off your drowsiness then recall to your awareness the Dhamma as you have heard  memorized it reexamine it  ponder it over in your mindIts possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsinessBut if by doing this you dont shake off your drowsiness then repeat aloud in detail the Dhamma as you have heard  memorized itIts possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsinessBut if by doing this you dont shake off your drowsiness then pull both your earlobes and rub your limbs with your handsIts possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsinessBut if by doing this you dont shake off your drowsiness then get up from your seat and after washing your eyes out with water look around in all directions and upward to the major stars  constellationsIts possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsinessBut if by doing this you dont shake off your drowsiness then attend to the perception of light resolve on the perception of daytime by night as by day and by day as by nightBy means of an awareness thus open  unhampered develop a brightened mindIts possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsinessBut if by doing this you dont shake off your drowsiness then  percipient of what lies in front  behind  set a distance to meditate walking back  forth your senses inwardly immersed your mind not straying outwardIts possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsinessBut if by doing this you dont shake off your drowsiness then  reclining on your right side  take up the lions posture one foot placed on top of the other mindful alert with your mind set on getting upAs soon as you wake up get up quickly with the thought I wont stay indulging in the pleasure of lying down the pleasure of reclining the pleasure of drowsinessThus Moggallāna should you train yourselfThe passages in this section deal with right concentration in terms of three questions that deserve appropriate attentionTo answer the first question Passage  defines concentration as singleness of mind but not every instance of mental singleness counts as right concentrationPassage  identifies right concentration with the four levels of jhāna  meditative absorption  and  makes the point that jhāna can be considered right concentration only if it is devoid of unskillful qualities such as the hindrancesAbsorption in sensual passion for instance even though it may be very singleminded does not count as part of the pathThus the definition for the first level of jhāna specifies that it counts as a path factor only when the mind is secluded from sensuality and unskillful mental qualitiesThe singleness of jhāna means not only that awareness is focused on a single object but also that the object is reduced to a single quality that fills the entirety of ones awareness at the same time that ones awareness broadens to suffuse the entire objectThis mutual pervasion of awareness and object in a state of expansion is what is meant by absorptionThe similes used to illustrate the various levels of jhāna repeatedly make mention of expansion suffusing stretching and filling culminating in the fourth jhāna where ones body is filled with a bright sense of awarenessThis sense of expansion and makingsingle is also indicated in passages that teach specific meditation techniquesThe directions for keeping the breath in mind for instance state that one should be sensitive to the entire body while breathing in and outThis accounts for the term mahaggata  enlarged or expanded  used to describe the mind in the state of jhānaThere are two basic types of jhāna which the commentaries term form jhāna and formless jhānaEach type has several levelsIn the case of form jhāna different passages in the Canon list the levels in different waysThe differences revolve around two different senses of the word form In one sense form denotes the body and form jhāna is a state of mental absorption in the form of ones own physical body as sensed from withinJhana focused on this type of form comes in four levels identical with the four levels mentioned in the definition of the faculty of concentration and of right concentration under the noble eightfold pathIn another sense form can also denote the visible forms and light that some meditators can see in the minds eye in the course of their meditationThis type of form jhāna is analyzed into two patterns one with two levels the other with threeBoth patterns end with the perception of the beautiful which in terms of its function is equivalent to the sense of radiance filling the body on the fourth level of body form jhānaFor a person practicing form jhāna in either sense of the term the equanimity experienced with the sense of beautiful radiance can then act as the basis for the formless levels of jhāna which the Canon terms the four formlessnesses beyond form These are invariably defined as progressive absorption in the perceptions of infinite space infinite consciousness and there is nothing leading to a fourth state of neither perception nor nonperceptionAs for the second question on how to master right concentration Passage  notes that the ability to attain the first level of jhāna  however one experiences the form acting as its focus  depends on the abandoning of the hindrances because the feeling of freedom that comes with their abandoning provides the sense of joy and pleasure that lets the mind settle skillfully in the present momentHow to master this process is best shown by following the Buddhas most detailed set of meditation instructions  the sixteen steps in the practice of keeping the breath in mind  and comparing them with the standard description of the four stages of jhānaBefore we analyze these maps of the practice however we must make a few comments on how to use them skillfullyTo begin with internal obstacles to the practice of jhāna do not end with the preliminary groundclearing of the hindrances discussed in the preceding sectionMore refined levels of unskillful mental states can get in the wayLapses in mindfulness and alertness can leave openings for the hindrances to returnThus although the maps of the various stages of concentration proceed in a smooth seemingly inevitable progression the actual experience of the practice does notFor this reason the Buddha gives specific instructions on how to deal with these obstacles as they arise in the course of the practicePassage  lists five basic approaches the first two of which we have already covered in the preceding sectionThe remaining three are One ignores the obstaclesThis works on the principle that paying attention to the distraction feeds the distraction just as paying attention to a crazy person  even if one is simply trying to drive him away  encourages him to stay One notices that the act of thinking a distracting thought actually takes more energy than not thinking the thought and one consciously relaxes whatever tension or energy happens to accompany itThis approach works best when one is sensitive enough to bodily sensations to see the pattern of physical tension that appears in conjunction with the thought and can intentionally relax it The approach of last resort is simply to exert force on the mind to drive out the distracting thoughtThis is a temporary stopgap measure that works only as long as mindfulness is firm and determination strongIt is useful in cases where discernment is not yet sharp enough to make the other approaches work but once discernment is up to the task the other approaches are more effective in the long runAnother point to keep in mind in understanding the maps of the practice is that they list the steps of meditation not in the order in which they will be experienced but in the order in which they can be masteredThere are cases for instance where one will feel rapture in the course of the practice before one is able to breath in and out sensitive to the entire bodyIn such cases it is important not to jump to any conclusions as to ones level of attainment or to feel that one has bypassed the need to master an earlier stepInstead  when several different experiences arise together in a jumble as they often do  one should use the maps to tell which experience to focus on first for the sake of developing ones meditation as a skillOne qualification here is that it is not necessary to master all the levels of concentration in order to gain AwakeningThe relationship of concentration to discernment is a controversial issue which we will cover in the following section but here we may simply note that many texts point out that the experience of the first jhāna can be a sufficient basis for the discernment leading to AwakeningThe same holds true for the first four steps in breath meditation which constitute one of the alternative ways of developing the body in and of itself as a frame of referenceIn this case ones practice of breath meditation would jump from a mastery of step straight to step skipping the intervening stepsIn fact beginning with step it is possible to jump directly to from any of the steps and from there to progress all the way to AwakeningThe fact that the higher stages are unnecessary in some cases however does not mean that they are superfluousMany people as they develop the skill of their meditation will find that their minds naturally go to deeper levels of stillness with no liberating insight arisingFor them the maps are valuable aids for a number of reasonsTo begin with the maps can help indicate what does and does not count as AwakeningWhen one arrives at a new more refined level of awareness in ones practice it is easy to assume that one has attained the goalComparing ones experience to the maps however can show that the experience is simply a higher level of concentrationFurthermore awareness of the distinct levels can help one review them after attaining them so that in the course of trying to master them moving from one level to another one can begin to gain insight into the element of will and fabrication that goes into themThis insight can then provide an understanding into the pattern of cause and effect in the mind and as passage  shows can lead to a sense of dispassion and ultimately to AwakeningHowever the maps should not be used to plan ones practice in advanceThis is the message of  which makes the point that one should not try to use ones knowledge of the various levels of the practice to force ones way through themIn other words one should not try to concoct a particular state of jhāna based on ideas picked up from the mapsOn reaching a particular level one should not be in a hurry to go to the nextInstead one should familiarize oneself with that level of mind perfecting ones mastery eventually that state of concentration will ripen naturally into the next levelTo continue the image of the passage one will find that there is no need to jump to another pasture to taste different grass and water for the new grass and water will develop right in ones own pastureFinally although the maps to the various stages of concentration seem exhaustive and complete bear in mind that they list only the stages of right concentration and not the varieties of wrongIn addition to the types of wrong concentration mentioned in  there are states of mind that may be very quiet but lack the mindfulness that would make them rightOne of these stages is a blurred state  essentially a concentration of delusion  halfway between waking and sleep in which ones object becomes hazy and illdefinedOn leaving it one is hard put to say where the mind was focused or whether it was awake or asleepAnother type of wrong concentration is one that a modern practice tradition following DN calls a state of nonperceptionIn this state which is essentially a concentration of subtle aversion  the result of a strongly focused determination not to stay with any one object  everything seems to cease the mind blanks out with no perception of sights or sounds or of ones own body or thoughtsThere is just barely enough mindfulness to know that one hasnt fainted or fallen asleepOne can stay there for long periods of time and yet the experience will seem momentaryOne can even determine beforehand when one will leave the state but on emerging from it one may feel somewhat dazed or drugged a reaction caused by the intense aversive force of the concentration that induced the state to begin withThere are other forms of wrong concentration but a general test is that right concentration is a mindful fully alert stateAny state of stillness without clear mindfulness and alertness is wrongWith these points in mind we can now turn to the maps to see their answer to the question of how breath meditation leads to the mastery of jhānaAs noted above the practice of keeping the breath in mind is the meditation method that the Canon teaches in most detailThere are two possible reasons for this one historical and the other more theoreticalFrom the historical point of view the breath was the focal point that the Buddha himself used on the night of his own AwakeningFrom the theoretical perspective a state of concentration focused on the breath is the meeting place of all the elements of the factor of fabrication in the formula for dependent coarisingThis factor as experienced in the present consists of bodily fabrication verbal fabrication and mental fabricationBecause transcendent discernment must deal directly with these three types of fabrication if it is to eliminate the ignorance that underlies them the practice of jhāna based on the breath is an ideal point to focus on all three at onceThe first two steps of breath meditation involve simple tasks of directed thought and evaluation directing ones thoughts and attention to the breath in and of itself in the present at the same time evaluating it as one begins to discern variations in the length of the breathSome modern teachers maintain that the factor of evaluation here also includes taking ones observations of short and long breathing as a basis for adjusting the rhythm of the breath to make it as comfortable as possibleBecause the first level of jhāna must be based on a sense of pleasure this advice is very practicalThe remaining steps are willed or determined One trains oneself first by manipulating ones sense of conscious awareness making it sensitive to the body as a wholeThen one can begin manipulating the bodily sensations of which one is aware reducing them to a single sensation of calm by letting bodily fabrication  the breath  grow calm so as to create an easeful sense of rapture and pleasureA comparison between the stages of breath meditation and the graphic analogies for jhāna indicates that the fifth and sixth steps  being sensitive to rapture and pleasure  involve making these feelings single as well by letting them suffuse the entire body just as the bathman kneads the moisture throughout his ball of bath powderWith bodily fabrications stilled mental fabrications  feelings and perceptions  become clearly apparent as they occur just as when a radio is precisely tuned to a certain frequency static is eliminated and the message sent by the radio station broadcasting at that frequency becomes clearThese mental fabrications too are calmed a step symbolized in the analogies for jhāna by the still waters in the simile for the third level in contrast to the spring waters welling up in the secondWhat remains is simply a sense of the mind itself corresponding to the level of fourth jhāna in which the body is filled from head to toe with a single sense of bright radiant awarenessThis completes the first level of framesofreference practiceOnce this stage is reached steps  indicate that one can now turn ones attention to consolidating ones mastery of concentrationOne does this by reviewing the various levels of jhāna focusing not so much on the breath as on the mind as it relates to the breathThis allows a perception of the different ways in which the mind can be satisfied and steadied and the different factors from which it can be released by taking it through the different levels of jhāna  for example releasing it from rapture by taking it from the second level to the third and so forthOne comes to see that although the breath feels different on the different levels of jhāna the cause is not so much the breath as it is the way the mind relates to the breath shedding the various mental activities surrounding its single preoccupationAs one ascends through the various levels directed thought and evaluation are stilled rapture fades and pleasure is abandonedAnother way of consolidating ones skills in the course of these steps is to examine the subtle defilements that interfere with full mastery of concentrationThe fact that ones focus is now on the mind makes it possible to see these defilements clearly and then to steady the mind even further by releasing it from themPassage  although aimed specifically at the problems faced by those who have visions in their meditation gives a useful checklist of subtle mental defilements that can hamper the concentration of any meditatorThe image of grasping the quail neither too loosely nor too tight has become a standard one in Buddhist meditation manualsThe mastery of concentration developed in steps  provides an excellent chance to develop discernment into the pattern of cause and effect in the process of concentrating the mind in that one must master the causal factors before one can gain the desired results in terms of satisfaction steadiness and releaseHere we see at work the basic pattern of skillfulness mentioned in several earlier sections that discernment is sharpened and strengthened by employing it in developing the skills of concentrationThis would correspond to the second level of framesofreference meditation  focusing on the phenomenon of origination and passing away  mentioned in IIBAnother development that can happen during these steps  although this goes outside of the practice of breath meditation per se  is the discovery of how the equanimity developed in the fourth jhāna can be applied to other refined objects of the mindThese are the four formless jhanas the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness and the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionThese states may sound impossibly abstract but in actual practice they grow directly from the way the mind relates to the still sense of the body in the fourth jhānaThe first stage comes when the mind consciously ignores its perception of the form of the body attending instead to the remaining sense of space that surrounds and pervades that form the second stage comes when the mind sheds its perception of space leaving a limitless sense of awareness the third when it lets go of the oneness of its perception of awareness leaving a perception of inactivity and the fourth when it sheds the perception of that lack of activityThat leaves a state where perception is so refined that it can hardly be called perception at all even though it is still thereAs one masters these steps one realizes that whereas the first four levels of jhāna differ in the type of activity the mind focuses on its one object the four formless jhanas differ in their objects as one level of mental labeling falls away to be replaced by a more subtle onePassages  and  list one more meditative attainment beyond the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception  the cessation of feeling and perception  but this is qualitatively different from the others in that a meditator cannot attain it without at the same time awakening to the level of at least nonreturningThe reason behind this is related once more to the factor of fabrication in dependent coarisingIn the course of mastering the levels of jhāna verbal fabrication grows still as one enters the second jhāna bodily fabrication as one enters the fourth and mental fabrication as one enters this last stageFor all three types of fabrication to stop however ignorance  the condition for fabrication  must stop as well and this can happen only with the insight that leads to AwakeningWe have come to the end of the list of the stages of mastery in meditative attainment but four steps in breath meditation remain unexplainedThis is because aside from the ninth level of attainment the stages of mastery can all be attained without developing the discernment that constitutes Awakening while the last four steps in breath meditation deal specifically with giving rise to that discernmentThis brings us to the third question that was broached at the beginning of this introduction how right concentration can be put to usePassage  lists four possible uses for concentrationThe first use is the simple enjoyment of the experience of jhāna the second relates to the first five supranormal powersThe third relates to the development of the frames of reference and the fourth to the discernment that constitutes AwakeningWe have already discussed the second and third uses of concentration in the passages just cited in bracketsThis leaves us with the first and fourthThe Canon notes that meditators can become chained and fettered to the attractions of the pleasure to be found in jhānaAs a result many meditators are afraid to let their minds settle into blissfully still states for fear of becoming stuckThe Canon however never once states that streamentry can be attained without at least some experience in jhāna and it states explicitly that the attainment of nonreturning requires a mastery of concentrationMN relates that the turning point in the Buddhas own practice  when he abandoned the path of selfaffliction and turned to the middle way  hinged on his realization that there is nothing blameworthy in the pleasure to be found in jhānaThus there is nothing to fearThis pleasure plays an important function in the practiceTo begin with it enables the mind to stay comfortably in the present moment helping it attain the stability it needs for gaining insightThis can be compared to a scientific experiment in which the measuring equipment needs to be absolutely steady in order to give reliable readingsSecond because a great deal of sensitivity is required to tune the mind to the refined pleasure of jhāna the practice serves to increase ones sensitivity making one more acutely aware of even the most refined levels of stress as wellThird because the pleasure and equanimity of jhāna are more exquisite than sensory pleasures and because they exist independently of the five senses they can enable the mind to become less involved in sensory pleasures and less inclined to search for emotional satisfaction from themIn this sense the skillful pleasures of jhāna can act as a fulcrum for prying loose ones attachments to the less skillful pleasures of sensualityThe fact that fully mature mastery of jhāna brings about the attainment of nonreturning the preliminary level of Awakening where sensual passion is abandoned shows the necessary role that jhāna plays in letting go of this particular defilementFinally the pleasure of jhāna provides a place of rest and rehabilitation along the path when the minds powers of discernment become dulled or it must be coaxed into the proper mood to accept some of the harsher lessons it needs to learn in order to abandon its cravingsJust as a person who is wellfed and rested is more open to receiving criticism than when he is tired and hungry the mind is often more willing to admit its own foolishness and lack of skill when it is nourished by the pleasure of jhāna than when it is notThus although the pleasure of jhāna can become an obstacle if treated as an end in itself there are phases of the practice where the pursuit of this form of pleasure is a useful strategy toward the fourth use of concentration the ending of the mental effluentsThis fourth use is the topic of the next section but here we can simply note that it is related to the fifth factor of noble right concentration mentioned in As the simile illustrating it suggests  with the standing person reflecting on the person sitting down  this factor is a pulling back or a lifting of the mind above the object of its absorption without at the same time disturbing the absorptionThis factor corresponds to steps through in the guide to breath meditation in that one is able to focus on the way the mind relates to its object at the same time that the mind is actually in a state of concentrationPassage  shows that this factor can be applied to any level of jhāna except for the states of neither perception nor nonperception and the cessation of perception and feelingAs for those two states one can reflect on their component factors only after leaving themWith the other states one stays with the object but ones prime focus is on the mindOne sees the various mental events that go into maintaining that state of concentration and as one contemplates these events one becomes struck by how inconstant they are how fabricated and willedThis provides insight into how the present aspect of kamma  ones present intentions  shape ones present experienceIt also gives insight into the general pattern of cause and effect in the mindFocusing on the inconstancy and unreliability of the factors in this pattern gives rise to the realization that they are also stressful and notself neither me nor mine but simply instances of the first noble truthWhen this realization goes straight to the heart there comes a sense of dispassion for any craving directed at them and an experience of their fading and cessationFinally one relinquishes attachment not only to these events but also to the discernment that sees through to their true natureThis completes steps through in the guide to breath meditation at the same time bringing the seven factors for Awakening to completion in a state dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting go where letting go would appear to be equivalent to the relinquishment in stepWhen one can simply experience the act of relinquishment without fashioning an identity around doing the relinquishing one passes through the third stage of framesofreference meditation to the state of nonfashioning which forms the threshold to releaseEven after attaining release the Arahant continues to practice meditation although now that the effluents are ended the concentration is not needed to put them to an endMN mentions that Arahants practice concentration both for the sake of a pleasant abiding in the here and now and for mindfulness and alertnessA number of passages in the Canon mention the Buddha and his Arahant disciples exercising their supranormal powers which shows that they were practicing concentration for the sake of attaining knowledge and vision as well to use in instructing those around themThe description of the Buddhas passing away tells that he entered total Unbinding after exercising his mastery in the full range of jhanic attainmentsThus the practice of concentration is useful all the way to the point where one gains total release from the round of death and rebirthVisākha Now what is concentration what qualities are

ConcentrationNow what monks is fivefactored noble right concentrationThere is the case where a monk  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationHe permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of seclusionThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born of seclusionJust as if a skilled bathman or bathmans apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again  again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within  without  would nevertheless not drip even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of seclusionThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born of seclusionThis is the first development of the fivefactored noble right concentrationFurthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceHe permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of concentrationThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born of concentrationJust like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from east west north or south and with the skies periodically supplying abundant showers so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate  pervade suffuse  fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of concentrationThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born of concentrationThis is the second development of the fivefactored noble right concentrationAnd furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of raptureJust as in a blue white or redlotus pond there may be some of the blue white or red lotuses which born  growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated  pervaded suffused  filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those blue white or red lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of raptureThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of raptureThis is the third development of the fivefactored noble right concentrationAnd furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure  stress  as with the earlier disappearance of joys  distresses  he enters  remains in the fourth jhāna purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpainHe sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awarenessJust as if a man were sitting wrapped from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating his body with a pure bright awarenessThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awarenessThis is the fourth development of the fivefactored noble right concentrationAnd furthermore the monk has his theme of reflection well in hand well attended to well pondered well tuned by means of discernmentJust as if one person were to reflect on another or a standing person were to reflect on a sitting person or a sitting person were to reflect on a person lying down even so monks the monk has his theme of reflection well in hand well attended to well pondered well tuned by means of discernmentThis is the fifth development of the fivefactored noble right concentrationWhen a monk has developed  pursued the fivefactored noble right concentration in this way then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know  realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an openingSuppose that there were a water jar set on a stand brimful of water so that a crow could drink from itIf a strong man were to tip it in any way at all would water spill outIn the same way when a monk has developed  pursued the fivefactored noble right concentration in this way then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know  realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an openingSuppose there were a rectangular water tank  set on level ground bounded by dikes  brimful of water so that a crow could drink from itIf a strong man were to loosen the dikes anywhere at all would water spill outYes lordSuppose there were a chariot on level ground at four crossroads harnessed to thoroughbreds waiting with whips lying ready so that a skilled driver a trainer of tamable horses might mount and  taking the reins with his left hand and the whip with his right  drive out  back to whatever place and by whichever road he liked in the same way when a monk has developed  pursued the fivefactored noble right concentration in this way then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know  realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an openingBreath MeditationNow how is mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so that it bears great fruit  great benefitsThere is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes outBreathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long Or breathing in short he discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns I am breathing out short He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body he trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication and to breathe out calming bodily fabricationHe trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to rapture he trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to rapture He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to pleasure he trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to pleasure He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication he trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication He trains himself I will breathe in calming mental fabrication he trains himself I will breathe out calming mental fabricationHe trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the mind he trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to the mind He trains himself I will breathe in gladdening the mind he trains himself I will breathe out gladdening the mind He trains himself I will breathe in steadying the mind he trains himself I will breathe out steadying the mind He trains himself I will breathe in releasing the mind he trains himself I will breathe out releasing the mindHe trains himself I will breathe in focusing on inconstancy he

will breathe in focusing on cessation he trains himself I will breathe out focusing on cessation He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment he trains himself I will breathe out focusing on relinquishmentThis is how mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so that it bears great fruit  great benefitsVassakāra Once Master nanda Master Gotama was living at Vesālī in the Hall with the peaked roof in the Great ForestI went to where he was staying in the Great Forest and there he spoke in a variety of ways on jhānaMaster Gotama was both endowed with jhāna and made jhāna his habitIn fact he praised all sorts of jhānaVennanda It was not the case that the Blessed One praised all sorts of jhāna nor did he criticize all sorts of jhānaAnd what sort of jhāna did he

Himalayas king of mountains to say nothing of miserable ignoranceWhich sixThere is the case where a monk is skilled in the attaining of concentration in the maintenance of concentration in the exit from concentration in the preparedness for concentration in the range of concentration  in the application of concentrationA monk endowed with these six qualities could break through the Himalayas king of mountains to say nothing of miserable ignoranceImagine a great pool of water to which there comes a great bull elephant seven or seven and a half cubits tallThe thought occurs to him What if I were to plunge into this pool of water to amuse myself by squirting water into my ears and along my back and then to bathe  drink  come back out  go off as I please So he plunges into the pool of water amuses himself by squirting water into his ears and along his back and then bathes  drinks  comes back out  goes off as he pleasesWhy is thatBecause his large body finds a footing in the depthNow suppose a rabbit or a cat were to come along  think Whats the difference between me  a bull elephantWhat if I were to plunge into this pool of water to amuse myself by squirting water into my ears and along my back and then to bathe  drink  come back out  go off as I please So he plunges rashly into the pool of water without reflecting and of him it can be expected that he will either sink to the bottom or float away on the surfaceWhy is thatBecause his small body doesnt find a footing in the depthIn the same way whoever says Without having attained concentration I will go live in solitude in isolated wilderness places of him it can be expected that he will either sink to the bottom or float away on the surfaceThese are the five rewards for one who practices walking meditationWhich fiveHe can endure traveling by foot he can endure exertion he becomes free from disease whatever he has eaten  drunk chewed  savored becomes welldigested the concentration he wins while doing walking meditation lasts for a long timeDistracting ThoughtsWhen a monk is intent on the heightened mind there are five themes he should attend to at the appropriate timesWhich fiveThere is the case where evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  arise in a monk while he is referring to  attending to a particular themeHe should attend to another theme apart from that one connected with what is skillfulWhen he is attending to this other theme those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned  subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates itJust as a skilled carpenter or his apprentice would use a small peg to knock out drive out  pull out a large one in the same way he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates itIf evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to this other theme connected with what is skillful he should scrutinize the drawbacks of those thoughts Truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful blameworthy these thoughts of mine result in stress As he is scrutinizing their drawbacks those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned  subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates itJust as a young woman  or man  fond of adornment would be horrified humiliated  disgusted if the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human being were hung from her neck in the same way the monk steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates itIf evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts he should pay no mind  pay no attention to those thoughtsAs he is paying no mind  paying no attention to them those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned  subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates itJust as a man with good eyes not wanting to see forms that had come into range would close his eyes or look away in the same way the monk steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates itIf evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is paying no mind  paying no attention to those thoughts he should attend to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughtsAs he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned  subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates itJust as the thought would occur to a man walking quickly Why am I walking quicklyWhy dont I walk slowly So he walks slowlyThe thought occurs to him Why am I walking slowlyWhy dont I stand So he standsThe thought occurs to him Why am I standingWhy dont I sit down So he sits downThe thought occurs to him Why am I sittingWhy dont I lie down So he lies downIn this way giving up the grosser posture he takes up the more refined oneIn the same way the monk steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates itIf evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts then  with his teeth clenched  his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he should beat down constrain  crush his mind with his awarenessAs  with his teeth clenched  his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he is beating down constraining  crushing his mind with his awareness those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned  subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates itJust as a strong man seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the shoulders would beat him down constrain  crush him in the same way the monk steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates itNow when a monk attending to another theme scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts paying no mind  paying no attention to those thoughts attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts beating down constraining  crushing his mind with his awareness steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates it he is then called a monk with mastery over the ways of thought sequencesHe thinks whatever thought he wants to and doesnt think whatever thought he doesntHe has severed craving thrown off the fetters and  through the right penetration of conceit  has made an end of suffering  stressThere are these gross impurities in gold dirty sand gravel  gritThe dirtwasher or his apprentice having placed in a vat washes it again  again until he has washed them awayWhen he is rid of them there remain the moderate impurities in the gold coarse sand  fine gritHe washes the gold again  again until he has washed them awayWhen he is rid of them there remain the fine impurities in the gold fine sand  black dustThe dirtwasher or his apprentice washes the gold again  again until he has washed them awayWhen he is rid of them there remains just the gold dustThe goldsmith or his apprentice having placed it in a crucible blows on it again  again to blow away the drossThe gold as long as it has not been blown on again  again to the point where the impurities are blown away as long as it is not refined  free from dross is not pliant malleable or luminousIt is brittle and not ready to be workedBut there comes a time when the goldsmith or his apprentice has blown on the gold again  again until the dross is blown awayThe gold is then refined free from dross plaint malleable  luminousIt is not brittle and is ready to be workedThen whatever sort of ornament he has in mind  whether a belt an earring a necklace or a gold chain  the gold would serve his purposeIn the same way there are these gross impurities in a monk intent on heightened mind misconduct in body speech  mindThese the monk  aware  able by nature  abandons destroys dispels wipes out of existenceWhen he is rid of them there remain in him the moderate impurities thoughts of sensuality ill will  violenceThese he wipes out of existenceWhen he is rid of them there remain in him the fine impurities thoughts of his caste thoughts of his home district thoughts related to not wanting to be despisedThese he wipes out of existenceWhen he is rid of them there remain only thoughts of the DhammaHis concentration is neither calm nor refined it has not yet attained serenity or unity and is kept in place by the fabrication of forceful restraintBut there comes a time when his mind grows steady inwardly settles down grows unified  concentratedHis concentration is calm  refined has attained serenity  unity and is no longer kept in place by the fabrication of forceful restraintThen whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know  realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening VenAnuruddha It has happened that as we were remaining heedful ardent  resolute we perceived light  the vision of formsBut soon after that the light disappeared together with the vision of forms and we cant become attuned to that themeThe Buddha You should become attuned to that themeBefore my selfawakening while I was still just an unawakened Bodhisatta I too perceived light  the vision of forms and soon after that the light disappeared together with the vision of formsThe thought occurred to me What is the cause what is the reason why the light disappeared together with the vision of forms Then it occurred to me Uncertainty arose in me and because of the uncertainty my concentration fell away when my concentration fell away the light disappeared together with the vision of formsI will act in such a way that uncertainty will not arise in me againAs I was remaining heedful ardent  resolute I perceived light  the vision of formsBut soon after that the light disappeared together with the vision of formsThe thought occurred to me What is the cause what is the reason why the light disappeared together with the vision of forms Then it occurred to me Inattention sloth  drowsiness fear elation inertia arose in me and because of the inattention inertia my concentration fell away when my concentration fell away the light disappeared together with the vision of formsI will act in such a way that uncertainty inattention sloth  drowsiness fear elation  inertia will not arise in me againAs I was remaining heedful ardent  resolute it occurred to me Excessive persistence arose in me and because of the excessive persistence my concentration fell away when my concentration fell away the light disappeared together with the vision of formsJust as if a man might hold a quail tightly with both hands it would die then  there in the same way excessive persistence arose in me I will act in such a way that uncertainty  excessive persistence will not arise in me againAs I was remaining heedful ardent  resolute it occurred to me Sluggish persistence arose in me and because of the sluggish persistence my concentration fell away when my concentration fell away the light disappeared together with the vision of formsJust as if a man might hold a quail loosely it would fly out of his hand in the same way sluggish persistence arose in me I will act in such a way that uncertainty excessive  sluggish persistence will not arise in me againAs I was remaining heedful ardent  resolute it occurred to me Longing the perception of multiplicity excessive absorption in forms arose in me and because of the excessive absorption in forms my concentration fell away when my concentration fell away the light disappeared together with the vision of forms I will act in such a way that uncertainty longing the perception of multiplicity excessive absorption in forms will not arise in me againWhen I knew Uncertainty is a defilement of the mind I abandoned the uncertainty that was a defilement of the mindAs I was remaining heedful ardent  resolute I perceived light without seeing forms or saw forms without perceiving light for a whole day a whole night a whole day  nightThe thought occurred to me What is the cause what is the reason Then it occurred to me When I attend to the theme of light without attending to the theme of forms I perceive light without seeing formsWhen I attend to the theme of forms without attending to the theme of light I see forms without seeing light for a whole day a whole night a whole day  nightAs I was remaining heedful ardent  resolute I perceived limited light  saw limited forms I perceived unlimited light  saw unlimited forms for a whole day a whole night a whole day  nightThe thought occurred to me What is the cause what is the reason Then it occurred to me When my concentration is limited my sense of vision is limitedWhen my concentration is unlimited my sense of vision is unlimitedWith an unlimited sense of vision I perceive unlimited light  see unlimited forms for a whole day a whole night a whole day  nightI have abandoned those defilements of the mindLet me develop concentration in three ways So I developed concentration with directed thought  evaluationI developed concentration without directed thought but with a modicum of evaluationI developed concentration without directed thought or evaluationI developed concentration with rapture without rapture I developed concentration accompanied by enjoyment accompanied by equanimityWhen my concentration with directed thought  evaluation was developed when my concentration without directed thought but with a modicum of evaluation without directed thought or evaluation with rapture without rapture accompanied by enjoyment accompanied by equanimity was developed then the knowledge  vision arose in me Unprovoked is my releaseThis is my last birthThere is no further becomingThat was what the Blessed One saidGlad at heart VenAnuruddha delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsSkill in concentrationSuppose there was a mountain cow  foolish inexperienced unfamiliar with her pasture unskilled in roaming on rugged mountains  and she were to think What if I were to go in a direction I have never gone before to eat grass I have never eaten before to drink water I have never drunk before She would lift her hind hoof without having placed her front hoof firmly and would not get to go in a direction she had never gone before to eat grass she had never eaten before or to drink water she had never drunk beforeAnd as for the place where she was standing when the thought occurred to her What if I were to go where I have never been before to drink water I have never drunk before she would not return there safelyWhy is thatBecause she is a foolish inexperienced mountain cow unfamiliar with her pasture unskilled in roaming on rugged mountainsIn the same way there are cases where a monk  foolish inexperienced unfamiliar with his pasture unskilled in entering  remaining in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation  doesnt stick with that theme doesnt develop it pursue it or establish himself firmly in itThe thought occurs to him What if I with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations were to enter  remain in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance He is not able to enter  remain in the second jhāna The thought occurs to him What if I were to enter  remain in the first jhāna He is not able to enter  remain in the first jhānaThis is called a monk who has slipped  fallen from both sides like the mountain cow foolish inexperienced unfamiliar with her pasture unskilled in roaming on rugged mountainsBut suppose there was a mountain cow  wise experienced familiar with her pasture skilled in roaming on rugged mountains  and she were to think What if I were to go in a direction I have never gone before to eat grass I have never eaten before to drink water I have never drunk before She would lift her hind hoof only after having placed her front hoof firmly and would get to go in a direction she had never gone before to drink water she had never drunk beforeAnd as for the place where she was standing when the thought occurred to her What if I were to go in a direction I have never gone before to drink water I have never drunk before she would return there safelyWhy is thatBecause she is a wise experienced mountain cow familiar with her pasture skilled in roaming on rugged mountainsIn the same way there are some cases where a monk  wise experienced familiar with his pasture skilled in entering  remaining in the first jhāna sticks with that theme develops it pursues it  establishes himself firmly in itThe thought occurs to him What if I were to enter  remain in the second jhāna Without jumping at the second jhāna he  with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations  enters  remains in the second jhānaHe sticks with that theme develops it pursues it  establishes himself firmly in itThe thought occurs to him What if I were to enter  remain in the third jhāna Without jumping at the third jhāna he enters  remains in the third jhānaHe sticks with that theme develops it pursues it  establishes himself firmly in itThe thought occurs to him What if I were to enter  remain in the fourth jhāna Without jumping at the fourth jhāna he enters  remains in the fourth jhānaHe sticks with that theme develops it pursues it  establishes himself firmly in itThe thought occurs to him What if I with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity Infinite space were to enter  remain in the dimension of the infinitude of space Without jumping at the dimension of the infinitude of space he enters  remains in dimension of the infinitude of spaceHe sticks with that theme develops it pursues it  establishes himself firmly in itThe thought occurs to him What if I with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space Infinite consciousness were to enter  remain in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness Without jumping at the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness he enters  remains in dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessHe sticks with that theme develops it pursues it  establishes himself firmly in itThe thought occurs to him What if I with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness There is nothing were to enter  remain in the dimension of nothingness Without jumping at the dimension of nothingness he enters  remains in dimension of nothingnessHe sticks with that theme develops it pursues it  establishes himself firmly in itThe thought occurs to him What if I with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness were to enter  remain in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception Without jumping at the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception he enters  remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionHe sticks with that theme develops it

cessation of perception  feeling Without jumping at the cessation of perception  feeling he enters  remains in the cessation of perception  feelingWhen a monk enters  emerges from that very attainment his mind is pliant  malleableWith his pliant malleable mind limitless concentration is well developedWith his concentration well developed  limitless then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know  realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an openingGuided by the elephant trainer the elephant to be tamed goes only in one direction east west north or south Guided by the Tathāgata the person to be tamed goes in eight directionsPossessed of form he sees formsThis is the first directionNot percipient of form internally he sees forms externallyThis is the second directionHe is intent only on the beautifulThis is the third directionWith the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity Infinite space he enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of spaceThis is the fourth directionWith the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space Infinite consciousness he enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessThis is the fifth directionHe enters  remains in the dimension of nothingnessThis is the sixth directionHe enters  remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionThis is the seventh directionWith the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception he enters  remains in the cessation of perception  feelingThis is the eighth directionThere are these seven propertiesWhich sevenThe property of light the property of beauty the property of the dimension of the infinitude of space the property of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the property of the dimension of nothingness the property of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception the property of the cessation of feeling  perceptionThese are the seven propertiesWhen this was said a certain monk addressed the Blessed One In dependence on what are these properties discernedThe property of light is discerned in dependence on darknessThe property of beauty is discerned in dependence on the unattractiveThe property of the dimension of the infinitude of space is discerned in dependence on formThe property of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness is discerned in dependence on the dimension of the infinitude of spaceThe property of the dimension of nothingness is discerned in dependence on the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessThe property of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception is discerned in dependence on the dimension of nothingnessThe property of the cessation of feeling  perception is discerned in dependence on cessationAnd how lord is the attainment of these properties to be reachedThe property of light beauty the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness These properties are to be reached as perception attainmentsThe property of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception is to be reached as a remnantoffabrications attainmentThe property of the cessation of feeling  perception is to be reached as a cessation attainmentWe noted in IIA that some of the sets in the Wings to Awakening list jhāna as a condition for discernment whereas others list discernment as a condition for jhānaPlace both of these patterns into the context of thisthat conditionality and they convey the point that jhāna and discernment in practice are mutually supportingPassage  states this point explicitly while  and  show that the difference between the two causal patterns relates to differences in meditators some develop strong powers of concentration before developing strong discernment whereas others gain a sound theoretical understanding of the Dhamma before developing strong concentrationIn either case both strong concentration and sound discernment are needed to bring about AwakeningPassage  makes the point that when the practice reaches the culmination of its development concentration and discernment act in tandemThe passages in this section deal with this topic in more detailThe role of jhāna as a condition for transcendent discernment is one of the most controversial issues in the Theravada traditionThree basic positions have been advanced in modern writingsOne following the commentarial tradition asserts that jhāna is not necessary for any of the four levels of Awakening and that there is a class of individuals  called dry insight meditators  who are discernmentreleased based on a level of concentration lower than that of jhānaA second position citing a passage in the Canon stating that concentration is mastered only on the level of nonreturning holds that jhāna is necessary for the attainment of nonreturning and Arahantship but not for the lower levels of AwakeningThe third position states that the attainment of at least the first level of jhāna is essential for all four levels of AwakeningEvidence from the Canon supports the third position but not the other twoAs  points out the attainment of streamentry has eight factors one of which is right concentration defined as jhānaIn fact according to this particular discourse jhāna is the heart of the streamwinners pathSecondly there is no passage in the Canon describing the development of transcendent discernment without at least some skill in jhānaThe statement that concentration is mastered only on the level of nonreturning must be interpreted in the light of the distinction between mastery and attainmentA streamwinner may have attained jhāna without mastering it the discernment developed in the process of gaining full mastery over the practice of jhāna will then lead himher to the level of nonreturningAs for the term discernmentreleased passage  shows that it denotes people who have become Arahants without experiencing the four formless jhanasIt does not indicate a person who has not experienced jhānaPart of the controversy over this question may be explained by the fact that the commentaries define jhāna in terms that bear little resemblance to the canonical descriptionThe Path of Purification  the cornerstone of the commentarial system  takes as its paradigm for meditation practice a method called kasina in which one stares at an external object until the image of the object is imprinted in ones mindThis image then gives rise to a countersign that is said to indicate the attainment of threshold concentration a necessary prelude to jhānaThe text then tries to fit all other meditation methods into this mold so that they too give rise to countersigns but even by its own admission breath meditation does not fit the mold very wellWith the other methods the stronger ones focus the more vivid the object and the closer it is to producing a countersign but with the breath the stronger ones focus the more subtle the breath and the harder it is to detectAs a result the text states that only Buddhas and Buddhas sons find the breath a congenial focal point for attaining jhānaNone of these assertions have any support in the CanonAlthough a practice called kasina is mentioned tangentially in some of the discourses the only point where it is described in any detail makes no mention of staring at an object or gaining a countersignIf breath meditation were congenial only to Buddhas and their sons there seems little reason for the Buddha to have taught it so frequently and to such a wide variety of peopleIf the arising of a countersign were essential to the attainment of jhāna one would expect it to be included in the steps of breath meditation and in the graphic analogies used to describe jhāna but it isntSome Theravadins insist that questioning the commentaries is a sign of disrespect for the tradition but it seems to be a sign of greater disrespect for the Buddha  or the compilers of the Canon  to assume that he or they would have left out something absolutely essential to the practiceSo it would seem that what jhāna means in the commentaries is something quite different from what it means in the CanonBecause of this difference we can say that the commentaries are right in viewing their type of jhāna as unnecessary for Awakening but Awakening cannot occur without the attainment of jhāna in the canonical senseWe have already given a sketch in the preceding section of how jhāna in its canonical sense can act as the basis for transcendent discernmentTo recapitulate On attaining any of the first seven levels of jhāna one may step back slightly from the object of jhāna  entering the fifth factor of noble right concentration  to perceive how the mind relates to the objectIn doing this one sees the process of causation as it plays a role in bringing the mind to jhāna together with the various mental acts of fabrication that go into keeping it therePassage  lists these acts in considerable detailThe fact that the passage emphasizes the amazing abilities of Sariputta the Buddhas foremost disciple in terms of discernment implies that there is no need for every meditator to perceive all these acts in such a detailed fashionWhat is essential is that one develop a sense of dispassion for the state of jhāna seeing that even the relatively steady sense of refined pleasure and equanimity it provides is artificial and willed inconstant and stressful a state fabricated from many different events and thus not worth identifying withJhana thus becomes an ideal test case for understanding the workings of kamma and dependent coarising in the mindIts stability gives discernment a firm basis for seeing clearly its refined sense of pleasure and equanimity allow the mind to realize that even the most refined mundane states involve the inconstancy and stress common to all willed phenomenaPassage  lists a number of verbal mental acts surrounding the exercise of supranormal powers that can be regarded in a similar light as topics to be analyzed so as to give rise to a sense of dispassionThe dispassion that results in either case enables one to experience the fading away and cessation of the last remaining activities in the mind even the activity of discernment itselfWhen this process fully matures it leads on to total relinquishment resulting in the clear knowing and release of ArahantshipIn contrast to the issue of the role of jhāna as a condition for discernment the role of discernment as a condition for jhāna is uncontroversialDiscernment aids jhāna on two levels mundane and transcendentOn the mundane level it enables one to perceive the various factors that go into ones state of jhāna so that one can master them and shed the factors that prevent one from attaining a higher level of jhānaThis again involves the reflection that constitutes the fifth factor of noble right concentration but in this case the results stay on the mundane levelFor instance as one masters the first level of jhāna and can reflect on the elements of stress it contains one may perceive that directed thought and evaluation should be abandoned because they have become unnecessary in maintaining ones concentration just as the forms used in pouring a cement wall become unnecessary when the cement has hardenedIn dropping these factors one then goes on to the second level of jhānaPassage  gives a list of the factors that in succession are dropped in this way as one attains higher and higher levels of concentrationOn the transcendent level the discernment that precipitates Awakening results in a supramundane level of jhāna called the fruit of gnosis which is described in   a type of jhāna independent of all perceptions and intentional processes beyond all limitations of cosmos time and the present the Arahants foretaste in this lifetime of the absolutely total Unbinding experienced by the awakened mind at deathThese four types of individuals are to be found existing in the worldWhich fourThere is the case of the individual who has attained internal tranquility of awareness but not insight into phenomena through heightened discernmentThere is the individual who has attained insight into phenomena through heightened discernment but not internal tranquility of awarenessThere is the individual who has attained neither internal tranquility of awareness nor insight into phenomena through heightened discernmentAnd there is the individual who has attained both internal tranquility of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernmentThe individual who has attained internal tranquility of awareness but not insight into phenomena through heightened discernment should approach an individual who has attained insight into phenomena through heightened discernment and ask him How should fabrications be regardedHow should they be investigatedHow should they be seen with insight The other will answer in line with what he has seen  experienced Fabrications should be regarded in this way investigated in this way seen in this way with insight Then eventually he will become one who has attained both internal tranquility of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernmentAs for the individual who has attained insight into phenomena through heightened discernment but not internal tranquility of awareness he should approach an individual who has attained internal tranquility of awareness and ask him How should the mind be steadiedHow should it be made to settle downHow should it be unifiedHow should it be concentrated The other will answer in line with what he has seen  experienced The mind should be steadied in this way made to settle down in this way unified in this way concentrated in this way Then eventually he will become one who has attained both internal tranquility of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernmentAs for the individual who has attained neither internal tranquility of awareness nor insight into phenomena through heightened discernment he should approach an individual who has attained both internal tranquility of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernment and ask him How should the mind be steadiedHow should it be made to settle downHow should it be unifiedHow should it be concentratedHow should fabrications be regardedHow should they be investigatedHow should they be seen with insight The other will answer in line with what he has seen  experienced The mind should be steadied in this way made to settle down in this way unified in this way concentrated in this wayFabrications should be regarded in this way investigated in this way seen in this way with insight Then eventually he will become one who has attained both internal tranquility of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernmentAs for the individual who has attained both internal tranquility of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernment his duty is to make an effort in establishing those very same skillful qualities to a higher degree for the ending of the effluentsVenAnanda Whenever a monk or nun declares the attainment of arahantship in my presence they all do it by means of one or another of four pathsWhich fourThere is the case where a monk has developed insight preceded by tranquilityAs he develops insight preceded by tranquility the path is bornHe follows that path develops it pursues itAs he follows the path developing it  pursuing it  his fetters are abandoned his obsessions abolishedFurthermore there is the case where a monk has developed tranquility preceded by insightAs he develops tranquility preceded by insight the path is bornHe follows that path His fetters are abandoned his obsessions abolishedFurthermore there is the case where a monk has developed tranquility  insight in concertAs he develops tranquility  insight in tandem the path is bornHe follows that path His fetters are abandoned his obsessions abolishedFurthermore there is the case where a monks mind has its restlessness concerning the Dhamma well under controlThere comes a time when his mind grows steady inwardly settles down and becomes unified  concentratedIn him the path is bornHe follows that path His fetters are abandoned his obsessions abolishedWhenever a monk or nun declares the attainment of Arahantship in my presence they all do it by means of one or another of these four pathsThen VenAnuruddha went to VenSāriputta and on arrival greeted him courteouslyAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat down to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenSāriputta By means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human I see the thousandfold cosmosMy persistence is aroused  unsluggishMy mindfulness is established  unshakenMy body is calm  unarousedMy mind is concentrated into singlenessAnd yet my mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clingingsustenanceVenSāriputta My friend when the thought occurs to you By means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human I see the thousandfold cosmos that is related to your conceitWhen the thought occurs to you My persistence is aroused  unsluggishMy mindfulness is established  unshakenMy body is calm  unperturbedMy mind is concentrated into singleness that is related to your restlessnessWhen the thought occurs to you And yet my mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clingingsustenance that is related to your anxietyIt would be well if  abandoning these three qualities not attending to these three qualities  you directed your mind to the Deathless propertySo after that VenAnuruddha  abandoning those three qualities not attending to those three qualities  directed his mind to the Deathless propertyDwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute he in no long time entered  remained in the unexcelled goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus VenAnuruddha became another one of the ArahantsAnd what is an individual released in both waysThere is the case of the individual who remains touching with his body the peaceful liberations the formlessnesses beyond forms when he has seen with discernment his effluents are totally endedI do not say that such a monk has any duty to do with heedfulnessWhy is thatBecause he has done his duty with heedfulness he is no longer capable of being heedlessAnd what is an individual released through discernmentThere is the case of the individual who does not remain touching with his body the peaceful liberations the formlessnesses beyond forms but when he has seen with discernment his effluents are totally endedI do not say that such a monk has any duty to do with heedfulnessWhy is thatBecause he has done his

not having been come into playHaving been they vanish He remained unattracted  unrepelled with regard to those qualities  independent detached released dissociated with an awareness rid of barriersHe discerned that There is a further escape and pursuing it there really was for himFurthermore completely transcending the dimension of nothingness he entered  remained in the dimension of neither

virtue noble concentration noble discernment noble release he would be rightly describing Sāriputta Sāriputta takes the unexcelled wheel of Dhamma set rolling by the Tathāgata and keeps it rolling rightlyI tell you the ending of the effluents depends on the first jhāna the second jhāna the third the fourth the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionI tell you the ending of the effluents depends on the first jhāna Thus it has been saidIn reference to what was it said Suppose that an archer or archers apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession and to pierce great massesIn the same way there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationHe regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perceptions fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notselfHe turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation UnbindingStaying right there he reaches the ending of the mental effluentsOr if not then  through this very Dhammapassion this Dhammadelight and through the total wasting away of the five lower fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that worldI tell you the ending of the effluents depends on the first jhāna Thus it was said and in reference to this was it saidThus as far as the perceptionattainments go that is as far as gnosispenetration goesAs for these two dimensions  the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception  the attainment of the cessation of feeling  perception  I tell you that they are to be rightly explained by those monks who are meditators skilled in attaining skilled in attaining  emerging who have attained  emerged in dependence on themThen Dasama the householder from the city of Aṭṭhaka went to Vennanda and on arrival having bowed down sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to Vennanda Is there venerable sir any one condition explained by the Blessed One whereby a monk  dwelling heedful ardent  resolute  releases his mind that is as yet unreleased or whereby the effluents not yet brought to an end come to an end or whereby he attains the unexcelled security from bondage that he has not yet attainedVennanda Yes householder there is There is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhāna He notices that This first jhāna is fabricated  willed He discerns Whatever is fabricated  willed is inconstant  subject to cessation Staying right there he reaches the ending of the effluentsOr if not then  through this very Dhammapassion this Dhammadelight and through the total wasting away of the five lower fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that worldVenSāriputta This Unbinding is pleasant friendsThis Unbinding is pleasantUdāyin But what is the pleasure here my friend where there is nothing feltVenSāriputta Just that is the pleasure here my friend where there is nothing feltThere are these five strings of sensualityWhich fiveForms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing sounds smells tastes tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingWhatever pleasure or joy arises in dependence on these five strings of sensuality that is sensual pleasureNow there is the case where a monk  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhāna If as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with sensuality that is an affliction for himJust as pain arises as an affliction for a healthy person even so the attention to perceptions dealing with sensuality that beset the monk is an affliction for himNow the Blessed One has said that whatever is an affliction is stressSo by this line of reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasantFurthermore there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the second jhāna If as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with directed thought that is an affliction for himFurthermore there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the third jhāna If as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with rapture that is an affliction for himFurthermore there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the fourth jhāna If as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with equanimity that is an affliction for himFurthermore there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of spaceIf as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with form that is an affliction for himFurthermore there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessIf as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with the dimension of the infinitude of space that is an affliction

beset with attention to perceptions dealing with the dimension of nothingness that is an affliction for him whatever is an affliction is stressSo by this line of reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasantFurthermore there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the cessation of perception  feelingAnd when he has seen with discernment his effluents are completely endedSo by this line of reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasantVennanda Its amazing my friend its astounding how the Blessed One has attained  recognized the opportunity for the purification of beings and the direct realization of Unbinding where the eye will be and forms and yet one will not be sensitive to that dimension where the ear will be and sounds where the nose will be and smells where the tongue will be and tastes where the body will be and tactile sensations and yet one will not be sensitive to that dimensionVenUdāyin Is one percipient when not sensitive to that dimension or unpercipientVennandapercipientVenUdāyinpercipient of whatVennanda There is the case where with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity Infinite space one remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space this is one way of being percipient when not sensitive to that dimensionFurther with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space Infinite consciousness one remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness this is another way of being percipient when not sensitive to that dimensionFurther with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness There is nothing one remains in the dimension of nothingness this is another way of being percipient when not sensitive to that dimensionOnce friend when I was staying in Sāketa at the Game Refuge in the Black Forest the nun Jaṭilā Bhāgikā went to me and on arrival  having bowed down  stood to one sideAs she was standing to one side she said to me The concentration whereby  neither pressed down nor forced back nor with mental fabrications kept blocked or suppressed  still as a result of release contented as a result of stillness and as a result of contentment one is not agitated this concentration is said by the Blessed One to be the fruit of whatI said to her This concentration is said by the Blessed One to be the fruit of gnosis This is another way of being percipient when not sensitive to that dimensionThe Buddha Sandha practice the absorption of a thoroughbred horse not the absorption of an unbroken coltAnd how is an unbroken colt absorbedAn unbroken colt tied to the feeding trough is absorbed with the thought Barley grainBarley grain Why is thatBecause as he is tied to the feeding trough the thought does not occur to him I wonder what task the trainer will have me do todayWhat should I do in response Tied to the feeding trough he is simply absorbed with the thought Barley grainBarley grainIn the same way there are cases where an unbroken colt of a man having gone to the wilderness to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling

the excellent thoroughbred of a man absorbed when he is absorbedThe Buddha There is the case Sandha where for an excellent thoroughbred of a man the perception of earth with regard to earth has ceased

Brahmās  viceroys pay homage even from afarKnowledge of the ending of the effluents as it has come to be occurs to one who is concentrated I tell you and not to one who is not concentratedSo concentration is the path monksNonconcentration is no path at allWe have pinpointed the fifth reflective level of noble right concentration as the mental state in which transcendent discernment can ariseA look at how equanimity functions in this process will help to flesh out our account of this stateThe word equanimity is used in the Canon in two basic senses  a neutral feeling in the absence of pleasure and pain and  an attitude of evenmindedness in the face of every sort of experience regardless of whether pleasure and pain are present or notThe attitude of evenmindedness is what is meant herePassage  gives an outline of the place of equanimity in the emotional life of a person on the path of practiceThis outline is interesting for several reasonsTo begin with contrary to many teachings currently popular in the West it shows that there is a skillful use for the sense of distress that can come to a person who longs for the goal of the practice but has yet to attain itThis sense of distress can help one to get over the distress that comes when one feels deprived of pleasant sensory objects for one realizes that the goal unattained is a much more serious lack than an unattained sensual pleasureWith ones priorities thus straightened out one will turn ones energy to the pursuit of the path rather than to the pursuit of sensual pleasureAs the path thus matures it results in the sense of joy that comes on gaining an insight into the true nature of sensory objects  a joy that in turn matures into a sense of equanimity resulting from that very same insightThis is the highest stage of what is called equanimity dependent on multiplicity  ie equanimity in the face of multiple objectsPassages  and  go into more detail on how to foster this sort of equanimityPassage  describes three stages in the process  development or a conscious turning of the mind to equanimity in the face of agreeable or disagreeable objects  a state of being in training in which one feels a spontaneous disillusionment with agreeable or disagreeable objects and  fully developed faculties in which ones evenmindedness is so completely mastered that one is in full control of ones thought processes in the face of agreeable or disagreeable objectsBecause the first of these three stages is a conscious process both  and  illustrate it with a series of graphic metaphors to help tune the mind to the right attitude and to help keep that attitude firmly in mindHowever the cultivation of equanimity does not stop with equanimity dependent on multiplicityFormless jhāna if one is able to attain it functions as a basis for equanimity dependent on singleness ie the singleness of jhānaThe next stage is to use this equanimity to bring on the state of equipoise called nonfashioning although  shows that nonfashioning can be attained directly from any of the stages of jhāna and not just the formless onesExactly what nonfashioning involves is shown in  one perceives the fabricated and willed nature of even ones refined state of jhāna and becomes so dispassionate toward the whole process that one neither fabricates nor wills for the sake of becoming or unbecoming In this state of nonfashioning the mind is so balanced that it contributes absolutely no present input into the conditioning of experience at allBecause the process of conditioned or fabricated experience on the unawakened level requires present input together with input from the past in order to continue functioning the entire process then breaks down and all that remains is the UnfabricatedAfter this experience the processes of worldly experience resume due to the kammic input from the past but ones attitude toward these processes is changed in line with the mental fetters that have been cut by the AwakeningIf the Awakening was total one continues to deal on an awakened level with the world until the time of ones total Unbinding with an attitude of perfect evenmindedness illustrated by the three frames of reference described at the end of One feels sympathy for others and seeks their wellbeing experiencing a sense of satisfaction when they respond to ones teachings but otherwise one stays equanimous untroubled mindful and alertThis passage shows that the evenmindedness of a fully awakened person is an attitude not of cold indifference but rather of mental imperturbabilitySuch a person has found true happiness and would like others to share that happiness as well but that happiness is not dependent on how others respondThis is the ideal state of mind for a person who truly works for the benefit of the worldThe thirtysix emotions should be known by experience Thus it was saidAnd in reference to what was it saidSix kinds of household joy

would blow on it periodically sprinkle water on it periodically examine it periodically so that the gold would become refined wellrefined thoroughly refined flawless free from dross pliant malleable  luminousThen whatever sort of ornament he had in mind  whether a belt an earring a necklace or a gold chain  it would serve his purposeIn the same way there remains only equanimity pure  bright pliant malleable  luminousHe discerns that If I were to direct equanimity as pure  bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of space I would develop the mind along those lines and thus this equanimity of mine  thus supported thus sustained  would last for a long timeHe discerns that If I were to direct equanimity as pure  bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of space and to develop the mind along those lines that would be fabricated He neither fabricates nor wills for the sake of becoming or unbecomingThis being the case he is not sustained by anything in the

integrity completely transcending the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enters  remains in the cessation of feeling  perceptionWhen he sees with discernment his effluents are endedThis is a monk who does not construe anything does not construe anywhere does not construe in any wayThe texts define right view as knowledge with regard to the four noble truthsThe phrase with regard to here can also mean in terms of and this alternative meaning is especially relevant in this caseIt reflects the point that the knowledge constituting right view is not a theoretical knowledge about the truths but is a way of using the truths to categorize all of conditioned experienceBecause these truths view experience in terms of function  how unskillful and skillful mental qualities play a role in the causal chain of creating suffering or bringing it to an end  the right way to view right view itself is not to stop with its definition but to regard it in terms of its function and then put it to its intended useThe function of right view is to look at events in the mind in a way that gives rise to a sense of dispassion leading the mind to a state of nonfashioning and then on to AwakeningIt does this by focusing on the way in which passion and desire lead to suffering and stressIn this it develops the minds basic reaction to stress  the search for a way to escape from the stress  in a skillful way so that this reaction actually leads to utter releaseWhen the mind sees without its normal bewilderment the actual process by which stress is caused it will naturally let go of the causesWhen it sees passion clearly enough to catch that passion in the act of leading to stress it will naturally develop a sense of dispassion for and detachment from the passion so that it can view it simply as a mental event with no meaning in terms of anything elseThis opens the way to the state of nonfashioning where the cause of stress is allowed to ceaseThe causal connection between passion and desire on the one hand and stress on the other is explained in the standard formula for dependent coarising under the factor of clingingsustenanceA passage in the Canon analyzes this factor into four forms of passion and desire for the five aggregates clinging to sensuality clinging to habits and practices clinging to views and clinging to theories about the selfThe third form of clinging listed here points to one of the paradoxes about right view it is a form of view that has to loosen attachment to all views ultimately including itselfPassage  shows how this happensWhen faced with a variety of views about the world and the self right view looks at the views not in terms of their content but simply as events in the mind in and of themselvesIt sees them as part of a causal chain fabricated inconstant stressful and thus notself not worthy of attachmentIn this way it makes the mind dispassionate to all other views dispassionate toward the terms they use dispassionate toward their claims to truthRight view then turns on itself to see itself as part of a similar causal chainThis loosens any sense of attachment even for right view so that the mind can see the view simply as an event there is this This entry into the perceptual mode of emptiness leads straight to the higher escape  the state of nonfashioning  that then becomes present to awarenessBecause right view is the only form of view that contains the seeds of its own transcendence in this way it is the only form of knowing that is skillful enough to lead to AwakeningThe Canon gives no room for any alternative skillful means that would contradict right viewAfter the experience of Awakening the texts tell us one continues to make use of right view with no sense of clinging as a pleasant abiding for the mind and for mindfulness and alertness much as one would use jhāna for the same purposeThis process of transcending right view even as one makes use of it shows that nonattachment to views does not mean agnosticism or an openness to all viewsInstead nonattachment is a skillful way of making use of ones discerning faculties seeing through to the causal function of all views so that one may attain Awakening and then maintain a pleasant and mindfully alert abiding after one has become awakenedThe steps in the functioning of right view correspond to the three stages of framesofreference meditationThe first step in which one focuses on events in and of themselves  and not in reference to anything they might mean outside of the range of immediate experience  corresponds to the first stage of framesofreference meditation in which one stays focused on the body etc in and of itself putting aside all greed and distress with reference to the worldThe second step of right view in which one focuses on events in terms of their role in the causal chain  fabricated inconstant stressful and notself  corresponds to the second stage of framesofreference meditation in which one remains focused on the phenomenon of origination and passing awayThe third step of right view in which one sees even right view simply as an event corresponds to the third stage of framesofreference meditation in which one moves to the perceptual mode of entry into emptiness noting simply There is this  without being caught up in the this  and from there on to nonfashioning and AwakeningBecause the practice of jhāna is also implicated in these three steps  steadying the mind in the first step sensitizing it to causality in the second and providing the basis for the fifth factor of noble concentration in the third  mindfulness concentration and discernment are thus inextricably intertwined as they develop along the path to AwakeningIt is important to note that right view functions in two time frames small and largeIts primary frame is in the small frame dealing exclusively with the immediate presentAs it focuses on the phenomenon of origination and passing away it reduces its terms of analysis to more and more basic levels until reaching the point where it sees even such simple categories as being and nonbeing as extraneous inappropriate and irrelevant to the simple flow of events arising and passing away in the presentAs a result it strips everything down to the most basic categories of experience  the presence and absence of stress  without adding anything furtherThis phenomenological mode of perception or entry into emptiness sees things simply in terms of what is present and what is notHere realizations are expressed merely as pointers to present phenomena without any content that would point to anything outside of direct experience There is this Such is form such is feeling etcThe Pali name for thisthat conditionality idappaccayata points to the fact that not only the phenomena but also their relationships are a matter of immediate right hereandnow insightOnce these insights are gained on the level of radically immediate experience one realizes that they have implications for the larger time frame of the whole process of transmigration and ones entire experience of the cosmos as wellThe process of stress arising and passing away in the present is precisely the same process as that of living beings arising and passing away on the cosmic scaleOne sees that one has participated in this process from an inconceivable beginning in time one knows  now that the process has been disbanded  that one has found the end of the cycle of rebirthThis is because in entering radically into the present moment by stripping away all clinging one ultimately steps out of the dimensions of time and the present having done so one can see the totality of what it means to be in those dimensionsThis point is illustrated in two passages that express the content of right view immediately before and after the experience of the DeathlessThis is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are effluents This is the origination of effluents This is the cessation of effluents This is the way leading to the cessation of effluents His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the effluent of sensuality released from the effluent of becoming released from the effluent of ignoranceWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThe first passage depicts the act of discernment that verifies the principles of convictionThe second passage depicts the act of discernment that confirms the fact that the five faculties when fully developed do lead to the DeathlessNotice that both passages follow a similar pattern even though they deal with vastly different time scalesTransmigration and darkness in the first passage correspond to stress in the secondIgnorance and craving are the origination of stress and the sentence The total fading  cessation of ignorance Unbinding describes the cessation of stressThe act of discernment that sees all these things is the way leading to the cessation of stressThis repetition of the same pattern on two different frames of space and time in nonlinear systems is called scale invariance the same process on two different scalesIt is one of the most distinctive features of the Buddhas teachings for it shows how an insight into a present moment in the mind can have repercussions on ones entire involvement in the cosmosThe principle behind the scale invariance of right view is thisthat conditionality the fact that ones continued participation in the cosmos is kept going by ones present contribution to the causal stream initiated over the long course of the pastBy reaching the state of nonfashioning one stops contributing to the present and thus can bring the totality of ones participation to an end leaving the utter freedom of UnbindingIn this sense the principle of thisthat conditionality explains the possibility of attaining the Deathless while the actuality of the Deathless  once it is attained through skillful mastery of kamma  is what proves the principle of thisthat conditionality as an adequate description of the causal process that fabricates conditioned experience and provides an opening to the UnfabricatedI do not envision any one other quality by which

assisted by virtue assisted by learning assisted by discussion assisted by tranquility  assisted by insightWhen assisted by these five factors right view has awarenessrelease  discernment release as its fruit  rewardKaccāyana Lord Right view right view it is saidTo what extent is there right viewThe Buddha By  large Kaccāyana this world is supported by a polarity that of existence  nonexistenceBut when one sees the origination of the world with right discernment as it has come to be nonexistence with reference to the world does not occur to oneWhen one sees the cessation of the world with right discernment as it has come to be existence with reference to the world does not occur to oneBy  large Kaccāyana this world is in bondage to attachments clingings  biasesBut one such as this does not get involved with or cling to these attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases or obsessions nor is he resolved on my self He has no uncertainty or doubt that mere stress when arising is arising stress when passing away is passing awayIn this his knowledge is independent of othersIts to this extent Kaccāyana that there is right viewThen Anāthapiṇḍika the householder went to the wanderers of other persuasionsOn arrival he greeted them courteouslyAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat down to one sideAs he was sitting there the wanderers said to him Tell us householder what views the contemplative Gotama hasVenerable sirs I dont know entirely what views the Blessed One has Well wellSo you dont know entirely what views the contemplative Gotama hasThen tell us what views the monks haveI dont even know entirely what views the monks haveSo you dont know entirely what views the contemplative Gotama has or even the monks haveThen tell us what views you haveIt wouldnt be difficult for me to expound to you what views I haveBut please let the venerable ones expound each in line with his position and then it wont be difficult for me to expound to you what views I haveWhen this had been said one of the wanderers said to Anāthapiṇḍika the householder The cosmos is eternalOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I haveAnother wanderer said to Anāthapiṇḍika The cosmos is not eternalOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I haveAnother wanderer said The cosmos is finiteThe cosmos is infiniteThe soul  the body are the sameThe soul is one thing and the body anotherAfter death a Tathāgata existsAfter death a Tathāgata does not existAfter death a Tathāgata both does  does not existAfter death a Tathāgata neither does nor does not existOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I haveWhen this had been said Anāthapiṇḍika the householder said to the wanderers As for the venerable one who says The cosmos is eternalOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I have his view arises from his own inappropriate attention or in dependence on the words of anotherNow this view has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently coarisenWhatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently coarisen that is inconstantWhatever is inconstant is stressThis venerable one thus adheres to that very stress submits himself to that very stress When this had been said the wanderers said to Anāthapiṇḍika the householder We have each  every one expounded to you in line with our own positionsNow tell us what views you haveWhatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently coarisen that is inconstantWhatever is inconstant is stressWhatever is stress is not mine is not what I am is not my selfThis is the sort of view I haveSo householder whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently coarisen that is inconstantWhatever is inconstant is stressYou thus adhere to that very stress submit yourself to that very stressVenerable sirs whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently coarisen that is inconstantWhatever is inconstant is stressWhatever is stress is not mine is not what I am is not my selfHaving seen this well with right discernment as it has come to be I also discern the higher escape from it as it has come to beWhen this had been said the wanderers fell silent abashed sitting with their shoulders drooping their heads down brooding at a loss for wordsAnāthapiṇḍika the householder perceiving that the wanderers were silent abashedat a loss for words got up  leftIn  the Buddha refers to himself as a doctor treating the spiritual illnesses of his studentsThis metaphor is useful to keep in mind as we discuss the basic categories of right view the four noble truthsMany people have charged Buddhism with being pessimistic because the four truths start out with stress and suffering but this charge misses the fact that the first truth is part of a strategy of diagnosis and therapy focusing on the basic problem in life so as to offer a solution to itThis is the sense in which the Buddha was like a doctor focusing on the disease he wanted to cureThe total cure he promised as a result of his course of therapy shows that in actuality he was much less pessimistic than the vast majority of world for whom wisdom means accepting the bad things in life with the good assuming that there is no chance in this life for unalloyed happinessThe Buddha was an extremely demanding person unwilling to bend to this supposed wisdom or to rest with anything less than absolute happinessWe are fortunate that he was so demanding and succeeded in his aim for otherwise we would have to undertake the uncertain task of trying to discover the way to that happiness ourselvesAlthough the four noble truths constitute the most basic categories of the Buddhas teaching he did not discuss them unless he felt that his listeners were ready for themTo understand and accept them requires a basic shift in the framework of ones awareness and only a mind that has been thoroughly prepared is in a position to make such a shiftOften the Buddha would prepare his listeners with what he called a gradual discourse discussing step by step the joy of generosity the joy of living a virtuous life the longterm sensory rewards of generosity and virtue in heaven the drawbacks and impermanence of sensory pleasures and conditioned phenomena in general and finally the rewards of renunciationThen if he sensed that his listeners were ready to look favorably on renunciation as a means to true happiness he would discuss the four truths beginning with suffering and stressIn this he followed the sequence of his own Awakening beginning with insight into the punishments of bad kamma the rewards of good kamma and the limitations of all kamma and then proceeding to insight into the origination of stress and its cessation through the cessation of kammaOnce the problem of stress and suffering is solved he said there are no more problemsThis is why he limited his teaching to this issue even though his own Awakening encompassed much moreThe vicious cycle that operates between suffering and ignorance  with ignorance underlying the craving that causes suffering and suffering causing the bewilderment that leads people to act in ignorant and unskillful ways  can be broken only when one focuses on understanding suffering and stress and the causal network that surrounds themMost people are so bewildered by the complexities of suffering and stress that they do not even know what the true problem isThus they may deny that they are suffering or may imagine that something stressful can actually be a solution to their problemsThe genius of the Buddha is that he recognized the most elegant and comprehensive way to deal with every variety of dissatisfaction in lifeWhen suffering and stress are seen with clear knowledge they no longer can cause bewilderment and the cycle that underlies all the problems of experience can be disbanded for goodAs  states this clear knowledge is based on knowledge of the four noble truthsThese truths are best understood not as the content of a belief but as categories for viewing and classifying the processes of immediate experienceIn  the Buddha refers to them as categories of appropriate attention a skillful alternative to the common way that people categorize their experience in terms of two dichotomies beingnonbeing and selfotherFor several reasons these common dichotomies are actually problemcausing rather than problemsolvingThe beingnonbeing dichotomy for instance comes down to the question of whether or not there exist actual things behind the changing phenomena of experienceThis type of questioning deals by definition with possibilities that cannot be directly experiencedIf the things in question could be experienced then they wouldnt be lying behind experienceThus the beingnonbeing dichotomy pulls ones attention into the land of conjecture  a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of views  and away from the area of direct awareness where the real problem and its solution lieAs for the selfother dichotomy there is the initial difficulty of determining what the self isAny true self would have to lie totally under ones own control and yet nothing that one might try to identify as ones self actually meets this criterionAlthough the sense of self may seem intuitive enough when carefully examined it shows itself to be based on confused perceptions and ideasIf ones basic categories for understanding experience are a cause for confusion in this way they can lead only to confused unskillful action and thus to more suffering and stressFor example when people view the source of their problems as poor relationships between themselves and others or inadequate integration of the self they are trying to analyze their problems in terms of categories that are ultimately uncertainThus there is a builtin uncertainty in the efforts they make to solve their problems in terms of those categoriesA second problem no matter how one might define a self is the question of how to prove whether or not it actually existsThis question entangles the mind in the unresolvable problems of the beingnonbeing dichotomy mentioned above because the problem is phrased in terms that cannot be directly experienced it forces the solution into a realm that cannot be experienced eitherThis fact probably explains the Buddhas statement in  to the effect that if one even asks the question of whether there is someone standing outside the processes of dependent coarising to whom those processes pertain it is impossible to lead the life that will bring about an end to sufferingRegardless of whether one would answer the question with a yes or a no the terms of the question focus on an area outside of direct experience and thus away from the true problem  the direct experience of suffering  and actually make it worseIf one assumes the existence of a self one must take on the implicit imperative to maximize the selfs wellbeing through recourse to the other This recourse may involve either exploiting the other or swallowing the other into the self by equating ones self with the cosmos as a wholeEither approach involves clinging and craving which lead to further suffering and stressOn the other hand if one denies any kind of self saying that the cosmos is totally other then one is assuming that there is nothing with any longterm existence whose happiness deserves anything more than quick shortterm attempts at finding pleasureThe imperative in this case would be to pursue immediate pleasure with as little effort as possible thus aborting any sustained effort to bring about an end to sufferingThese problems explain why the Buddha regarded questions of existence and nonexistence self and noself as unskillful inappropriate ways of attending to experienceStress and its cessation on the other hand are categories that avoid these problemsTo begin with they are immediately present and apparentEven babies recognize stress and pain well before they have any concept of self or being If one pays close attention to ones actual experience there is no question about whether or not stress and its cessation are presentFinally because these categories dont require fashioning notions of self or other  or noself or noother  on top of ones immediate awareness they allow one to reach the mode of entry into emptiness on the verge of nonfashioning in which as we mentioned in IIIH the mind simply notes There is this Thus they are ideal categories for analyzing experience in a way that reduces the confusion that causes people to act in unskillful ways and brings the mind to a point where it can disengage and transcend all suffering and stress by ending the mental fabrication that provides input into the causal webAs for the imperatives implicit in the four categories of the noble truths they are very different from the imperatives implicit in the notion that there is a self or that there isntStress the first category should be comprehendedIn practice this means admitting its presence recognizing it as a problem and then observing it with patient mindfulness to understand its true natureOne comes to realize that the problem is not with the stress and discomfort of external conditions but with the stress and discomfort in the mindOne also sees how stress is part of a causal process and that it is always accompanied by craving its point of originationThe second category  craving the origination of stress  should be abandonedHere we must note that the word craving covers not all desire but only the desire leading to further becomingThe desire to escape from that becoming as we have noted is part of the pathWithout such a desire no one would have the motivation to follow the path or reach UnbindingWhen Unbinding is reached though even this desire is abandoned just as a desire to walk to a park is abandoned on arriving thereThe third category the cessation of stress should be realizedThe definition of this truth as the abandoning of craving means that it denotes the successful performance of the duty appropriate to the second noble truthThis introduces a double tier into the practice in that one must not only abandon craving but also realize what is happening and what is uncovered in the process of that abandoningThis in turn accounts for two of the major themes covered so far in this book the switch from object to approach as the focal point in ones meditation as one moves from the first to the second stage in framesofreference meditation and the need for sensitivity to ones present input into the causal network in order to nurture the minds skillful mastery of thisthat conditionalityThe feedback loop created by this combination of abandoning and knowing is what eventually shortcircuits the process of thisthat conditionality cutting dependent coarising at the links of craving and ignorance and leading on to the state of nonfashioning that forms the threshold to the DeathlessThe fourth category the way to the cessation of stress is defined as the noble eightfold path which we have already discussed in detailThis truth must be developed which involves two processes nurturing the conditions for clear knowing and abstaining from acts of body speech and mind that involve craving and would obstruct knowledgeThese two processes correspond to the two layers we have just noted in the duties associated with the cessation of stress realizing and abandoningThis correspondence shows the intimate relation between the third and fourth noble truths and explains the Buddhas insistence that the noble eightfold path is the only way to the goalTaken together the four categories of the noble truths along with their imperatives follow a basic problemsolving approach one solves the problem of stress by following a path of practice that directly attacks the cause of the problemThe noble eightfold path develops the qualities of mind needed to see that all the possible objects of craving  the five aggregates  are stressful inconstant and notselfAs a result one grows dispassionate toward themWith nothing left to focus on craving disbandsWhen one experiences the remainderless fading  cessation renunciation relinquishment release  letting go of that very craving the problem is solvedAlthough the texts list four separate duties appropriate to each of the truths in actual practice these duties are four aspects of a single processWhen stress is comprehended the second noble truth  craving  has no object to latch onto and so can be abandonedThe full realization of what is happening in the process of that abandoning constitutes the realization of the third noble truth the cessation of stressBoth the abandoning and the realization are accomplished by developing the path which destroys any trace of ignorance concerning the four noble truths at the same time that it abandons cravingThis is how the practice cuts the chain of dependent coarising simultaneously at its two most crucial factors thus unraveling the causal chain and opening the way for an experience of the UnfabricatedPassage  lists three steps in this process which take the form of three levels of knowledge concerning each of the four truths recognizing the truth for what it is recognizing the duty appropriate to the truth and realizing that the duty has been completedThese levels of knowledge correspond to the three stages in right view that we mentioned in the preceding sectionThe first level corresponds to the stage of seeing events in and of themselves for what they actually areThe relationship between the second level of knowledge  realizing the duty appropriate to the truth  and the second stage of right view  viewing things as part of a causal chain  is somewhat less obvious but more revealing once it is understoodThe word duty makes the point that in order to understand the process of origination and passing away one must become involved in the process in an active wayThis understanding does not come from a passive state of simply watching things arise and disappearInstead one must participate in the process becoming sensitive to preexisting causal conditions and the impact of ones present activity on those conditions if one wants truly to understand themThe only way to know a causal relationship is to tamper with it and see what happens as a resultThe more precise and skillful ones tampering and the more properly attuned ones powers of observation the more precise the knowledge that can be gainedThis active participation corresponds to the second stage of frames of reference meditation and the process of gaining mastery in the practice of concentrationUltimately it comes down to the issues of acquiring skillfulness and understanding the connection between skillfulness and thisthat conditionalityThe meditator can gain escape from the confines of the causal process not by simply watching it but by developing the sensitivity to causal factors that comes from learning how to explore and manipulate them with skillThe third level of knowledge  that the duty appropriate to the truth has been completed  corresponds to the mode of entry into emptiness on the verge of nonfashioning when one realizes that nothing more needs to be contributed to the present momentIn fact nothing more can be contributed to the present momentAs noted in the preceding section this is the point where right view transcends itselfIn terms of the four noble truths this is where simple distinctions among the four truths begin to break downAs a modern teacher has put it the meditator sees that all four truths are ultimately identicalAfter having used jhāna and discernment which form the heart of the path to gain understanding of pain and to abandon clinging and craving one comes to see that even jhāna and discernment are composed of the same aggregates as stress and pain and that ones attitude toward them involves subtle levels of clinging and craving as wellThus the path is simply a refined version of the first three noble truths in which one has taken suffering craving and ignorance and turned them into tools for pleasure detachment and insightWithout these tools one could not have begun the process of releaseWere it not for ones attachment to jhāna and discernment one could not have liberated oneself from the more obvious levels of stress one could not have developed the sensitivity enabling one to appreciate the value of cessation and release when they finally comeNow however that these tools have performed their functions they become the last remaining obstacle to full releaseThe approach to the problem of stress has now become in and of itself the only problem leftAs the four truths become one in this way their respective duties reach the point where any further activity would mean that they would cancel one another outThis is where the mind attains the state of nonfashioning as there is nothing more it can do or know in terms of any of these dutiesThis lack of input into the present moment forms a breach in thisthat conditionality opening the way beyond the four truths and on to the UnfabricatedThis coalescing of the truths coincides with a movement noted earlier in which jhāna and discernment become one and the same thingThis union of jhāna and discernment solves the riddle of how one can come to know the end of the intention that keeps the round of rebirth in motionAs the path nears its end the intentional activity underlying jhāna becomes the sole remaining element of intention in the mind while the activity of discernment as appropriate attention aimed at understanding jhāna becomes the sole function of knowledgeAs they reach culmination and coalesce the attention focused on the intention and the intention behind the act of attention shortcircuit one anotherAll that can follow on this point is the state of nonfashioning in which all present input into the cycle of rebirth ends and all experience of the cycle falls awayAs we explained in the Introduction the experience of this falling away at Awakening confirms not only the Buddhas teachings on the present function of kammic input in thisthat conditionality but also on the functioning of kamma in the round of rebirth in the larger dimensions of timeThe wheel the traditional symbol of the Dhamma expresses these points in a visual formThe Buddha states that when he gained full knowledge of all four truths on all three levels  recognizing the truth recognizing the duty appropriate to it and realizing that he had fully completed that duty  he knew that he had attained full AwakeningHe elaborates on his assertion by setting out a table of two sets of variables  the four noble truths and the three levels of knowledge appropriate to each  listing all twelve permutations of the two setsThis sort of table in Indian legal and philosophical traditions is called a wheelThis is why the discourse in which he makes this statement is called Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion and why the wheel used as a symbol of the Dhamma has twelve spokes uniting at the hub symbolizing the twelve permutations that merge into a singularity  knowledge and vision of things as they have come to be  at the still point of nonfashioning in the midst of the cycle of kammaOnce the Blessed One was staying at Kosambī in the siṃsapā forestThen picking up a few siṃsapā leaves with his hand he asked the monks What do you think monksWhich are more numerous the few siṃsapā leaves in my hand or those overhead in the siṃsapā forestThe leaves in the hand of the Blessed One are few in number lordThose overhead in the siṃsapā forest are more numerousIn the same way monks those things that I have known with direct knowledge but have not taught are more numerousAnd why havent I taught themBecause they are not connected with the goal do not relate to the rudiments of the holy life and do not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingThat is why I have not taught themAnd what have I taughtThis is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is what I have taughtAnd why have I taught these thingsBecause they are connected with the goal relate to the rudiments of the holy life and lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingThis is why I have taught themTherefore your duty is the contemplation This is stressThis is the origination of stressThis is the cessation of stressThis is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stressStress should be knownThe cause by which stress comes into play should be knownThe diversity in stress should be knownThe result of stress should be knownThe cessation of stress should be knownThe path of practice for the cessation of stress should be known Thus it was saidAnd in reference to what was it saidBirth is stress aging is stress death is stress sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stress association with the unbeloved is stress separation from the loved is stress not getting what is wanted is stressIn short the five clingingaggregates are stressAnd what is the cause by which stress comes into playCraving is the cause by which stress comes into playAnd what is the diversity in stressThere is major stress  minor slowly fading  quickly fadingThis is called the diversity in stressAnd what is the result of stressThere are some cases in which a person overcome with pain his mind exhausted grieves mourns laments beats his breast  becomes bewilderedOr one overcome with pain his mind exhausted comes to search outside Who knows a way or two to stop this pain I tell you monks that stress results either in bewilderment or in searchAnd what is the cessation of stressFrom the cessation of craving is the cessation of stress and just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationNow when a disciple of the noble ones discerns stress in this way the cause by which stress comes into play in this way the diversity of stress in this way the result of stress in this way the cessation of stress in this way  the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress in this way then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of stressStress should be knownThe cause by which stress comes into playThe diversity in stressThe result of stressThe cessation of stressThe path of practice for the cessation of stress should be known Thus it was said and in reference to this was it saidThese four things are real not unreal not other than what they seemWhich fourThis is stress is real not unreal not other than what it seemsThis is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress is real not unreal not other than what it seemsThese are the four things that are real not unreal not other than what they seemTherefore your duty is the contemplation This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stressSuppose that a man were to cut down all the grass sticks branches  leaves in India and to gather them into a heapHaving gathered them into a heap he would make stakes from them and having made stakes he would impale all the large animals in the sea on large stakes all the mediumsized animals in the sea on mediumsized stakes  all the minute animals in the sea on minute stakesBefore he had come to the end of all the sizable animals in the sea he would have used up all the grass sticks branches  leaves here in IndiaIt would not be feasible for him to impale on stakes the minute animals in the sea which are even more numerousWhy is thatBecause of the minuteness of their bodiesSo great is the plane of deprivationFreed from this great realm of deprivation is the individual who is consummate in his viewsHe discerns as it has come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stressMonks there is a betweentheworlds space of impenetrable darkness and in the murk of that darkness not even the sun  moon so mighty so powerful can spread their lightWhen this was said a certain monk addressed the Blessed One What a great darkness lordWhat a very great darknessIs there another darkness greater  more fearsome than thatYes there isWhat darknessAny contemplatives or brahmans who do not discern as it has come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the

unexcelled right selfawakening The knowledge  vision arose in me Unprovoked is my releaseThis is the last birthThere is now no further becomingThe first noble truth is that of dukkha translated here as stress and sufferingThe term has a wide range of other meanings as well including distress disease and  what is probably its most elemental meaning  painPeople learn their most basic strategies for dealing with pain in very early childhood when their powers of observation are undeveloped and they cannot learn from the verbal lessons of othersBeing in such a stage they are in a poor position to understand pain and it often leaves them bewilderedThis means that they develop unskillful ways of handling itEven when their minds later develop verbal and higher logical skills many of the unskillful strategies and attitudes toward pain that they developed in early childhood persist on a subconscious levelOne of the most important insights leading up to the Buddhas Awakening was his realization that the act of comprehending pain lay at the essence of the spiritual questIn trying to comprehend pain  instead of simply trying to get rid of it in line with ones habitual tendencies  one learns many valuable lessonsTo begin with one can end any sense of bewilderment in the face of painIn seeing pain for what it truly is one can treat it more effectively and skillfully thus weakening the process by which pain and ignorance feed on each otherAt the same time as one learns to resist ones habitual reactions to pain one begins to delve into the nonverbal subconscious levels of the mind bringing to light many illformed and hidden processes of which one was previously unawareIn this sense pain is like a watering hole where all the animals in the forest  all the minds subconscious tendencies  will eventually come to drinkJust as a naturalist who wants to make a survey of the wildlife in a particular area can simply station himself near a watering hole to wait for the animals that will eventually have to come there for water in the same way a meditator who wants to understand the mind can simply keep watch right at pain in order to see what subconscious reactions will appearThus the act of trying to comprehend pain leads not only to an improved understanding of pain itself but also to an increased awareness of the most basic processes at work in the mindAs one sees how any lack of skill in these processes and in particular in ones reactions to pain leads only to more pain ones mind opens to the possibility that more skillful reactions will not only alleviate specific pains but also lead away from pain altogetherPassage  shows how conviction in this possibility  which is nothing other than the principle of kamma  leads from the experience of stress and pain into a causal chain that cuts the bewilderment leading to further pain and ends in total releaseAlthough pain is the best vantage point for observing the processes of the mind it is also the most difficult simply because it is so unpleasant and hard to bearThis is why discernment needs the faculties of conviction persistence mindfulness and concentration to give it the detached assurance and steady focus needed to stick with pain in and of itself in the phenomenological mode and not veer off into the usual narratives abstract theories and other unskillful defenses the mind devises against the painOnly through the development of the five faculties into right concentration does discernment have the basis of pleasure and equanimity needed to probe into pain without feeling threatened by it thus enabling it to arrive at an unbiased understanding of its true naturePassage  shows the direction this understanding should take ultimately analyzing the wide variety of stress and pain down to five categories the five clingingaggregatesMany of the remaining passages in this section give more detailed analysis of these categoriesTaken together these passages provide a useful conceptual framework for taking on the duty of trying to comprehend the issues surrounding stress suffering and painHere we will first discuss the aggregates and then their connection with clinging and sustenanceThe five aggregates are form feeling perception fabrications and consciousnessThese five categories cover the entire range of experience that can be adequately describedForm covers all physical phenomena both within ones own body and withoutThe remaining four categories cover all mental eventsFeeling covers feelings of pleasure pain and neitherpleasurenorpain regardless of whether they are based on physical or mental sensationsPerception denotes the mental act of applying labels or names to physical or mental eventsFabrications here covers the verbal and mental processes of concocting thoughts questions urges or intentions in the mindConsciousness covers the act of consciousness at any of the six senses eyes ears nose tongue body and intellectA few texts discuss a separate type of consciousness that does not partake of any of the six senses or their objectsThis type of consciousness is said to lie beyond the range of describable experience and so is not included under the five aggregatesIn fact it is equivalent to the Unfabricated and forms the goal at the end of the pathThe five aggregates on their own do not constitute suffering or stressThey are stressful only when functioning as objects of clingingsustenanceThis hybrid word  clingingsustenance  is a translation of the Pali term upadanaUpadana has a hybrid meaning because it is used to cover two sides of a physical process metaphorically applied to the mind the act of clinging whereby a fire takes sustenance from a piece of fuel together with the sustenance offered by the fuelOn the level of the mind upadana denotes both the act of clinging and the object clung to which together give sustenance to the process whereby mental pain arisesIn terms of this metaphor pain is hot and unstable like fire whereas the mental act of clinging to any of the five aggregates is what keeps the fire burningThese images are part fiof a larger complex of imagery contained in the Pali discourses likening the processes of pain and its cessation to the physical processes of fire and its extinguishingAn understanding of this imagery helps to give a graphic intuitive sense for the ways in which the Pali texts analyze the problem of stress and painMany of the texts explicitly liken pain to a fever or to a burning unstable fireOthers deal more in indirect imagery in which the terminology for explaining fire is applied to the mindThe word upadana is one instance of this type of indirect imageryOthers include khandha or aggregate which also means the trunk of a tree and nibbana the most common name for the Buddhist goal which also means the extinguishing of a fireAccording to the physics of the Buddhas time fire was seized when it was ignitedBurning it was in a state of unstable agitation entrapped by the fuel to which it clung for sustenanceOn going out it was freed Letting go of its sustenance it grew cool calm and unboundAccording to the commentaries unbound is what nibbana literally meansThus the study of pain is like the study of a raging fire one tries to comprehend it in order to find the source of the burning bondage and entrapment so as to put the fire out and gain freedom from it for goodThere are four types of clinging to the aggregates that give sustenance to the processes of suffering and stress desire and passion forMN makes the point that the act of clinging is neither the same as the aggregates nor entirely separate from themIf clinging were identical with the aggregates there would be no way to experience the aggregates without clinging and thus there would be no way for an awakened person to return to the conditioned level of experience after AwakeningIf clinging and the aggregates were totally separate clinging could exist independently of the aggregates and would count as a separate part of describable experienceIf this were so the transcending of the aggregates at the moment of Awakening would not constitute the transcending of the fabricated realm and thus the task of comprehending suffering would not yet be finishedThus the nature of the actual interdependence between clinging and the aggregates means that a full comprehension of the aggregates is enough to bring about Awakening at the same time that it leaves an opening for the continued experience of the fabricated realm after Awakening has occurredWhat this interdependence means in practical terms is that one must examine the aggregates in such a way as to realize fully that they are not worth clinging toOne does this by focusing on two of their common characteristics their instability and their complexityIn seeing their inherent instability one realizes that they are inconstantBecause they are inconstant any attempt to base happiness on them is inherently stressful just as there is inherent stress in trying to sit comfortably on a wobbling chairBecause the aggregates offer no basis for true happiness they lie beyond ones control and thus do not deserve to be viewed as me or mineFocusing further on the aggregates one perceives the complexity of their interrelationshipsPassage  indicates some of this complexity in its discussion of the relationship among feeling perception and sensory consciousnessAlthough these aggregates function in different ways in actual experience they can occur only as parts of an interrelated cluster of mental events surrounding a common objectIn fact they are so closely related to one another that ordinary awareness assumes them to be a single wholeOne of the tasks of discernment in comprehending pain is to see these aggregates as interrelated eventsBecause their interrelationships follow complex invariable laws ones comprehension of their true behavior brings with it the oppressive realization  oppressive as long as one is still regarding the causal network in part or in whole in terms of self or other  that they ultimately do not lie under ones controlAt best one can explore and manipulate them to the extent of understanding them to gain freedom from them but in and of themselves they do not offer any stable kind of happinessObserving and understanding the complex interrelationships among feeling perception and consciousness leads one into the area of dependent coarising which forms the essence of the second truthAs ones understanding grows more sensitive it drives home the point that all clinging to these interrelated phenomena should be abandonedThis understanding  that phenomena taking part in such relationships are unworthy of clinging  forms the essence of the pathThe full pursuit of this path in which one abandons all passion and desire for the five aggregates brings about knowledge of the cessation of stressAll of this bears out

the third noble truth is identical with the successful performance of the duty appropriate to the secondThus these two truths are best discussed togetherPassage  gives the short definition of the second noble truthNow what is the noble truth of the origination of stressThe craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now here  now there  ie craving for sensuality craving for becoming craving for nonbecomingCraving for sensuality here means the desire for sensual objectsCraving for becoming means the desire for the formation of states or realms of being that are not currently happening while craving for nonbecoming means the desire for the destruction or halting of any that arePassion and delight here is apparently a synonym for the desire and passion for the five aggregates that constitutes clingingsustenancePassage  also gives the short definition of the third noble truthAnd what is the noble truth of the cessation of stressThe remainderless fading  cessation renunciation relinquishment release  letting go of that very cravingThe extended passages that make up the remainder of  make the point that craving must be brought to cessation right at the objects where it arises ie by realizing that those objects are unworthy of cravingThe longer definitions of the second and third noble truths center on dependent coarising a detailed map of how craving arises and how it can be brought to cessation by undercutting its preconditionsThis map is the most complex teaching in the CanonIn a famous passage VenAnanda comments on how clear the doctrine of dependent coarising seems to him and the Buddha repliesDont say that AnandaDont say thatDeep is this dependent coarising and deep its appearanceIts because of not understanding  not penetrating this Dhamma that this generation is like a tangled skein a knotted ball of string like matted rushes  reeds and does not go beyond the cycle of the planes of deprivation woe  bad destinationsNevertheless although no explanations can be expected to give a full and final understanding of the process of dependent coarising they can provide tools that the meditator can use to probe the process in the course of training the mind and come to an understanding for him or herselfThe passages in this section help to provide that set of toolsA few general points about dependent coarising are important to understand before going into the detailsTo begin with dependent coarising is often presented in the texts as an expansion of the general principle of thisthat conditionality which we have already discussed in the IntroductionHere we will recapitulate some of the essential pointsThisthat conditionality is expressed in a simple formulaThis formula is nonlinear an interplay of linear and synchronic principlesThe linear principle  taking and as a pair  connects events over time the synchronic principle  and  connects objects and events in the present momentThe two principles intersect so that any given event is influenced by two sets of conditions those acting from the past and those acting from the presentBecause this is the pattern underlying dependent coarising it is a mistake to view dependent coarising simply as a chain of causes strung out over timeEvents in any one category of the list are affected not only by past events in the categories that act as their conditions but also by the ongoing interacting presence of whole streams of events in those categoriesAll categories can be present at once and even though two particular conditions may be separated by several steps in the list they can be immediately present to each otherThus they can create the possibility for unexpected feedback loops in the causal processFeeling for instance keeps reappearing at several stages in the process and ignorance can contribute to any causal link at any timeThe importance of these points will become clear when we examine how to disengage the causal network so as to realize the third noble truthBecause new input into the causal stream is possible at every moment the actual working out of thisthat conditionality and dependent coarising can be remarkably fluid and complexThis point is borne out by the imagery used in the Canon to illustrate these teachingsAlthough some noncanonical texts depict dependent coarising as a circle or a wheel of causes  implying something of a mechanical deterministic process  the Canon never uses that image at allInstead it likens dependent coarising to water flowing over land lakes overflow filling rivers which in turn fill the sea while the tides of the sea rise swelling the rivers which in turn swell the lakesThis imagery captures something of the flow of give and take among the factors of the processA more modern pattern that might be used to illustrate dependent coarising is the strange attractor an intricate interwoven pattern that chaos theory uses to describe complex fluid systems containing at least three feedback loopsAs we will see below the number of feedback loops in dependent coarising is far more than threeThe fluid complexity of dependent coarising means that it is inherently unstable and thus stressful and notselfAlthough some nonTheravadin Buddhist texts insist that happiness can be found by abandoning ones smaller separate identity and embracing the interconnected identity of all interdependent things this teaching cannot be found in the Pali CanonThe instability of conditioned processes means that they can never provide a dependable basis for happinessThe only true basis for happiness is the UnfabricatedThe Pali discourses are quite clear on the point that the fabricated and Unfabricated realms are radically separateIn MN the Buddha strongly criticizes a group of monks who tried to develop a theory whereby the fabricated was derived out of the Unfabricated or somehow lay within itStress he says is inherent in the interdependent nature of conditioned phenomena while the Unfabricated is totally free from stressStress could not possibly be produced by absolute freedom from stressBecause the nature of conditioning is such that causes are in turn influenced by their effects the Unfabricated could not itself function as a cause for anythingThe only way the Unfabricated can be experienced is by skillfully using fabricated conditioned processes to unravel the network of fabricated conditioned processes from withinTo do so one needs to know the individual factors of dependent coarising and the patterns in which they depend on one anotherThese factors come down to the five aggregatesIn fact the entire pattern of dependent coarising is a map showing how the different aggregates group disband and regroup in one anothers presence in a variety of configurations giving rise to stress and to the cosmos at largeAs we have mentioned earlier one of the most basic features of the Buddhas teachings is his confirmation that the knowable cosmos composed of old kamma is made up of the same factors that make up the personality and that the interaction of the aggregates as immediately present to awareness in the here and now is the same process that underlies the functioning of the knowable cosmos as a wholeAs a result the descriptions of dependent coarising slip easily back and forth between two time scales  events in the present moment and events over the vast cycle of timeIt is important to remember though that the Buddha discovered this principle by observing events in the immediate present which is where the individual meditator will have to discover them as wellThus the practice takes the same approach as phenomenology exploring the processes of conditioning from the inside as they are immediately experienced in the present momentThis is why the pattern of dependent coarising lists factors of consciousness  such as ignorance attention and intention  as prior conditions for the experience of the physical world for if we take as our frame of reference the world as it is directly experienced  rather than a world conceived somehow as separate from our experience of it  we have to see the processes of the mind as prior to the objects they processReferences in the texts to the larger frame of space and time provide examples to illustrate particularly subtle points in the immediate present and serve as reminders that the pattern of events observed in the present moment has implications that cover the entire cosmosGiven the fluid complex nature of the basic causal principle it should come as no surprise that the Canon contains several variations on the list of basic factors and configurations in dependent coarisingLike the seven sets in the Wings to Awakening these different lists offer the meditator a variety of ways to approach the complexities of the causal stream and to gain a handle on mastering themThe most basic list is found in  and  which give the factors  starting with the stress of aging and death and then working backwards  as followsAging and death require birthIf there were no birth there would be nothing to set in motion the processes of aging and deathHere and in the following causal links birth aging and death denote not only the arising decay and passing away of the body but also the repeated arising decay and passing away of mental states momentbymoment in the presentIn fact during the third watch on the night of his Awakening the Buddha probably focused on present mental states as his primary examples of birth aging and deathFrom them he gained insight into how these processes functioned in the cosmos as a wholeBirth depends on becomingIf there were no comingintobeing of a sensual realm a realm of form or a formless realm there would be no locus for rebirthAgain these realms refer not only to levels of being on the cosmic scale but also to levels of mental statesSome mental states are concerned with sensual images others with forms and still others with formless dimensions such as the formless jhanasThe relationship between birth and becoming can be compared to the process of falling asleep and dreamingAs drowsiness makes the mind lose contact with waking reality a dream image of another place and time will appear in itThe appearance of this image is called becomingThe act of entering into this image and taking on a role or identity within it  and thus entering the world of the dream and falling asleep  is birthThe commentaries maintain that precisely the same process is what enables rebirth to follow the death of the bodyAt the same time the analogy between falling asleep and taking birth explains why release from the cycle of becoming is called AwakeningBecoming requires clingingsustenanceThe image here is of a fire staying in existence by appropriating sustenance in the act of clinging to its fuelThe process of becoming takes its sustenance from the five aggregates while the act of taking sustenance is to cling to these aggregates in any of four forms of passion and delight mentioned in IIIHii sensual intentions views habits and practices or theories about the selfWithout these types of clinging the realms of sensuality form and formlessness would not come into beingClingingsustenance requires cravingIf one did not thirst for sensuality for becoming or for nonbecoming then the process would not appropriate fuelCraving requires feelingIf there were no experience of pleasant painful or neitherpleasantnorpainful feelings one would not thirst for continuing experience of the pleasant or for cessation of the unpleasantFeeling requires contactWithout contact there would be no feelings of pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpainContact requires

birth there would be nothing to activate an experience of the aggregatesConsciousness of the six sense fields requires nameandformWithout nameandform there would be no object for this type of consciousnessIn  VenSariputta points out that the entire process of dependent coarising relies on the mutual dependency of nameandform on the one hand and sensory consciousness on the otherThis mutual dependency is actually composed of many feedback loops which can get quite complexIf either of the two factors is pulled away from the other the whole edifice falls downFor this reason as we shall see when we discuss the cessation of stress this mutual dependency is one of the primary points for focusing attention in disbanding the causal processOther lists of the factors in dependent coarising expand on this basic listThe most common list adds the factors of the six sense fields between contact and nameandform and then states that sensory consciousness requires the three types of fabrication  bodily verbal and mental  while these fabrications in turn require ignorance of the four noble truthsThere is some disagreement over the meaning of the three types of fabrication in this listOne passage in the Canon which seems to treat fabrications as they are immediately experienced in the present defines bodily fabrication as the breath verbal fabrication as directed thought and evaluation and mental fabrication as feeling and perceptionOther passages which seem to regard fabrications as they function over time simply class these three types of fabrication as to whether they are meritorious demeritorious or imperturbableIf we regard these two definitions as typical of the dual time frame of dependent coarising there is no conflict between themAnother point of disagreement is over the question of how the factors of fabrication and ignorance came to be added to the basic listSome scholars maintain that this was the result of a temporal development in the Buddhas teachings either during his lifetime or after his passing awayHowever if we examine the content of the added factors we find that they are simply an elaboration of the mutual dependence between nameandform and sensory consciousness and do not add anything substantially new to the listThe three fabrications are simply another way of presenting nameandform in their active role as shapers of consciousnessBodily fabrication the breath is the active element of form verbal fabrications directed thought and evaluation are the active element in the attention and intention subfactors of name while mental fabrications feeling and perception are identical with the feeling and perception under name Ignorance on the other hand is the type of consciousness that actively promotes inappropriate questioning in the verbal fabrication of evaluation which in turn can lead to inappropriate attention in the factor of nameandformIt may seem redundant to have the factors of nameandform on the one hand and fabrications on the other covering the same territory in two different configurations but these configurations serve at least two practical purposesFirst the connection between ignorance and inappropriate questioning helps to pinpoint precisely what is wrong in the typical relationship between nameandform and consciousnessAs one modern teacher has put it the verbal fabrications are the ones to watch out forSecond the relationship between verbal fabrications on the one hand and attention and intention on the other mediated by consciousness diagrams the doubletiered relationships among mental events as they breed and feed on one another in the presence of consciousnessIn the course of giving rise to suffering and stress this incestuous interbreeding can fly out of hand leading to many complex and intense patterns of sufferingHowever its doubletiered quality can also be used  as we will see below  to help bring that suffering to an endPassage  adds yet another factor to the list pointing out another way of looking at the mutually dependent relationships that feed the process of dependent coarising ignorance requires the effluents of sensuality becoming views and ignorance while these effluents in turn require ignorance of the four noble truthsThese added factors point to one of the ways in which the process of dependent coarising is selfsustainingSensuality and views are forms of clingingsustenance while becoming is a result of clingingsustenanceIgnorance as an effluent is nowhere defined in the discourses to differentiate it from simple ignorance and in fact the distinction may simply be one of role with both forms of ignorance denoting a state of awareness out of touch with the four noble truthsWhen ignorance is entwined with the feelings that result from contact it forms the requisite condition for clingingsustenance and becoming together all of these factors act as impulses that flow out of the process and then return to reinforce the ignorance that provides the requisite condition for fabrications consciousness and nameandform thus fueling another round in the process leading to further becoming and stressThe selfsustaining nature of dependent coarising makes it easy to see why many noncanonical texts explain it as a wheelHowever the many openings for feedback loops among the various factors  creating smaller cycles within the larger cycle  make the process exceedingly complexThis explains why stress and suffering are so bewilderingIf they were a simple cycle there would be little or no variety to the sufferings of living beings and the process of suffering would be easy for everyone to predict and understandSome of the feedback loops that make stress so complex are explicitly mentioned in the textsOthers are implicit in the fact that particular factors  such as feeling and contact  keep reappearing at different points of the process of dependent coarisingFeeling is perhaps the most important of theseThe stress that forms the final factor of dependent coarising can be experienced as a feeling which can then reenter the causal stream at the factor of fabrications nameandform or at feeling itselfIf it reenters at feeling it would then directly condition further craving which in turn would create a positive feedback loop leading to increased stress and painOn the other hand if the stress reenters the stream at nameandform it could be subjected either to unskillful intentions and inappropriate attention or to skillful intentions and appropriate attentionThe former pair would simply aggravate the stress and pain whereas the latter pair would weaken the tendency to craving and thus act as a negative feedback loop alleviating the conditions that would lead to further stress and pain or eliminating them altogetherThis shows that these feedback loops instead of being a mere curiosity in the formal structure of dependent coarising actually help to explain the wide variations in the way living beings experience stressThey also help explain the possibility of the cessation of stressThe elements of contact intention and attention under the factor of name are especially important in opening up this latter possibilityAs we noted in IA this is the factor of dependent coarising that intersects with the teachings on kamma and skillfulnessContact  here apparently meaning contact with consciousness  forms the precondition for kammaIntention lies at the essence of the kamma that keeps the cycle of rebirth in motionThrough appropriate attention  the right way of looking at things and focusing on appropriate questions about them  kamma can be trained to be skillful and thus lead away from stress rather than toward itFor this reason any feedback loop that does not pass through the factor of nameandform will tend simply to continue the problem of stress and pain whereas any loop that does lead through this factor allows for the possibility for using appropriate attention to weaken the process or disband it entirelyIn feeding the loops of dependent coarising through the factor of nameandform the factor of fabrication plays an especially important roleAs we have noted in IIIE the practice of jhāna focused on the breath gathers all three forms of fabrication  bodily verbal and mental  into a single wholeIn doing so it takes all the aggregates that play a variety of roles in the pattern of dependent coarising and gathers them into a configuration where appropriate attention can conveniently focus on all their interactions at onceTo express this in terms of the four noble truths it takes the aggregates that make up the first noble truth and gives them a role in the fourthIn this way the doubletiered relationship mentioned above  between nameandform on the one hand and fabrications on the other  can be put to use in disbanding rather than compounding the causal network leading to suffering and stressIn terms of meditation practice this doubletiered relationship corresponds to the five factors of noble right concentrationThe three types of fabrication cover the same ground as the four levels of jhāna while the subfactor of attention under name forms a separate tier of mental activity that allows one to monitor ones practice of jhāna and to develop it as a skillAs the process of developing skill becomes more and more refined this tier of attention turns into the fifth reflective level of noble concentration that allows one to analyze the state of jhāna while it is present and thus to develop a sharpened discernment of its fabricated natureAs passage  shows one begins to see that jhāna is composed not only of such fabrication subfactors as directed thought evaluation feeling and perception but also of sensory consciousness and such name factors as attention intention and contactIn other words the boundary line between the different tiers of mental activity begins to break downThis allows for the conflation of discernment and concentration noted in IIH and IIIH in which concentrated discernment begins to take its own workings as its objectAs discernment in the role of object shortcircuits with discernment in the role of approach then contact between the factors of nameandform on the one hand and sensory consciousness on the other ceases in a state of clear knowingIn the image of VenSariputta one of the two sheaves of reeds is pulled away and the entire edifice of suffering based on them comes tumbling downAnother crucial point to note in understanding how to disband the workings of dependent coarising is that the relationships between particular factors and their neighbors in the list are not all the sameIn some cases factor x is a sufficient cause for factor yWhat this means is that whenever x occurs y will always have to followAn example is the relationship between contact and feeling or between clinging and the remaining factors leading up to stressWhenever there is contact in the presence of consciousness there will have to be feelingWhenever there is clinging there will have to be becoming and stressThus it is impossible to cut the process at these linksHowever there are other cases where x is a necessary cause but not a sufficient one for yIn other words x has to be present for y to occur but y does not have to follow every time there is xExamples would include the link between consciousness and nameandform between feeling and craving and between craving and clingingIn each of these cases there has to be an added factor  the presence of ignorance the most subtle and basic of the roots of unskillfulness  for x to give rise to yThis fact is what opens the way for appropriate attention to bring about the end of suffering and stressAt the same time it determines precisely what that way must beAn analysis of how this happens will reveal in a nutshell the convergence of many of the themes of this book the role of the three levels of framesofreference practice and by extension the three levels in the development of concentration and discernment the way in which the principles of thisthat conditionality and skillfulness apply to the practice and the way in which the duties appropriate to the four noble truths  comprehending stress abandoning its origination realizing its cessation and developing the path  in practice are oneThe nutshell is this If each factor in dependent coarising were a sufficient cause for the following factor the pattern would be absolutely deterministic and there would be no way outHowever in cases where the link between x and y is necessary but not sufficient then in terms of thisthat conditionality the x factor is input from the past  even if only a splitsecond past  whereas ignorance is the input from the present needed to give rise to yThus the strategy of the practice must be to use appropriate attention to eliminate ignorance in the presence of xTo do this one must focus on comprehending the aggregate that functions as x  or in the case of the cravingclinging link that functions as the potential object of xAt first this means learning to focus on the aggregate in and of itselfThen to overcome the unskillfulness inherent in ignorance one must gain practical familiarity with the aggregate in its role as a factor in the skillful practice of jhānaAs this approach attains a state of mastery one focuses ones powers of discernment on the how of the approach to the practice taking it as the what or object of investigation until one can see the aggregate even in this role in terms of the four noble truthsThe more precise and comprehensive this knowing the less craving is produced the less craving produced the fewer the effluents that cloud ones knowingWith the culmination of totally clear knowing ignorance is totally wiped out together with its attendant craving and thus the present input that maintained the cycle is endedThis achieves a point of resonance the point of nonfashioning at which the cycle breaks down and where stress and suffering ceaseModern practice traditions differ as to which links in dependent coarising they focus on in order to bring about the cessation of craving and thus realize the third noble truthFor the purposes of this essay we will discuss three of these links as they relate to the three different lists of factors mentioned aboveThese different points of focus are best regarded as alternative options for tackling the problem of stress and its cessationAll are equally valid and so it is up to the individual meditator to choose whichever focus seems most congenial and comprehensible and to follow it throughThe first list of the factors of dependent coarising which takes the process down to the mutual dependence of consciousness and nameandform emphasizes precisely that link how nameandform depends on consciousness and how consciousness relates to nameandformPassage  treats this point in detail using the term fabrication to cover attention intention and contactIn practical terms this approach focuses on the question of how consciousness relates to its objects making use of skillful intention and appropriate attention as the approach to help peel away any sense of passion or desire for nameandformOnce the more blatant forms of passion and desire have been eliminated this approach then peels away passion and desire even for the approach of skillful intentions and appropriate attention themselvesConsciousness  thus deprived of its support in nameandform either in terms of objects or approaches  has no basis for proliferation and so is releasedPassages related to this perspective on Awakening include  andAs for the second list which traces the pattern of dependent coarising down to fabrication and ignorance we have already noted that this is simply an explanation of a particular type of relationship between consciousness and nameandformWe have also noted that all three types of fabrication in their present aspect are brought together in the experience of jhāna based on the breathThus the question here is how to master jhāna to the point where one can step back in the fifth factor of fivefactored noble concentration so as to overcome ones ignorance of the willed and fabricated nature of jhāna or of any views and assumptions  based on inappropriate attention  that might underlie the attainment of jhānaWith the cessation of ignorance there is nothing willed or fabricated to form a station of consciousnessAt this point of nonfashioning  where there is no sense of ones doing anything or of anyone elses doing anything  nothing is created for the sake of further becoming or nonbecomingAs a result consciousness is releasedPassages related to this perspective on Awakening include In the third list of dependent coarising which traces the pattern to the mutual dependence of ignorance and the effluents the focus is on the acts of clingingsustenance and the resultant states of becoming that conditioned by ignorance breed more ignoranceThe difficulty in focusing on becoming is that its apparent opposite nonbecoming  the destruction of what has come to be  can also act as an object of craving leading to further becomingThus the question is how to focus on the drawbacks of sensuality and becoming without falling into the reverse trap of willing nonbecomingAs  shows this requires seeing the drawbacks of all willed states regardless of whether the will is aimed at proliferation or destructionOnce the mind has abandoned all such states the only alternative left open is the equipoise of nonfashioning the threshold to the UnfabricatedPassages related to this perspective on Awakening include Although these three points of focus differ in emphasis in essence they come down to different aspects of the same approachIn every case one must use skillful intentions and appropriate attention to undercut craving and ignorance regarding the five aggregates so that no fabrications will be activated for the sake of further becomingThis lack of activation  the moment of nonfashioning  releases consciousness from the aggregates both in their role as objects of consciousness and in their role as the intention and attention that served as the approaches to releaseThe differences among the points of focus lie primarily in the questions they ask in framing a view of the problem at handIn this we see the true function of the teaching of dependent coarising in practice as a guide to appropriate attentionNot only does the teaching provide a direct way of viewing experience that avoids useless questions of being and nonbeing self and other it also gives a framework for inspiring alternative ways of asking appropriate questions about the crucial junctures in the conditioned flow of phenomena in and of themselvesAs with all of the Buddhas teachings once the processes of discernment inspired by the teaching of dependent coarising have fully performed their function the teaching itself is transcended in the release of consciousnessOnce consciousness is released from the objects that bring sensory consciousness into play all that remains is consciousness without feature without end luminous all aroundThis consciousness  which lies beyond the extent to which there are means of designation expression  description the extent to which the sphere of discernment extends the extent to which the cycle revolves for the manifesting of this cosmos  is the experience of the goalThere is some question as to whether the goal can be equated with the third noble truthSome passages in the Canon would seem to indicate yes others noThis contradiction can be resolved by noting that the full realization of the third noble truth and the experience of the goal are two different things so intimately related that the one cannot be experienced without the otherTheir relationship can be compared to noticing a longoverlooked valuable in the course of cleaning ones yardThe act of cleaning is not the same as the valuable but only in the course of doing the former thoroughly and attentively can the latter be foundAs one modern teacher has said the fact that the third noble truth involves a duty means that it is part of fabricated reality whereas the goal at the end of the path is absolutely unfabricatedFree from all acting and doing it pertains to an entirely different dimension and thus  although found along with the truth of cessation  it is something utterly beyond and unboundFrom the time of Awakening to that of death there remains a sense of dissociated contact between the inner and outer sense media that comprise the Awakened Ones old kamma and hisher only remaining experience of the stress inherent in the dimensions of time and the present contact in that there is sensitivity to pain and pleasure in these things dissociated in that the passion and delight the fetters defilements and attachments in between the inner and outer sense media are totally severed by discernmentOld kamma thus runs through the pattern of dependent coarising from nameandform and consciousness up through feeling but  without the fashioning factors of ignorance and craving  the feeling of pain and pleasure does not feed back into any causal patterns that would lead to further becoming or any renewed kammaThe texts liken this state to a fire that has gone out but whose embers are still glowing and warmEventually old kamma runs out at the death of the Awakened One and there is a total Unbinding like that of a fire so completely released from its fuel that the embers have grown thoroughly coldAlthough this analogy may sound negative in terms of modern ideas about the workings of fire in the Buddhas time it was recognized as an image not of extinction or annihilation but of freedom so unlimited and irreversible that it cannot be describedGandhabhaka It would be good lord if the Blessed One would teach me the origination  ending of stressThe Buddha If I were to teach you the origination  ending of stress with reference to the past saying Thus it was in the past you would be doubtful and perplexedIf I were to teach you the origination  ending of stress with reference to the future saying Thus it will be in the future you would be doubtful and perplexedSo instead I  sitting right here  will teach you sitting right there the origination  ending of stressListen  pay close attentionI will speakGandhabhaka As you say lordThe Buddha Now what do you thinkAre there any people in Uruvelakappa who if they were murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would cause sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair to arise in youGandhabhaka Yes there areThe Buddha And are there any people in Uruvelakappa who if they were murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would cause no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair to arise in youGandhabhaka Yes there areThe Buddha Now what is the cause what is the reason why the murder of some would cause you sorrow and the murder of others would cause you no sorrowGandhabhaka Those whose murder would cause me sorrow are those for whom I feel desire  passionThose whose murder would cause me no sorrow are those for whom I feel no desire or passionThe Buddha Now from what you have realized attained fathomed right now in the present without regard to time you may draw an inference with regard to the past and future Whatever stress in arising arose for me in the past all of it had desire as its root had desire as its cause for desire is the cause of stressAnd whatever stress in arising will arise for me in the future all of it will have desire as the root will have desire as its cause  for desire is the cause of stressGandhabhaka Amazing lordAstoundingHow well the Blessed One has put it Whatever stress in arising arose for me in the past all of it had desire as its root had desire as its cause for desire is the cause of stressAnd whatever stress in arising will arise for me in the future all of it will have desire as the root will have desire as its cause for desire is the cause of stressI have a son lord named Cīravāsin who lives far away from hereWhen I get up in the morning I send a man saying Go learn how Cīravāsin is doing And as long as that man has not returned I am simply beside myself Dont let Cīravāsin be sickThe Buddha Now what do you thinkIf Cīravāsin were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would you feel sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairGandhabhaka If my son Cīravāsin were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured my very life would be alteredSo how could I not feel sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairThe BuddhaAnd what do you thinkBefore you had seen or heard of Cīravāsins mother did you feel desire passion or love for herGandhabhaka No lordThe Buddha And after you had seen or heard of Cīravāsins mother did you feel desire passion or love for herGandhabhaka Yes lordThe Buddha Now what do you thinkIf Cīravāsins mother were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would you feel sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairGandhabhaka If Cīravāsins mother were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured my very life would be alteredSo how could I not feel sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairThe Buddha Thus by this line of reasoning it may be realized how stress when arising arises All of it has desire as its root has desire as its cause  for desire is the cause of stressCraving  Its CessationNow what is the noble truth of the origination of

resultsNow there is both this body and external nameformHere in dependence on this duality there is contact at the six sensesTouched by these or one or another of them the wise person is sensitive to pleasure  painNow what is the difference here between the wise person  the foolIn the wise person that ignorance has been abandoned and that craving has been destroyedWhy is thatThe wise person has practiced the holy life for the right ending of stressTherefore at the breakup of the body he is not headed for a bodyNot headed for a body he is entirely freed from birth aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairI tell you he is entirely freed from stressBecomingnanda This word becoming becoming  to what extent is there becomingThe Buddha If there were no kamma ripening in the property of sensuality would sensual becoming be discernednanda No lordThe Buddha Thus kamma is the field consciousness the seed and craving the moistureThe consciousness of living beings hindered by ignorance  fettered by craving is established in a lower propertyThus there is the production of renewed becoming in the futureIf there were no kamma ripening in the property of form would form becoming be discernednanda No lordThe Buddha Thus kamma is the field consciousness the seed and craving the moistureThe consciousness of living beings hindered by ignorance  fettered by craving is established in a middling propertyThus there is the production of renewed becoming in the futureIf there were no kamma ripening in the property of formlessness would formless becoming be discernednanda No lordThe Buddha Thus kamma is the field consciousness the seed and craving the moistureThe consciousness of living beings hindered by ignorance  fettered by craving is established in a refined propertyThus there is the production of renewed becoming in the futureThis is how there is becomingI have heard that on one occasion when the Blessed One was newly Awakened  living at Uruvelā by the banks of the Nerañjarā River in the shade of the Bodhi tree the tree of Awakening  he sat in the shade of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of releaseAt the end of seven days after emerging from that concentration he surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened OneAs he did so he saw living beings burning with the many fevers and aflame with the many fires born of passion aversion  delusionThen on realizing the significance of that he on that occasion exclaimedWhatever contemplatives or brahmans say that liberation from becoming is by means of becoming all of them are not released from becoming I sayAnd whatever contemplatives or brahmans say that escape from becoming is by means of nonbecoming all of them have not escaped from becoming I sayOvercome by two viewpoints some human  divine beings adhere other human  divine beings slip right past while those with vision seeAnd how do some adhereHuman  divine beings delight in becoming enjoy becoming are satisfied with becomingWhen the Dhamma is being taught for the sake of the cessation of becoming their minds do not take to it are not calmed by it do not settle on it or become resolved on itThis is how some adhereAnd how do some slip right pastSome feeling horrified humiliated  disgusted with that very becoming delight in nonbecoming When this self at the breakup of the body after death perishes  is destroyed and does not exist after death that is peaceful that is exquisite that is sufficiency This is how some slip right pastAnd how do those with vision seeThere is the case where a monk sees whats come to be as whats come to beSeeing this he practices for disenchantment with whats come to be dispassion for whats come to be and the cessation of whats come to beThis is how those with vision seeFabricationsVisākha And what lady are bodily fabrications what are verbal fabrications what are mental fabricationsSister Dhammadinnā Inout breathing is bodily bound up with the body therefore is it called a bodily fabricationHaving directed ones thought and evaluated one breaks into speechTherefore directed thought  evaluation are called verbal fabricationsPerception  feeling are mental bound up with the mindTherefore perception  feeling are called mental fabricationsWhen there is a body pleasure  pain arise internally with bodily intention as the cause or when there is speech pleasure  pain arise internally with verbal intention as the cause or when there is intellect pleasure  pain arise internally with intellectual intention as the causeFrom ignorance as a requisite condition then either of ones own accord one fabricates the bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure  pain arise internally or because of others one fabricates the bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure  pain arise internallyWith alertness or without alertness one fabricates the bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure  pain arise internallyNow ignorance is bound up in these thingsFrom the remainderless fading  cessation of that very ignorance there no longer exists the body the speech the intellect on account of which that pleasure  pain internally ariseThere no longer exists the field the site the dimension or the issue on account of which that pleasure  pain internally ariseIf a person immersed in ignorance fabricates a meritorious fabrication his consciousness goes on to meritIf he fabricates a demeritorious fabrication his consciousness goes on to demeritIf he fabricates an imperturbable fabrication his consciousness goes on to the imperturbableWhen ignorance is abandoned by a monk clear knowing arisesFrom the fading of ignorance and the arising of knowledge he neither fabricates a meritorious fabrication nor a demeritorious fabrication nor an imperturbable fabricationNeither fabricating nor willing he is not sustained by anything in the worldUnsustained he is not agitatedUnagitated he is totally unbound right withinHe discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldSensing a feeling of pleasure he discerns that it is fleeting not grasped at not relishedSensing a feeling of pain Sensing a feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain he discerns that it is fleeting not grasped at not relishedSensing a feeling of pleasure he senses it disjoined from itSensing a feeling of pain Sensing a feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain he senses it disjoined from itWhen sensing a feeling limited to the body he discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to the body When sensing a feeling limited to life he discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to life He discerns that With the breakup of the body after the termination of life all that is experienced not being relished will grow cold right here while the corpse will remainJust as if a man having removed a heated jar from a kiln were to place it on level ground any heat in the jar would subside right there while the fired clay would remainIn the same way when sensing a feeling limited to the body he discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to the body When sensing a feeling limited to life he discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to life He discerns that With the breakup of the body after the termination of life all that is experienced not being relished will grow cold right here while the corpse will remainWhat do you think monksWould a monk whose effluents were ended fabricate a meritorious or a demeritorious or an imperturbable fabricationWith the total nonexistence of fabrications from the cessation of fabrications would consciousness be discernibleWith the total nonexistence of birth from the cessation of birth would agingdeath be discernibleVery good monksJust so should you construe itJust so should you be convincedJust so should you believeDo not be doubtful do not be uncertainThis just this is the end of stressWhat is willed what is arranged and what is obsessed over this is a support for the stationing of consciousnessThere being a support there is a landing of consciousnessWhen that consciousness lands and grows there is the production of renewed becoming in the futureWhen there is the production of renewed becoming in the future there is future birth agingdeath sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairSuch is the origination of this entire mass of stressIf nothing is willed if nothing is arranged but something is obsessed over This is a support for the stationing of consciousness Such is the origination of this entire mass of stressBut when nothing is willed arranged or obsessed over there is no support for the stationing of consciousnessThere being no support there is no landing of consciousnessWhen that consciousness does not land  grow there is no production of renewed becoming in the futureWhen there is no production of renewed becoming in the future there is no future birth agingdeath sorrow lamentation pain distress or despairSuch is the cessation of this entire mass of stressSāriputta Now what is ignorance what is the origination of ignorance what is the cessation of ignorance and what is the way of practice leading to the cessation of ignoranceNot knowing in terms of stress not knowing in terms of the origination of stress not knowing in terms of the cessation of stress not knowing in terms of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress this is called ignoranceFrom the origination of effluents comes the origination of ignoranceFrom the cessation of effluents comes the cessation of ignoranceAnd just this noble eightfold path is the way of practice leading to the cessation of ignoranceNow when a disciple of the noble ones discerns ignorance in this way discerns the origination of ignorance in this way discerns the cessation of ignorance in this way  discerns the way of practice leading to the cessation of ignorance in this way when  having entirely abandoned passionobsession having abolished irritationobsession having uprooted the viewconceit obsession I am having abandoned ignorance having given rise to clear knowing  he has put an end to stress in the here  now then it is to this extent that the disciple of the noble ones is a person of right view one whose view is made straight who is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma and who has arrived at this true DhammaNow what are effluents what is the origination of effluents what is the cessation of effluents and what is the way of practice leading to the cessation of effluentsThese three are effluents the effluent of sensuality the effluent of becoming the effluent of ignoranceFrom the origination of ignorance comes the origination of effluentsFrom the cessation of ignorance comes the cessation of effluentsAnd just this noble eightfold path is the way of practice leading to the cessation of effluentsNow when a disciple of the noble ones discerns the effluents in this way discerns the origination of effluents in this way discerns the cessation of effluents in this way  discerns the way of practice leading to the cessation of effluents in this way when  having entirely abandoned passionobsession having abolished irritation obsession having uprooted the viewconceit obsession I am having abandoned ignorance having given rise to clear knowing  he has put an end to stress in the here  now then it is to this extent that the disciple of the noble ones is a person of right view one whose view is made straight who is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma and who has arrived at this true DhammaVenMahā Koṭṭhita Now tell me Sāriputta my friend Is agingdeath selfmade or othermade or both selfmade  othermade or  without selfmaking or othermaking  spontaneously arisenVenSāriputta Its not the case Koṭṭhita my friend that agingdeath is selfmade that it is othermade that it is both selfmade  othermade or that  without selfmaking or othermaking  its spontaneously arisenHowever from birth as a requisite condition comes agingdeathVenMahā Koṭṭhita Now tell me Is nameform selfmade or othermade or both selfmade  othermade or  without selfmaking or othermaking  spontaneously arisenVenSāriputta Its not the case that nameform is selfmade that it is othermade that it is both selfmade  othermade or that  without selfmaking or othermaking  its

selfmaking or othermaking spontaneously arisenVenSāriputta Its not the case that consciousness is selfmade that it is othermade that it is both selfmade  othermade or that  without selfmaking or othermaking  its spontaneously arisenHowever from nameform as a requisite condition comes consciousnessVenMahā Koṭṭhita Just now I understood what you said as from consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform from nameform as a requisite condition comes consciousnessNow how is the meaning of what you said to be understoodVenSāriputta Very well then my friend I will give you an analogy for there are cases where it is through the use of an analogy that intelligent people can understand the meaning of what is being saidIts as if two sheaves of reeds stood leaning against one anotherIn the same way from nameform as a requisite condition comes consciousness from consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameformFrom nameform as a requisite condition come the six sense media Thus is the origination of this entire mass of stressIf one were to pull away one of those sheaves of reeds the other would fall if one were to pull away the other the first one would fallIn the same way from the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of consciousness from the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameformFrom the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of the six sense media Thus is the cessation of this entire mass of stressThe Buddha From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications From birth as a requisite condition then old age  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair come into playSuch is the origination of this entire mass of stress  sufferingWhen this was said a certain monk said to the Blessed One Which agingdeath lordAnd whose is this agingdeathNot a valid question the Blessed One saidIf one were to ask Which agingdeathAnd whose is this agingdeath and if one were to ask Is agingdeath one thing and is this the agingdeath of someonesomething else both of them would have the same meaning even though their words would differWhen there is the view that the soul is the same as the body there isnt the leading of the holy lifeAnd when there is the view that the soul is one thing and the body another there isnt the leading of the holy lifeAvoiding these two extremes the Tathāgata points out the Dhamma in between From birth as a requisite condition comes agingdeathWhich birth lordAnd whose is this birthNot a valid question the Blessed One saidAvoiding these two extremes the Tathāgata points out the Dhamma in between From ignorance as requisite condition come fabricationsNow from the remainderless fading  cessation of that very ignorance every one of these writhings  wrigglings  wigglings  Which agingdeathAnd whose is this agingdeath or Is agingdeath one thing and is this the agingdeath of someonesomething else or The soul is the same as the body or The soul is one thing and the body another  are abandoned their root destroyed like an uprooted palm tree deprived of the conditions of existence not destined for future arisingVennanda Its amazing lord its astounding how deep this dependent coarising is  how deep its appearance and yet to me it seems as clear as clear can beThe Buddha Dont say that nandaDont say thatDeep is this dependent coarising and deep its appearanceIts because of not understanding  not penetrating this Dhamma that this generation is like a tangled skein a knotted ball of string like matted rushes  reeds and does not go beyond the cycle of the planes of deprivation woe  bad destinationsFrom birth as a requisite condition comes agingdeath Thus it has been saidAnd this is the way to understand how from birth as a requisite condition comes agingdeathIf there were no birth at all in any way of anything anywhere in the utter absence of birth from the cessation of birth would agingdeath be discernedVennanda No lordThe Buddha Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for agingdeath ie birthFrom nameform as a requisite condition comes contactThus it has been saidAnd this is the way to understand how from nameform as a requisite condition comes contactIf the qualities traits themes  indicators by which there is a description of namegroup were all absent would designationcontact with regard to the formgroup be discernedVennanda No lordThe Buddha If the permutations signs themes  indicators by which there is a description of formgroup were all absent would resistancecontact with regard to the namegroup be discernedVennanda No lordThe Buddha If the permutations signs themes  indicators by which there is a description of namegroup  formgroup were all absent would designationcontact or resistancecontact be discernedVennanda No lordThe Buddha Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for contact ie nameformFrom consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform Thus it has been saidAnd this is the way to understand how from consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameformIf consciousness were not to descend into the mothers womb would nameform take shape in the wombVennanda No lordThe Buddha If after descending into the womb consciousness were to depart would nameform be produced for this worldVennanda No lordThe Buddha If the consciousness of the young boy or girl were to be cut off would nameform ripen grow  reach maturityVennanda No lordThe Buddha Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for nameform ie consciousnessFrom nameform as a requisite condition comes consciousness Thus it has been saidAnd this is the way to understand how from nameform as a requisite condition comes consciousnessIf consciousness were not to gain a foothold in nameform would a comingintoplay of the origination of birth aging death  stress in the future be discernedVennanda No lordThe Buddha Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for consciousness ie nameformThis is the extent to which there is birth aging death passing away  rearisingThis is the extent to which there are means of designation expression  descriptionThis is the extent to which the sphere of discernment extends the extent to which the cycle revolves for the manifesting of this world  ie nameform together with consciousnessIts in dependence on a pair that consciousness comes into playAnd how does consciousness come into play in dependence on a pairIn dependence on the eye  forms there arises eyeconsciousnessThe eye is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwiseForms are inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwiseThus this pair is both fleeting  unsettled  inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwiseEyeconsciousness is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwiseWhatever is the cause the requisite condition for the arising of eyeconsciousness that is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwiseHaving arisen in dependence on an inconstant factor how could eyeconsciousness be constantOne attached is unreleased one unattached is releasedShould consciousness when taking a stance stand attached to form supported by form established on form watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferationShould consciousness when taking a stance stand attached to feeling to perception to fabrications it would exhibit growth increase  proliferationWere someone to say I will describe a coming a going a passing away an arising a growth an increase or a proliferation of consciousness apart from form from feeling from perception from fabrications that would be impossibleIf a monk abandons passion for the property of form feeling perception fabrications consciousness then owing to the abandoning of passion the support is cut off and there is no base for consciousnessConsciousness thus unestablished  not proliferating not performing any function  is releasedOwing to its release it is steadyOwing to its steadiness it is contentedOwing to its contentment it is not agitatedNot agitated he is totally unbound right withinHe discerns Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThere are these four nutriments for the establishing of beings who have taken birth or for the support of those in search of a place to be bornWhich fourPhysical food gross or refined contact as the second consciousness the third and intellectual intention the fourthThese are the four nutriments for the establishing of beings or for the support of those in search of a place to be bornWhere there is passion delight  craving for the nutriment of physical food consciousness lands there and growsWhere consciousness lands and grows nameform alightsWhere nameform alights there is the growth of fabricationsWhere there is the growth of fabrications there is the production of renewed becoming in the futureWhere there is the production of renewed becoming in the future there is future birth aging  death together I tell you with sorrow affliction  despairJust as  when there is dye lac yellow orpiment indigo or crimson  a dyer or painter would paint the picture of a woman or a man complete in all its parts on a wellpolished panel or wall or on a piece of cloth in the same way where there is passion delight  craving for the nutriment of physical food consciousness lands there  grows together I tell you with sorrow affliction  despairWhere there is no passion for the nutriment of physical food where there is no delight no craving then consciousness does not land there or grow Nameform does not alight There is no growth of fabrications There is no production of renewed becoming in the futureWhere there is no production of renewed becoming in the future there is no future birth aging  deathThat I tell you has no sorrow affliction or despairJust as if there were a roofed house or a roofed hall having windows on the north the south or the eastWhen the sun rises and a ray has entered by way of the window where does it landOn the western wall lordAnd if there is no western wallOn the ground lordAnd if there is no groundOn the water lordAnd if there is no waterIt does not land lordIn the same way where there is no passion for the nutriment of physical foodconsciousness does not land or grow That I tell you has no sorrow affliction or despairThen Vennanda together with a group of monks went to where the Blessed One was staying in Pālileyyaka at the root of the Auspicious Sal Tree and on arrival after bowing down to him sat down to one sideAs they were sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged them with a talk on DhammaThen this train of thought appeared in the awareness of one of the monks Now I wonder  knowing in what way seeing in what way does one without delay put an end to the effluentsThe Blessed One perceiving with his awareness the train of thought in the monks awareness said to the monks I have analyzed  taught you the Dhamma monksI have analyzed  taught you the four frames of reference the four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for Awakening  the noble eightfold path And yet still there appears this train of thought in the awareness of one of the monks Now I wonder  knowing in what way seeing in what way does one without delay put an end to the effluentsWell then  knowing in what way seeing in what way does one without delay put an end to the effluentsThere is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person assumes form to be the selfThat assumption is a fabricationNow what is the cause what is the origination what is the birth what is the comingintoexistence of that fabricationTo an uninstructed runofthemill person touched by that which is felt born of contact with ignorance craving arisesThat fabrication is born of thatAnd that fabrication is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisenThat craving That feeling That contact That ignorance is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisenIts by knowing  seeing in this way that one without delay puts an end to the effluentsOr he doesnt assume form to be the self but he assumes the self as possessing form form as in the self self as in form or feeling to be the self the self as possessing feeling feeling as in the self self as in feeling or perception to be the self the self as possessing perception perception as in the self self as in perception or fabrications to be the self the self as possessing fabrications fabrications as in the self self as in fabrications or consciousness to be the self the self as possessing consciousness consciousness as in the self self as in consciousnessNow that assumption is a fabricationWhat is the cause of that fabricationTo an uninstructed runofthemill person touched by that which is felt born of contact with ignorance craving arisesThat fabrication is born of thatAnd that fabrication is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisenThat craving That feeling That contact That ignorance is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisenIts by knowing  seeing in this way that one without delay puts an end to the effluentsOr he may have a view such as this This self is the same as the cosmosThis I will be after death constant lasting eternal not subject to change This eternalist view is a fabrication Or he may have a view such as this I would not be neither would there be what is mineI will not be neither will there be what is mine This annihilationist view is a fabrication Or he may be doubtful  uncertain having come to no conclusion with regard to the true DhammaThat doubt uncertainty  comingtonoconclusion is a fabricationWhat is the cause of that fabricationTo an uninstructed runofthemill person touched by that which is felt born of contact with ignorance craving arisesThat fabrication is born of thatAnd that fabrication is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisenThat craving That feeling That contact That ignorance is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisenIts by knowing  seeing in this way that one without delay puts an end to the effluentsThe ending of the effluents is for one who knows  sees I tell you not for one who does not know  does not seeFor one who knows what  sees what Such is form such its origination such its disappearanceSuch is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origination such its disappearance The ending of the effluents is for one who knows in this way  sees in this wayThe knowledge of ending in the presence of ending has its prerequisite I tell youIt is not without a prerequisiteAnd what is its prerequisiteReleaseRelease has its prerequisite I tell youIt is not without a prerequisiteAnd what is its prerequisiteDispassion Disenchantment Knowledge  vision of things as they have come to be Concentration Pleasure Serenity Rapture Joy Conviction Stress Birth Becoming Clinging Craving Feeling ContactThe six sense media Nameform Consciousness Fabrications Fabrications have their prerequisite I tell youThey are not without a prerequisiteAnd what is their prerequisiteIgnoranceJust as when the devas pour rain in heavy drops  crash thunder on the upper mountains the water flowing down along the slopes fills the mountain clefts  rifts  gulliesWhen the mountain clefts  rifts  gullies are full they fill the little pondsWhen the little ponds are full they fill the big lakes the little rivers the big riversWhen the big rivers are full they fill the great oceanIn the same wayBefore my selfawakening when I was still just an unawakened Bodhisatta the realization came to me How this world has fallen on difficultyIt is born it ages it dies it falls away  rearises but it does not discern the escape from this stress from this agingdeathO when will it discern the escape from this stress from this agingdeathThen the thought occurred to me Agingdeath exists when what existsFrom what as a requisite condition is there agingdeath From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment Agingdeath exists when birth existsFrom birth as a requisite condition comes agingdeath Then the thought occurred to me Birth exists when what existsFrom what as a requisite condition comes birth From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment Birth exists when becoming existsFrom becoming as a requisite condition comes birth Nameform exists when what existsFrom what as a requisite condition is there nameform From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment Nameform exists when consciousness existsFrom consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform Then the thought occurred to me Consciousness exists when what existsFrom what as a requisite condition comes consciousness From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment Consciousness exists when nameform existsFrom nameform as a requisite condition comes consciousnessThen the thought occurred to me This consciousness turns back at nameform and goes no fartherIt is to this extent that there is birth aging death falling away  rearising ie from nameform as a requisite condition comes consciousness from consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameformFrom nameform as a requisite condition come the six sense media Thus is the origination of this entire mass of stressOrigination origination Vision arose clear knowing arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard beforeThen the thought occurred to me Agingdeath doesnt exist when what doesnt existFrom the cessation of what comes the cessation of agingdeath From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment Agingdeath doesnt exist when birth doesnt existFrom the cessation of birth comes the cessation of agingdeath Nameform doesnt exist when what doesnt existFrom the cessation of what comes the cessation of nameform From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment Nameform doesnt exist when consciousness doesnt existFrom the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameform Then the thought occurred to me Consciousness doesnt exist when what doesnt existFrom the cessation of what comes the cessation of consciousness From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment Consciousness doesnt exist when nameform doesnt existFrom the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of consciousnessThe thought occurred to me I have attained this path to Awakening ie from the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of consciousness from the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameformFrom the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of the six sense media Thus is the cessation of this entire mass of stressCessation cessation Vision arose clear knowing arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard beforeIts just as if a man traveling along a wilderness track were to see an ancient path an ancient road traveled by people of former timesHe would follow itFollowing it he would see an ancient city an ancient capital inhabited by people of former times complete with parks groves  ponds walled delightfulHe would go to address the king or the kings minister saying Sire you should know that while traveling along a wilderness track I saw an ancient path I followed it I saw an ancient city an ancient capital complete with parks groves  ponds walled delightfulSire rebuild that city The king or kings minister would rebuild the city so that at a later date the city would become powerful rich  wellpopulated fully grown  prosperousIn the same way I saw an ancient path an ancient road traveled by the Rightly Selfawakened Ones of former timesAnd what is that ancient pathJust this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration I followed that pathFollowing it I came to direct knowledge of agingdeath direct knowledge of the origination of agingdeath direct knowledge of the cessation of agingdeath direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of agingdeathI followed that pathFollowing it I came to direct knowledge of birth becoming clinging craving feeling contact the six sense media nameform consciousness direct knowledge of the origination of consciousness direct knowledge of the cessation of consciousness direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of consciousnessI followed that pathFollowing it I came to direct knowledge of fabrications direct knowledge of the origination of fabrications direct knowledge of the cessation of fabrications direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of fabricationsKnowing that directly I have revealed it to monks nuns male lay followers  female lay followers so that this holy life has become powerful rich detailed wellpopulated widespread proclaimed among celestial  human beingsNow at that time Subhadda the wanderer was staying in KusinārāHe heard Tonight in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will take place Then this thought occurred to him I have heard the venerable elder wanderers teachers of teachers saying that only once in a long long time do Tathāgatas  worthy ones rightly selfawakened  appear in the worldTonight in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will take placeNow there is a doubt that has arisen in me but I have faith that he could teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that doubtSo he went to the Mallan Sal Tree grove to Vennanda and on arrival said to him I have heard the venerable elder wanderers teachers of teachers saying that only once in a long long time do Tathāgatas  worthy ones rightly selfawakened  appear in the worldTonight in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will take placeNow there is a doubt that has arisen in me but I have faith that he could teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that doubtIt would be good Master nanda if I could get to see himWhen this was said Vennanda said to him Enough friend SubhaddaDo not bother the Blessed OneThe Blessed One is tiredFor a second time For a third time Subhadda the wanderer said to Vennanda  It would be good Master nanda if I could get to see himFor a third time Vennanda said to him Enough friend SubhaddaDo not bother the Blessed OneThe Blessed One is tiredNow the Blessed One heard the exchange between Vennanda  Subhadda the wanderer and so he said to Vennanda Enough nandaDo not stand in his wayLet him see the TathāgataWhatever he asks me will all be for the sake of knowledge and not to be bothersomeAnd whatever I answer when asked he will quickly understandSo Vennanda said to Subhadda the wanderer Go ahead friend SubhaddaThe Blessed One gives you his leaveThen Subhadda went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Venerable sir these contemplatives  brahmans each with his group each with his community each the teacher of his group an honored leader wellregarded by people at large  ie Pūraṇa Kassapa Makkhali Gosāla Ajita Kesakambalin Pakudha Kaccāyana Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta  Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta Do they all have direct knowledge as they themselves claim or do they all not have direct knowledge or do some of them have direct knowledge and some of them notEnough SubhaddaPut this question asideI will teach you the DhammaListen and pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord Subhadda responded and the Blessed One said In any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is not ascertained no contemplative of the first second third fourth order is ascertainedBut in any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is ascertained contemplatives of the first second third fourth order are ascertainedThe noble eightfold path is ascertained in this doctrine  discipline and right here are contemplatives of the first second third fourth orderOther teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplativesAnd if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of ArahantsAnd no contemplative of the second third fourth orderOther teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplativesAnd if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of ArahantsThen Subhadda the wanderer said Magnificent lord magnificentIn many ways has the Blessed One made the Dhamma clear  just as if one were to place upright what has been overturned to reveal what has been hidden to point out the way to one who is lost or to set out a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes might see formsI go to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Community of monksLet me obtain the going forth in the Blessed Ones presence let me obtain admissionAnyone Subhadda who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires the going forth  admission in this doctrine  discipline must first undergo probation for four monthsIf at the end of four months the monks are pleased they give him the going forth  admit him to the monks stateBut I know distinctions among individuals in this matterLord if that is so I am willing to undergo probation for four yearsIf at the end of four years the monks are pleased let them give me the going forth  admit me to the monks stateThen the Blessed One said to Vennanda Very well then nanda give Subhadda the going forthAs you say lord Vennanda respondedThen Subhadda said to Vennanda It is a gain for you friend nanda a great gain that you have been anointed here in the Teachers presence with the pupils anointingThen Subhadda the wanderer received the going forth he received the admission in the Blessed Ones presenceAnd not long after his admission  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  he in no long time entered  remained in the unexcelled goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus VenSubhadda became another one of the Arahants the last of the Blessed Ones facetoface disciplesIn Theravada the relationship between teacher and student is like that between a master craftsman and his apprenticeThe Dhamma is a skill like carpentry archery or cookingThe duty of the teacher is to pass on the skill not only by word and example but also by creating situations to foster the ingenuity and powers of observation the student will need to become skillfulThe duty of the student is to choose a reliable master  someone whose skills are solid and whose intentions can be trusted  and to be as observant as possibleAfter all theres no way you can become a skilled craftsman by passively watching the master or merely obeying his wordsYou cant abdicate responsibility for your own actionsYou have to pay attention both to your actions and to their results at the same time using your ingenuity and discernment to correct mistakes and overcome obstacles as they ariseThis requires that you combine respect for your teacher with respect for the principle of cause and effect as it plays out in your own thoughts words and deedsShortly before my ordination my teacher  Ajaan Fuang Jotiko  told me If you want to learn youll have to think like a thief and figure out how to steal your knowledge And soon I learned what he meantDuring my first years with him he had no one to attend to his needs cleaning his hut boiling the water for his bath looking after him when he was sick etcSo even though I was a foreigner  barely fluent in Thai and probably the most uncouth barbarian he had ever met  I quickly took on the role of his attendantInstead of explaining where things should be placed or when certain duties should be done he left it up to me to observe for myselfIf I caught on he wouldnt say anythingIf I didnt hed point out my mistake  but still wouldnt fully explain what was wrongI had to observe for myself Where did he place things when he straightened out his hutAnd I had to do this out of the corner of my eye for if I was too obvious in watching him he would chase me awayAs he said If I have to explain everything youll get used to having things handed to you on a platterAnd then what will you do when problems come up in your meditation and you dont have any experience in figuring things out and experimenting on your ownSo I swallowed my pride and learned to take my mistakes as my teachersBefore I could never tolerate being in the wrongBut when I could finally admit to being wrong I started finding the inner resources I needed to start setting things rightStill the issue of balancing respect was a problemAjaan Fuang was amazingly principled wise and compassionate and I could always trust his intentions toward meAs a result I felt enormous respect for himNevertheless he was a human being with human foiblesBecause my Christian upbringing had taught me to reserve my ultimate respect for a supposedly infallible being I was awkward in handling the occasions when Ajaan Fuang was a little less than perfectAt the same time I didnt know quite what to do with my strongly ingrained streak of independenceSo one day out of the blue Ajaan Fuang told me a story about a time when he had had a disagreement with his own teacher Ajaan Lee DhammadharoToward the end of his life Ajaan Lee had built a monastery in a mangrove swamp on the outskirts of BangkokThe lay supporters wanted an ordination hall so that was the first permanent building erected in the monasteryWhen laying the foundations they placed a concrete vault under the spot where the Buddha image was to be situated and filled it with sacred objects Buddha relics Buddha images amulets pieces of scripture and so forthThen they sealed it up for posterityTraditionally in Thailand Buddha images always face east  the direction the Buddha was facing on the day of his Awakening  so the vault was placed under the western side of the building under the spot where the main Buddha image would be placedHalfway through the construction though Ajaan Lee changed his mind and decided to place the Buddha image on the eastern side of the building facing westAlthough he never offered an explanation for this unusual move his students are generally unanimous in their interpretation of what he wanted it to represent the Dharma was going WestNot until the building was finished though did anyone realize that the vault was no longer in line with the imageThis meant that people entering the building through the western door would be stepping right over the sacred objects in the vault violating a strong Thai tabooSo one evening Ajaan Lee said to Ajaan Fuang Get the monks together and move the vault to the other side of the building Ajaan Fuang thought to himself That vault is firmly planted in the ground and the area beneath the ordination hall is nothing but mud However he knew if he said that it couldnt be moved Ajaan Lee would say If you dont have the conviction to do it Ill find someone else who does So the next morning after the meal Ajaan Fuang got all the ablebodied monks and novices in the monastery down under the building with ropes to pull the vault over to the eastern sideThey worked all day but couldnt budge it an inchSo now was the time to express an opinion  and to suggest an alternative solution to the problemAjaan Fuang went to Ajaan Lee that evening and said How about if we build another vault under the image open the original vault take all the sacred objects out of the old vault and seal them up in the new one Ajaan Lee gave him a brief nod and thus the problem was solvedAnd that Ajaan Fuang concluded is how you show respect for your teacherMeditation is the most useful skill you can masterIt can bring the mind to the end of suffering something no other skill can doBut its also the most subtle and demanding skill there isIt requires all the mental qualities ordinarily involved in mastering a physical skill  mindfulness and alertness persistence and patience discipline and ingenuity  but to an extraordinary degreeThis is why when you come to meditation its good to reflect on any skills crafts or disciplines youve already mastered so that you can apply the lessons theyve taught you to the training of the mindAs a meditation teacher Ive often found it helpful to illustrate my points with analogies drawn from physical skillsAnd given the particular range of skills and disciplines currently popular in America Ive found that one useful source of analogies is strength trainingMeditation is more like a good workout than you might have thoughtThe Buddha himself noticed the parallels hereHe defined the practice as a path of five strengths conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernmentHe likened the minds ability to beat down its most stubborn thoughts to that of a strong man beating down a weaker manThe agility of a welltrained mind he said is like that of a strong man who can easily flex his arm when its extended or extend it when its flexedAnd he often compared the higher skills of concentration and discernment to the skills of archery which  given the massive bows of ancient India  was strength training for the noble warriors of his dayThese skills included the ability to shoot great distances to fire arrows in rapid succession and to pierce great masses  the great mass here standing for the mass of ignorance that envelops the untrained mindSo even if youve been pumping great masses instead of piercing them youve been learning some important lessons that will stand you in good stead as a meditatorA few of the more important lessons are theseRead up on anatomyIf you want to strengthen a muscle you need to know where it is and what it moves if youre going to understand the exercises that target itOnly then can you perform them efficientlyIn the same way you have to understand the anatomy of the minds suffering if you want to understand how meditation is supposed to workRead up on what the Buddha had to say on the topic and dont settle for books that put you at the far end of a game of telephoneGo straight to the sourceYoull find for instance that the Buddha explained how ignorance shapes the way you breathe and how that in turn can add to your sufferingThis is why most meditation regimens start with the breath and why the Buddhas own regimen takes the breath all the way to nirvanaSo read up to understand how and whyStart where you areToo many meditators get discouraged at the outset because their minds wont settle downBut just as you cant wait until youre big and strong before you start strength training you cant wait until your concentration is strong before you start sittingOnly by exercising what little concentration you have will you make it solid and steadySo even though you feel scrawny when everyone around you seems big or fat when everyone else seems fit remember that youre not here to compete with them or with the perfect meditators you see in magazinesYoure here to work on yourselfSo establish that as your focus and keep it strongEstablish a regular routineYoure in this for the long haulWe all like the stories of sudden enlightenment but even the most lightninglike insights have to be primed by a long steady discipline of daytoday practiceThats because the consistency of your discipline is what allows you to observe subtle changes and being observant is what enables insight to seeSo dont get taken in by promises of quick and easy shortcutsSet aside a time to meditate every day and then stick to your schedule whether you feel like meditating or notThe mind grows by overcoming resistance to repetition just like a muscleSometimes the best insights come on the days you least feel like meditatingEven when they dont youre establishing a strength of discipline patience and resilience that will see you through the even greater difficulties of aging illness and deathThats why its called practiceAim for balanceThe muscle groups of the path are three virtue concentration and discernment If any one of these gets overdeveloped at the expense of the others it throws you out of alignment and your extra strength turns into a liabilitySet interim goalsYou cant fix a deadline for your enlightenment but you can keep aiming for a little more sitting or walking time a little more consistency in your mindfulness a little more speed in recovering from distraction a little more understanding of what youre doingThe type of meditation taught on retreats where they tell you not to have goals is aimed at people who get neurotic around goals in general and the weekend warriors who need to be cautioned so that they dont push themselves past the breaking pointIf youre approaching meditation as a lifetime activity youve got to have goalsYouve got to want resultsOtherwise the whole thing loses focus and you start wondering why youre sitting here when you could be sitting out on the beachFocus on proper formGet your desire for results to work for you and not against youOnce youve set your goals focus directly not on the results but on the means that will get you thereIts like building muscle massYou dont blow air or stuff protein into the muscle to make it largerYou focus on performing your reps properly and the muscle grows on its ownIf as you meditate you want the mind to develop more concentration dont focus on the idea of concentrationFocus on allowing this breath to be more comfortable and then this breath this breath one breath at a timeConcentration will then grow without your having to think about itPace yourselfLearn how to read your painWhen you meditate some pains in the body are simply a sign that its adapting to the meditation posture others that youre pushing yourself too hardSome pains are telling the truth some are lyingLearn how to tell the differenceThe same principle applies to the mindWhen the mind cant seem to settle down sometimes it needs to be pushed even harder sometimes you need to pull backYour ability to read the difference is what exercises your powers of wisdom and discernmentLearn too how to read your progressThe meditation wont really be a skill wont really be your own until you learn to judge what works for you and what doesntYou may have heard that meditation is nonjudgmental but thats simply meant to counteract the tendency to prejudge things before theyve had a chance to show their resultsOnce the results are in you need to learn how to gauge them to see how they connect with their causes so that you can adjust the causes in the direction of the outcome you really wantVary your routineJust as a muscle can stop responding to a particular exercise your mind can hit a plateau if its strapped to only one meditation techniqueSo dont let your regular routine get into a rutSometimes the only change you need is a different way of breathing a different way of visualizing the breath energy in the bodyBut then there are days when the mind wont stay with the breath no matter how many different ways of breathing you tryThis is why the Buddha taught supplemental meditations to deal with specific problems as they ariseFor starters theres goodwill for when youre feeling down on yourself or the human race  the people you dislike would be much more tolerable if they could find genuine happiness inside so wish them that happinessTheres contemplation of the parts of the body for when youre overcome with lust  its hard to maintain a sexual fantasy when you keep thinking about what lies just underneath the skinAnd theres contemplation of death for when youre feeling lazy  you dont know how much time youve got left so youd better meditate now if you want to be ready when the time comes to goWhen these supplemental contemplations have done their work you can get back to the breath refreshed and revivedSo keep expanding your repertoireThat way your skill becomes allaroundTake your ups and downs in strideThe rhythms of the mind are even more complex than those of the body so a few radical ups and downs are par for the courseJust make sure that they dont knock you off balanceWhen things are going so well that the mind grows still without any effort on your part dont get careless or overly confidentWhen your mood is so bad that even the supplemental meditations dont work view it as an opportunity to learn how to be patient and observant of bad moodsEither way you learn a valuable lesson how to keep your inner observer separate from whatever else is going onSo do your best to maintain proper form regardless and youll come out the other sideWatch your eating habitsAs the Buddha once said we survive both on mental food and physical foodMental food consists of the external stimuli you focus on as well as the intentions that motivate the mindIf you feed your mind junk food its going to stay weak and sickly no matter how much you meditateSo show some restraint in your eatingIf you know that looking at things in certain ways with certain intentions gives rise to greed anger or delusion look at them in the opposite wayAs Ajaan Lee my teachers teacher once said look for the bad side of the things youre infatuated with and the good side of the things you hateThe same principle applies to all your sensesThat way you become a discriminating eater and the mind gets the healthy nourishing food it needs to grow strongAs for your physical eating habits this is one of the areas where inner strength training and outer strength training part waysAs a meditator you have to be concerned less with what physical food you eat than with why you eatIf youre bulking up for no real purpose its actually harmful for the mindYou have to realize that in eating  even if its vegetarian food  youre placing a burden on the world around you so you want to give some thought to the purposes served by the strength you gain from your foodDont take more from the world than youre willing to give backDont eat just for the fun of it because the beings that provided the food didnt provide it in funMake sure the energy gets put to good useDont leave your strength in the gymIf you dont use your strength in other activities strength training becomes largely an exercise in vanity  aimed at impressing yourself or others but the impression is rarely deep or lastingThe same principle applies to your meditative skillsIf you leave them on the cushion and dont apply them in everyday life they never make a deep impression on the mind and you dont get as much out of them as you really shouldThe ability to maintain your center and to breathe comfortably in any situation can be a genuine lifesaver keeping the mind in a position where you can more easily think of the right thing to do say or think when your surroundings get toughAs a result the people around you are no longer subjected to your greed anger and delusionAnd as you maintain your inner balance in this way it helps them maintain theirsSo make the whole world your meditation seat and youll find that meditation both on the big seat and the little seat will get a lot strongerAt the same time itll become a gift both to yourself and to the world around youNever lose sight of your ultimate goalMental strength has at least one major advantage over physical strength in that it doesnt inevitably decline with ageIt can always keep growing to and through the experience of deathThe Buddha promises that it leads to the Deathless and he wasnt a man to make vain empty promisesSo when you establish your priorities make sure that you give more time and energy to strengthening your meditation than you do to strengthening your bodyAfter all someday youll be forced to lay down this body no matter how fit or strong youve made it but youll never be forced to lay down the strengths youve built into the mindThus have I heardOn one occasion the Exalted One was dwelling in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary near RajagahaNow at that time young Sigala a householders son rising early in the morning departing from Rajagaha with wet clothes and wet hair worshipped with joined hands the various quarters  the East the South the West the North the Nadir and the ZenithThen the Exalted One having robed himself in the forenoon took bowl and robe and entered Rajagaha for almsNow he saw young Sigala worshipping thus and spoke to him as followsWherefore do you young householder rising early in the morning departing from Rajagaha with wet clothes and wet hair worship with joined hands these various quarters  the East the South the West the North the Nadir and the ZenithMy father Lord while dying said to me The six quarters dear son you shall worshipAnd I Lord respecting revering reverencing and honoring my fathers word rise early in the morning and leaving Rajagaha with wet clothes and wet hair worship with joined hands these six quartersIt is not thus young householder the six quarters should be worshipped in the discipline of the nobleHow then Lord should the six quarters be worshipped in the discipline of the nobleIt is well Lord if the Exalted One would teach the doctrine to me showing how the six quarters should be worshipped in the discipline of the nobleWell young householder listen and bear it well in mind I shall speak  Very good Lord responded young SigalaAnd the Exalted One spoke as followsInasmuch young householder as the noble disciple has eradicated the four vices in conduct inasmuch as he commits no evil action in four ways inasmuch as he pursues not the six channels for

actionLed by desire does one commit evilLed by anger does one commit evilLed by ignorance does one commit evilLed by fear does one commit evilBut inasmuch as the noble disciple is not led by desire anger ignorance and fear he commits no evilThus spoke the Exalted OneAnd when the Master had thus spoken he spoke yet againWhat are the six channels for dissipating wealth which he does not pursueThere are young householder these six evil consequences in indulging in intoxicants which cause infatuation and heedlessnessThere are young householder these six evil consequences in sauntering

friend and an associate only when it is advantageousSleeping till sunrise adultery irascibility malevolence evil companions avarice  these six causes ruin a manThe man who has evil comrades and friends is given to evil ways to ruin does he fall in both worlds  here and the nextDice women liquor dancing singing sleeping by day sauntering at unseemly hours evil companions avarice  these nine causes ruin a manWho plays with dice and drinks intoxicants goes to women who are dear unto others as their own lives associates with the mean and not with elders  he declines just as the moon during

late hours is ever intoxicated and is licentious is not fit to lead a household lifeWho says it is too hot too cold too late and leaves things undone the opportunities for good go past such menBut he who does not regard cold or heat any more than a blade of grass and who does his duties manfully does not fall away from happinessThese four young householder should be understood as foes in the guise of friendsIn four ways young householder should one who appropriates be understood as a foe in the guise of a friendIn four ways young householder should one who renders lipservice be understood as a foe in the guise of a friendIn four ways young householder should one who flatters be understood as a foe in the guise of a friendIn four ways young householder should one who brings ruin be

six quartersThe parents should be looked upon as the East teachers as the South wife and children as the West friends and associates as the North servants and employees as the Nadir ascetics and brahmans as the ZenithIn five ways young householder a child should minister to his parents as the EastIn five ways young householder the parents thus ministered to as the East by their children show

householder who ministers to them as the ZenithThus is the Zenith covered by him and made safe and secure Thus spoke the Exalted OneAnd when the Master had thus spoken he spoke yet againWhen the Exalted One had spoken thus Sigala the young householder said as followsExcellent Lord excellentIt is as if Lord a man were to set upright that which was overturned or were to reveal that which was hidden or were to point out the way to one who had gone astray or were to hold a lamp amidst the darkness so that those who have eyes may seeEven so has the doctrine been explained in various ways by the Exalted OneI take refuge Lord in the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaMay the Exalted One receive me as a lay follower as one who has taken refuge from this very day to lifes endThis is what I heardOn one occasion the Buddha was living near the town of Rajagaha at a spot in the Bamboo Grove called the Squirrels Feeding PlaceAt that time a young householder named Sigalaka arose early and set out from Rajagaha with freshly washed clothes and hairWith palms together held up in reverence he was paying respect towards the six directions that is east south west north lower and upperMeanwhile the Buddha dressed himself in the early morning took his bowl and robe and went in to Rajagaha on alms roundOn the way he saw Sigalaka worshipping the six directionsSeeing this the Buddha said to him Young man why have you risen in the early morning and set out from Rajagaha to worship in such a wayDear sir my father on his deathbed urged me My son you must worship the directionsSo dear sir realizing honoring respecting and holding sacred my fathers request I have risen in the early morning and set out from Rajagaha to worship in this wayBut young man that is not how the six directions should be worshipped according to the discipline of the noble onesThen how dear sir should the six directions be worshipped according to the discipline of the noble onesI would appreciate it if you would teach me the proper way this should be doneVery well young man listen and pay careful attention while I tell youYes dear sir agreed SigalakaThe Buddha said thisYoung man by abandoning the four impure actions a noble disciple refrains from harmful deeds rooted in four causes and avoids the six ways of squandering wealthSo these fourteen harmful things are removedThe noble disciple now with the six directions protected has entered upon a path for conquering both worlds firmly grounded in this world and the nextAt the dissolution of the body after death a good rebirth occurs in a heavenly worldWhat four impure actions are abandonedThe harming of living beings is an impure action taking what is not given is an impure action sexual misconduct is an impure action and false speech is an impure actionThese four are abandonedThat is what the Buddha saidSumming up in verse the sublime teacher saidWhat are the four causes of harmful deedsGoing astray through desire hatred delusion or fear the noble disciple does harmful deedsBut young man not going astray through desire hatred delusion or fear the noble disciple does not perform harmful deedsThat is what the Buddha saidSumming up in verse the sublime teacher saidAnd what six ways of squandering wealth are to be avoidedYoung man heedlessness caused by intoxication roaming the streets at inappropriate times habitual partying compulsive gambling bad companionship and laziness are the six ways of squandering wealthThese are the six dangers inherent in heedlessness caused by intoxication loss of immediate wealth increased quarreling susceptibility to illness disrepute indecent exposure and weakened insightThese are the six dangers inherent in roaming the streets at inappropriate times oneself ones family and ones property are all left unguarded and unprotected one is suspected of crimes then rumors spread and one is subjected to many miseriesThese are the six dangers inherent in habitual partying You constantly seek Wheres the dancingWheres the singingWheres the musicWhere are the storiesWheres the applauseWheres the drummingThese are the six dangers inherent in compulsive gambling winning breeds resentment the loser mourns lost property savings are lost ones word carries no weight in a public forum friends and colleagues display their contempt and one is not sought after for marriage since a gambler cannot adequately support a familyThese are the six dangers inherent in bad companionship any rogue drunkard addict cheat swindler or thug becomes a friend and colleagueThese are the six dangers inherent in laziness saying Its too cold one does not work saying Its too hot one does not work saying Its too late one does not work saying Its too early one does not work saying Im too hungry one does not work saying Im too full one does not workWith an abundance of excuses for not working new wealth does not accrue and existing wealth goes to wasteThat is what the Buddha saidSumming up in verse the sublime teacher saidYoung man be aware of these four enemies disguised as friends the taker the talker the flatterer and the reckless companionThe taker can be identified by four things by only taking asking for a lot while giving little performing duty out of fear and offering service in order to gain somethingThe talker can be identified by four things by reminding of past generosity promising future generosity mouthing empty words of kindness and protesting personal misfortune when called on to helpThe flatterer can be identified by four things by supporting both bad and good behavior indiscriminately praising you to your face and putting you down behind your backThe reckless companion can be identified by four things by accompanying you in drinking roaming around at night partying and gamblingThat is what the Buddha saidSumming up in verse the sublime teacher saidYoung man be aware of these four goodhearted friends the helper the friend who endures in good times and bad the mentor and the compassionate friendThe helper can be identified by four things by protecting you when you are vulnerable and likewise your wealth being a refuge when you are afraid and in various tasks providing double what is requestedThe enduring friend can be identified by four things by telling you secrets guarding your own secrets closely not abandoning you in misfortune and even dying for youThe mentor can be identified by four things by restraining you from wrongdoing guiding you towards good actions telling you what you ought to know and showing you the path to heavenThe compassionate friend can be identified by four things by not rejoicing in your misfortune delighting in your good fortune preventing others from speaking ill of you and encouraging others who praise your good qualitiesThat is what the Buddha saidSumming up in verse the sublime teacher saidAnd how young man does the noble disciple protect the six directionsThese six directions should be known mother and father as the east teachers as the south spouse and family as the west friends and colleagues as the north workers and servants as the lower direction and ascetics and Brahmans as the upper directionIn five ways should a mother and father as the eastern direction be respected by a child I will support them who supported me I will do my duty to them I will maintain the family lineage and tradition I will be worthy of my inheritance and I will make donations on behalf of dead ancestorsAnd the mother and father so respected reciprocate with compassion in five ways by restraining you from wrongdoing guiding you towards good actions training you in a profession supporting the choice of a suitable spouse and in due time handing over the inheritanceIn this way the eastern direction is protected and made peaceful and secureIn five ways should teachers as the southern direction be respected by a student by rising for them regularly attending lessons eagerly desiring to learn duly serving them and receiving instructionAnd teachers so respected reciprocate with compassion in five ways by training in selfdiscipline ensuring the teachings are wellgrasped instructing in every branch of knowledge introducing their friends and colleagues and providing safeguards in every directionIn this way the southern direction is protected and made peaceful and secureIn five ways should a wife as the western direction be respected by a husband by honoring not disrespecting being faithful sharing authority and by giving giftsAnd the wife so respected reciprocates with compassion in five ways by being wellorganized being kindly disposed to the inlaws and household workers being faithful looking after the household goods and being skillful and diligent in all dutiesIn this way the western direction is protected and made peaceful and secureIn five ways should friends and colleagues as the northern direction be respected by generosity kind words acting for their welfare impartiality and honestyAnd friends and colleagues so respected reciprocate with compassion in five ways by protecting you when you are vulnerable and likewise your wealth being a refuge when you are afraid not abandoning you in misfortunes and honoring all your descendantsIn this way the northern direction is protected and made peaceful and

what is given doing work well and promoting a good reputationIn this way the lower direction is protected and made peaceful and secureIn five ways should ascetics and Brahmans as the upper direction be respected by kindly actions speech and thoughts having an open door and providing material needsAnd ascetics and Brahmans so respected reciprocate with compassion in six ways by restraining you from wrongdoing guiding you to good actions thinking compassionately telling you what you ought to know clarifying what you already know and showing you the path to heavenIn this way the upper direction is protected and made peaceful and secureThat is what the Buddha saidSumming up in verse the sublime teacher saidWhen all was said the young householder Sigalaka exclaimed to the BuddhaWonderful dear sirWonderfulIt is as though you have set upright what was overturned or uncovered what was concealed or shown the path to one gone astray or brought an oillamp into the darkness such that those with eyes could seeSo too has the Buddha made clear the Dhamma by various waysI go for refuge to the Buddha and to the Dhamma and to the monastic communityMay the exalted one accept me as a layfollower gone for refuge from henceforth for as long as I liveHaving been given leave by the Blessed One Sakka the devaking asked him his first question Fettered with what dear sir  though they think May we live free from hostility free from violence free from rivalry free from ill will free from those who are hostile  do devas human beings asuras nagas gandhabbas  whatever other many kinds of beings there are nevertheless live in hostility violence rivalry ill will with those who are hostileThus Sakka asked his first question of the Blessed One and the Blessed One when asked replied Devas human beings asuras nagas gandhabbas  whatever other many kinds of beings there are are fettered with envy  stinginess which is why  even though they think May we live free from hostility free from violence free from rivalry free from ill will free from those who are hostile  they nevertheless live in hostility violence rivalry ill will with those who are hostileThus the Blessed One answered having been asked by Sakka the devakingGratified Sakka was delighted in  expressed his approval of the Blessed Ones words So it is O Blessed OneSo it is O One WellgoneHearing the Blessed Ones answer to my question my doubt is now cut off my perplexity is overcomeThen Sakka having delighted in  expressed his approval of the Blessed Ones words asked him a further question But

same precepts desire the same thing aim at the same goalNo devaking not all brahmans  contemplatives teach the same doctrine adhere to the same precepts desire the same thing aim at the same goalWhy dear sir dont all brahmans  contemplatives teach the same doctrine adhere to the same precepts desire the same thing aim at the same goalThe world is made up of many properties various propertiesBecause of the many  various properties in the world then whichever property living beings get fixated on they become entrenched  latch onto it saying Only this is true anything else is worthless This is why not all brahmans  contemplatives teach the same doctrine adhere to the same precepts desire the same thing aim at the same goalBut dear sir are all brahmans  contemplatives utterly complete utterly free from bonds followers of the utterly holy life utterly consummateNo devaking not all brahmans  contemplatives are utterly complete utterly free from bonds followers of the

are released through the total ending of craving are the ones who are utterly complete utterly free from bonds followers of the utterly holy life utterly consummateThis is why not all brahmans  contemplatives are utterly complete utterly free from bonds followers of the utterly holy life utterly consummateThus the Blessed One answered having been asked by Sakka the devakingGratified Sakka was delighted in  expressed his approval of the Blessed Ones words So it is O Blessed OneSo it is O One WellgoneHearing the Blessed Ones answer to my question my doubt is now cut off my perplexity is overcomeThen Sakka having delighted in  expressed his approval of the Blessed Ones words said to him Yearning is a disease yearning is a boil yearning is an arrowIt seduces one drawing one into this or that state of being which is why one is reborn in high states  lowWhereas other outside brahmans  contemplatives gave me no chance to ask them these questions the Blessed One has answered at length so that he has removed the arrow of my uncertainty  perplexityDevaking do you recall having asked other brahmans  contemplatives these questionsYes lord I recall having asked other brahmans  contemplatives these questionsIf its no inconvenience could you tell me how they answeredIts no inconvenience when sitting with the Blessed One or one who is like himThen tell me devakingHaving gone to those whom I considered to be brahmans  contemplatives living in isolated dwellings in the wilderness I asked them these questionsBut when asked by me they were at a lossBeing at a loss they asked me in return What is your nameBeing asked I responded I dear sir am Sakka the devakingSo they questioned me further But what kamma did you do to attain to this stateSo I taught them the Dhamma as far as I had heard  mastered itAnd they were gratified with just this much We have seen Sakka the devaking and he has answered our questions So instead of my becoming their disciple they simply became mineBut I lord am the Blessed Ones disciple a streamwinner steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for selfawakeningDevaking do you recall ever having previously experienced such happiness  joyYes lord I doAnd how do you recall ever having previously experienced such happiness  joyOnce lord the devas  asuras were arrayed in battleAnd in that battle the devas won while the asuras lostHaving won the battle as the victor in the battle this thought occurred to me Whatever has been the divine nourishment of the asuras whatever has been the divine nourishment of the devas the devas will now enjoy both of them But my attainment of happiness  joy was in the sphere of violence  weaponsIt didnt lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingBut my attainment of happiness  joy on hearing the Blessed Ones Dhamma is in the sphere of no violence the sphere of no weaponsIt leads to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingThen Sakka the devaking touched the earth with his hand and said three times Homage to the Worthy One the Blessed One the Rightly Selfawakened OneHomage to the Worthy One the Blessed One the Rightly Selfawakened OneHomage to the Worthy One the Blessed One the Rightly Selfawakened OneWhile this explanation was being given there arose to Sakka the dustless stainless Dhamma eye  Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation  as it also did to other devasSuch were the questions that the Blessed One answered at Sakkas biddingAnd so this discourse is called Sakkas QuestionsSince the time of the Buddha more than two thousand five hundred years ago monks have retreated into the depths of the forests mountains and caves seeking physical isolation to aid them in the development of meditation and realization of Dhamma the truth of the Buddhas TeachingWhether in solitude or in small groups such monks live a life of simplicity austerity and determined effort and have included some of the greatest meditation masters since the Buddha himselfFar from cities and towns willing to put up with the rigours and hardships of living in the wild for the opportunity to learn from nature and uninterested in worldly fame or recognition these forest monks often remain unknown their life stories lost among the jungle thickets and mountain topsThis book is the autobiography of one such monkVenerable Ajahn Thate recorded his own life story  it was first published for his seventysecond birthday celebration  so that it might be of benefit to those monks nuns laymen and laywomen following himHe recounts his life from his boyhood encounter with forest monks to his final status as one of the great masters of the modern eraVenerable Ajahn Thate passed away in aged ninetytwoIn his Autobiography the author also takes the opportunity to record his gratitude to all those people  whether monks or lay  who had helped him over those yearsMuch of this is directed towards the ordinary rural villagers of the Northeast of Thailand who are VenAjahn Thates own stockAlthough it is the poorest and most underdeveloped region the people there are particularly devout Buddhists and it is from them that most of the Thai meditation masters have arisenIn later years this Northeastbased Forest Kammatthana Tradition started to attract the interest of sophisticated city folk and he also describes and acknowledges this trendThis book is not intended only a description of VenAjahn Thates experiences but is a narrative of a personal spiritual quest and contains advice and reflections on Buddhist meditation and practiceIt also incidentally offers a unique grassroots perspective on rural life spanning a period of unprecedented change in Thai cultureHowever VenAjahn Thate did not just stay in his native region for he wandered through the forests to all corners of Thailand and even across its bordersHe gives us therefore also glimpses of Laos and the Shan States and notes that would be interesting even to the anthropologistThe descriptions of his journeys to Singapore Indonesia and Australia are mainly for his Thai readers but even so they give a new reflection on developed countriesLay disciples have sometimes written biographies of deceased meditation masters not knowing all the influential events in their teachers livesSome biographies have been idealized out of respect for the teacherVenAjahn Thate however writes with straightforward frankness honestly relating the events that affected him most deeply and were instrumental in shaping his lifeVenAjahn Thate lived into his nineties and in the later years of his long life he was considered the most senior disciple of the fathers of the contemporary forest tradition of Northeast Thailand VenAjahn Bhuuridatta and VenAjahn Sao KantasiiloDuring his early years of practice he had enjoyed a privileged intimacy with these great teachersIn writing his autobiography VenAjahn Thate assumes a familiarity with the Thai forest tradition and its ways of practice so the following brief explanation of the lifestyle and its purpose may be helpfulIn former times the monasteries in the villages and towns of Thailand were usually the principal centers of learningThe village monastery provided a spiritual center for the village where rites and ceremonies could be performed and where local boys could become monks learn to read and perhaps start to study the Buddhist scripturesIn the more isolated rural areas however knowledge of the Vinaya was often only rudimentary and therefore standards were not very strictYoung monks who were interested in furthering their Buddhist studies could transfer to a monastery in a local market town provincial center or even BangkokThe programme there however would more usually be dedicated to scholastic study than strict observance of the monks rules or meditationThe revival of the forest tradition in Thailand during the last century was a grassroots movement to return to the lifestyle and training that was practiced in the time of the BuddhaSome monks abandoned the busy village and town monasteries for the peace and quiet of the forestThey followed the Vinaya Rule more strictly emphasizing the importance of every detailSuch monks lived without money living frugally on whatever was offered and patiently enduring when necessities were scarceThey integrated the extra austere practices recommended by the Buddha into their lifestyleFor example eating only one meal a day from their alms bowl wearing robes made from discarded cloth and living in the forest or in cemeteries  often using a krot for shelterThese forest monks would often wander barefoot through the sparsely settled regions  Thailands previously small population was scattered over quite a large country  seeking places conducive to meditationThe very heart of the forest tradition is the development of meditationBy cultivating deep states of tranquillity and systematically investigating the body and mind insight can arise into the true nature of existenceThe forest masters were noted for their creativity in overcoming the problems hindrances and defilements of the mind and for their daring determination to realize Nibbana enlightenment the fulfillment of the spiritual path taught by the BuddhaThe reader is asked to remember that this work was written by a Thai for a Thai audience with no thought of its being translated into EnglishIt depicts and represents the lifestyle social values and gender roles of a rural Asian culture at the beginning of this centuryThe experience of ultimate reality must necessarily be expressed through the conventional modes of a particular time and placeFurthermore the author often wrote specifically for young monks giving advice and warningsNonetheless the timeless truths of VenAjahn Thates wisdom shine forth bound neither by era nor cultureNearly all the tropical forest VenAjahn Thate walked through and described had been destroyed during his lifetimeIn an attempt to slow this destruction and save such forest as remains forest monks have often been in the forefront of raising social awareness of environmental issuesIn many areas the only patches of forest left are those protected behind forest monastery wallsThis book also includes two other examples of VenAjahn Thates Dhamma teachings for those who want a practical guide on the path to serenity and insight Steps Along the Path and The Meaning of Anatta both translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhuand Buddho VenAjahn Thate dedicated his life to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and from great compassion he taught and trained his followers in the practices leading to NibbanaIt is our sincere wish that the readers of his autobiography find it to be a source of inspiration and that they experience the deep peace joy and wisdom that are the fruits of the Buddhas pathTranslatorsDue to this memoirs uniqueness and importance I have aimed for an accurate translation even at the cost of losing some of the originals spirit and inspirationHowever in some places with a wholly Thai context material has been condensed and this is shown by ellipsesAll are from the original and footnotes have been added by the translatorsThe author had brought the book up to date with additions and the translation has kept to that structure the section numbering therefore comes from the originalPlease see the Glossary for an explanation of many words and terms
