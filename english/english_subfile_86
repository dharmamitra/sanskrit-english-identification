manifested in the form of a brahmin with a large matted dreadlock wearing an antelope hide He was old bent double wheezing and held a staff made of cluster fig tree wood He went up to those mendicants and saidYouve gone forth while young reverends Youre blackhaired blessed with youth in the prime of life and youve never flirted with sensual pleasuresEnjoy human sensual pleasuresDont give up what is visible in the present to chase after what takes effect over timeBrahmin thats not what were doingWere giving up what takes effect over time to chase after what is visible in the presentFor the Buddha says that sensual pleasures take effect over time they give much suffering and distress and they are all the more full of drawbacksBut this teaching is visible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselvesWhen they had spoken Māra the Wicked shook his head waggled his tongue raised his eyebrows until his brow puckered in three furrows and departed leaning on his staffThen those senior mendicants went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happenedThe Buddha saidMendicants that was no brahminThat was Māra the Wicked who came to pull the wool over your eyesThen knowing the meaning of this on that occasion the Buddha recited this verseWhen a person has seen where suffering comes

the noble ones no meditation at ease only nakedness baldness and pokes in the buttocksBut householder how long have you been a lay followerIts been thirty years sirBut householder in these thirty years have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones a meditation at easeHow sir could I notFor whenever I want quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedAnd whenever I want as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled  I enter and remain in the second absorptionAnd whenever I want with the fading away of rapture  I enter and remain in the third absorptionAnd whenever I want giving up pleasure and pain  I enter and remain in the fourth absorptionIf I pass away before the Buddha it wouldnt be surprising if the Buddha declares of meThe householder Citta is bound by no fetter that might return him to this worldWhen this was said Kassapa said to CittaIts incredible its amazinghow well explained the teaching is For a whiteclothed layperson can achieve such a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones a meditation at easeSir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceThen Citta the householder took the naked ascetic Kassapa to see the senior mendicants and said to themSirs this is the naked ascetic Kassapa who in lay life was an old friend of mineMay the senior monks give him the going forth the ordinationIll make sure that hes provided with robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sickAnd the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth the

completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceAnd Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfectedLinked DiscoursesWith CittaNigaṇṭha NāṭaputtaNow at that time Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta had arrived at Macchikāsaṇḍa together with a large assembly of Jain asceticsCitta the householder heard that they had arrivedTogether with several lay followers he went up to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sideNigaṇṭha Nātaputta said to himHouseholder do you have faith in the ascetic Gotamas claim thatthere is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connectedSir in this case I dont rely on faith in the Buddhas claim thatthere is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connectedWhen he said this Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta looked up at his assembly and saidSee good sirs how straightforward this householder Citta is Hes not devious or deceitful at all To imagine that you can stop placing the mind and keeping it connected would be like imagining that you can catch the wind in a net or dam the Ganges river with your own handWhat do you think sirWhich is betterknowledge or faithKnowledge is definitely better than faith householderWell sir whenever I want quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedAnd whenever I want as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled  I enter and remain in the second absorptionAnd whenever I want with the fading away of rapture  I enter and remain in the third absorptionAnd whenever I want giving up pleasure and pain  I enter and remain in the fourth absorptionAnd so sir since I know and see like this why should I rely on faith in another ascetic or brahmin who claims thatthere is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connectedWhen he said this Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta looked askance at his own assembly and saidSee good sirs how crooked this householder Citta is Hes so devious and deceitfulSir just now I understood you to saySee good sirs how straightforward this householder Citta is Hes not devious or deceitful at allBut then I understood you to saySee good sirs how crooked this householder Citta is Hes so devious and deceitfulIf your first statement is true the second is wrongIf your first statement is wrong the second is trueAnd also sir these ten

things prone to being fettered these things differ in both meaning and phrasingWell then sirs I shall give you a simileFor by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is saidSuppose there was a black ox and a white ox yoked by a single harness or yokeWould it be right to say thatthe black ox is the yoke of the white ox or the white ox is the yoke of the black oxNo householderThe black ox is not the yoke of the white ox nor is the white ox the yoke of the black oxThe yoke there is the single harness or yoke that theyre yoked byIn the same way the eye is not the fetter of sights nor are sights the fetter of the eyeThe fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of themThe ear  nose  tongue  body mind is not the fetter of thoughts nor are
