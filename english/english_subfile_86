Full of Love
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans where they have a town called Haliddavasana
Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and taking their bowls and robes entered Haliddavasana for alms
Then it occurred to him
Its too early to wander for alms in Haliddavasana
Why dont we go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths
Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there
When the greetings and polite conversation were over they sat down to one side
The wanderers said to them
Reverends the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this
Come mendicants give up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom and meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
Meditate spreading a heart full of compassion to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around spread a heart full of compassion to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
Meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around spread a heart full of rejoicing to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
Meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
We too teach our disciples in just the same way
What then is the difference between the ascetic Gotamas teaching and instruction and ours
Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers who follow other paths
They got up from their seat thinking
We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself
Then after the meal when they returned from almsround they went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened
Mendicants when wanderers who follow other paths say this you should say to them
But reverends how is the hearts release by love developed What is its destination apex fruit and end
How is the hearts release by compassion developed What is its destination apex fruit and end
How is the hearts release by rejoicing developed What is its destination apex fruit and end
How is the hearts release by equanimity developed What is its destination apex fruit and end

Why is that
Because theyre out of their element

For when I was still a layman I wasnt helped much by the teaching or the Saṅgha
But when I considered my love and respect for the Buddha and my sense of conscience and prudence I went forth from the lay life to homelessness

Such is form such is the origin of form such is the ending of form
Such is feeling 
Such is perception 
Such are choices 
Such is consciousness such is the origin of consciousness such is the ending of consciousness
Then while staying in an empty hut I followed the churning of the five grasping aggregates I truly understood This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering

Sir how are the seven awakening factors developed and cultivated so as to lead to the ending of craving
Udāyī its when a mendicant develops the awakening factor of mindfulness which relies on seclusion fading away and cessation and ripens as letting go And it is abundant expansive limitless and free of ill will
As they do so craving is given up
When craving is given up deeds are given up
When deeds are given up suffering is given up

Kuṇḍaliya
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāketa in the deer part at the Añjana Wood
Then the wanderer Kuṇḍaliya went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Master Gotama I like to hang around the monasteries and visit the assemblies
When Ive finished breakfast its my habit to
wander from monastery to monastery from park to park
There I see some ascetics and brahmins speaking for the sake of winning debates and finding fault
But what benefit does Master Gotama live for
The benefit the Realized One lives for Kuṇḍaliya is the fruit of knowledge and freedom
But what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill knowledge and freedom

Sense restraint
And Kuṇḍaliya how is sense restraint developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the three kinds of good conduct
A mendicant sees an agreeable sight with their eye They dont desire it or enjoy it and they dont give rise to greed
Their mind and body are steady internally well settled and well freed
But if they see a disagreeable sight theyre not dismayed their mind isnt hardened dejected or full of ill will
Their mind and body are steady internally well settled and well freed
Furthermore a mendicant hears an agreeable sound with the ear 
smells an agreeable odor with the nose 
tastes an agreeable flavor with the tongue 
feels an agreeable touch with the body 
knows an agreeable thought with their mind They dont desire it or enjoy it and they dont give rise to greed
Their mind and body are steady internally well settled and well freed
But if they know a disagreeable thought theyre not dismayed their mind isnt hardened dejected or full of ill will
Their mind and body are steady internally well settled and well freed
When a mendicants mind and body are steady internally theyre well settled and well freed when it comes to both agreeable and disagreeable sights
and thoughts
Thats how sense restraint is developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the three kinds of good conduct
And how are the three kinds of good conduct developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation
A mendicant gives up bad conduct by way of body speech and mind and develops good conduct by way of body speech and mind
Thats how the three kinds of good conduct are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation
And how are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors

I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha

Mendicants when a mendicant is accomplished in ethics immersion knowledge freedom or the knowledge and vision of freedom even the sight of them is very helpful I say
Even to hear them
approach them
pay homage to them

Is There a Way
Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and taking their bowls and robes entered Sāvatthī for alms
Then it occurred to him
Its too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī
Why dont we go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths
Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there
When the greetings and polite conversation were over they sat down to one side
The wanderers said to them
Reverends the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this
Mendicants please give up the five hindrancescorruptions of the heart that weaken wisdomand truly develop the seven awakening factors
We too teach our disciples
Reverends please give up the five hindrancescorruptions of the heart that weaken wisdomand truly develop the seven awakening factors
What then is the difference between the ascetic Gotamas teaching and instruction and ours
Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers who follow other paths
They got up from their seat thinking
We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself
Then after the meal when they returned from almsround they went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened
Mendicants when wanderers who follow other paths say this you should say to them
But reverends is there a way in which the five hindrances become ten and the seven awakening factors become fourteen
Questioned like this the wanderers who follow other paths would be stumped and in addition would get frustrated
Why is that
Because theyre out of their element
I dont see anyone in this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humanswho could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them

Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and taking their bowls and robes entered Sāvatthī for alms
The same as the previous discourse
Mendicants when wanderers who follow other paths say this you should say to them
Reverends which awakening factors should not be developed when the mind is sluggish And which awakening factors should be developed at that time
Which awakening factors should not be developed when the mind is restless And which awakening factors should be developed at that time
Questioned like this the wanderers who follow other paths would be stumped and in addition would get frustrated
Why is that
Because theyre out of their element
I dont see anyone in this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humanswho could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them
When the mind is sluggish its the wrong time to develop the awakening factors of tranquility immersion and equanimity
Why is that
Because its hard to stimulate a sluggish mind with these things

If they toss wet grass cowdung and timber on it spray it with water and scatter dirt on it
could they make it flare up

So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāketa in the deer part at the Añjana Wood
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants is there a way in which the five faculties become the five powers and the five powers become the five faculties
Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha
He is our guide and our refuge
Sir may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this The mendicants will listen and remember it
Mendicants there is a way in which the five faculties become the five powers and the five powers become the five faculties
And what is that method
The faculty of faith is the power of faith and the power of faith is the faculty of faith
The faculty of energy is the power of energy and the power of energy is the faculty of energy
The faculty of mindfulness is the power of mindfulness and the power of mindfulness is the faculty of mindfulness
The faculty of immersion is the power of immersion and the power of immersion is the faculty of immersion
The faculty of wisdom is the power of wisdom and the power of wisdom is the faculty of wisdom
Suppose that there was a river slanting sloping and inclining to the east and in the middle was an island
Theres a way in which that river can be reckoned to have just one stream
But theres also a way in which that river can be reckoned to have two streams
And whats the way in which that river can be reckoned to have just one stream
By taking into account the water to the east and the west of the island
that river can be reckoned to have just one stream
And whats the way in which that river can be reckoned to have two streams
By taking into account the water to the north and the south of the island
that river can be reckoned to have two streams
In the same way the faculty of faith is the power of faith and the power of faith is the faculty of faith
The faculty of energy is the power of energy and the power of energy is the faculty of energy
The faculty of mindfulness is the power of mindfulness and the power of mindfulness is the faculty of mindfulness
The faculty of immersion is the power of immersion and the power of immersion is the faculty of immersion
The faculty of wisdom is the power of wisdom and the power of wisdom is the faculty of wisdom
Its because of developing and cultivating the five faculties that a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements

So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas near the Mallian town called Uruvelakappa
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants as long as noble knowledge hasnt arisen for a noble disciple the four faculties are not stable and fixed
But when noble knowledge has arisen for a noble disciple the four faculties become stable and fixed
Its just like in a bungalow As long as the roof peak is not lifted into place the rafters are not stable or fixed
But when the roof peak is lifted into place the rafters become stable and fixed
In the same way as long as noble knowledge hasnt arisen for a noble disciple the four faculties are not stable and fixed
But when noble knowledge has arisen for a noble disciple the four faculties become stable and fixed

When a noble disciple has wisdom the faith energy mindfulness and immersion that follow along with that become stabilized

Then Venerable nanda went up to the Buddha bowed and while massaging the Buddhas limbs he said
Its incredible sir its amazing
how the complexion of your skin is no longer pure and bright Your limbs are flaccid and wrinkled and your body is stooped And its apparent that there has been a deterioration in your faculties

At Sāvatthī
Then Uṇṇābha the brahmin went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Master Gotama these five faculties have different scopes and different ranges and dont experience each others scope and range
What five
The faculties of the eye ear nose tongue and body
What do these five faculties with their different scopes and ranges have recourse to What experiences their scopes and ranges
Brahmin these five faculties have different scopes and different ranges and dont experience each others scope and range

These five faculties with their different scopes and ranges have recourse to the mind And the mind experiences their scopes and ranges
But Master Gotama what does the mind have recourse to
The mind has recourse to mindfulness
But what does mindfulness have recourse to
Mindfulness has recourse to freedom
But what does freedom have recourse to
Freedom has recourse to extinguishment
But what does extinguishment have recourse to
This question goes too far brahmin You werent able to grasp the limit of questioning
For extinguishment is the culmination destination and end of the spiritual life
And then the brahmin Uṇṇābha approved and agreed with what the Buddha said He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leaving
Then not long after he had left the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Suppose there was a bungalow or a hall with a peaked roof with windows on the eastern side When the sun rises and a ray of light enters through a window where would it land
On the western wall sir
In the same way the brahmin Uṇṇābhas faith in the Realized One is settled rooted and planted deep Its strong and cant be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world
If he were to pass away at this time he would be bound by no fetter that might return him to this world

So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi in Ghositas Monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants is there a way that a mendicant who is a trainee standing at the level of a trainee can understand that they are a trainee And that a mendicant who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can understand that they are an adept
Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha 
There is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee standing at the level of a trainee can understand that they are a trainee and that a mendicant who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can understand that they are an adept
And what is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee
Its when a mendicant who is a trainee truly understands This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
This is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee
Furthermore a mendicant who is a trainee reflects
Is there any other ascetic or brahmin elsewhere whose teaching is as true as real as accurate as that of the Buddha
They understand
There is no other ascetic or brahmin elsewhere whose teaching is as true as real as accurate as that of the Buddha
This too is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee
Furthermore a mendicant who is a trainee understands the five faculties

And although they dont have direct meditative experience of their destination apex fruit and culmination
they do see them with penetrating wisdom
This too is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee

At paṇa
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅgas near the Aṅgan town called paṇa
Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta
Sāriputta would a noble disciple who is sure and devoted to the Realized One have any doubt or uncertainty about the Realized One or his instructions
Sir a noble disciple who is sure and devoted to the Realized One would have no doubt or uncertainty about the Realized One or his instructions
You can expect that a faithful noble disciple will live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities Theyre strong staunchly vigorous not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities
For their energy is the faculty of energy
You can expect that a faithful and energetic noble disciple will be mindful with utmost mindfulness and alertness able to remember and recall what was said and done long ago
For their mindfulness is the faculty of mindfulness
You can expect that a faithful energetic and mindful noble disciple will relying on letting go gain immersion gain unification of mind
For their samādhi is the faculty of immersion
You can expect that a faithful energetic mindful noble disciple with their mind immersed in samādhi will understand this
Transmigration has no known beginning
No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving
But when that dark mass of ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over that state is peaceful and sublime
That is the stilling of all activities the letting go of all attachments the ending of craving fading away cessation extinguishment
For their noble wisdom is the faculty of wisdom
When a noble disciple has tried again and again recollected again and again entered immersion again and again and understood with wisdom again and again they will be confident of this
I have previously heard of these things
But now I have direct meditative experience of them and see them with penetrating wisdom
For their faith is the faculty of faith
Good good Sāriputta
Sāriputta a noble disciple who is sure and devoted to the Realized One would have no doubt or uncertainty about the Realized One or his instructions 
The Buddha then repeated Sāriputtas answer word for word

The Abuser
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
The brahmin Bharadvāja the Rude heard a rumor that
a brahmin of the Bharadvāja clan had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the ascetic Gotama
Angry and displeased he went to the Buddha and abused and insulted him with rude harsh words When he had spoken the Buddha said to him
What do you think brahmin
Do friends and colleagues relatives and family members and guests still come to visit you
Sometimes they do Master Gotama
Do you then serve them with a variety of foods and savories
Sometimes I do
But if they dont accept it brahmin who does it belong to
In that case it still belongs to me
In the same way brahmin when you abuse harass and attack us who do not abuse harass and attack we dont accept it
It still belongs to you brahmin
it still belongs to you
Someone who when abused harassed and attacked abuses harasses and attacks in return is said to eat the food and have a reaction to it
But we neither eat your food nor do we have a reaction to it
It still belongs to you brahmin
it still belongs to you
The king and his retinue believe that Master Gotama is
a perfected one
And yet he still gets angry
For one free of anger tamed living in balance
freed by right knowledge
a poised one who is at peace
where would anger come from
When you get angry at an angry person
you just make things worse for yourself
When you dont get angry at an angry person
you win a battle hard to win
When you know that the other is angry
you act for the good of both
yourself and the other
if youre mindful and stay calm
People unfamiliar with the teaching
consider one who heals both
oneself and the other
to be a fool
When he had spoken Bhāradvāja the Rude said to the Buddha
Excellent Master Gotama 
I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
Sir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
And the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Rude received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
Not long after his ordination Venerable Bhāradvāja the Rude living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
He understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence

Seeing this it occurred to him
I enjoy doing this building work here in the jungle
I wonder what the ascetic Gotama enjoys doing
Then Bhāradvāja the Builder went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse
What kind of work do you do
as a mendicant in the sal jungle
How do you find enjoyment

Theres nothing I need to do in the jungle

With jungle cleared and free of thorns

Venerable Upavāṇa was his carer

Please Upavāṇa find some hot water for me
Yes sir replied Upavāṇa He robed up and taking his bowl and robe went to the home of the brahmin Devahita and stood silently to one side
Devahita saw him standing there

Silent stands the Master

If theres hot water

Then the Buddhas illness died down
Then the brahmin Devahita went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side

Where should you give an available gift
Where is a gift very fruitful
How does one who is donating
ensure the success of their religious donation
One who knows their past lives
and sees heaven and places of loss
and has attained the ending of rebirth
that sage has perfect insight

Then Bhāradvāja together with those students went to that forest grove
where he saw the Buddha sitting down crosslegged with his body straight and mindfulness established right there
He went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse
Deep in the jungle so full of terrors
youve plunged into the empty desolate wilderness
Still steady and graceful
how beautifully you meditate mendicant
Where there is no song or music
a lonely sage resorts to the wilderness
This strikes me as an amazing thing
that you dwell so joyfully alone in the jungle
I suppose you wish to be reborn in the company
of the supreme sovereign of the heaven of the Three and Thirty
Is that why you resort to the desolate wilderness
to practice austerities for attaining Brahmā
Any wishes and hopes that are always attached
to the many and various realms
the yearnings sprung from the root of unknowing
Ive eliminated them all down to the root
So Im wishless unattached disengaged
amongst all things my vision is clear
Ive attained the state of grace the supreme awakening
I meditate alone brahmin and selfassured

Homage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
When she said this the brahmin said to Dhanañjānī

Right now lowlife woman Im going to refute your teachers doctrine
Brahmin I dont see anyone in this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humanswho can refute the doctrine of the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
But anyway you should go When youve gone youll understand
Then the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan angry and upset went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
and addressed the Buddha in verse
When what is incinerated do you sleep at ease
When what is incinerated is there no sorrow
What is the one thing
whose killing you approve
When angers incinerated you sleep at ease
When angers incinerated there is no sorrow
O brahmin anger has a poisoned root
and a honey tip
The noble ones praise its killing
for when its incinerated there is no sorrow

Yet he shows such utmost devotion to the ascetic Gotama
Then the Buddha said to the brahmin StuckUp
Enough brahmin Get up and take your own seat
For your mind has confidence in me
Then StuckUp took his seat and said to the Buddha
Regarding whom should you not be conceited
Who should you respect
Who should you esteem
Who is it good to venerate properly
Your mother and father
and also your oldest brother
with teacher as fourth
Regarding these you should not be conceited
They are who you should respect
They are who you should esteem
And theyre who its good to venerate properly
And when youve humbled conceit and arent stuckup
show supreme reverence for
the perfected ones cooled
their task complete free of defilements
When he had spoken the brahmin StuckUp said to the Buddha
Excellent Master Gotama 
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life

The Perfected Ones
With Bhāradvāja of the Matted Hair
At Sāvatthī
Then the brahmin Bhāradvāja of the Matted Hair went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
and addressed the Buddha in verse
Matted hair within matted hair without
these people are tangled up in matted hair
I ask you this Gotama
who can untangle this tangled mass
A wise man grounded in ethics
developing the mind and wisdom
a keen and alert mendicant
can untangle this tangled mass
Those in whom greed hate and ignorance
have faded away
the perfected ones with defilements ended
the tangle has been untangled
Where name and form
cease with nothing left over
and impingement and perception of form
its there that the tangle is cut

At Sāvatthī
Now at that time there was a brahmin named Saṅgārava staying in Sāvatthī He practiced purification by water believing in purification by water He lived committed to the practice of immersing himself in water at dawn and dusk
Then Venerable nanda robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for alms
He wandered for alms in Sāvatthī
After the meal on his return from almsround he went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir there is a brahmin named Saṅgārava staying in Sāvatthī He practices purification by water believing in purification by water He lives committed to the practice of immersing himself in water at dawn and dusk
Please visit him at his home out of compassion
The Buddha consented in silence
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to the home of the brahmin Saṅgārava and sat down on the seat spread out
Then the brahmin Saṅgārava went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
The Buddha said to him
Is it really true brahmin that you practice purification by water believing in purification by water that you live committed to the practice of immersing yourself in water at dawn and dusk
Yes Master Gotama
But brahmin for what reason do you practice purification by water
Its because Master Gotama whatever bad deeds Ive done during the day I wash off by bathing at dusk and whatever bad deeds Ive done during the night I wash off by bathing at dawn
Thats the reason why I practice purification by water
The teaching is a lake with shores of ethics brahmin
unclouded praised by the fine to the good
There the knowledgemasters go to bathe
and cross to the far shore without getting wet

With Bharadvāja the Fiend
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
The brahmin Bharadvāja the Fiend heard a rumor to the effect that
a brahmin of the Bharadvāja clan had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the ascetic Gotama Angry and displeased he went to the Buddha and abused and insulted him with rude harsh words
But when he said this the Buddha kept silent
Then Bharadvāja the Fiend said to the Buddha
Youre beaten ascetic youre beaten
Ha I won thinks the fool
when speaking with harsh words
Patience is the true victory
for those who understand
When you get angry at an angry person
you just make things worse for yourself
When you dont get angry at an angry person
you win a battle hard to win
When you know that the other is angry
you act for the good of both
yourself and the other
if youre mindful and stay calm
People unskilled in Dhamma
consider one who heals both
oneself and the other
to be a fool

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to the home of the brahmin Udaya
Then Udaya filled the Buddhas bowl with rice
The next day  and the day after that  Udaya filled the Buddhas bowl with rice
But when he had filled the Buddhas bowl for a third time he said to the Buddha
This insatiable ascetic Gotama keeps coming back again and again
Again and again they sow the seed
again and again the lord god sends rain
again and again farmers plough the field
again and again grain is produced for the nation
Again and again the beggars beg
again and again the donors give
Again and again when the donors have given
again and again they take their place in heaven
Again and again dairy farmers milk
again and again a calf cleaves to its mother
again and again oppressing and intimidating
that idiot is reborn again and again
Again and again youre reborn and die
again and again you get carried to a charnel ground
But when theyve gained the path for no further rebirth
one of vast wisdom is not reborn again and again

Master Gotama I seek alms by legitimate means which I use to provide for my mother and father
In doing so am I doing my duty
Indeed brahmin in so doing you are doing your duty
Whoever seeks alms by legitimate means and uses them to provide for their mother and father makes much merit
A mortal provides for their mother

A welltodo brahmin
At Sāvatthī
Then a certain welltodo brahmin shabby wearing a shabby cloak went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
The Buddha said to him
Brahmin why are you so shabby wearing a shabby cloak
Master Gotama I have four sons
At their wives bidding they expelled me from my house
Well then brahmin memorize these verses and recite them to your sons when you are all seated in the council hall with a large crowd
I was overjoyed when they were born
and wished for them the very best
But at their wives bidding they chased me out
like hounds after hogs
It turns out theyre wicked those nasty men
though they called me their dear old Dad
Theyre monsters in the shape of sons
throwing me out as Ive grown old
Like an old useless horse
led away from its fodder
the elderly father of those kids
begs for alms at others homes
Even my staff is better
than those disobedient sons
for it wards off a wild bull
and even a wild dog
It goes before me in the dark
in deep waters it supports me
By the wonderful power of this staff
when I stumble I stand firm again
Having memorized those verses in the Buddhas presence the brahmin recited them to his sons when they were all seated in the council hall with a large crowd 
Then the brahmins sons led him back home bathed him and each clothed him with a fine pair of garments
Then the brahmin taking one pair of garments went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Master Gotama we brahmins seek a fee for our teacher
May Master Gotama please accept my teachers fee
So the Buddha accepted it out of compassion

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Khomadussa for alms
Now at that time the brahmins and householders of Khomadussa were gathered in the council hall for some business while a gentle rain drizzled down
Then the Buddha approached that council
The brahmins and householders saw the Buddha coming off in the distance
Who are these shavelings these fake ascetics Dont they understand the council rules
Then the Buddha addressed the brahmins and householders of Khomadussa in verse
If good people are not present it is no true council
and those whose speak against principle are not good people
Having given up greed hate and delusion
speakers of principle are good people
When he had spoken the brahmins and householders of Khomadussa said to the Buddha

You dont become a beggar

With Bhāradvāja of Sundarika
At one time the Buddha was staying in the Kosalan lands on the bank of the Sundarika river
Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarika was serving the sacred flame and performing the fire sacrifice on the bank of the river Sundarika
Then he looked all around the four directions wondering
Now who might eat the leftovers of this offering
He saw the Buddha meditating at the root of a certain tree with his robe pulled over his head
Taking the leftovers of the offering in his left hand and a pitcher in the right he approached the Buddha
When he heard Sundarikas footsteps the Buddha uncovered his head
Sundarika thought This man is shaven he is shaven And he wanted to turn back
But he thought
Even some brahmins are shaven
Why dont I go to him and ask about his birth
Then Sundarika the brahmin went up to the Buddha and said to him
Sir in what caste were you born
Dont ask about birth ask about conduct
for any wood can surely generate fire
A steadfast sage even though from a low class family
is a thoroughbred checked by conscience
Tamed by truth fulfilled by taming
a complete knowledge master who has completed the spiritual journey
thats who a sacrificer should introduce themselves to
and make a timely offering to one worthy of a religious donation
My sacrificial offering must have been well performed
since I have met such a knowledge master
Its because Id never met anyone like you
that others ate the leftover offering
Eat Master Gotama
you are truly a brahmin
Food enchanted by a spell isnt fit for me to eat
Thats not the principle of those who see brahmin
The Buddhas reject things enchanted with spells
Since there is such a principle brahmin thats how they live
Serve with other food and drink
the consummate one the great hermit
with defilements ended and remorse stilled
For he is the field for the seeker of merit
Then Master Gotama to whom should I give the leftovers of this offering
Brahmin I dont see anyone in this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humanswho can properly digest these leftovers except for the Realized One or one of his disciples
Well then brahmin throw out those leftovers where there is little that grows or drop them into water that has no living creatures
So Sundarika dropped the leftover offering in water that had no living creatures
And when those leftovers were placed in the water they sizzled and hissed steaming and fuming
Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day If you placed it in the water it would sizzle and hiss steaming and fuming
In the same way when those leftovers were placed in the water they sizzled and hissed steaming and fuming
Then Sundarika the brahmin shocked and awestruck went up to the Buddha and stood to one side
The Buddha addressed him in verse
When youre kindling the wood brahmin
dont imagine this is purity for its just an external
Experts say that those who wish for purity
through externals will not find it
Ive given up kindling firewood brahmin
now I just light the inner flame
Always blazing always serene
I am a perfected one leading the spiritual life
Conceit brahmin is the burden of your possessions
anger your smoke and lies your ashes
The tongue is the ladle and the heart the fire altar
a welltamed self is a persons light
The teaching is a lake with shores of ethics brahmin
unclouded praised by the fine to the good
There the knowledgemasters go to bathe
and cross to the far shore without getting wet
Truth principle restraint the spiritual life
the attainment of the supreme based on the middle brahmin
Pay homage to the upright ones
I declare that man to be one who follows the teaching

With Bhāradvāja the Farmer
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans in the Southern Hills near the brahmin village of Ekanāḷa
Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Farmer had harnessed around five hundred plows it being the season for sowing
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to where Bhāradvāja the Farmer was working
Now at that time Bhāradvāja the Farmer was distributing food
Then the Buddha went to where the distribution was taking place and stood to one side
Bhāradvāja the Farmer saw him standing for alms
and said to him
I plough and sow ascetic and then I eat
You too should plough and sow then you may eat
I too plough and sow brahmin and then I eat
I dont see Master Gotama with a yoke or plow or plowshare or goad or oxen yet he says
I too plough and sow brahmin and then I eat
Then Bhāradvāja the Farmer addressed the Buddha in verse
You claim to be a farmer
but I dont see your plough
If youre a farmer declare to me
how are we to understand your farming
Faith is my seed austerity my rain
and wisdom is my yoke and plough
Conscience is my pole mind my strap
mindfulness my plowshare and goad
Guarded in body and speech
I restrict my intake of food
I use truth as my scythe
and gentleness is my release
Energy is my beast of burden
transporting me to a place of sanctuary
It goes without turning back
to where there is no sorrow
Thats how to do the farming
that has the Deathless as its fruit
When you finish this farming
youre released from all suffering
Eat Master Gotama
you are truly a farmer
For Master Gotama does the farming that has the Deathless as its fruit
Food enchanted by a spell isnt fit for me to eat
Thats not the principle of those who see brahmin

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Cool Grove
Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika had arrived at Rājagaha on some business
a rumor that a Buddha had arisen in the world
Right away he wanted to go and see the Buddha but he thought
Its too late to go and see the Buddha today
Ill go and see him tomorrow He went to bed thinking of the Buddha
During the night he got up three times thinking it was morning
Then he approached the Sivaka Gate
and nonhuman beings opened it for him
But as he was leaving the city light vanished and darkness appeared to him He felt fear terror and goosebumps and wanted to turn back
Then the invisible spirit Sivaka called out
A hundred elephants a hundred horses
a hundred muledrawn chariots
a hundred thousand maidens
bedecked with jeweled earrings
these are not worth a sixteenth part
of a single forward stride
Forward householder
Forward householder
Going forward is better for you
not turning back
Then darkness vanished and light appeared to Anāthapiṇḍika His fear terror and goosebumps settled down
But for a second time light vanished and darkness appeared to him 
For a second time the invisible spirit Sivaka called out 
 Going forward is better for you
not turning back
Then darkness vanished and light appeared to Anāthapiṇḍika His fear terror and goosebumps settled down
But for a third time light vanished and darkness appeared to him 
For a third time the invisible spirit Sivaka called out 
 Going forward is better for you
not turning back
Then darkness vanished and light appeared to Anāthapiṇḍika His fear terror and goosebumps settled down
Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went to the Cool Grove and approached the Buddha
Now at that time the Buddha had risen at the crack of dawn and was walking mindfully in the open
He saw Anāthapiṇḍika coming off in the distance
So he stepped down from the walking path sat down on the seat spread out
and said to Anāthapiṇḍika
Come Sudatta
Then Anāthapiṇḍika thought The Buddha calls me by name Smiling and joyful he bowed with his head to the Buddhas feet and said to him
Sir I trust the Buddha slept well
A brahmin who is fully extinguished
always sleeps at ease
Sensual pleasures slide off them
theyre cooled free of attachments
Since theyve cut off all clinging
and removed the stress from the heart
the peaceful sleep at ease

Then how does this body manifest
Where do the bones and liver come from
And how does one cling on in the womb
First theres a drop of coagulate
from there a little bud appears
next it becomes a piece of flesh
which produces a swelling
From that swelling the limbs appear
the head hair body hair and teeth
And whatever the mother eats

And as that lay woman wept on that occasion she recited these verses
I have heard this from the perfected ones
The native spirits will not mess with anyone
who leads the spiritual life
by observing the sabbath
complete in all eight factors
on the fourteenth and the fifteenth days
and the eighth day of the fortnight
as well as on the fortnight of special displays

this saying of the native spirits
Dont do bad deeds
either openly or in secret
If you should do a bad deed
or youre doing one now
you wont be freed from suffering
though you fly away and flee
Mum they cry for the dead

With Spiky
At one time the Buddha was staying near Gayā on the cutstone ledge in the haunt of Spiky the native spirit
Now at that time the native spirits Shaggy and Spiky were passing by not far from the Buddha
So Shaggy said to Spiky
Thats an ascetic
Thats no ascetic hes a faker
Ill soon find out whether hes an ascetic or a faker
Then Spiky went up to the Buddha and leaned up against his body
but the Buddha pulled away
Then Spiky said to the Buddha
Are you afraid ascetic
No sir Im not afraid
But your touch is nasty
I will ask you a question ascetic
If you dont answer me Ill drive you insane or explode your heart or grab you by the feet and throw you to the far shore of the Ganges
I dont see anyone in this world with its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humans who could do that to me
But anyway ask what you wish
Where do greed and hate come from
From where do discontent desire and terror spring
Where do the minds thoughts originate
like a crow let loose by boys
Greed and hate come from here
from here spring discontent desire and terror
heres where the minds thoughts originate
like a crow let loose by boys
Born of affection originating in oneself
like the shoots from a banyans trunk

get rid of themlisten up spirit
They cross this flood so hard to cross
not crossed before so as to not be reborn

Being responsible acting appropriately

Truthfulness wins you a good reputation
You hold on to friends by giving

does not grieve after passing away

Its incredible its amazing
Who cant become a streamenterer these days

And then say
Sir please visit him at his home out of compassion

I hope youre coping Dīghāvu I hope youre getting better I hope that your pain is fading not growing that its fading is evident not its growing
Sir Im not keeping well Im not alright

For I have experiential confidence in the Buddha

You should meditate observing the impermanence of all conditions perceiving suffering in impermanence perceiving notself in suffering perceiving giving up perceiving fading away and perceiving cessation
Thats how you should train
These six things that play a part in realization that were taught by the Buddha are found in me and I embody them

Come on dear Dīghāvu you should closely focus on what the Buddha is saying
When the Buddha had given this advice he got up from his seat and left
Not long after the Buddha left Dīghāvu passed away

He has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
Its good to see such perfected ones
Then the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate went up to the Buddha
Before sitting down to one side some bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silent
Seated to one side they said to the Buddha
Master Gotama these are our wishes desires and hopes
We wish to live at home with our children to use sandalwood imported from Kāsi to wear garlands perfumes and makeup and to accept gold and money And when our body breaks up after death we wish to be reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
Given that we have such wishes may the Buddha teach us the Dhamma so that we may achieve them
Householders I will teach you an explanation of the Dhamma thats relevant to oneself
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
And what is the explanation of the Dhamma thats relevant to oneself
Its when a noble disciple reflects
I want to live and dont want to die I want to be happy and recoil from pain
Since this is so if someone were to take my life I wouldnt like that
But others also want to live and dont want to die they want to be happy and recoil from pain So if I were to take the life of someone else they wouldnt like that either
The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others
Since I dislike this thing how can I inflict it on someone else
Reflecting in this way they give up killing living creatures themselves And they encourage others to give up killing living creatures praising the giving up of killing living creatures
So their bodily behavior is purified in three points
Furthermore a noble disciple reflects
If someone were to steal from me I wouldnt like that
But if I were to steal from someone else they wouldnt like that either
The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others
Since I dislike this thing how can I inflict it on someone else
Reflecting in this way they give up stealing themselves And they encourage others to give up stealing praising the giving up of stealing
So their bodily behavior is purified in three points
Furthermore a noble disciple reflects
If someone were to have sexual relations with my wives I wouldnt like it
But if I were to have sexual relations with someone elses wives he wouldnt like that either
The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others
Since I dislike this thing how can I inflict it on others
Reflecting in this way they give up sexual misconduct themselves And they encourage others to give up sexual misconduct praising the giving up of sexual misconduct
So their bodily behavior is purified in three points
Furthermore a noble disciple reflects
If someone were to distort my meaning by lying I wouldnt like it
But if I were to distort someone elses meaning by lying they wouldnt like it either
The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by someone else
Since I dislike this thing how can I inflict it on others
Reflecting in this way they give up lying themselves And they encourage others to give up lying praising the giving up of lying
So their verbal behavior is purified in three points
Furthermore a noble disciple reflects
If someone were to break me up from my friends by divisive speech I wouldnt like it
But if I were to break someone else from their friends by divisive speech they wouldnt like it either 
So their verbal behavior is purified in three points
Furthermore a noble disciple reflects
If someone were to attack me with harsh speech I wouldnt like it
But if I were to attack someone else with harsh speech they wouldnt like it either 
So their verbal behavior is purified in three points
Furthermore a noble disciple reflects
If someone were to annoy me by talking silliness and nonsense I wouldnt like it
But if I were to annoy someone else by talking silliness and nonsense they wouldnt like it either
The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by another
Since I dislike this thing how can I inflict it on another
Reflecting in this way they give up talking nonsense themselves And they encourage others to give up talking nonsense praising the giving up of talking nonsense
So their verbal behavior is purified in three points
And they have experiential confidence in the Buddha 
the teaching 
the Saṅgha 
And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones  leading to immersion
When a noble disciple has these seven good qualities and these four desirable states they may if they wish declare of themselves
Ive finished with rebirth in hell the animal realm and the ghost realm Ive finished with all places of loss bad places the underworld I am a streamenterer Im not liable to be reborn in the underworld and am bound for awakening
When he had spoken the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate said to the Buddha
Excellent Master Gotama 
We go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life

First Dangers and Threats
At Sāvatthī
Seated to one side the Buddha said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika
Householder when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats has the four factors of streamentry and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble cycle with wisdom they may if they wish declare of themselves
Ive finished with rebirth in hell the animal realm and the ghost realm Ive finished with all places of loss bad places the underworld I am a streamenterer Im not liable to be reborn in the underworld and am bound for awakening
What are the five dangers and threats they have quelled
Anyone who kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come and experiences mental pain and sadness
So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from killing living creatures
Anyone who steals 
Anyone who commits sexual misconduct 
Anyone who lies 
Anyone who uses alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come and experiences mental pain and sadness
So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from alcoholic drinks that cause negligence
These are the five dangers and threats they have quelled

Its when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha 
the teaching 
the Saṅgha 
And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones  leading to immersion
These are the four factors of streamentry that they have
And what is the noble cycle that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom
A noble disciple properly attends to dependent origination itself
When this exists that is due to the arising of this that arises
When this doesnt exist that is not due to the cessation of this that ceases' That is
Ignorance is a condition for choices Choices are a condition for consciousness Consciousness is a condition for name and form Name and form are a condition for the six sense fields The six sense fields are conditions for contact Contact is a condition for feeling Feeling is a condition for craving Craving is a condition for grasping Grasping is a condition for continued existence Continued existence is a condition for rebirth Rebirth is a condition that gives rise to old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over choices cease When choices cease consciousness ceases When consciousness ceases name and form cease When name and form cease the six sense fields cease When the six sense fields cease contact ceases When contact ceases feeling ceases When feeling ceases craving ceases When craving ceases grasping ceases When grasping ceases continued existence ceases When continued existence ceases rebirth ceases When rebirth ceases old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress cease
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases
This is the noble cycle that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom
When a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats has the four factors of streamentry and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble cycle with wisdom they may if they wish declare of themselves

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery
At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha thinking that
when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering
Mahānāma the Sakyan heard about this
Then he went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him that he had heard that the Buddha was leaving
He added
Sir I havent heard and learned it in the presence of the Buddha
how a wise lay follower should advise another wise lay follower who is sick suffering gravely ill
Mahānāma a wise lay follower should put at ease another wise lay follower who is sick suffering gravely ill with four consolations
Be at ease sir
You have experiential confidence in the Buddha 
the teaching 
the Saṅgha 
And you have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones  leading to immersion
When a wise lay follower has put at ease another wise lay follower who is sick suffering gravely ill with these four consolations they should say
Are you concerned for your mother and father
If they reply
I am they should say
But sir its your nature to die
Whether or not you are concerned for your mother and father
you will die anyway
It would be good to give up concern for your mother and father
If they reply
I have given up concern for my mother and father they should say
But are you concerned for your partners and children
If they reply
I am they should say
But sir its your nature to die
Whether or not you are concerned for your partners and children
you will die anyway
It would be good to give up concern for your partners and children
If they reply
I have given up concern for my partners and children they should say
But are you concerned for the five kinds of human sensual stimulation
If they reply
I am they should say
Good sir heavenly sensual pleasures are better than human sensual pleasures
It would be good to turn your mind away from human sensual pleasures and fix it on the gods of the Four Great Kings
If they reply
I have done so they should say
Good sir the gods of the ThirtyThree are better than the gods of the Four Great Kings 
Good sir the gods of Yama 
the Joyful Gods 
the Gods Who Love to Create 
the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others 
the Gods of the Brahmā realm are better than the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others
It would be good to turn your mind away from the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others and fix it on the Gods of the Brahmā realm
If they reply
I have done so they should say
Good sir the Brahmā realm is impermanent not lasting and included within identity
It would be good to turn your mind away from the Brahmā realm and apply it to the cessation of identity
If they reply
I have done so
then there is no difference between a lay follower whose mind is freed in this way and a mendicant whose mind is freed from defilements that is
between the freedom of one and the other

Seeing in yourself that experiential confidence in the Saṅgha that pain may die down on the spot
You dont have the unethical conduct that causes an uneducated ordinary person to be rebornwhen their body breaks up after deathin a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell

And then Anāthapiṇḍikas pain died down on the spot
Then he served Sāriputta and nanda from his own dish
When Sāriputta had eaten and washed his hand and bowl Anāthapiṇḍika took a low seat and sat to one side
Venerable Sāriputta expressed his appreciation to him with these verses
Whoever has faith in the Realized One
unwavering and well grounded
whose ethical conduct is good
praised and loved by the noble ones
who has confidence in the Saṅgha
and correct view
theyre said to be prosperous
their life is not in vain
So let the wise devote themselves
to faith ethical behaviour
confidence and insight into the teaching
remembering the instructions of the Buddhas
After expressing his appreciation to Anāthapiṇḍika with these verses Sāriputta got up from his seat and left
Then nanda went up to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
The Buddha said to him
So nanda where are you coming from in the middle of the day
Sir Venerable Sāriputta advised the householder Anāthapiṇḍika in this way and that
Sāriputta is astute nanda
He has great wisdom since he can analyze the four factors of streamentry in ten respects

About Sarakāni
First With Mahānāma
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery
Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir this Kapilavatthu is successful and prosperous and full of people with cramped culdesacs
In the late afternoon after paying homage to the Buddha or an esteemed mendicant I enter Kapilavatthu
I encounter a stray elephant
or person
At that time I lose mindfulness regarding the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha
If I were to die at this time where would I be reborn in my next life
Do not fear Mahānāma do not fear
Your death will not be a bad one your passing will not be a bad one
Take someone whose mind has for a long time been imbued with faith ethics learning generosity and wisdom Their body consists of form made up of the four primary elements produced by mother and father built up from rice and porridge liable to impermanence to wearing away and erosion to breaking up and destruction
Right here the crows vultures hawks dogs jackals and many kinds of little creatures devour it
But their mind rises up headed for a higher place
Suppose a person was to sink a pot of ghee or oil into a deep lake and break it open
Its shards and chips would sink down while the ghee or oil in it would rise up headed for a higher place
In the same way take someone whose mind has for a long time been imbued with faith ethics learning generosity and wisdom Their body consists of form made up of the four elements produced by mother and father built up from rice and porridge liable to impermanence to wearing away and erosion to breaking up and destruction

At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha thinking that
when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering
Now at that time the chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa were residing in Sādhuka on some business
They heard about this
So they posted someone on the road saying
My good man let us know when you see the Blessed One coming the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
And that person stood there for two or three days before they saw the Buddha coming off in the distance
When they saw him they went to the chamberlains and said
Sirs the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha is coming
Please come at your convenience
Then the chamberlains went up to the Buddha bowed and followed behind him
And then the Buddha left the road went to the root of a certain tree and sat down on the seat spread out
The chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa bowed sat down to one side
and said to the Buddha

Well then chamberlains living in a house is cramped and dirty but the life of one gone forth is wide open

Those sisters smell like a freshly opened perfume box thats how the royal ladies smell with makeup on
The touch of those sisters is like a tuft of cottonwool or kapok thats how dainty the royal ladies are
Now at that time we must look after the elephants the sisters and ourselves

Neverthless Nandiya as to how a noble disciple lives negligently and how they live diligently
listen and attend closely I will speak
Yes sir Nandiya replied
The Buddha said this
And how does a noble disciple live negligently
Firstly a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha 
Theyre content with that confidence and dont make a further effort for solitude by day or retreat by night
When they live negligently theres no joy
When theres no joy theres no rapture
When theres no rapture theres no tranquility
When theres no tranquility theres suffering
When one is suffering the mind does not become immersed in samādhi
When the mind is not immersed in samādhi principles do not become clear
Because principles have not become clear theyre reckoned to live negligently
Furthermore a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the teaching 
the Saṅgha 
And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones  leading to immersion
Theyre content with that ethical conduct loved by the noble ones and dont make a further effort for solitude by day or retreat by night
When they live negligently theres no joy
When theres no joy theres no rapture
When theres no rapture theres no tranquility
When theres no tranquility theres suffering
When one is suffering the mind does not become immersed in samādhi
When the mind is not immersed in samādhi principles do not become clear
Because principles have not become clear theyre reckoned to live negligently
Thats how a noble disciple lives negligently
And how does a noble disciple live diligently
Firstly a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha 
But theyre not content with that confidence and make a further effort for solitude by day and retreat by night
When they live diligently joy springs up
Being joyful rapture springs up
When the mind is full of rapture the body becomes tranquil
When the body is tranquil they feel bliss
And when blissful the mind becomes immersed in samādhi
When the mind is immersed in samādhi principles become clear
Because principles have become clear theyre reckoned to live diligently
Furthermore a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the teaching

Overflowing Merit
Mendicants suppose it rains heavily on a mountain top and the water flows downhill to fill the hollows crevices and creeks As they become full they fill up the pools The pools fill up the lakes the lakes fill up the streams and the streams fill up the rivers And as the rivers become full they fill up the ocean
In the same way a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha and the ethics loved by the noble ones
These things flow onwards and after crossing to the far shore they lead to the ending of defilements

Mendicants if there were no gratification in the earth element sentient beings wouldnt love it
But since there is gratification in the earth element sentient beings do love it
If the earth element had no drawback sentient beings wouldnt grow disillusioned with it

But since there is an escape from the earth element sentient beings do escape from it
If there were no gratification in the water element

In the same way a corrupt perception might arise in an ascetic or brahmin If they dont quickly give it up get rid of it eliminate it and obliterate it theyll suffer in the present life with anguish distress and fever
And when the body breaks up after death they can expect to be reborn in a bad place
Thoughts of renunciation good will and harmlessness arise for a reason not without reason
And how do thoughts of renunciation good will and harmlessness arise for a reason not without reason
The element of renunciation gives rise to perceptions of renunciation

Second Māras Snares
At one time the Buddha was staying near Benares in the deer park at Isipatana
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants I am freed from all snares both human and divine
You are also freed from all snares both human and divine
Wander forth mendicants for the welfare and happiness of the people out of compassion for the world for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humans
Let not two go by one road
Teach the Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And reveal a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
There are beings with little dust in their eyes Theyre in decline because they havent heard the teaching
There will be those who understand the teaching
I will travel to Uruvelā the village of Senāni in order to teach the Dhamma
Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse
Youre bound by all snares
both human and divine
Youre bound by the great bond
you wont escape me ascetic
Im freed from all snares
both human and divine
Im freed from the great bonds
Youre beaten terminator

And then Māra the Wicked after reciting these verses of disillusionment in the Buddhas presence left that place He sat crosslegged on the ground not far from the Buddha silent embarrassed shoulders drooping downcast depressed with nothing to say scratching the ground with a stick
Then Māras daughters Craving Delight and Lust went up to Māra the Wicked and addressed him in verse
Why so downhearted dad
What man are you upset about
Well catch him with the snare of lust
like an elephant in the wild
Well tie him up and bring him back
hell fall under your sway
In this world he is the perfected one the Holy One
Hes not easily seduced by lust
He has slipped free of Māras sway
thats why Im so upset
Then Māras daughters Craving Delight and Lust went up to the Buddha and said to him
We serve at your feet ascetic
But the Buddha ignored them since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments
Then Craving Delight and Lust withdrew to one side to think up a plan
Men have a diverse spectrum of tastes
Why dont we each manifest in the form of a hundred young maidens
So thats what they did Then they went up to the Buddha and said to him
We serve at your feet ascetic
But the Buddha still ignored them since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments
Then Craving Delight and Lust withdrew to one side to think up a plan
Men have a diverse spectrum of tastes
Why dont we each manifest in the form of a hundred women who have never given birth
So thats what they did Then they went up to the Buddha and said to him
We serve at your feet ascetic
But the Buddha still ignored them since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments
Then Craving Delight and Lust 
each manifested in the form of a hundred women who have given birth once 
women who have given birth twice 
middleaged women 
old women 
But the Buddha still ignored them since he was freed with the supreme ending of attachments
Then Craving Delight and Lust withdrew to one side and said
What our father said is true
In this world he is the perfected one the Holy One
Hes not easily seduced by lust
He has slipped free of Māras sway
thats why Im so upset
For if we had come on to any ascetic or brahmin like this who was not free of lust his heart would explode or hed spew hot blood from his mouth or hed go mad and lose his mind
Hed dry up wither away and shrivel up like a green reed that was mowed down
Then Māras daughters Craving Delight and Lust went up to the Buddha and stood to one side
Māras daughter Craving addressed the Buddha in verse
Are you swamped by sorrow that you meditate in the forest
Have you lost a fortune or do you long for one
Or perhaps youve committed some crime in the village
Why dont you get too close to people
And why does noone get close to you
Ive reached the goal peace of heart
Having conquered the army of the likable and pleasant
alone practicing absorption I awakened to bliss
Thats why I dont get too close to people
and noone gets too close to me
Then Māras daughter Delight addressed the Buddha in verse
How does a mendicant who has crossed five floods
usually meditate here while crossing the sixth
How do they usually practice absorption so that sensual perceptions
are kept out and dont get hold of them
With tranquil body and mind well freed
without making plans mindful homeless
understanding the teaching they practice absorption without placing the mind
theyre not shaking or drifting or rigid
Thats how a mendicant who has crossed five floods
usually meditates here while crossing the sixth
Thats how they usually practice absorption so that sensual perceptions
are kept out and dont get hold of them
Then Māras daughter Lust addressed the Buddha in verse
He lives with his community after cutting off craving
and many of the faithful will cross over for sure
Alas this homeless one will snatch many men away
and lead them past the King of Death
The great heroes they lead
by means of the true teaching
When the Realized Ones are leading by the teaching
how could anyone who knows be jealous
Then Māras daughters Craving Delight and Lust went up to Māra the Wicked
Māra the Wicked saw them coming off in the distance
and addressed them in verse
Fools You drill into a mountain
with lotus stalks
You dig up a hill with your nails
You chew iron with your teeth
You seek a footing in the deeps as it were
while lifting a rock with your head
After attacking a stump with your breast as it were
you leave Gotama disappointed
They came in their splendor
Craving Delight and Lust
But the Teacher brushed them off right there

Seven Years of Following
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherds banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River
Now at that time Māra the Wicked had been following the Buddha for seven years hoping to find a vulnerability without success
Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse
Are you swamped by sorrow that you meditate in the forest
Have you lost a fortune or do you long for one
Or perhaps youve committed some crime in the village
Why dont you get too close to people
And why does noone get close to you
Ive dug out the root of sorrow completely
I practice absorption free of guilt or sorrow
Ive cut off all greed and hunger for future lives
Undefiled I practice absorption O kinsman of the negligent
The things they call mine
and those who say its mine
if your mind remains there
you wont escape me ascetic
The things they speak of arent mine
Im not someone who speaks like that
So know this Wicked One
you wont even see the path I take
If youve discovered the path
thats safe and leads to the deathless
go and walk that path alone
why teach it to anyone else
Those crossing to the far shore
ask whats beyond the domain of Death
When Im asked I explain to them
the truth without attachments
Sir suppose there was a lotus pond not far from a town or village
and a crab lived there
Then several boys or girls would leave the town or village and go to the pond where theyd pull out the crab and put it on dry land
Whenever that crab extended a claw those boys or girls would snap crack and break it off with a stick or a stone
And when that crabs claws had all been snapped cracked and broken off it wouldnt be able to return down into that lotus pond
In the same way sir the Buddha has snapped cracked and broken off all my tricks dodges and evasions
Now Im not able to approach the Buddha again in hopes of finding a vulnerability
Then Māra the Wicked recited these verses of disappointment in the Buddhas presence
A crow once circled a stone
that looked like a lump of fat
Perhaps Ill find something tender it thought
perhaps theres something tasty
But finding nothing tasty
the crow left that place
Like the crow that pecked the stone
I leave Gotama disappointed

Now at that time the Buddha was educating encouraging firing up and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk on the topic of the six fields of contact
And those mendicants were paying heed paying attention engaging wholeheartedly and lending an ear
Then Māra thought
This ascetic Gotama is educating encouraging firing up and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk on the topic of the six fields of contact
And those mendicants are paying heed paying attention engaging wholeheartedly and lending an ear
Why dont I go and pull the wool over their eyes
Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and made a terrifyingly loud noise close by him
It seemed as if the earth were shattering so that one of the mendicants said to another
Mendicant mendicant it seems like the earth is shattering
When this was said the Buddha said to that mendicant
Mendicant thats not the earth shattering
Thats Māra the Wicked come to pull the wool over your eyes
Then the Buddha knowing that this was Māra the Wicked addressed him in verse

Why dont I go and pull the wool over their eyes
Then Māra the Wicked manifested in the form of a farmer carrying a large plough on his shoulder He held a long goad his hair was messy he was clad in sunn hemp and his feet were muddy He went up to the Buddha and said to him
So ascetic did you happen to see any oxen
But what have you to do with oxen Wicked One

Ruling
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a wilderness hut on the slopes of the Himalayas
Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind
I wonder if its possible to rule legitimately without killing or having someone kill for you without conquering or having someone conquer for you without sorrowing or causing sorrow
And then Māra the Wicked knowing what the Buddha was thinking went up to him and said
Rule Blessed One Rule Holy One Rule legitimately without killing or having someone kill for you without conquering or having someone conquer for you without sorrowing or causing sorrow
But what do you see Wicked One that you say this to me
The Blessed One sir has developed and cultivated the four bases for psychic power made them a vehicle and a basis kept them up consolidated them and properly implemented them
If he wished the Blessed One need only determine that the Himalaya king of mountains was gold and it would turn into gold
Take a golden mountain
made entirely of gold and double it
its still not enough for one
Knowing this live a moral life
When a person has seen where suffering comes from
how could they incline towards sensual pleasures
Realizing that attachment is a chain in the world
a person would train to remove it

You must go to the next life So you should do what is skillful you should practice the spiritual life
Noone born is immortal
A long life is a hundred years or a little more
Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse
The life of humans is long
A good person wouldnt scorn it
Live like a suckling babe

The life of humans is short

They should live as though their head was on fire

Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Pañcasālā for alms
Now at that time Māra had possessed the brahmins and householders of Pañcasālā so that they thought
Dont let the ascetic Gotama get any alms
Then the Buddha left the village with his bowl as cleanwashed as it was when he entered for alms
Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and said to him
Well ascetic did you get any alms
Wicked One did you make sure I didnt get any alms
Well then sir let the Buddha enter Pañcasālā a second time for alms

So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Silāvatī
Now at that time several mendicants were meditating not far from the Buddha diligent keen and resolute
Then Māra the Wicked manifested in the form of a brahmin with a large matted dreadlock wearing an antelope hide He was old bent double wheezing and held a staff made of cluster fig tree wood He went up to those mendicants and said
Youve gone forth while young reverends Youre blackhaired blessed with youth in the prime of life and youve never flirted with sensual pleasures
Enjoy human sensual pleasures
Dont give up what is visible in the present to chase after what takes effect over time
Brahmin thats not what were doing
Were giving up what takes effect over time to chase after what is visible in the present
For the Buddha says that sensual pleasures take effect over time they give much suffering and distress and they are all the more full of drawbacks
But this teaching is visible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselves
When they had spoken Māra the Wicked shook his head waggled his tongue raised his eyebrows until his brow puckered in three furrows and departed leaning on his staff
Then those senior mendicants went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened
The Buddha said
Mendicants that was no brahmin
That was Māra the Wicked who came to pull the wool over your eyes
Then knowing the meaning of this on that occasion the Buddha recited this verse
When a person has seen where suffering comes from
how could they incline towards sensual pleasures
Realizing that attachment is a chain in the world

But then he fell away from that temporary freedom of heart
For a second 
sixth time Godhika experienced temporary freedom of heart
But for a sixth time he fell away from it
For a seventh time Godhika meditating diligent keen and resolute experienced temporary freedom of heart
Then he thought
Ive fallen away from this temporary freedom of heart no less than six times
Why dont I slit my wrists
And then Māra the Wicked knowing what Godhika was thinking went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse
O great hero O greatly wise
Shining with power and glory
Youve gone beyond all threats and perils
I bow to your feet O seer
Great hero master of death
your disciple longs for death
hes planning for it
Stop him O lightbringer
For how Blessed One can a disciple of yours
one who loves your teaching
a trainee who hasnt achieved their hearts desire
take his own life O renowned one
Now at that time Venerable Godhika had already slit his wrists
Then the Buddha knowing that this was Māra the Wicked addressed him in verse
This is how the wise act
for they dont long for life
Having plucked out craving root and all
Godhika is extinguished
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants
Come mendicants lets go to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili where Godhika who came from a good family slit his wrists
Yes sir they replied
Then the Buddha together with several mendicants went to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili
The Buddha saw Godhika off in the distance lying on his cot having cast off the aggregates
Now at that time a cloud of black smoke was moving east west north south above below and inbetween
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants
Mendicants do you see that cloud of black smoke moving east west north south above below and inbetween
Yes sir
Thats Māra the Wicked searching for Godhikas consciousness wondering
Where is Godhikas consciousness established
But since his consciousness is not established Godhika is extinguished
Then Māra carrying his harp of yellow wood apple went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse
Above below and all around
in the four quarters and inbetween
Ive been searching without success
where has that Godhika got to
He was a wise and steadfast sage
a meditator who loved to practice absorption
By day and by night he applied himself
without concern for his life
He defeated the army of death
and wont return for any future life
Having plucked out craving root and all
Godhika is extinguished

Any bird that flies there is flung about by those galeforce winds
Their feet go one way their wings another their head another and their body another
In the same way take a certain monk whose mind is overcome and overwhelmed by possessions honor and popularity He robes up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe enters the village or town for alms without guarding body speech and mind without establishing mindfulness and without restraining the sense faculties
There he sees a female scantily clad with revealing clothes
Lust infects his mind
He resigns the training and returns to a lesser life
Some take his robe others his bowl others his sitting cloth others his needle case just like the bird flung about by the galeforce winds
So brutal are possessions honor and popularity

At one time Venerable Lomasavaṅgīsa was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery
Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to Venerable Lomasavaṅgīsa bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir is the meditation of a trainee just the same as the meditation of a Realized One Or is the meditation of a trainee different from the meditation of a Realized One
Reverend Mahānāma the meditation of a trainee and a realized one are not the same
they are different
Those mendicants who are trainees havent achieved their hearts desire but live aspiring for the supreme sanctuary They meditate after giving up the five hindrances
What five
The hindrances of sensual desire ill will
dullness and drowsiness
restlessness and remorse
and doubt
Those who are trainee mendicants  meditate after giving up the five hindrances
Those mendicants who are perfectedwho have ended the defilements completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and are rightly freed through enlightenmentfor them the five hindrances are cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated and unable to arise in the future

There he addressed the mendicants
Mendicants I wish to go on retreat for three months
Noone should approach me except for the one who brings my almsfood
Yes sir replied those mendicants And noone approached him except for the one who brought the almsfood
Then after three months had passed the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants
Mendicants if wanderers who follow another path were to ask you
Reverends what was the ascetic Gotamas usual meditation during the rainy season residence You should answer them like this
Reverends the ascetic Gotamas usual meditation during the rainy season residence was immersion due to mindfulness of breathing
In this regard mindful I breathe in Mindful I breathe out

Then the Buddha said to the mendicants
Mendicants I wish to go on retreat for a fortnight
Noone should approach me except for the one who brings my almsfood
Yes sir replied those mendicants And noone approached him except for the one who brought the almsfood
Then those mendicants thought
The Buddha spoke in many ways about the meditation on ugliness He praised the meditation on ugliness and its development They committed themselves to developing the many different facets of the meditation on ugliness
Becoming horrified repelled and disgusted with this body they looked for someone to slit their wrists
Each day ten twenty or thirty mendicants slit their wrists
Then after a fortnight had passed the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed nanda

Mendicants if wanderers who follow another path were to ask you
Reverends what was the ascetic Gotamas usual meditation during the rainy season residence You should answer them like this
Reverends the ascetic Gotamas usual meditation during the rainy season residence was immersion due to mindfulness of breathing
In this regard mindful I breathe in Mindful I breathe out

With Citta
First Isidatta
At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove
Then Citta the householder went up to them bowed sat down to one side and said to them
Sirs may the senior mendicants please accept my offering of tomorrows meal
They consented in silence
Knowing that the senior mendicants had consented Citta got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled them keeping them on his right before leaving
Then when the night had passed the senior mendicants robed up in the morning and taking their bowls and robes went to Cittas home and sat down on the seats spread out
Then Citta went up to them bowed sat down to one side and asked the senior venerable
Sir they speak of the diversity of elements
In what way did the Buddha speak of the diversity of elements
When he said this the senior venerable kept silent
For a second time 
And for a third time Citta asked him
Sir they speak of the diversity of elements
In what way did the Buddha speak of the diversity of elements
And a second time and a third time the senior venerable kept silent
Now at that time Venerable Isidatta was the most junior mendicant in that Saṅgha
He said to the senior venerable
Sir may I answer Cittas question
Answer it Reverend Isidatta
Householder is this your question
They speak of the diversity of elements
In what way did the Buddha speak of the diversity of elements
Yes sir
This is the diversity of elements spoken of by the Buddha
The eye element the sights element the eye consciousness element 
The mind element the thought element the mind consciousness element
This is how the Buddha spoke of the diversity of elements
Then Citta having approved and agreed with what Isidatta said served and satisfied the senior mendicants with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods
When the senior mendicants had eaten and washed their hands and bowls they got up from their seats and left
Then the senior venerable said to Venerable Isidatta
Isidatta its good that you felt inspired to answer that question because I didnt
So when a similar question comes up you should also answer it as you feel inspired

Seeing the Sick
Now at that time the householder Citta was sick suffering gravely ill
Then several deities of the parks forests trees and those who haunt the herbs grass and big trees came together and said to Citta
Householder make a wish to become a wheelturning monarch in the future
When they said this Citta said to them
That too is impermanent That too will pass That too will be left behind
When he said this his friends and colleagues relatives and family members said
Be mindful master Dont babble
What have I said that makes you say that
Its because you said
That too is impermanent That too will pass That too will be left behind
Oh well thats because the deities of the parks forests trees and those who haunt the herbs grass and big trees said to me
Householder make a wish to become a wheelturning monarch in the future
So I said to them
That too is impermanent That too will pass That too will be left behind
But what reason do they see for saying that to you
They think
This householder Citta is ethical of good character
If he makes a wish to
become a wheelturning monarch in the future his hearts wish will succeed because of the purity of his ethics And then as a proper principled king he will provide proper spiritofferings
Thats the reason they see for saying to me
Householder make a wish to become a wheelturning monarch in the future
So I said to them
That too is impermanent That too will pass That too will be left behind
Then master advise us

We will have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha
The Saṅgha of the Buddhas disciples is practicing the way thats good direct methodical and proper It consists of the four pairs the eight individuals This is the Saṅgha of the Buddhas disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods worthy of hospitality worthy of a religious donation worthy of greeting with joined palms and is the supreme field of merit for the world

Second With Isidatta
At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove
Then Citta the householder went up to them bowed sat down to one side and said to them
Sirs may the senior mendicants please accept my offering of tomorrows meal
They consented in silence
Then knowing that the senior mendicants had consented Citta got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled them keeping them on his right before leaving
Then when the night had passed the senior mendicants robed up in the morning and taking their bowls and robes went to Cittas home and sat down on the seats spread out
So he went up to them bowed sat down to one side and said to the senior venerable
Sir there are many different views that arise in the world For example
the cosmos is eternal or not eternal or finite or infinite the soul and the body are the same thing or they are different things after death a Realized One exists or doesnt exist or both exists and doesnt exist or neither exists nor doesnt exist
And also the sixtytwo misconceptions spoken of in the Prime Net Discourse
When what exists do these views come to be When what doesnt exist do these views not come to be
When he said this the senior venerable kept silent
For a second time 
And for a third time Citta said to him
Sir there are many different views that arise in the world 
When what exists do these views come to be When what doesnt exist do these views not come to be
And a second time and a third time the senior venerable kept silent
Now at that time Venerable Isidatta was the most junior mendicant in that Saṅgha
He said to the senior venerable
Sir may I answer Cittas question
Answer it Reverend Isidatta
Householder is this your question
There are many different views that arise in the world 
When what exists do these views come to be When what doesnt exist do these views not come to be
Yes sir
Householder there are many different views that arise in the world For example
the cosmos is eternal or not eternal or finite or infinite the soul and the body are the same thing or they are different things after death a Realized One exists or doesnt exist or both exists and doesnt exist or neither exists nor doesnt exist
And also the sixtytwo misconceptions spoken of in the Prime Net Discourse
These views come to be when identity view exists When identity view does not exist they do not come to be
But sir how does identity view come about
Its when an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve not seen good persons and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons
They regard form as self self as having form form in self or self in form
They regard feeling 
consciousness as self self as having consciousness consciousness in self or self in consciousness
Thats how identity view comes about
But sir how does identity view not come about
Its when an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve seen good persons and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons
They dont regard form as self self as having form form in self or self in form
They dont regard feeling 
perception 
consciousness as self self as having consciousness consciousness in self or self in consciousness
Thats how identity view does not come about
Sir where has Venerable Isidatta come from
I come from Avanti householder
Sir theres a friend of mine called Isidatta who Ive never met Hes gone forth from a good family in Avanti
Have you met him
Yes householder
Sir where is that venerable now staying
When he said this Isidatta kept silent
Sir are you that Isidatta
Yes householder
Sir I hope Venerable Isidatta is happy here in Macchikāsaṇḍa
for the Wild Mango Grove is lovely
Ill make sure that Venerable Isidatta is provided with robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick
Thats nice of you to say householder
Then Citta having approved and agreed with what Isidatta said served and satisfied the senior mendicants with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods
When the senior mendicants had eaten and washed their hands and bowls they got up from their seats and left
Then the senior venerable said to Venerable Isidatta
Isidatta its good that you felt inspired to answer that question because I didnt
So when a similar question comes up you should also answer it as you feel inspired
But Isidatta set his lodgings in order and taking his bowl and robe left Macchikasaṇḍa
never to return

First With Kāmabhū
At one time Venerable Kāmabhū was staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove
Then Citta the householder went up to Venerable Kāmabhū bowed and sat down to one side
Kāmabhū said to him
Householder there is this saying
With flawless wheel and white canopy
the onespoke chariot rolls on
See it come untroubled
with stream cut unbound
How should we see the detailed meaning of this brief statement
Sir was this spoken by the Buddha
Yes householder
Well then sir please wait a moment while I consider the meaning of this
Then after a short silence Citta said to Kāmabhū
Sir flawless wheel is a term for ethics
White canopy is a term for freedom
One spoke is a term for mindfulness
Rolls on is a term for going forward and coming back
Chariot is a term for this body made up of the four primary elements produced by mother and father built up from rice and porridge liable to impermanence to wearing away and erosion to breaking up and destruction
Greed hate and delusion are troubles
A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump and obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future
Thats why a mendicant who has ended the defilements is called untroubled
The one who comes is a term for the perfected one
Stream is a term for craving
A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given this up cut it off at the root made it like a palm stump and obliterated it so its unable to arise in the future
Thats why a mendicant who has ended the defilements is said to have cut the stream
Greed hate and delusion are bonds
A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump and obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future
Thats why a mendicant who has ended the defilements is called unbound
So sir thats how I understand the detailed meaning of what the Buddha said in brief
With flawless wheel and white canopy
the onespoke chariot rolls on
See it come untroubled
with stream cut unbound

Second With Kāmabhū
At one time Venerable Kāmabhū was staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove
Then Citta the householder went up to Venerable Kāmabhū sat down to one side and said to him
Sir how many processes are there
Householder there are three processes
Physical verbal and mental processes
Saying Good sir Citta approved and agreed with what Kāmabhū said Then he asked another question
But sir what is the physical process Whats the verbal process Whats the mental process
Breathing is a physical process Placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes Perception and feeling are mental processes
Saying Good sir he asked another question
But sir why is breathing a physical process Why are placing the mind and keeping it connected verbal processes Why are perception and feeling mental processes
Breathing is physical
Its tied up with the body thats why breathing is a physical process
First you place the mind and keep it connected then you break into speech Thats why placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes
Perception and feeling are mental
Theyre tied up with the mind thats why perception and feeling are mental processes
Saying Good sir he asked another question
But sir how does someone attain the cessation of perception and feeling
A mendicant who is entering such an attainment does not think
I will enter the cessation of perception and feeling or I am entering the cessation of perception and feeling or I have entered the cessation of perception and feeling
Rather their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state
Saying Good sir he asked another question
But sir which cease first for a mendicant who is entering the cessation of perception and feeling physical verbal or mental processes
Verbal processes cease first then physical then mental
Saying Good sir he asked another question
Whats the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling
When someone dies their physical verbal and mental processes have ceased and stilled their vitality is spent their warmth is dissipated and their faculties have disintegrated
When a mendicant has attained the cessation of perception and feeling their physical verbal and mental processes have ceased and stilled But their vitality is not spent their warmth is not dissipated and their faculties are very clear
Thats the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling
Saying Good sir he asked another question
But sir how does someone emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling
A mendicant who is emerging from such an attainment does not think
I will emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling or I am emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling or I have emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling
Rather their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state
Saying Good sir he asked another question
But sir which arise first for a mendicant who is emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling physical verbal or mental processes
Mental processes arise first then physical then verbal
Saying Good sir he asked another question
But sir when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling how many kinds of contact do they experience
They experience three kinds of contact
emptiness signless and undirected contacts
Saying Good sir he asked another question
But sir when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling what does their mind slant slope and incline to
Their mind slants slopes and inclines to seclusion
Saying Good sir Citta approved and agreed with what Kāmabhū said Then he asked another question
But sir how many things are helpful for attaining the cessation of perception and feeling
Well householder youve finally asked what you should have asked first
Nevertheless I will answer you
Two things are helpful for attaining the cessation of perception and feeling
serenity and discernment

With Godatta
At one time Venerable Godatta was staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove
Then Citta the householder went up to Venerable Godatta bowed and sat down to one side
Godatta said to him
Householder the limitless release of the heart and the release of the heart through nothingness and the release of the heart through emptiness and the signless release of the heart do these things differ in both meaning and phrasing Or do they mean the same thing and differ only in the phrasing
Sir there is a way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing
But theres also a way in which they mean the same thing and differ only in the phrasing
And whats the way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing
Its when a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth
In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion 
They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing 
They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth
In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
This is called the limitless release of the heart
And what is the release of the heart through nothingness
Its when a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness
This is called the release of the heart through nothingness
And what is the release of the heart through emptiness
Its when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut and reflects like this
This is empty of a self or what belongs to a self
This is called the release of the heart through emptiness
And what is the signless hearts release
Its when a mendicant not focusing on any signs enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart
This is called the signless release of the heart
This is the way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing
And whats the way in which they mean the same thing and differ only in the phrasing
Greed hate and delusion are makers of limits
A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump and obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future
The unshakable release of the heart is said to be the best kind of limitless release of the heart
That unshakable release of the heart is empty of greed hate and delusion
Greed is something hate is something and delusion is something
A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump and obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future
The unshakable release of the heart is said to be the best kind of release of the heart through nothingness
That unshakable release of the heart is empty of greed hate and delusion

With Kassapa the Naked Ascetic
Now at that time the naked ascetic Kassapa who in lay life was an old friend of Citta had arrived at Macchikāsaṇḍa
Citta the householder heard that he had arrived
So he went up to him and they exchanged greetings
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the naked ascetic Kassapa
Sir Kassapa how long has it been since you went forth
Its been thirty years householder
But sir in these thirty years have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones a meditation at ease
I have no such achievement householder only nakedness baldness and pokes in the buttocks
Citta said to him
Its incredible its amazing
how well explained the teaching is For in thirty years you have achieved no superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones no meditation at ease only nakedness baldness and pokes in the buttocks
But householder how long have you been a lay follower
Its been thirty years sir
But householder in these thirty years have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones a meditation at ease
How sir could I not
For whenever I want quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
And whenever I want as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled  I enter and remain in the second absorption
And whenever I want with the fading away of rapture  I enter and remain in the third absorption
And whenever I want giving up pleasure and pain  I enter and remain in the fourth absorption
If I pass away before the Buddha it wouldnt be surprising if the Buddha declares of me
The householder Citta is bound by no fetter that might return him to this world
When this was said Kassapa said to Citta
Its incredible its amazing
how well explained the teaching is For a whiteclothed layperson can achieve such a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones a meditation at ease
Sir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
Then Citta the householder took the naked ascetic Kassapa to see the senior mendicants and said to them
Sirs this is the naked ascetic Kassapa who in lay life was an old friend of mine
May the senior monks give him the going forth the ordination
Ill make sure that hes provided with robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick
And the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth the ordination in this teaching and training
Not long after his ordination Venerable Kassapa living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
He understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence

Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta
Now at that time Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta had arrived at Macchikāsaṇḍa together with a large assembly of Jain ascetics
Citta the householder heard that they had arrived
Together with several lay followers he went up to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said to him
Householder do you have faith in the ascetic Gotamas claim that
there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected
Sir in this case I dont rely on faith in the Buddhas claim that
there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected
When he said this Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta looked up at his assembly and said
See good sirs how straightforward this householder Citta is Hes not devious or deceitful at all To imagine that you can stop placing the mind and keeping it connected would be like imagining that you can catch the wind in a net or dam the Ganges river with your own hand
What do you think sir
Which is betterknowledge or faith
Knowledge is definitely better than faith householder
Well sir whenever I want quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
And whenever I want as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled  I enter and remain in the second absorption
And whenever I want with the fading away of rapture  I enter and remain in the third absorption
And whenever I want giving up pleasure and pain  I enter and remain in the fourth absorption
And so sir since I know and see like this why should I rely on faith in another ascetic or brahmin who claims that
there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected
When he said this Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta looked askance at his own assembly and said
See good sirs how crooked this householder Citta is Hes so devious and deceitful
Sir just now I understood you to say
See good sirs how straightforward this householder Citta is Hes not devious or deceitful at all
But then I understood you to say
See good sirs how crooked this householder Citta is Hes so devious and deceitful
If your first statement is true the second is wrong
If your first statement is wrong the second is true
And also sir these ten legitimate questions are relevant
When you understand what they mean then together with your assembly of Jain ascetics you can rebut me
One thing question summary and answer Two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine  ten things question summary and answer
Then Citta got up from his seat and left without asking Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta these ten legitimate questions

The Fetter
At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove
Now at that time after the meal on return from almsround several senior mendicants sat together in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them
Reverends the fetter and the things prone to being fettered do these things differ in both meaning and phrasing Or do they mean the same thing and differ only in the phrasing
Some senior mendicants answered like this
Reverends the fetter and the things prone to being fettered these things differ in both meaning and phrasing
But some senior mendicants answered like this
Reverends the fetter and the things prone to being fettered mean the same thing they differ only in the phrasing
Now at that time the householder Citta had arrived at Migapathaka on some business
He heard about what those senior mendicants were discussing
So he went up to them bowed sat down to one side and said to them
Sirs I heard that you were discussing whether the fetter and the things prone to being fettered differ in both meaning and phrasing or whether they mean the same thing and differ only in the phrasing
Thats right householder
Sirs the fetter and the things prone to being fettered these things differ in both meaning and phrasing
Well then sirs I shall give you a simile
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said
Suppose there was a black ox and a white ox yoked by a single harness or yoke
Would it be right to say that
the black ox is the yoke of the white ox or the white ox is the yoke of the black ox
No householder
The black ox is not the yoke of the white ox nor is the white ox the yoke of the black ox
The yoke there is the single harness or yoke that theyre yoked by
In the same way the eye is not the fetter of sights nor are sights the fetter of the eye
The fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them
The ear  nose  tongue  body 
mind is not the fetter of thoughts nor are thoughts the fetter of the mind
The fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them
Youre fortunate householder so very fortunate

Mahakas Demonstration
At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove
Then Citta the householder went up to them bowed sat down to one side and said to them
Sirs may the senior mendicants please accept my offering of tomorrows meal in my barn
They consented in silence
Then knowing that the senior mendicants had consented Citta got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled them keeping them on his right before leaving
Then when the night had passed the senior mendicants robed up in the morning and taking their bowls and robes went to Cittas barn and sat down on the seats spread out
Then Citta served and satisfied the senior mendicants with his own hands with delicious milkrice made with ghee
When the senior mendicants had eaten and washed their hands and bowls they got up from their seats and left
Citta instructed that the remainder of the food be distributed then followed behind the senior mendicants
Now at that time the heat was sweltering
And those senior mendicants walked along as if their bodies were melting as happens after a meal
Now at that time Venerable Mahaka was the most junior mendicant in that Saṅgha
Then Venerable Mahaka said to the senior venerable
Wouldnt it be nice sir if a cool wind blew a cloud canopy formed and a gentle rain drizzled down
It would indeed be nice Reverend Mahaka
Then Mahaka used his psychic power to will that a cool wind would blow a cloud canopy would form and a gentle rain would drizzle down
Then Citta thought
The most junior mendicant in this Saṅgha has such psychic power
When they reached the monastery Mahaka said to the senior venerable
Sir is that sufficient
Thats sufficient Reverend Mahaka
youve done enough
and offered enough
Then the senior mendicants entered their dwellings
and Mahaka entered his own dwelling
Then Citta went up to Mahaka bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir please show me a superhuman demonstration of psychic power
Well then householder place your upper robe on the porch and spread a handful of grass on it
Yes sir replied Citta and did as he was asked
Mahaka entered his dwelling and latched the door Then he used his psychic power to will that a flame shoot out through the keyhole and the chink in the door and it burned up the grass but not the upper robe
Then Citta shook out his upper robe and stood to one side shocked and awestruck
Mahaka left his dwelling and said to Citta
Is that sufficient householder
Thats sufficient sir
youve done enough
and offered enough
I hope Venerable Mahaka is happy here in Macchikāsaṇḍa
for the Wild Mango Grove is lovely
Ill make sure that Venerable Mahaka is provided with robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick
Thats nice of you to say householder
But Mahaka set his lodgings in order and taking his bowl and robe left Macchikasaṇḍa

The FrankincenseTree Hut
At one time Venerable Anuruddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the frankincensetree hut
There Venerable Anuruddha addressed the mendicants
Reverends suppose that although the Ganges river slants slopes and inclines to the east
a large crowd were to come along with a spade and basket saying
Well make this Ganges river slant slope and incline to the west
What do you think reverends Would they succeed
No reverend
Why is that
The Ganges river slants slopes and inclines to the east
Its not easy to make it slant slope and incline to the west
That large crowd will eventually get weary and frustrated
In the same way while a mendicant develops and cultivates the four kinds of mindfulness meditation if rulers or their ministers friends or colleagues relatives or family should invite them to accept wealth saying
Please mister why let these ocher robes torment you
Why follow the practice of shaving your head and carrying an alms bowl
Come return to a lesser life enjoy wealth and make merit
Its simply impossible for a mendicant who is developing and cultivating the four kinds of mindfulness meditation to resign the training and return to a lesser life
Why is that
Because for a long time that mendicants mind has slanted sloped and inclined to seclusion So its impossible for them to return to a lesser life
And how does a mendicant develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation
Its when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body 
feelings 
principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world

Seclusion
So I have heard
At one time one of the mendicants was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove
Now at that time that mendicant during their days meditation was thinking bad unskillful thoughts to do with the lay life
The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant and wanted whats best for them So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up and addressed them in verse
You entered the woods desiring seclusion
yet your mind strays to outward things
As a person you should dispel the desire for people
Then youll be happy free of greed
Mindful give up discontent
let us remind you of the way of the good
The dusty abyss is so hard to cross
dont let sensual dust drag you down
Just as a bird strewn with dirt
sheds that clingy dust with a shake
so too an energetic mindful mendicant
sheds that clingy dust with a shake
Impelled by that deity that mendicant was struck with a sense of urgency

Getting Up
At one time one of the mendicants was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove
Now at that time that mendicant fell asleep during the days meditation
The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant and wanted whats best for them So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up and addressed them in verse
Get up mendicant Why lie down
Whats the point in sleeping
How can the afflicted slumber
when injured by an arrow strike
You should amplify the faith
that led you to go forth
from the home life to homelessness
Dont fall under the sway of slumber
Sensual pleasures are impermanent and unstable
but idiots still fall for them
Among those who are bound theyre free and unattached
why bother a renunciate
By removing desire and greed
by going beyond ignorance
that knowledge has been perfectly cleansed
why bother a renunciate
By breaking ignorance with knowledge
by the ending of defilements
theyre sorrowless unstressed
why bother a renunciate
Energetic resolute
always staunchly vigorous
aspiring to extinguishment
why bother a renunciate

With Kassapagotta

Now at that time Venerable Kassapagotta having withdrawn for his days meditation tried to advise a tribal hunter
Then the deity haunting that forest approached Kassapagotta wanting to stir him up and recited these verses
A tribal hunter wandering the rugged hills
is unintelligent unthinking
Its a waste of time to advise him
this mendicant seems to me like an idiot
The tribal hunter listens without understanding
he looks without seeing
Though the teaching is spoken
the fool doesnt get it
Even if you lit ten lamps
and brought them to him Kassapa
he wouldnt see anything
for he has no eyes to see
Impelled by that deity Venerable Kassapagotta was struck with a sense of urgency

like a winddeer in the wood
theyll call you flighty minded
and your practice wont succeed

Then after completing the three months of the rainy season residence those mendicants set out wandering
Not seeing those mendicants the deity haunting that forest cried And on that occasion they recited this verse
Seeing so many vacated seats today
it seems to me that they must have become dissatisfied
They were so learned such brilliant speakers
Where have these disciples of Gotama gone
When they had spoken another deity replied with this verse
Theyve gone to Magadha theyve gone to Kosala
and some are in the Vajjian lands
Like deer that wander free of ties

Then a certain deity of the company of the ThirtyThree named Penelope had been Anuruddhas partner in a former life She went up to Anuruddha and recited these verses
Set your heart there
where you used to live
among the gods of the ThirtyThree
whose every desire is granted
At the fore of a retinue
of divine maidens youll shine
Divine maidens are in a sorry state
stuck in selfidentity
And those beings too are in a sorry state
who are attached to divine maidens
They dont know pleasure
who dont see the Garden of Delight
Its the abode of lordly gods
the glorious host of Thirty
Fool dont you understand
the saying of the perfected ones
all conditions are impermanent
their nature is to rise and fall
having arisen they cease
their stilling is true bliss
Penelope weaver of the web
therell be no more lives in the hosts of gods
Transmigration through births is finished
now therell be no more future lives

The Thief of Scent
At one time one of the mendicants was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove
Now at that time after the meal on their return from almsround that mendicant plunged into a lotus pond and sniffed a pink lotus
The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant and wanted whats best for them So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up and addressed them in verse
This water flower has not been given
When you sniff it
this is one factor of theft
Good sir you are a thief of scent
I do not take nor do I break
I sniff the water flower from afar
So based on what evidence
do you call me a thief of scent
Why dont you accuse someone
who does such vandalizing
as digging up the roots
or breaking off the flowers
I have nothing to say
to a person who is a crude vandal
soiled like a used nappy
Youre the one who deserves to be spoken to
To the man who has not a blemish
who is always seeking purity
even a hairtip of evil
seems as big as a cloud
Indeed O spirit you understand me
and you empathize with me
Please speak to me again
whenever you see something like this
Im no dependent of yours
nor am I your servant
You yourself should know mendicant
the way that leads to a good place

At one time several mendicants were staying in the Kosalan lands in a certain forest grove They were restless insolent fickle scurrilous loosetongued unmindful lacking situational awareness and immersion with straying minds and undisciplined faculties
The deity haunting that forest had compassion for those mendicants and wanted whats best for them So they approached those mendicants wanting to stir them up and addressed them in verse
The mendicants used to live happily
as disciples of Gotama
Desireless they sought alms
desireless they used their lodgings
Knowing that the world was impermanent
