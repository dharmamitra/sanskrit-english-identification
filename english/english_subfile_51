They then all said Quiet and the pieces of hair were once more tucked behind their fingernails
Only then were the monks all happy to disperse and make their escapes Don't go too far said Brother Monkey and keep your ears open for news of me
If a notice is issued recalling Buddhist monks come to the city and return my hair The five hundred monks then scattered in all directions some went away and some stayed where they were
The story switches back to Sanzang who gave up waiting beside the track for Monkey to report back and told Pig to lead the horse Westward
They met monks hurrying away and when they were close to the city wall they found Monkey with a dozen or so monks who had not yet gone
Wukong said Sanzang reining in his horse why did it take you so long to get back from investigating that noise Monkey led the dozen or so monks in performing obeisances before Sanzang's horse and then told him everything that happened
Sanzang was horrified What are we to do if that's the way it is Please don't worry my lord said the dozen or so monks His Honour the Great Sage Monkey is a god down from Heaven whose divine powers are tremendous He will most certainly be able to protect you
We are monks from the Deep Wisdom Monastery a royal foundation in the city
Because our monastery was founded by the greatgrandfather of the present king and there is a statue of him there the monastery has not been demolished although all the others in the city big and small alike have been torn down
We would like to invite you to come straight into town to stay in our humble monastery The Great Sage Monkey is bound to find some way of coping at court tomorrow morning You are right said Monkey
Very well then let us go into the city without further delay The venerable elder then dismounted and went on foot to the city gate
The sun was setting in the West as they crossed the drawbridge and went in through the triple gates People in the streets turned away when they saw the monks of the Deep Wisdom Monastery leading a horse and carrying luggage
When they reached the monastery gates the travelers saw a large sign over them reading DEEP WISDOM MONASTERY
FOUNDED BY ROYAL COMMAND The monks pushed the gates open and led them through the Hall of the Vajrapanis before opening the doors of the main hall of the monastery
Sanzang covered himself with his cassock and worshipped the Buddha before Journey to the West entering
Steward the monks called and an old monk came out who kowtowed to Monkey the moment he saw him My lord are you really here he said
Do you know which lord I am bowing like that Monkey asked
I can see that you are Lord Sun the Great Sage Equaling Heaven the old monk replied
We see you in our dreams every night the Great White Planet is always coming in them to tell us that we will only be saved when you arrive
Now that I have beheld your distinguished countenance I know that it is the same as in our dreams I am glad you are here so soon my lord
Had you been a day or two later we would all have become ghosts by then Please get up said Monkey
Things will be sorted out tomorrow The monks then laid on a vegetarian meal for the master and his disciples and tidied up the abbot's lodgings for them to stay in They settled down for the night
A little before midnight Monkey who had too much on his mind to go to sleep heard music outside got up quietly dressed and sprang into the air to look around
To the South he saw lamps and candles burning bright and when he brought his cloud lower for a close look he saw that in the Temple of the Three Pure Ones the Taoists were performing a star ritual
What he saw was The high hall of the sanctum The true holy shrine
The high hall of the sanctum Was as majestic as Penghu's magic isle The true holy shrine Was mysteriously pure like the Huale Temple
On either side the Taoist priests played panpipes While the celebrant in the center held a tablet of jade
They explained The Elimination of Disaster And preached on The Way and its Power
When the dustraising dance was over the talismans were issued After making divine petition all lay down in respect
When the water had been blessed and the spirits summoned Journey to the West The fluttering flames of the candles rose up to the sky
When the Pole Star was located and the Dipper paced out Clouds of fragrant incense filled the void
Fresh food was offered on the votive tables And a rich repast of meatless food laid out
In front of the hall hung a pair of yellow brocade vertical scrolls on which were embroidered these words May winds and rains come as they should We pray for the boundless power of the Heavenly Honoured Ones
May rivers and seas be pure and peaceful We beg for many a year of life for His Majesty
Monkey saw three old Taoists wearing their religious robes he took them to be the Great Immortals Tiger Power Deer Power and Antelope Power
Standing below them to either side were a crowd of seven or eight hundred Taoists holding drums bells incense and divine petitions Monkey was delighted
I had meant to go down and fool around with them by myself he thought but one strand of silk can't make a thread and one hand can't clap
I think I'll go back and do Friar Sand and Pig a good turn by letting them join in the game with me Monkey then landed his auspicious cloud and went straight into the abbot's lodgings where he found Pig and Friar Sand sleeping top to toe
Monkey first called Friar Sand who woke up and said Aren't you asleep yet brother Get up said Monkey
We're going to have a good feed Whatever sort of good feed can I have in the middle of the night when my throat's dried out and my eyes are all bleary Friar Sand asked
There's the Temple of the Three Pure Ones in this city where the Taoist priests are holding a service Brother Monkey replied The Hall of the Three Pure Ones is full of offerings steamed buns as big as a bucket cakes that must weight fifty or sixty pounds apiece any amount of rice and fresh fruit too
Let's go and have some The talk of all this good food was enough to wake Pig up Won't you take me too brother he asked
If you want a feed said Monkey keep your voice down and don't wake the master
Come with me Journey to the West The two of them dressed slipped outside and leapt up by cloud with Monkey
As soon as the idiot saw the lights he wanted to attack but Monkey held him back and said Steady on
We'll go down when they've all gone But their recitations are only just warming up said Pig
They won't want to go I'll do some magic that will send them packing said Monkey
The splendid Great Sage said the words and made the hand movements of a spell drew in a breath from the quarter of the wind and blew a gale so terrible that as it tore into the Hall of the Three Pure Ones it knocked down all the vases candlesticks and offerings on the walls and put out all the lamps
The Taoists all shook with terror
You had better go disciples said the Great Immortal Tiger Power
This divine wind has blown out all the lamps and the incense so you should all go back to bed Get up early tomorrow morning and recite some more scriptures to make the numbers up The Taoists then did indeed all withdraw
Monkey then led Pig and Friar Sand to land their clouds and they charged straight into the Hall of the Three Pure Ones
The idiot grabbed some food not caring whether it was cooked or raw and was just about to eat it when Monkey raised his iron cudgel to hit him
Pig pulled back his hand and said You're going to hit me before I've even tasted anything Don't act so low said Monkey
You must pay your respects and sit down before eating You're shameless said Pig
You steal food and expect me to pay my respects too
What would I have had to do if we'd been properly invited Do you know who the three Bodhisattvas sitting up there are Monkey asked
Can't you recognize the Three Pure Ones themselves asked Pig How could you possibly think they are Bodhisattvas What about those Three Pure Ones Monkey asked
Oh well said Pig the one in the middle is the Original Celestial Pure One the one on the left is the Precious Pure One and the one on the right is the Supreme Lord Lao Zi We've got to make ourselves look like them before we can eat in safety said Monkey
The delicious smells of the offerings were making the idiot desperate with hunger so he climbed on the pedestal of the statue and knocked Lord Lao Zi off it with one shove of his snout You've sat here for long enough old man he said
It's my turn now Pig turned himself into the Supreme Lord Lao Zi Monkey turned himself into the Original Celestial Pure One and Friar Sand into the Precious Pure One
When the statues had all been pushed over and the three of them were sitting up there Pig grabbed a big steamed bun
Not so fast said Monkey
But brother protested Pig we've already made ourselves look like them
What are we waiting for Brother said Monkey eating is much less important than not giving ourselves away
If one of the Taoists got up early to hit the bell or sweep the floor and tripped over a piece of one of the statues we've knocked over the news would be out
You'd better hide them Journey to the West But where asked Pig
I'm a stranger here and I don't know my way around When we came in said Monkey there was a little pair of double doors to the right with an awful stench coming out of them It must be the place where the five kinds of grain prepare for reincarnation
Put them in there The idiot really did have some brute strength When he leapt down he put the three statues over his shoulders and carried them out
On kicking those doors open he found that it was in fact a big lavatory
That Protector of the Horses certainly knows how to talk he said with a laugh He even made up a fancy Taoist name for the shithouse'the place where the five kinds of grain prepare for reincarnation' Before tipping in the three statues he was carrying he mumbled a prayer
Three Pure Ones Three Pure Ones hear my prayer We have come here from afar to wipe out evil spirits
We wish to enjoy your offerings but there was nowhere we could sit So we've had to borrow your pedestals for a while
You have been sitting there long enough and now you can go into the cesspit
Normally you have no end of things to eat and you are pure Taoists
But today you'll have to taste some filth and be stinking Heavenly Honoured Ones His prayer said he threw them in with a great splash that covered half his tunic with evilsmelling liquid
When he went hack into the hall Monkey asked him Did you hide them properly I hid them well enough the idiot replied but I splashed some of that filthy water on my clothes
I hope the stench doesn't make you feel sick Never mind laughed Monkey come and eat now
But you'll have to clean up before we go outside The idiot turned himself back into Lord Lao Zi and the three of them sat down to eat their fill
First they ate the steamed bread and then they went on to the assorted cold dishes the rice the pastries the buns the biscuits the pancakes the doughnuts and the steamed pies They ate whatever they felt like not caring whether it was hot or cold
Now Monkey was not much of a one for cooked food so he just ate some fruit to keep the other two company
They cleaned everything up like shooting stars chasing the moon or a wind sweeping the clouds away
When there was nothing else left to eat they did not go but stayed there chatting and entertaining themselves while they digested the meal
What a thing to have done
There was a young Taoist priest who had just gone to bed in his dormitory by the Eastern cloister when he suddenly got up
I left my handbell in the hall he thought and if I lose it my master will be angry with me tomorrow You go to sleep he said to other priest who shared his bed while I go to look for it He was in such a hurry that he did not put his underclothes back on but just pulled on his tunic and went straight to the main hall to look for his bell
He groped all around till he found it and was about to turn and leave when to his consternation he heard the sound of breathing
As he fled in alarm he tripped on a lichee stone and crashed to the ground smashing his bell to pieces with a tremendous clang
Pig could not help roaring with laughter at this which terrified the young Taoist out of his wits
He staggered to the abbots lodgings knocked on the doors and said Masters disaster The three senior Taoist were not yet in bed so they opened the doors and asked What disaster I'd lost my bell said the young Taoist shivering and shaking and was looking for it in the hall when I heard a loud laugh that all but scared me to death Journey to the West Fetch lanterns said the senior Taoists on hearing this and see what evil creature it is This order was passed on to the priests young and old in both cloisters who all got up lit lamps and went to the main hall to look
If you don't know what they found listen to the explanation in the next installment
In the Hall of the Three Pure Ones the Great Sage Leaves His Name In the Kingdom of Tarrycart the Monkey King Shows His Powers The story tells how the Great Sage Monkey pinched Friar Sand with his left hand and Pig with his right The two of them realized what was happening and sat there on high their heads bowed in silence while the Taoists lit their lamps and shone them all around as they searched
The three of them looked just as if they really were made of clay covered with gold leaf
If no evildoers have been here said the Great Immortal Tiger Power how have the offerings all been eaten It looks as though people have eaten them said the Great Immortal Deer Power
The fruit with skins has all been peeled and the stones have all been spat out of the stone fruit But why can't we see anybody There is no need to be so suspicious brother said the Great Immortal Antelope Power
I think that the Heavenly Honoured Ones must have been moved by our reverence and respect in reciting scriptures and making readings day and night and by the name of His Majesty
Evidently the Three Pure Lords came down to the mortal world to enjoy these offerings
I suggest that we should worship the Heavenly Honoured Ones before they fly away on their cranes We should beg them for some holy water and golden elixir pills that we can present to His Majesty and thereby win credit for giving him immortality A good idea said Tiger Power
Let there be music and recitation my disciples he ordered and bring me my ceremonial robes so that I may pace out the Dipper dance and pray for immortality for His Majesty The young Taoists did as they were told and were soon neatly drawn up in two groups
At the sound of a stone chime they all began to recite in unison the True Classic of the Way and Its Power of the Yellow Court
Throwing his religious cloak over his shoulders Tiger Power took his jade tablet in his hands performed the ritual dance raising the dust before the statues prostrated himself in respect and submitted the following memorial to the Pure Ones In fear and trembling I bow my head in submission
We your subjects promote the faith and long for your pure emptiness
We are suppressing the low vulgarity of Buddhist monks and gaining respect for the brilliance of the Way
A holy temple has been built by command of His Majesty the King
Many an offering has been set out and the dragon banners hang high candles burn all night and incense smokes throughout the day
We worship with complete sincerity respect and devotion
Now that you have honoured us with your presence we beseech you before you go away in your immortal chariots to grant us tablets of golden elixir and holy water that we may present to His Majesty to bring him life as long as the Southern Hills Journey to the West Pig felt most uncomfortable at all this and he murmured under his breath to Monkey We shouldn't have stayed to be prayed to after eating the stuff
How are we going to answer their prayers Monkey gave him another pinch opened his mouth and called out Cease your worship young immortals
We have just come from a Peach Banquet so we did not bring any golden elixir or holy water today
We will present you with some another day When the priests young and old heard the statue speaking they all twitched at their clothes and trembled as they said My lord a living Heavenly Honoured One has come down to earth Don't let him go
Whatever you do get him to give us a recipe for eternal life Tiger Power then stepped forward bowed again and said Raising the dust while kowtowing in the sincerity of my heart your humble servant dutifully worships the Three Pure Ones
Since coming to this country we have promoted the Way and suppressed the Buddhist clergy
His Majesty adores the Way and respectfully wishes to prolong his years which is why we held this great service to heaven and recited scriptures all night
We are most fortunate that you Heavenly Honoured Ones have not disdained from descending in your holy chariots and have appeared in person
We beg you in your mercy to grant us the great boon of a little holy water to lengthen the lives of your disciples They must be desperate to get it praying for it again muttered Friar Sand under his breath to Monkey giving him a pinch
Then let's give them some said Monkey
But where will we get it mumbled Pig
Watch me said Monkey
When I get some you'll have some too The Taoists had by now finished playing their music Young immortals said Brother Monkey there is no need to prostrate yourselves
I did not originally want to leave any holy water with you in case it destroyed your offspring of immortality but there would be no difficulty at all about giving you some When the Taoists heard this they all prostrated themselves kowtowed and said We beg and implore the Heavenly Honoured One to grant your disciples some in recognition of the respectful devotion
We have widely taught the Way and its power and won the respect of the king for our sect of mystery Very well then said Monkey fetch a vessel The Taoists all once again kowtowed in thanks
Tiger Power who liked to show off carried in a great earthen jar that he placed in the hall
Deer Power put an earthenware dish on the table for offerings and Antelope Power took the flowers out of a vase and put it between the other two containers Withdraw from the hall all of you ordered Monkey and screen us off The secrets of Heaven must not be revealed
Then we can give you some holy water The priests then all prostrated themselves below the steps outside the hall and shut the doors
Monkey then stood up lifted his tigerskin kilt and filled the vase with stinking piss to the delight of Pig who said In all the years we've been brothers we've never done this before
I've just eaten and you ask me to do such a thing The idiot then lifted his clothes and noisily filled the earthenware dish The sound was like that of a torrent pouring down a mountainside
Friar Sand half filled the earthen jar
Journey to the West Then they all straightened their clothes sat down again and said Come and receive the holy water young immortals The Taoist elders then pushed the screens aside and kowtowed in worship and gratitude
When the jar was carried out and put together with the vase and the dish they called Disciples fetch me a cup to try some The younger Taoists fetched a teacup and handed it to the elders
The elder filled the cup drained it and made a show of wiping his mouth and smacking his lips
Is it good brother asked Deer Power
Pursing his lips together the most senior of the elders said Not very Tastes a bit off Let me have a taste said Antelope Power
When he had drunk a mouthful he said Tastes rather like pig's urine When Monkey heard this from where he was sitting up there he realized that his plans had been foiled I'm going to play a trick just for the hell of it for them to remember me by Then he shouted
Oh Way Oh Way what nonsense you imagine
What Three Pure Ones would ever descend to earth
Let me tell you our real names
We are Buddhist monks from the Great Tang travelling West on imperial orders
Having nothing else to do this pleasant evening we decided to come down to your temple halls
We had eaten the offerings and were sitting here chatting when you started kowtowing to us and worshipping us
How did you expect us to reply
What you've been drinking there isn't holy waterit's our piss Hearing this the Taoist priests shut the doors and started throwing rakes brooms tiles and stones wildly into the hall
Splendid Brother Monkey tucked Friar Sand under his left arm and Pig under his right rushed out through the door and rode his cloud straight back to the abbot's lodgings in the Deep Wisdom Monastery
The three of them went back to bed without disturbing their master
It was soon the third quarter of the fifth watch when the king held his dawn court audience at which the civil and military officials and the four hundred courtiers were all assembled under the crimson light of the silken lanterns and amid clouds of smoke from the incense burners
At just this time the Tang Priest woke up and called Disciples come with me when I go to show my passport and obtain an exit permit Monkey Pig and Friar Sand got out of bed and into their clothes quickly then stood waiting in attendance on the master
Master Monkey reported the king here trusts those Taoist priests He promotes the Way and persecutes Buddhist monks I'm afraid that if you say the wrong thing he'll refuse you an exit permit
We had better escort you to the palace The Tang Priest was delighted with this suggestion
He put on his brocade cassock Monkey took the passport Pig carried the begging bowl and Friar Sand the monastic staff
The luggage and the horse were entrusted to the care of the monks of the Deep Wisdom Monastery
They went straight to the Tower of Five Phoenixes at the palace gate where they bowed to the eunuch on duty and told him their names They said that they were monks from Great Tang in the East on their way to fetch the scriptures who had come to show their papers and obtain an exit permit and they asked him to pass the message on
The officer of the gate went straight to the throne hall where he prostrated himself by the steps and reported There are four monks outside awaiting Your Majesty's command by the Tower of Five Phoenixes They say they are from the Great Tang in the East and going to fetch scriptures To this the king replied Do they have Journey to the West to come looking for their deaths here Can't they do it anywhere else
Why didn't the police capture them and bring them here under arrest The king's tutor slipped forward to submit this memorial
Great Tang in the East is in the Southern Continent of Jambu It is known as the great land of China
It is over three thousand miles from here and the way is beset with many a demon
These monks must have some magic powers if they dared to travel West
I beg You Majesty to receive these monks who have come from the far country of China inspect their travel papers and let them proceed
Then you will be preserving good relations with China The king approved this suggestion
The Tang Priest and his disciples were summoned to the throne hall where they stood in a row before the steps and submitted their travel document to the king
The king had just opened the document and started reading it when the eunuch gate officer came in to report again The three Teachers of the Nation are here This threw the king into such a fluster that he put the paper away hurried down from the throne told his attendants to fetch embroidered stools and went out to meet the Taoist masters
Sanzang and his disciples turned round to look and saw the three Great Immortals come majestically in followed by a pair of page boys with their hair in bunches
They walked straight in while the civil and military officers all bowed low not daring to look up
As they entered the throne hall they did not deign to bow to the king who asked them Teachers of the Nation why have you honoured us with your presence although we have not yet invited you I have something to report the most senior of the Taoists replied
Where are those four Buddhist monks from They have been sent from Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven the king replied and they are here to obtain an exit permit The three Taoists clapped their hands with delight at this news
We thought they had already gone but they are still here What do you mean Teachers the king asked in astonishment They have only just come to report their names I was on the point of handing them over to you to use as you will when my tutor made a very sensible suggestion
Out of consideration for the great distance they have come and also to preserve good relations with the land of China I sent for them a moment ago and was just examining their papers when you three Teachers raised this question
Have they offended or harmed you To this the Taoist replied with a smile What Your Majesty does not yet know is that they arrived yesterday killed two of our disciples outside the East Gate released the five hundred captive Buddhist monks smashed our cart broke into our temple at night destroyed the statues of the Three Pure Ones and stole their offerings
We were so deceived by them that we though they were Heavenly Honoured Ones come down to earth and asked them for holy water and elixir pills to present to Your Majesty in the hope of securing eternal life for you
We never expected them to make fools of us by giving us urine
We each drank a mouthful to taste but when we tried to capture them they escaped
If they are still here now it's a case of meeting your enemy on a narrow road All this made the king so angry that he ordered the execution of the four monks
The Great Sage Monkey put his hands together and began to yell at the top of his voice Please hold back your thunderous wrath for a moment Your Majesty and allow us Buddhist monks to make our submission You have offended the Teachers of the Nation the king replied and what they say is always right Journey to the West He accuses me of coming here yesterday and killing two of his disciples said Monkey What witnesses does he have
Even if we admitted the killing you need only execute two of us monks to pay for their lives and you could release the other two to fetch the scriptures
He doesn't have any witnesses either for his accusations that I smashed their cart and freed the captive monks Even if I had done that wouldn't be a capital offence To punish one more of us would be enough
When he says I destroyed the statues of the Three Pure Ones and made havoc in the Taoist temple he's deliberately trying to frame and murder me Why the king asked
We are all from the East Monkey replied and have only just arrived here We don't even know our way round the streets so how could we possibly know what happened in his temple in the middle of the night
If we had given them some piss they should have arrested us on the spot They shouldn't make up these terrible accusations now
There are any number of people in the world who give false names He could not possibly tell that it was me
I hope Your Majesty will turn your wrath aside and have these charges properly investigated The king had been wild with fury before but now that he had heard what Monkey had to say he could not make up his mind
As the king was wondering what to do the eunuch gate officer came in once more to report Your Majesty there is a crowd of village elders outside the gates awaiting your summons What do they want the king asked and ordered them to be sent in
Thirty or forty of them were brought before the throne hall where they kowtowed to the king and said Your Majesty there has been no rain this spring and we fear a drought this summer
We have come here to submit a request to Your Majesty that you invite the Teachers of the Nation to pray for timely rain that will save the common people You may withdraw said the king
There will be rain The elders thanked him for his mercy and withdrew
Tang monks said the king do you know why we honour the Way and persecute Buddhist monks
When the Buddhist monks of this country prayed for rain some years ago they did not get a single drop
It was fortunate that Heaven sent down to us the Teachers of the Nation to bring help and deliverance
You have come from afar and offended the Teachers of the Nation and you thoroughly deserve to be punished for it If I spare you for the time being will you enter a rainmaking competition with the Teachers of the Nation
If you can bring about a good fall of rain that saves the common people we shall pardon your crimes return your paper and let you go
If you fail you will all be taken to the place of execution and publicly executed We humble monks know how to pray for things said Monkey with a smile
Hearing this the king ordered that the altars be swept clean and sent for his carriage as he was going to watch the ritual from the Tower of Five Phoenixes
The officials then moved him in his carriage to the tower where he was soon seated
The Tang Priest stood at the foot of the tower with Monkey Friar Sand and Pig while the three Taoist masters sat with the king in the tower
Before long an official galloped in to report Everything is ready at the altar
Will the Teacher of the Nation please come to the altar The Great Immortal Tiger Power bowed to take his leave of the king and descended from the tower
Brother Monkey blocked his way and said Where are you going sir To the altar to pray for rain the immortal replied Journey to the West You're being too arrogant said Monkey
Why don't you show some courtesy to us monks from far away
Oh well 'a mighty dragon can't crush a snake in its lair' You go first but you'll have to explain to His Majesty Explain what the Great Immortal asked
If we both pray for rain at the altar Monkey replied how will we know whether it's your rain or mine
It'll be hard to tell who should get the credit When the king heard this up on his tower he was discreetly delighted as he said That little monk talks sense Friar Sand too hid a smile as he thought The king doesn't realize that Monkey hasn't even started showing how much sense he has in him No explanations will be needed said the immortal
Of course His Majesty will know whose the rain is I'm sure he will said Monkey but we monks from far away have never met you before
If later on both sides made false claims that would be terrible
We must have it all sorted out before we start When I go to the altar said the Great Immortal this magic wand of mine will give the signal When it first sounds the wind will come
The second time the clouds will rise
The third time it will bring thunder and lightning
The fourth time it will rain
The fifth time the clouds will break up and the rain will finish Splendid said Monkey with a laugh
I've never seen anything like that
Please go ahead The Great Immortal then strode straight to the gates of the altar compound followed by Sanzang and his disciples
They looked up to see a raised terrace over thirty feet high
To the left and right of it were planted banners bearing the sign of the twentyeight zodiacal constellations and clouds of fragrant smoke rose from an incenseburner on a table set at the highest point on the altar
At each end of the table was a candleholder with candles burning brightly
Beside the incenseburner was a golden tablet inscribed with the titles of the gods of thunder and below the burner were five great vats all filled with clean water Sprigs of willow floated on them and on the willow was an iron plaque bearing the talisman of the Commander of Thunder
To the left and right of these were five stout posts on which were written the names of the five barbarian thunder heralds
By each post stood two Taoist priests ready to strike them with iron hammers
Behind the terrace many Taoist priests were writing things out and in the middle of them was a stove for burning paper and some model figures representing the messengers who carried the charms and the local gods who supported the Taoist teachings
The Great Immortal walked straight into the altar enclosure and without any show of modesty went straight up the altar mound and took his place
A young Taoist at his side handed him several yellow pieces of paper that had spells written on them and a precious sword
Holding the sword the Great Immortal recited a spell and burnt a spell on a candle
Two or three of the young Taoists standing below the altar mound passed him a model figure holding a spell and a written document both of which he also lit and burnt
Then there was a loud report from the wand and up in the sky the signs of a wind blowing up could be seen
This is bad muttered Pig The Taoist really has got some powers
He just had to sound his wand once to make the wind blow Keep quiet brothers said Monkey and don't say anything else to me
Look after the master while I get busy Journey to the West The splendid Great Sage then plucked out one of his hairs blew on it with magic breath called Change and turned it into an imitation Monkey who stood by the Tang Priest while his true self escaped rose up into the air and shouted Who's in charge of the wind This threw Granny Wind into such a fluster that she held her cloth bag closed while Young Master Xun tied the string round the mouth They both came forward and bowed to him
I'm protecting the holy priest from Tang on his journey to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures Monkey said We're now having a rainmaking competition with an evil Taoist in the country of Tarrycart Why are you helping him instead of me
If you put your wind away I'll let you off but if there's even enough wind to move a whisker in that Taoist's beard I'll give you twenty strokes each with my iron cudgel We wouldn't dare help him said Granny Wind and the wind then stopped
In his impatience Pig started to yell wildly Give up give up
You've sounded your wand and there's not a breath of wind Come down now and let us go up Once again the Taoist took his magic wand burnt spells and made a report with the wand The sky filled with clouds
Who's spreading the clouds out the Great Sage asked up overhead
Boy Cloudpusher and Young Lord Mistspreader bowed to him
Once again Monkey explained what had happened Cloudpusher and Mistspreader put the clouds away and the sun shone brightly once more in a clear sky
This teacher has been fooling the king and hoodwinking the common people laughed Pig He doesn't really have any powers at all
His wand has sounded for the second time and there's not a cloud to be seen By now the Taoist was getting anxious
Leaning on his sword he let down his hair said the words of a spell and cracked his magic wand for the third time
From the Southern Gate of Heaven the Heavenly Lord Deng led Grandfather Thunder and Mother Lightning to bow to Monkey in midair
Monkey told them what had happened and asked Why are you being so dutiful
What sort of orders are they you're obeying That Taoist really does know the Five Laws of Thunder the Heavenly Lord Deng replied He issued the right document burned the summons and alarmed the Jade Emperor who issued an edict to the offices of the Universal Honoured One of the Ninth Heaven Who Responds to the Primal with the Sound of Thunder
We are going on imperial orders to help Grandfather Thunder and Mother Lightning make rain In that case you'd better stay where you are and let me sort things out said Monkey and indeed the thunder did not sound nor did the lightning flash
The Taoist was becoming more anxious than ever He lit more incensesticks burnt charms said incantations and sounded his wand once more
The dragon kings of the four seas all gathered in midair
Where are you going Ao Guang Monkey asked
The four dragon kings Ao Guang Ao Shun Ao Qin and Ao Run came up and bowed to him
He told them what had happened then said When I troubled you the other day you didn't succeed
I hope you will help me again today We hear and obey replied the dragon kings Monkey then thanked Ao Shun
I am very grateful to your son for capturing the monster and saving my master the other day Journey to the West That wretch is being kept in chains in the sea the dragon king Ao Shun replied
I have not ventured to deal with him on my own initiative and I would like to ask you Great Sage to decide on his sentence Deal with him however you think fit replied Monkey
Now I would like you to do me a good turn
That Taoist has now sounded his wand four times so it's my turn to perform now
As I don't know how to use charms burn talismans or sound a magic wand I'll have to ask you gentlemen to help me out We would not dare disobey a command from the Great Sage Heavenly Lord Deng replied
But we can only act when proper orders are given
Otherwise the thunder and the rain will happen at the wrong times and the Great Sage will lose his credibility I'll give the signs with my cudgel said Monkey to the horror of Grandfather Thunder who protested But my lord none of us can take your cudgel No said Monkey I won't be hitting you with it
When I point up with it the first time I want wind We'll let the wind out promised Granny Wind and Young Master Xun
The second time I point up I want clouds We'll spread out the clouds said Cloudpusher and Mistspreader
The third time I point up with the cudgel I want thunder and lightning We shall obey we shall obey said Grandfather Thunder and Mother Lightning
The fourth time I point up with the cudgel I want rain Your orders will be carried out the dragon kings replied
And the fifth time I point up with the cudgel I want the sun shining in a clear sky
I won't have any disobedience or mistakes Having given his orders Monkey brought his cloud down shook his hair and put it back on his body
None of those with mortal fleshly eyes could see what had happened
Monkey then called out in a loud voice Please finish now teacher
You have sounded your magic wand four times without producing any wind clouds thunder or rain
It's my turn now The Taoist could stay at the altar no longer he had to come down and allow Monkey to take his place while he went with a long face to climb the tower to see the king
Wait while I go up with him and hear what he has to say said Monkey
He heard the king asking Why was there no wind or rain when you sounded your magic wand four times We are listening most carefully The dragons are all out today the Taoist replied
Your Majesty yelled Monkey today the dragons are all in
It was just that the Teacher of the Nation's magic didn't work and he couldn't get them to come
Just watch how we Buddhist monks can make them come Climb to the altar then said the king
We shall remain here and await rain Journey to the West As soon as he received this command Brother Monkey hurried to the altar compound tugged at the Tang Priest's clothes and said Master please climb the altar mound But I do not know how to pray for rain disciple said Sanzang He's trying to murder you said Pig
If there's still no rain they'll bring firewood along and send you up in flames You may not know how to pray for rain said Monkey but you're good at reciting scriptures
I'll help you Only then did the venerable elder start to climb to the altar When he reached the top he sat down with great dignity settled his nature brought his spirit under control and quietly recited the Prajnaparamita Heart Sutra
As he sat there an official messenger galloped up to him to ask Monk why aren't you sounding a magic wand or burning charms and summonses He doesn't need to Monkey shouted back
We pray in stillness and silence The official returned to the king to report this reply
When Monkey heard that his master had finished reciting the sutra he produced his cudgel from his ear waved it in the breeze to make it about twelve feet long and as thick as a ricebowl and pointed it towards the sky
As soon as Granny Wind saw it she opened her leather bag while Young Master Xun untied the rope round its mouth
There was then the howling of a wind that tore off tiles and sent bricks flying throughout the city
It was evidently a splendid wind not at all like ordinary ones
Willow were broken and flowers hurt Trees blown down in devastated woods
The walls collapsed in halls of nine stories Beams and columns were shaken in the Five Phoenix Tower
In the sky the red sun turned dark And the yellow dust of the earth began to fly
The officers before the reviewing stand were scared Terror struck the civil officials in their hall
The beauties of the harem had their hair blown untidy The royal consorts' coiffures were all ruined
Tassels fell from the coronets of nobles The black silk hat of the premier took wing
The king was too terrified to speak Journey to the West The eunuchs could not hand in their reports
Senior officials stood in disorder Highlevel functionaries broke ranks
Coloured pavilions and turquoise screens were ruined Green windows and crimson doors were wrecked
Bricks and tiles flew from the throne hall In the Brocade Cloud Chamber doors leaned and partition were smashed
Vicious indeed was this terrible gale Making hard for the king to see his sons And driving the people from streets and markets Every household firmly shut its doors
Just as this gale was at its height Brother Monkey gave another display of his divine powers as he pointed his goldbanded cudgel up into the sky for the second time
What could then be seen was The Boy Cloudpusher Young Lord Mistspreader
The Boy Cloudpusher showed his divine magic Making great rocklike heaps that hung down from the sky Young Lord Mistspreader used his powers 
To cover the earth with thick dense fog All was dark in the three markets Black were the six main streets of the city
Leaving the sea together with the wind They appeared with the rain in the Kunlun Mountains Filled heaven and earth in an instant Journey to the West Immediately covered the mortal world
All was reduced to obscurity And the doors of the Five Phoenix Tower disappeared
In an instant there was dense fog and thick clouds everywhere
Monkey then pointed his goldbanded cudgel into the air a third time with alarming results
Grandfather Thunder was angry Mother Lightning was furious
Grandfather Thunder was angry As he rode backwards on his fire beast down from Heaven Mother Lightning was furious As she left her Dipper Palace lashing out with her golden snake
The thunder crashed and roared Shaking the Iron Fork Mountain Brilliant flashes of red silk Flew from the Eastern Ocean
The noise rumbled like carts The flashes were like rice plants gleaming in the wind
The spirit of all living shoots revived Many a sleeping insect came to life
It terrified monarch and subject alike The sound made merchants nervously active
The thunder roared with the noise of an earthquake or a landslide so frightening the people in the city that they all burnt incense and imitation money
Deng shouted Monkey familiarly make sure that you kill me a few more corrupt officials who twist the laws and disobedient sons who do not do their duty to their parents as an example to the people The thunder became louder than ever and Monkey pointed his cudgel upwards for Journey to the West the fourth time
The dragons gave their orders And ram filled Heaven and earth As if the river in the sky was filling the heavenly gulf And as fast as clouds passing over the ocean's gates
It pattered on the roof of the tower Splashed against the windows
Now that the river in the sky had flooded White waves rolled along the streets
They moved around like a dish being picked up Splashed like water being tipped from a bowl
The lonely farm's houses were almost covered by the flood Which was nearly as high as the bridge across the river
The mulberry fields indeed were turning into sea And dry land was under water in an instant
This was the help the dragons gave As they lifted the Yangtse and poured the water down
The rain started at about eight in the morning and lasted till around noon by when all the streets inside and outside the capital of Tarrycart were running with water
The king then issued a command Enough rain has fallen now
If there is any more the growing crops will be drowned and it will be a disaster The officer on duty at the foot of the Tower of Five Phoenixes whipped his horse and rode through the rain to say Holy monk that is enough rain Hearing this Monkey pointed his goldbanded cudgel towards the sky again and at once the thunder stopped the wind fell the rain ceased and the clouds scattered
The king was delighted and all the civil and military officials said in admiration What a marvellous monk How true it is that however good you are at something there's always somebody better
Our Teachers of the Nation are very effective at making rain but when they ask for fine weather the drizzle goes on for hours before clearing up
However can this monk make the skies clear the moment he gives the word so that the sun shines bright on the instant and there isn't a cloud to be seen for miles around Journey to the West The king ordered that his carriage be taken back to the court where he would return the Tang Priest's passport with an exit permit and allow him to go
Just when he was placing the royal seal on the document the three Taoists came in to stop him saying Your Majesty that rain was caused not by the monk but by our efforts But you told me earlier that it did not rain because the dragon kings were not at home said the king
When the Buddhist monk went up to the altar and prayed in stillness and silence the rain came
How can you possibly try to take the credit from him When I went to the altar burnt the charms and summonses and sounded my magic wand the Great Immortal Tiger Power said the dragon kings would not have dared stay away
No doubt they had been called elsewhere which was why the authorities in charge of wind cloud thunder and rain were all out When they heard my order they hurried here which happened to be just when I was coming down from the altar and he was going up to it It was a coincidence that it rained then
Essentially it was I who summoned the dragons and made it rain
The credit can't possibly go to him In his confusion the king took this suggestion seriously and was once again unable to make up his mind
Monkey took a step forward put his hands together in front of his chest and said Your Majesty these heterodox magic tricks achieved nothing the credit is neither his nor mine
But the dragon kings of the four seas are still in the sky here I haven't sent them away and they wouldn't dare leave on their own initiative
If the Teacher of the Nation can make the dragon kings appear he can take the credit This delighted the king who said In the twentythree years we have been on the throne we have never seen what a live dragon looks like You must both display your magic powers
Whoever can make them come be he Taoist or Buddhist will have the credit and whoever fails will be punished Of course that Taoists did not have the power
In the presence of the Great Sage the dragon kings would not have dared show their faces in response to a call from the Taoists
We cannot do it said the Taoists
You summon them The Great Sage looked up to the sky and yelled at the top of his voice Where are you Ao Guang
You and your brothers must show yourselves to me in your true forms On hearing this summons the dragon kings soon appeared in their true forms writhing through the mist and clouds in the sky they danced through the air to the throne hall
This was what could be seen Flying transformations Coiling through the clouds
Their jade claws hung like white hooks Their silver scales danced with the brightness of mirrors Vigor was in every strand of their floating white beards And their horns rose proud and full of purity
Lofty were their foreheads Bright shone their round round eyes
Journey to the West None can predict their appearance Their flight is beyond appraisal
But when the rain was prayed for it fell And the skies cleared as soon as requested
These were holy and magical dragons Surrounding the palace with numinous radiance
The king burnt incense in his palace hall and the ministers bowed low in worship before the steps
Now that your noble selves have granted us your presence we need detain you no longer said the king
We shall have a thanksgiving mass said another day All you gods may now go too said Monkey
The king will have a thanksgiving mass said another day The dragon kings went straight back to their oceans and the gods all returned to Heaven Indeed
Great and boundless is the wonderful Dharma False faiths are smashed when its truth is revealed
If you don't know how evil was eliminated listen to the explanation in the next installment
False Faith Oppresses the True Dharma The Sage MindApe Eliminates Evil The story tells how when the king saw that Monkey had the power to summon dragons and order gods about he put his seal on the passports and handed them to the Tang Priest whom he allowed to continue on his journey West
The three Taoist masters were so terrified that they prostrated themselves in the Hall of Golden Bells and submitted a memorial to the king who came down from his dragon throne helped them to their feet with his own hand and said Why are you performing this obeisance to me today Your Majesty the Taoists replied we came here to help the country protect the state and look after the people
We have toiled here for twenty years but now these Buddhist monks have put themselves ahead of us and ruined our reputation with a magic trick
Are you not insulting us by letting them off their death sentences just because of some rain
We implore you to keep their papers and allow us three brothers to challenge them to another competition
What do you think The king of Tarrycart really was muddleheaded when he heard advice from the East he inclined to the East Journey to the West and when he was advised from the West he inclined to the West What sort of competition with them do you propose Teachers of the Nation he asked
We would like to compete with them in sitting in meditation said the Great Immortal Tiger Power
The Teacher of the Nation must have made a mistake the king replied
That monk comes from a sect that practices dhyana meditation He must have mastered the art of meditation before his emperor sent him to fetch scriptures Why would you want to compete with him at that The way we sit in meditation the Great Immortal replied is not the ordinary way It has a special name
'revealing one's holiness on a cloud ladder' What does that mean the king asked
A hundred tables are needed said the Great Immortal Fifty of them are piled one on top of each other to make the meditation platform Once must mount it not by using one's hands or a ladder but by riding a cloud to take one's seat on it and sit motionless for the agreed number of hours Realizing that this was rather difficult he asked this question
Monks the Teacher of the Nation would like to compete with you in a way of sitting in meditation called 'revealing one's holiness on a cloud ladder'
Can any of you do that When Monkey heard this he kept silent and did not reply
Brother asked Pig why aren't you saying anything I'll be honest with you Monkey replied
I can manage all sorts of tricks like kicking the sky into a well stirring up the sea turning rivers upside down lifting mountains chasing the moon away and moving stars and constellations around
I'm not afraid of having my head chopped off my brains sliced up my entrails laid open my heart cut out and being shifted about in other ways like that
But when it comes to sitting in meditation I'm beaten
I'm not a sitter by nature
Even if you chained me to an iron column I'd want to wriggle up and down
I'd never want to sit still Then Sanzang cut in with I can sit in meditation That's splendid said Monkey with delight splendid
But how long can you do it for When I was young Sanzang replied a monk of the Chan sect who came to my monastery taught the way of fastening one's being to the root settling the nature and fixing the spirit while on the boundary of life and death
I can sit for two or three years If you're going to sit there for two or three years Master said Monkey we can give up the idea of going to fetch the scriptures
You won't need to sit there for more than a few hours before coming down But I can't get up there disciple Sanzang protested
Go forward and accept the challenge said Monkey
I'll get you up there The venerable elder put his hands together in front of his chest and said This humble monk can sit in meditation The king then ordered that the meditation platforms be built
The state had the resources to tear down mountains and in less than an hour the two meditation platforms had been built one to each side of the throne hall
Journey to the West The Great Immortal Tiger Power then went down from the hall stood in the middle of the steps sprang into the air and went straight up on a cloud to the Western platform and set down
Monkey plucked out one of his hairs and turned it into a double of himself that stood below with Pig and Friar Sand while he made his real self into a coloured auspicious cloud that lifted the Tang Priest up through the air to take his seat on the Eastern platform
Then he put the cloud away turned into the tiniest of insects flow into Pig's ear and said Brother keep a very close eye on the master and don't talk to my double I understand I understand replied the idiot with a grin
The Great Immortal Deer Power had been sitting on his embroidered cushion for a very long time watching the two of them sitting on their high platforms without either emerging as the winner He decided to help his elder brother so he plucked a hair from the back of his head rolled it into a ball and flicked it straight at the Tang Priest's head where it turned into a huge bedbug that started biting the venerable elder
Sanzang first itched and then was in pain
When sitting in meditation movements of the hand are forbidden if he moved his hand he would lose
The agony was soon unbearable and he pulled his head down to scratch it against his collar
This is bad said Monkey
The master's being driven mad by epilepsy No said Friar Sand it's a migraine When Monkey heard this he said Our master is sincere and a gentleman If he says he can sit in meditation he most certainly can
Gentlemen don't lie
You two shut up while I go up there for a look The splendid Monkey then flew with a buzz straight up to the Tang Priest's head where he saw a bedbug the size of a bean biting the master
He immediately picked it off him then scratched and rubbed his head for him so that the venerable elder did not itch or ache any more and sat up straight again
Monks have bald heads thought Brother Monkey and not even a louse could settle on one let alone a bedbug
I think it must have been a trick by those Taoists to get the master killed
Well they haven't won yet despite their cheating
I'll try a trick on them Monkey then flew up and landed on the head of one of the ceramic animals on the roof of the palace hall He shook himself and turned into a poisonous centipede seven inches long that went straight for the Taoist and stung him in the nose
The Taoist could sit still no longer and tumbling head over heels he fell off the platform and would probably have died had not the senior and junior officials saved him
The horrified king sent the royal tutor to take the Taoist to the Hall of Literary Splendor to comb his hair and clean himself up meanwhile Monkey went up on his auspicious cloud to carry his victorious master down to before the steps of the throne hall
The king ordered that Sanzang be allowed to leave the country but the Great Immortal Deer Power made this submission
Your Majesty my elder brother has long suffered from rheumatism The heavenly wind in that high place brought on a new attack of his illness which was why the Buddhist monk won
Please keep him here so that I can compete with him at guessing objects through wooden boards What is guessing objects through wooden boards the king asked
This humble Taoist has the power of knowing what is on the other side of a board Deer Power replied and I would like to see whether that Buddhist monk can too
If he is better at guessing than I am let him go
But if he is not then I hope Your Majesty will decide what crime he is guilty of avenge us brothers and not allow our twenty years of protecting the country to be sullied Journey to the West The king was so utterly muddleheaded that he accepted this malicious suggestion and ordered that a red lacquered chest be carried by the eunuchs of the royal household into the harem where his queen was told to put one of her treasures inside
The chest was carried out and set in front of the steps of the throne hall a few moments later Your two faiths must each compete with your magical powers in guessing what treasure is in the chest he told the Buddhist and the Taoist
Disciple asked Sanzang how can I tell what is inside Monkey put his cloud away turned himself back into the smallest of insects landed on Sanzang's face and said Don't worry master
I'll go and take a look The splendid Great Sage flew over to the chest crawled under its legs and saw a crack between the boards through which he squeezed inside
Here he saw a red lacquer tray in which was placed a set of court robes a mountain river and state jacket and a heaven earth and land skirt
He picked them up shook and crumpled them bit the tip of his tongue sprayed a mouthful of blood over them called Change and turned them into a wornout cloak into which he pissed before crawling out through the crack between the boards
He then flew back to the Tang Priest's ear and said Master say that it's a wornout cloak But he told me to guess what treasure is inside said the Tang Priest
What sort of treasure is an old cloak Never mind about that said Monkey
Just make that guess The Tang Priest stepped forward and was just about to state his guess when Deer Power said I shall make the first guess The chest contains a mountain river and state jacket and a heaven earth and land skirt No said the Tang Priest it does not
The chest contains a rotten cloak That monk is being outrageous said the king He has the effrontery to suggest that our country has no treasures by guessing that it contains a tattered old cloak
Execute him The two groups of guards officers were just about to fall upon the Tang Priest when he called out desperately Your Majesty spare me for a moment while the chest is opened for you to look inside
If there really is a treasure there I shall accept my punishment but if there is not you would be doing me an injustice The king then ordered that the chest be opened and when the officials in attendance on him opened it and lifted out the red tray he saw that there really was a putrid old cloak on it
Who put that there asked the king in a great fury
The queen then slipped forward from behind the dragon throne to say My lord I put the mountain river and state jacket and the heaven earth and land skirt inside myself
I don't know how they can have turned into that You may retire good wife said the king I believe you
All the things used in the harem are of the finest silks and gauzes
We would never have anything like that He then ordered that the chest be carried up to him so that he could put a treasure inside it himself for another test
The king then went into the harem picked a peach as big as a bowl from the magic peach tree in the palace gardens placed it in the chest and had it carried down for the two of them to guess what it was
Disciple said the Tang Priest I have to guess again Don't worry said Monkey I'll take another look Once more he buzzed over went in through the same crack and saw a peach that was just to his liking
He turned back into himself and ate the peach clean up as he Journey to the West sat in the chest nibbling every single piece of it including the damaged parts of the skin and leaving the stone there when he turned back into the tiniest of insects and flew back to land on Sanzang's ear
Master he said guess that it's a peach stone Don't make a fool of me disciple said Sanzang
If I hadn't spoken up fast just now I would have been executed
This time I must guess that it is something precious and there is nothing precious about a peach stone Don't be afraid said Monkey
All that matters is winning Before Sanzang could speak the Great Immortal Antelope Power said I shall make the first guess
It is a magic peach It is not a peach only a peach stone said Sanzang
But we put the peach in there ourself said the king It could not possibly be only a stone
The Third Teacher of the Nation is right Your Majesty put in Sanzang open the chest up and look Once more the officials in attendance carried the chest up to be opened lifted out the dish and revealed only a stone with no skin or flesh a sight that shocked the king
Teachers of the Nation he said stop competing with him and let him go
We put the magic peach in there with our own hands If there is only a stone there now who can have eaten it
He must have gods or demons helping him in secret When Pig heard this he said to Friar Sand with a touch of a sarcastic grin The king doesn't realize that Monkey is an expert when it comes to eating peaches As he was saying this the Great Immortal Tiger Power came back into the throne hall after combing his hair and washing himself in the Hall of Literary Splendor Your Majesty he said this monk has the art of shifting and changing things Have the chest brought up here
I will break his magic and have another divination contest with him What do you want to guess now the king asked
Magic can change only things not people said Tiger Power
Hide this boy Taoist in the chest and I guarantee that the monk will not be able to change him The boy got inside the lid was put on and the chest carried down
Guess what treasure is inside it this third time monk the king said
Again exclaimed Sanzang to which Monkey replied Wait while I take another look Once more he buzzed over and squeezed inside this time to find a little boy inside
Splendid Monkey knew what to do How true it is that few in the world can do improvised transformations and hardly any as skillfully as he
He shook himself turned into the exact image of the old Taoist went into the chest and said Disciple Where have you come from master the boy asked him Journey to the West I came by disappearing magic Monkey replied
What instructions do you have for me the boy asked
The Buddhist monk saw you getting into the chest said Monkey and if he says that there's a young Taoist in here we'll have lost I've come here to work out a plan with you
We'll shave your head and guess that you're a Buddhist monk Do whatever you decide master said the boy as long as we win
If we lose to him again our reputation will be ruined and the king will have no more respect for us You are right said Monkey
Come here my boy and if we win I'll reward you richly He then turned his goldbanded cudgel into a razor put his arms firmly round the boy and said Put up with the pain there's a good boy and don't make a sound while I shave your head In an instant he had shaved off the boy's hair which he stuffed into a ball and hid in a corner of the chest
Then he put the razor away and stroked the boy's shaven pate saying Your head looks like a Buddhist monk's now my boy but your clothes are wrong
Take them off and I'll transform them for you The boy took off his greenishwhite cloudpatterned crane cloak with embroidered brocade hems
Monkey blew on it with a magic breath called Change and turned it into a brown Buddhist monk's habit for the boy to put on
Monkey pulled out two more hairs and turned them into a wooden fish that he gave to the boy saying Listen carefully disciple Whatever happens don't come out when you hear a call of 'Taoist boy'
But when you hear someone say 'Buddhist monk' lift the lid of the chest with your head strike the wooden fish and come out reciting a Buddhist surra
Do that and we will win But I can only recite the Classic of the Three Officials the Classic of the Dipper and the Classic of Elimination of Disaster said the boy I don't know any Buddhist scriptures Can you recite the name of a Buddha asked Monkey
Anyone can recite 'Amitabha Buddha' the boy replied
That'll have to do then said Monkey Recite the Buddha's name and save me the trouble of having to teach you a sutra
Remember what I've told you as I'm going now Monkey then turned back into the tiniest of insects squeezed out flew back to beside the Tang Priest's ear and said Master say that there's a Buddhist monk inside This time we are certain to win replied Sanzang
How can you be so sure Monkey asked
The sutras teach us that there are three treasures said Sanzang the Buddha the Dharma and the Clergy so a monk must count as a treasure As Sanzang was saying this the Great Immortal Tiger Power said Your Majesty this third time there is a Taoist boy inside Tiger Power called and called but the boy would not come out
Sanzang then put his hands together and said There is a monk inside There's a monk inside the chest shouted Pig at the top of his voice at which the boy raised the lid of the chest with his head and stepped out beating his wooden fish and repeating the name of the Buddha
The civil and military officials were so delighted that they all cheered while the terrified Taoists were at a loss for words
Journey to the West This monk is being helped by gods and demons said the king
How else could he have got into the chest as a Taoist boy and stepped out as a Buddhist monk
Even if a barber had got in with him he could only have shaved his head but he's wearing a wellfitting habit and repeating the Buddha's name too
Teachers of the Nation you must let those monks go To this the Great Immortal Tiger Power replied Your Majesty this is a case of a chessplayer meeting his match or a general coming up against a master strategist
We would like to try the martial arts we learned as boys in the Zhongnan Mountains against him What martial arts the king asked
We three brothers all have some divine powers Tiger Power replied
We can put our head back on when they have been cut off open up our chests cut out our hearts and make ourselves whole again and take a bath in boiling oil But those are all certain death exclaimed the king in horror
We have these powers said Tiger Power which is why I can give you a clear undertaking that we will not give up until we have been allowed a tournament with him Monkey had just turned himself back into the tiniest of insects and gone over to investigate when he heard all this
Reverting to his real form he roared with laughter and said What luck what marvellous luck
Business has brought itself to my front door But those are all ways of getting yourself killed said Pig
How can you talk about business coming to your front door You still don't know my powers said Monkey
But all the transformations you can do are more than enough said Pig
You can't have powers like that too To this Monkey said Cut off my head and I'll still go on talking Lop off my arms and I'll sock you another
Chop off my legs and I'll carry on walking Carve up my guts and I'll put them together
When anyone makes a meat dumpling I take it and down it in one
To bath in hot oil is really quite nice A warm tub that makes all the dirt gone Journey to the West When Pig and Friar Sand heard this they roared with laughter
Monkey then stepped forward and said Your Majesty this humble monk can be beheaded What do you mean you can be beheaded the king asked
When I was cultivating my conduct in the monastery many years ago Monkey replied a dhyana monk who came there taught me a method of being beheaded
I don't know if it's any good and I'd like to try it out today That monk is too young to have any sense said the king with a smile Having your head cut off isn't something that you can try out for I fun
Your head is the chief of the Six Positives and when it's cut off you're dead Your Majesty said the Great Immortal Tiger Power this is just the way I want him to act so that we can get our revenge on him Believing him the foolish monarch ordered that a place for public execution be prepared
As soon as the order was given three thousand men of the royal guard were drawn up outside the palace gates
The monk shall be beheaded first said the king Monkey cheerfully agreed
I'll go first I'll go first Then he put his hands together and shouted Teacher of the Nation I hope you'll forgive my effrontery in going first Monkey then turned round and went outside
Be careful disciple said Sanzang catching hold of him as he passed this is no place for fooling about What's there to be afraid of said Monkey
Stop holding me let me go The Great Sage went straight to the execution ground where the executioners grabbed him and tied him up so that he was like a ball When he was placed high on the earthen mound a shout of Behead him was heard and his head was cut off as the sword whistled down
The executioners then kicked it and sent it rolling thirty or forty paces away like a ripe watermelon
No blood came from Monkey's throat as a shout of Come here head rose from his stomach
The Great Immortal Tiger Power was so appalled by this display of magical skill that he said a spell and ordered the local deity Hold on to that head When I've beaten this monk I shall request His Majesty to rebuild your little shrine as a big temple and replace your clay statue with a gold one Now the local deity was under Tiger Power's control because Tiger Power had the fivethunder magic so he held Monkey's head down
Come here head Monkey called again but his head was no more able to move than if it had taken root there
Monkey was now feeling anxious so he made a spell with his hands burst out of the ropes that were binding him and shouted Grow In a flash another head grew on his neck so terrifying the executioners and the soldiers of the guard army that they all shivered and shook
The officer supervising the executions rushed into the palace to report Your Majesty when the little monk's head was cut off he grew another one So that's another trick our brother can do said Pig to Friar Sand with a mocking laugh
Journey to the West As he can do seventytwo transformations said Friar Sand he has seventytwo heads Before he had finished saying this Monkey came back and called Master Was it painful disciple asked a greatly relieved Sanzang
No it wasn't painful said Monkey it was fun Brother asked Pig do you need swordwound ointment Feel if there is a scar said Monkey
The idiot put out his hand and said with a smile of wideeyed astonishment Fantastic
It's completely wholethere's not even a scar While the brotherdisciples were congratulating each other they heard the king calling on them to take their passport and saying We grant you a full pardon
Go at once We accept the passport but we insist that the Teacher of the Nation must be beheaded too to see what happens said Monkey
Senior Teacher of the Nation said the king that monk's not going to let you off
You promised to beat him and don't give me another fright this time Tiger Power then had to take his turn to go to be tied up like a ball by the executioners and have his head cut off with a flash of the blade and sent rolling over thirty paces when it was kicked away
No blood came from his throat either and he too called out Come here head Monkey instantly pulled out a hair blew a magic breath on it said Change and turned it into a brown dog that ran across the execution ground picking the Taoist's head up with its teeth and dropping it into the palace moat
The Taoist shouted three times but did not get his head to come back As he did not have Monkey's art of growing a new one the red blood started to gush noisily from his neck
No use were his powers to call up wind and rain He could not compete with the true immortal again
A moment later his body collapsed into the dust and everyone could see that he was really a headless yellowhaired tiger The officer supervising the executions then came to report Your Majesty the Senior Teacher of the Nation has had his head cut off and cannot grow a new one
He is lying dead in the dust and is now a headless yellowhaired tiger This announcement made the king turn pale with shock He stared at the other two Taoist masters his eyes not moving
Journey to the West Deer Power then rose to his feet and said My elder brother's life is now over but he was no tiger
That monk in his wickedness must have used some deception magic to turn my elder brother into a beast
I will never forgive him for this and am resolved to compete with him in opening the stomach and cutting out the heart When the king heard this he pulled himself together and said Little monk the Second Teacher of the Nation wants another competition with you I hadn't had a cooked meal for ages said Monkey until the other day I was given a meal at a vegetarian's house on our journey West
I ate rather a lot of steamed bread and my stomach has been aching recently I think I must have worms so I'd be glad to borrow Your Majesty's sword cut my stomach open take out my innards and give my spleen and my stomach a good cleanout before going to the Western Heaven When the king heard this he said Take him to the place of execution A whole crowd of people fell upon Monkey took hold of him and began dragging him there
Monkey pulled his hands free and said No need to grab hold of me I can walk there myself There's just one condition
my hands mustn't be tied up as I will need them to wash my innards The king then ordered that his hands be left free
Monkey walked with a swagger straight to the execution ground where he leant against the stake undid his clothes and exposed his stomach
The executioners tied ropes round his neck and his legs then made a quick cut in his stomach with a knife shaped like a cow's ear
This made a hole into which Monkey thrust both his hands to open it further as he brought out his entrails He spent a long time checking them over carefully before putting them all back inside
Then he bent over again pinched the skin of his stomach together breathed a magic breath on it called out Grow and made it join up again
The king was so shocked that he gave Monkey the passport with his own hands saying Here is your passport
Please don't let me delay you holy monks on your journey West any longer Never mind the passport said Monkey but what about asking the Second Teacher of the Nation to be cut open This is nothing to do with me the king said to Deer Power
You wanted a match with him and now you must go ahead Don't worry said Deer Power
I cannot possibly lose to him Watch him as he swaggers like the Great Sage Monkey to the execution ground to be tied up by the executioners and have his stomach cut open with a whistle of the cow'sear knife
He too took out his entrails and sorted them out with his own hands
Monkey meanwhile pulled out one of his hairs blew on it with a magic breath shouted Change and turned it into a hungry eagle that spread its wings stretched out its claws swooped down grabbed the Taoist's internal organs heart liver and all and flew off nobody knew where to devour them
The Taoist was Left as an empty eviscerated ghost With no entrails or stomach as he wanders around lost
Journey to the West The executioners kicked the wooden stake down and dragged the body over to look at it
To their surprise they found it was that of a whitehaired deer
The officer supervising the executions came to make another shocked report The Second Teacher of the Nation has met with disaster He died when his stomach was cut open and a hungry eagle carried off all his entrails and internal organs in its claws
He turns out to have been a whitehaired deer How could he have been a deer asked the king in terror
To this the Great Immortal Antelope Power submitted the following reply How could my elder brother possibly look like an animal after his death
This is all the result of that monk using magic to ruin us
Let me avenge my elder brother What magic arts do you have at which you might beat him the king asked
I will compete with him at bathing in boiling oil Antelope Power replied
The king then ordered that a great cauldron be brought out and filled with sesame oil for the two of them to have their competition
I'm most grateful for your consideration said Monkey
I haven't had a bath for a very long time and these last couple of days my skin has begun to itch
I need a good hot soak The officials in attendance on the king then set the cauldron of oil in position built up a pile of dry firewood set it burning fiercely and heated the oil till it boiled and bubbled Monkey was told to go in first
He put his hands together in front of his chest and said Is it to be a gentle bath or a rough one When the king asked him what they were Monkey replied For a gentle bath you keep your clothes on stretch your hands wide out do a roll and come up again without getting your clothes at all dirty If there is even a spot of oil on them you have lost For a rough bath you need a clothes rack and a wash towel
You take your clothes off jump in and somersault or do dragonflystands as you play around and wash yourself Do you want to compete with him at gentle baths or rough ones the king asked Antelope Power
If it is gentle baths said Antelope Power he might have treated his clothes with some drug that will keep the oil off
Let it be rough baths then Monkey then stepped forward and said Excuse my impertinence in always going first Watch him while he takes off his tunic and tigerskin kilt jumps into the cauldron and dives through the waves enjoying himself as much as if he were swimming in water
At the sight of this Pig bit his finger and said to Friar Sand We've underestimated that Monkey
I usually say nasty things about him as if he just liked fooling about
I never realized he had powers like this When Monkey saw the two of them whispering his praises to each other he thought suspiciously The idiot's mocking me again
How true it is that the clever have to do all the work and the clumsy stay idle
Here's me leaping around like this while he's standing there at his ease
Right then I'll get him tied up in knots and give him a real scare In the middle of washing himself he made a great splash and plunged down to the bottom of the cauldron where he turned himself into a jujube stone He did not come up again
The officer supervising the executions went up to the king and reported Your Majesty the little monk has been fried to death in the boiling oil The king in his delight ordered that the bones be fished out for him to see
The executioners fetched an iron strainer on a long handle with which they fished around in the cauldron but its mesh was so coarse that Monkey who was now as small as a nail kept slipping through the holes in it and they could not fish him out
They then reported that the monk was so small and his bones so soft that they had been fried right away
Arrest the three monks the king ordered
The guard officers in attendance grabbed Pig first as he looked dangerous pushed him down and tied him up with his hands behind his back
Sanzang was so terrified that he shouted Your Majesty grand this poor monk a couple of hours' reprieve
My disciple achieved countless Journey to the West good deeds after he was converted
Today he has died in the cauldron of boiling oil because he offended Your Majesty Those who die first become gods and I am not greedy to stay alive
Indeed those in authority in the world look after the world's people
If Your Majesty tell me to die your subject will not dare disobey
I only ask you in your mercy to grant me a bowl of cold gruel and three paper horses that I can place in front of the cauldron I would like to burn the paper as a mark of my feeling for my disciple and I will then be ready to go to my execution Very well said the King
What a fine sense of honour these Chinese have He then ordered that some gruel and yellow paper be given to the Tang Priest which was done
Sanzang told Friar Sand to come with him as the two of them went to the foot of the steps while several guard officers dragged Pig by his ears to the cauldron
Sanzang said this invocation before the cauldron Disciple Sun Wukong Since being ordained and then joining our order You cared for and guarded me travelling West
We hoped to complete our great journey together Who would have thought you would here to go rest
Your life's only aim was collecting the scriptures And even when dead on the Buddha you ponder
Now far far away you true spirit is waiting As a ghost will you climb to the temple of Thunder Master said Pig when he heard this there's no need for an invocation like that
Friar Sand fetch me some gruel and I'll make an invocation Then the idiot said snorting with anger as he lay tied up on the ground Troublemaking monkey Ignorant Protector of the Horses
The monkey deserved to die The Protector had to fry
The Monkey found it too hot The Protector's had his lot Journey to the West When Monkey at the bottom of the cauldron heard the idiot abusing him like that he could not restrain himself from turning back into himself standing up in the cauldron and saying Dregguzzling moron Who do you think you're swearing at Disciple said Sanzang on seeing him you gave me a terrible fright Big Brother's used to shamming dead said Friar Sand The civil and military officials were thrown into such a panic that they went forward to report to the king
Your Majesty the monk did not die He has just stood up in the cauldron The officer supervising the executions was afraid that he would be in trouble for having earlier made a false report to the king so he submitted a new one
The monk did die but as this is an illomened day he has come back as a ghost to haunt us This made Monkey so angry that he sprang out of the cauldron wiped the oil off himself put on his clothes pulled out his cudgel and hit the supervisor of the executions so hard that his head turned to a meatball
A ghost indeed he said giving the officers such a fright that they untied Pig fell to their knees and pleaded Forgive us forgive us As the king came down from his dragon throne Monkey went into the hall seized hold of him and said Don't go Your Majesty
Make the Third Teacher of the Nation get into the cauldron of oil now Third Teacher of the Nation said the king with much trembling you must get into the cauldron at once to save my life
Don't let the monk hit me Antelope Power then went down from the throne hall and like Monkey took off his clothes jumped into the oil and went through the motions of washing himself
Monkey let the king go went up to the cauldron and told those tending the fire to add more fuel
Then he put out his hand to feel and found to his astonishment that the bubbling oil was icy cold
It was boiling hot when I had my bath he thought but it's cold for his
I'm sure that one of the dragon kings must be protecting him He leap straight up into midair said the magic word Om and summoned the Dragon King of the Northern Ocean I'll get you you horned worm you loach with scales on said Monkey
How dare you help the Taoist by protecting the bottom of the cauldron as a cold dragon and letting him beat me in this display of divine powers The dragon king was so frightened that he kept making respectful noises as he replied I'd never have dared help him
There is more to this than you realize Great Sage That evil beast has strenuously cultivated his conduct shaken off his original shell and has only really kept his fivethunder magic In all other respects he has taken the path of heresy and could never return to the true Way
This is the 'Great Openingup' that he learned on Lesser Mount Mao
The other two have already had their powers defeated by you Great Sage and reverted to their true appearances
The cold dragon this one uses is one that he created for himself but it is only a trick with which to fool common mortals it could not deceive you Great Sage
I shall now take that cold dragon under my control and guarantee that his skin and bones will now be fried to a crisp Hurry up about it if you don't want a beating said Monkey at which the dragon king changed into a fierce gust of wind that seized the cold dragon and carried it off to the sea
Journey to the West Monkey now came down to earth and stood beside Sanzang Pig and Friar Sand in front of the throne hall watching the Taoist struggling without success to climb out of the boiling oil
Then the Taoist slipped back into the cauldron and in an instant his bones came apart as his skin was fried crisp and his flesh cooked tender
The official supervising the executions came in again to report Your Majesty the Third Teacher of the Nation has been deepfried to death The tears gushed from the king's eyes as he struck the table by the throne and cried aloud Hard is the gaining of life and hard is its end Elixir never refine without true instruction
Vainly the spirits are raced and waterspells made Pills that can make you immortal are only a fiction
Nirvana can never be won by a mind in disorder Cunning is useless when all it can cause is destruction
Had I been warned that all could so easily fail I'd have kept to the diet and chosen a life of inaction Indeed
There was no use in the golden touch and in making elixir Calling up wind and summoning rain all ended in failure
If you do not know how the master and his disciples continued listen to the explanation in the next installment
The Holy Monk Is Stopped by the River of Heaven at Night Metal and Wood in Their Mercy Rescue a Child The king collapsed on his throne in tears and cried till nightfall Then Monkey stepped forward and called out Don't be so silly
Look at those Taoists' bodies One was a tiger and the other was a deer Antelope Power Journey to the West was an antelope
If you don't believe me have his bones fished out and take a look at them Is that a human skeleton
They were all mountain beasts who became spirits and came here to destroy you
The only reason they had not struck yet was because your life force is still strong but in another couple of years when your life force was weaker they would have murdered you and your whole kingdom would have been theirs
You are very lucky that we came here in time to destroy their evil and save your life
What are you crying for
Give us our passport at once and let us go This finally brought the king to his senses and then the civil and military officials reported together The first two who died were indeed a white deer and a yellow tiger and the cauldron contains the bones of an antelope
The holy monk must be believed If that is the case I must thank the holy monk said the king who then said to his tutor it is late now so please take the holy monks to the Deep Wisdom Monastery
Tomorrow morning the Eastern hall of the palace shall be opened up and the royal kitchens shall lay on a vegetarian banquet as a mark of our thanks They were then taken to the monastery where they slept that night
Shortly before dawn the next morning the king held an audience at which he ordered the officials to issue a notice to be posted at the four gates of the city and on every road recalling Buddhist monks
While the banquet was being set out the king went in his carriage to the gates of the Deep Wisdom Monastery to invite the Tang Priest and his disciples to the banquet in the Eastern hall of the palace
When the Buddhist monks who had escaped learned of the notice they all returned in delight to the city to find the Great Sage Monkey return his hairs and thank him
When the banquet was over the king returned Sanzang the passport and escorted him out through the gates of the palace with his queen consorts and concubines and the civil and military officials The Buddhist monks could be seen kneeling beside the road and calling out Great Sage Equaling Heaven we are the monks your lordship saved on the sandbank
Now that we have heard that you lordship has destroyed those evil beings and saved us and His Majesty has issued a notice recalling us monks we have come to return your hairs and kowtow in gratitude How many of you are there here Monkey asked
All five hundred
we are not one short Monkey then shook himself and took the hairs back before saying to king subjects monks and lay people alike It was I who released these monks it was I who took the cart through the two gates and along the ridge before smashing it and it was I who killed those evil Taoists
Now that the evil has been destroyed you will realize that there is a Way in the Buddha's faith
From now on you must have no more foolish beliefs
I hope that you will combine the three teachings by honoring both the Buddhist clergy and the Way of Taoism and by also educating men of talent in the Confucian tradition
I can guarantee that this will make you kingdom secure for ever The king accepted this advice and expressed his gratitude at great length as he accompanied the Tang Priest out of the city
Because they were seriously seeking the scriptures They strove to maintain their brightness of spirit
Journey to the West Setting out at dawn and not stopping till nightfall they drank when thirsty and ate when hungry Before they realized it spring and summer were over and it was autumn again
Late one day the Tang Priest reined in his horse and asked Where shall we spend the night disciples Master said Monkey a man of religion shouldn't talk like a layman What is the difference in the way they talk Sanzang asked
At a time like this said Monkey a layman would be fast asleep in a warm bed wrapped up in a quilt with his child in his arms and a wife to keep his feet warm We monks can't expect anything like that
We have only the moon and the stars to cover us with We dine on the wind and sleep in the dew We travel when we can find a way and only stop when there's no way forward Brother said Pig you only know half of the story
The trail is very steep now and I can barely manage my heavy load We've got to find somewhere where I can get a good night's sleep and build myself up to carry my load tomorrow
Otherwise I'm going to collapse from exhaustion Let's go a little further in the moonlight said Monkey
When we reach a house we can stay there Master and disciples had no choice but to carry on with Monkey
They had not been going for long when they heard the sound of waves That's done it said Pig
We've come to the end of the road There's a river in our way said Friar Sand
How are we going to get across asked the Tang Priest
Let me test it for depth said Pig Don't talk nonsense Wuneng said Sanzang
How could you test the water for depth Find a pebble the size of a goose egg and throw it in Pig replied
If it makes a big splash the water's shallow and if it goes down with bubbles the water's deep Test it then said Monkey
The idiot then picked up a stone and threw it into the water they heard the bubbles rising as the stone sunk
It's deep too deep he said we'll never get across You have tested for depth said the Tang Priest but we don't know how wide it is I can't tell that said Pig
Let me have a look said Monkey
The splendid Great Sage sprang up into midair on his cloud and took a good look What he saw was The light of the moon immersed in the vastness The floating reflection of the limitless sky
Journey to the West The magical stream has swallowed Mount Hua Hundreds of rivers flow into its waters
Waves in their thousands rise and then fall Towering breakers crash without number
No fisherman burns his fire by the shore The herons are all now asleep on the sand
It is as turbid and huge as the ocean And there is no end to its water in sight
Monkey brought his cloud quickly down put it away and reported It's wide Master very wide
We'll never get across it My fiery eyes with their golden pupils can see there hundred miles by day and distinguish good from evil too
By night they can see a hundred to a hundred and fifty miles
If even I can't see the other bank goodness only knows how wide it is Sanzang was speechless with shock then he sobbed What are we to do disciples Don't cry Master said Friar Sand
There's someone standing by the river over there I expect it's a fisherman working his nets said Monkey
I'll go and ask him Monkey took his iron cudgel in his hand and was before the man in two or three bounds only to discover that it was in fact a stone tablet on which was inscribed in an ancient script three words in large letters and nine words in two rows of little ones underneath
The three words written large were RIVER OF HEAVEN and the words in small writing were  miles across few travelers have ever been here Master called Monkey come and take a look When Sanzang read this he said through his tears Disciple when I left Chang'an all those years ago I thought that the Western Heaven would be easy to get to I never knew that so many evil monsters would block my way or that there would be such enormous mountains and rivers to cross Listen Master said Pig
Where is that sound of drums and cymbals coming from
It must be people holding a religious feast
Let's go and get some of the food to eat and find out where there is a boat that will ferry us across tomorrow When Sanzang listened as he sat on the horse he could hear that it really was the sound of drums and cymbals Those aren't Taoist instruments he said It must be some Buddhist monks performing a ceremony
Let's go there Monkey led the horse as they headed towards the music
There was no track to follow as they climbed and then lost height again and crossed sand banks until a village of some four or five hundred households came into sight It was a fine settlement
Journey to the West Protected by hills beside the main road On the bank of the river and watered by a stream
All the wicket gates were shut Every household's bamboo fence was closed
Clear were the dreams of the egrets on the strand Silent the song of the birds by the willows
No sound came from the flute Nothing was heard of the choppingboard's rhythm
The moon was rocked in stalks of knotweed The leaves of the rushes trembled in the wind
Beside the fields the dogs barked through the fence The fisherman slept in his boat moored by the ford
Few were the lights amid the stillness And the moon hung like a mirror in the sky A smell of duckweed wafted over Carried by the wind from the Western bank
When Sanzang dismounted he saw a house at the end of the road outside of which hung a silken banner Inside it was bright with candles and lanterns and there were clouds of incense
Wukong said Sanzang this is much better than a mountain hollow or the bank of a stream
Under the eaves we will be able to relax and sleep soundly protected from the chilly dew
You all keep out of the way while I go to the gates of the believer's house that is giving the religious feast to ask for shelter
If they invite me in I shall call you over
But don't start playing it up if they don't invite me in
If you show your ugly faces you might give them a terrible fright and cause trouble and then we would have nowhere to stay You're right said Monkey
You go ahead Master while we wait here The venerable elder then took off his rain hat straightened his habit took his monastic staff in his hand and went bareheaded to the gates which were ajar
Not venturing to walk in uninvited Sanzang stood there for a while until a very old man with prayerbeads round his neck who was repeating the name of Amitabha Buddha came out to shut the gate
Journey to the West Sanzang at once put his hands together before his chest and said I salute you benefactor The old man returned his greeting then said You're too late monk What do you mean Sanzang asked
You're too late to get anything the old man said
If you had been here earlier we were giving each monk a good meal three pints of polished rice a piece of white cloth and ten copper cash
Why have you only come now Benefactor Sanzang replied I am not here to collect offerings If you're not here for offerings what are you here for then the old man asked
I have been sent by the Emperor of the Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven Sanzang replied
It was already late when I reached this village and I have come here to beg for a night's shelter because I heard the drums and cymbals
I will be on my way at dawn The old man shook his hand at him as he replied Monk men of religion should not tell lies
Great Tang in the East is  miles from here
How could you have come from there by yourself You are quite right benefactor said Sanzang
I have only been able to reach here because I have three disciples who protect me
They clear paths across mountains and build bridges across rivers If you have these disciples the old man said why aren't they with you
But do come in
We have room for you to stay here Sanzang then looked back and called Come here disciples As Monkey was impatient by nature Pig coarse and Friar Sand impetuous the moment they heard their master calling they grabbed the horse's bridle and the luggage and ran in hellbent for leather
The sight of them gave the old man such a shock that he collapsed muttering Demons demons Please don't be afraid benefactor said Sanzang
They're not demons they are my disciples But how could so handsome a master have such hideous disciples asked the old man still shivering and shaking
They may not be much to look at said Sanzang but they certainly know how to subdue dragons and tigers and capture monsters and demons The old man was not entirely convinced as he helped the Tang Priest inside
The three ferocious disciples rushed to the main hall tied the horse up outside and put the baggage down
Several monks were reciting sutras inside Covering his long snout with his hands Pig shouted What's that sutra you're reciting monks The monks looked up when they heard his question
They looked at the stranger and saw a long snout As well as a pair of big ears that stuck out
Journey to the West His body was rough and his shoulders were broad When he opened his muzzle like thunder he roared
But as for our Monkey and good Friar Sand Their faces were more than a person could stand
The monks saying their sutras within the main hall Were terribly frightened and scared one and all
The teacher continued the text to recite Until the head monk said they should stop for the night
They paid no more heed to the chimes and the bell And the Buddha's own images from their hands fell
They all blew at once to put out every light And tried in their terror to scatter in flight
They crawl on the ground as they stumble and fall And all of them trip getting out of that hall
One old monk's head with another one clashes Just like the collapse of piledup calabashes
What once was a pure and a most holy rite Was all now reduced to a comical sight
The sight of the monks stumbling and crawling about made the three disciples clap their hands and laugh aloud at which the monks were more terrified than ever Colliding with each other's heads they all fled for their lives and disappeared
By the time Sanzang helped the old man into the hall the lights had all been put out and the three of them were still chuckling away
Damned creatures said Sanzang you are all thoroughly evil despite my daily teaching and advice
As the ancients said Only the saintly can become good without instruction Only the worthy can become good after instruction Journey to the West Only idiots will not become good even with instruction
The disgraceful scene you've just made is one of the lowest and most stupid things I could possibly imagine
You charge in through the gates without any respect make our elderly benefactor collapse in fright send all the monks fleeing for their lives and completely ruin their service I shall have to take the blame for all of this None of them could find a word to say in their defense
Only then did the old man believe that they really were Sanzang's disciples turn back and say It's nothing sir nothing
The lamps have just been put out and the flowers scattered as the service is ending anyhow If it's over said Pig bring out the food and wine for the completion feast
We need a meal before we go to bed The old man called for oil lamps to be lit The servants could not understand why
There are lots of incense sticks and candles where they're saying surras in the main hall so why does he want oil lamps lit When some servants came out to look they found everything in darkness so they lit torches and lanterns and rushed in together
When they looked inside and suddenly saw Pig and Friar Sand they dropped their torches in terror and fled shutting the doors behind them and fleeing to the inner part of the house with shout of Demons demons Monkey picked up a torch lit some lamps and candles and pulled up an armchair for the Tang Priest to sit in while the disciples sat on either side of him
As they were sitting there talking they heard a door leading from the inner part of the house being opened Another old man came in leaning on a stick and asking What evil spirits are you coming to this pious household in the middle of the night The first old man who was sitting in front of them rose and went to meet him behind the screen saying Stop shouting elder brother These aren't demons
This is an arhat sent from Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures
His disciples may look evil but really they are very good Only then did the old man put his stick down and bow in greeting to the four of them after which he too sat down in front of them and called for tea and vegetarian food
He shouted several times but the servants were still quaking with terror and too frightened to come in This was more than Pig could put up with
Old man he said you have an awful lot of servants
What have they all gone off to do I have sent them to fetch food to offer to you gentlemen the old man replied
How many of them will be serving the food asked Pig
Eight said the old man Who will they be waiting on asked Pig
You four gentlemen the old man replied
Our master the one with the white face only needs one person to wait on him said Pig The one with hair cheeks whose mouth looks like a thunder god only needs two That viciouslooking creature needs eight and I must have twenty Journey to the West From what you say must be rather a big eater the old man remarked
You're about right said Pig
We have enough servants the old man said and by bringing together servants of all ages he produced thirty or forty of them
As the monks talked to the old man the servants lost their fear and set a table in front of the Tang Priest inviting him to take the place of honour
They then put three more tables on both sides of him at which they asked the three disciples to sit and another in front of these for the two old men
On the tables were neatly arranged some fruit vegetables pasta rice refreshments and peanoodle soup
Sanzang raised his chopsticks and started to say a grace over the food but the idiot who was impatient and hungry to boot did not wait for him to finish before grabbing a red lacquered wooden bowl of white rice that he scooped up and gulped down in a single mouthful Sir said the servant standing beside him you didn't think very carefully
If you are going to keep food in your sleeves shouldn't you take steamed bread instead of rice that will get your clothes duty I didn't put it in my sleeve chuckled Pig I ate it But you didn't even open your mouth they said so how could you have eaten it Who is lying then said Pig I definitely ate it
If you don't believe me I'll eat another to show you The servants carried the rice over filled a bowlful and passed it to Pig who had it down his throat in a flash
Sir said the astonished servants you must have a throat built of whetstones it's so smooth and slippery Pig had downed five or six bowls before the master could finish the short grace only then did he pick up his chopsticks and start eating with them
The idiot grabbed whatever he could and bolted it not caring whether it was rice or pasta fruit or refreshments More food more food he shouted until it gradually began to run out Brother said Monkey don't eat so much
Make do with being half full Anyhow it's better than starving in a mountain hollow What a horrible face you're making said Pig
As the saying goes The monk at a banquet who can't eat his fill Would rather be buried alive on the hill Clear the things away and pay no more attention to him said Monkey
We will be frank with you reverend sirs said the two old men with bows We would have no problem in feeding a hundred or more reverend gentlemen with big bellies like him in the daytime but it is late now and the remains of the maigrefeast have been put away
We only cooked a bushel of noodles five bushels of rice and a few tables of vegetarian food to feed our neighbors and the clergy at the end of the service
We never imagined that you reverend gentlemen would turn up and put the monks to flight We have not even been able to offer any food to our relations and neighbors as we have given it all to you
If you are still hungry we can Journey to the West have some more cooked Yes said Pig cook some more After this exchange the tables and other things used for the banquet were tidied away
Sanzang bowed to his hosts to thank them for the meal then asked them their surname
We are called Chen they replied
Then you are kinsmen of mine said Sanzang putting his hands together in front of his chest
Is your surname Chen as Well the old men asked
Yes Sanzang replied Chen was my surname before I became a monk
May I ask why you were holding that religious feast just now Why brother to ask Master said Pig with a laugh
Anyone could tell you that it's bound to have been a feast for the new crops or for safety or for the end of funeral ceremonies No it was not the old men said
Then what was it for Sanzang asked
It was a feast to prepare for death the old men replied
You don't know who you're talking to said Pig falling about with laughter
We could build a bridge out of lies We're kings of deception Don't try to fool us
As monks we know all about maigrefeasts
There are only preparatory maigrefeasts for transferring money to the underworld and for fulfilling vows
Nobody's died here so why have a funeral feast This idiot's learning a bit of sense chuckled Monkey to himself
Old man he said aloud what you said must be wrong
How can you have a feast to prepare for death At this the two old men bowed and replied And if you were going to fetch the scriptures why did you come here instead of taking the main route We were on the main route replied Monkey but a river was in our way and we weren't able to cross it
We came to your distinguished residence to ask for a night's shelter because we heard the drums and cymbals What did you see by the side of the river one of the old men asked
Nothing but a stone tablet on which was written 'River of Heaven' above and ' miles across few travelers have ever been here' underneath Monkey replied
Less than half a mile along the bank from the stone tablet is the Temple of the Great King of Miraculous Response the old man said
Did you not see it No Monkey replied
Would you old gentlemen tell me why he's called 'Miraculous Response' The two old men burst into tears as they replied My lord as for the Great King Journey to the West Because he responded a temple we built His miracles greatly the common folk helped
He sends timely rain to the farms all about His clouds give their moisture to keep us from drought But if he sends timely rain and clouds he's being kind to you said Brother Monkey so why are you so upset and miserable At this the old man stamped on the ground beat his chest and wailed Master Great is our gratitude greater our anger Although he is kind he is also a danger
He is not one of the gods true and right To eat boys and girls is his evil delight He likes eating boys and girls Brother Monkey exclaimed
Yes replied the old man I suppose it's your family's turn now said Monkey
Yes this year it is our turn the old man said
There are a hundred households living here
This place is called Chen Village and it is in Yuanhui County of the Kingdom of Tarrycart
There is a sacrifice to the Great King every year at which a boy a girl pigs sheep oxen and wine have to be offered
If he gets his meal he gives us wind and rain at the right time but if there is no sacrifice he sends disaster How many sons are there in your household Monkey asked
The old man beat his breast and said Alas alas we die of shame when you speak of sons
This is my brother Chen Qing who is fiftyseven
I am Chen Cheng and am sixtytwo
We have both found great difficulty in having children As I had no son my friends and relations persuaded me to take a concubine when I was nearly fifty I had no option but to find one and we had a daughter She is just seven this year and we call her Pan of Gold That's a very grand name said Pig
But why Pan of Gold Because we were childless we built bridges repaired roads contributed to putting up monasteries and pagodas gave donations and fed monks
We kept an account of all this and what with three ounces spent here and five spent there it added up to thirty pounds of gold by the time the girl was born
Thirty pounds is a pan of gold and hence the name Journey to the West What about sons Monkey asked
My brother has a son who was also by a concubine He is six this year and we call him Chen Guangiven Why did you call him that Monkey asked
In our family we worship Lord Guan Yu and we called him Guangiven as it was from the statue of Lord Guan that we begged and obtained this son
My brother and I are  between us if you add our ages together and these are our only two offspring We never imagined that it would fall to us to provide the sacrificial offerings this year and this is a duty we cannot escape
It is because as fathers we cannot bear to part from our children that we held this service to bring about rebirth this maigrefeast to prepare for death This brought the tears pouring down Sanzang's cheeks as he replied This is what the ancients mean when they said Long before the ripe ones the green plums always fall The harshness of heaven hits the childless worst of all Monkey smiled at this and said Let me ask some more questions
Tell me sir how much property does your family have Quite a lot the younger old man replied
About seven hundred acres of paddy fields a thousand acres of dry fields eighty or ninety fields of hay two or three hundred waterbuffalo and oxen twenty or thirty donkeys and horses and goodness only knows how many pigs sheep chickens and geese
We have more old grain piled up at home than we can eat and more clothes than we can wear
That is the extent of our family's property It's a pity you're so stingy with all your wealth said Monkey
How can you accuse us of being stingy the old man asked
If you're so rich said Monkey why give your own children to be sacrificed
You could buy a boy for fifty ounces and a girl for a hundred
With all the other expenses together it shouldn't cost you more than two hundred ounces of silver to keep your own children
Wouldn't that be better To this the younger old man replied through his tears My lord you don't realize that the Great King is miraculously responsive and that he often calls on this household If he comes here have you seen what he looks like and how tall he is asked Brother Monkey
We don't see him the younger old man replied we just know that the Great King is coming when we smell a fragrant wind Then we burn huge amounts of incense and all of us young and old alike prostrate ourselves in the direction of the wind
He knows every trifling detail about our householdeven about our spoons and the bowls we useand remembers all our dates of birth
He will only accept our own son and daughter
Never mind two or three hundred ounces of silver we could not buy identicallooking children of exactly the same age for tens of thousands of ounces Journey to the West So it's like that said Monkey
Very well then bring your son out for me to take a look at him Chen Qing hurried to the inner part of the house brought Guangiven back with him into the hall and set the boy down in front of the lamp
Not realizing the mortal danger he was in the little boy leapt about filled his sleeves with fruit ate and played around
Monkey looked at him said a spell silently shook himself and made himself look just like Guangiven
Then the two boys started to jump and dance in front of the lamp giving the two old men such a shock that they fell to their knees
That was a terrible thing for him to do venerable sirs said Sanzang But the gentleman was talking to us a moment ago said the old man How can he have turned into the exact likeness of my son When you call them they respond and move together
This shock has shortened our lives
Please return to your normal appearance Monkey rubbed his face and was himself once more
What powers you have my lord said the old man still on his knees
Was I like your son Monkey asked
Yes just like him the old man replied Same face same voice same clothes same height You didn't look carefully enough said Monkey
Get some scales and weigh me to see if I'm the same weight as him Yes yes the same weight the old man said
Would I do for the sacrifice like that asked Monkey
Perfect said the old man just perfect
You would be accepted I shall take the child's place and keep him alive for your family to have descendants to burn incense to you said Monkey
I shall be offered to the Great King instead At this Chen Qing kowtowed as he knelt there saying My lord if in your mercy you were to take his place I will give His Reverence the Tang Priest a thousand ounces of silver towards the cost of his journey to the Western Heaven Aren't you going to reward me asked Monkey
But if you are sacrificed in the boy's place it will be the end of you said the old man What do you mean Monkey asked
The Great King will eat you the old man replied
He'd dare to eat me said Monkey
The only reason he might not eat you would be if he thought you would taste too high the old man said
Let Heaven do as it will said Monkey
If I'm eaten up it'll be because I'm fated to have a short life and if I'm not eaten it'll be because I'm lucky
Take me to the sacrifice While Chen Qing kowtowed expressed his thanks and presented them with five hundred ounces of silver Chen Cheng neither kowtowed nor thanked Monkey but leant against the doorway sobbing
As soon as Brother Monkey noticed this he went up to him took hold of his clothes and said Old man is it because you can't bear to lose your daughter that you're not giving me anything or thanking me Journey to the West Only then did Chen Cheng fall to his knees and reply Yes I cannot bear to lose her
It is enough that in your great kindness you are saving my nephew by taking his place
But I have no son She is my only child and she would weep for me bitterly after my death
I cannot bear to lose her Then you'd better go along at once and cook five bushels of rice and some good vegetarian dishes for that longsnouted venerable gentleman to eat
Then I'll make him turn into the likeness of your daughter and the two of us will be able to take part in the sacrifice
We'll see if we can do a meritorious deed and save your children's lives These words came as a great shock to Pig who said Brother if you turn yourself into a spirit and leave me to die you'll be dragging me into disaster Brother said Monkey as the saying goes a chicken doesn't eat what it doesn't earn
We came in here and were given an ample meal but you had to complain that you were still hungry
Why aren't you willing to help them in their crisis But brother protested Pig I can't do transformations You can do thirtysix transformations said Monkey
How can you possibly deny that Wuneng Sanzang said to Pig what your brother says is absolutely correct and he has made the right decision
As the saying goes to save a human life is better than building a sevenstoried pagoda
If you do this you will be thanking our hosts for their generous hospitality and accumulating good karma for yourself
Besides it will be fun for you and your brother on this cool night when you have nothing else to do What are you saying Master said Pig
I can only change into a hill a tree a rock a scabby elephant a waterbuffalo or a big fat man
It'd be pretty hard for me to turn into a little girl Pay no attention to him said Monkey to Chen Cheng but bring your daughter out for me to see Chen Cheng then hurried inside and came back into the hall with Pan of Gold in his arms and everyone in the household young and old wives and concubines members of the family and other relations all came in to kowtow and beg Monkey to save the child's life
Round her hair the little girl was wearing a patterned turquoise headband from which hung ornaments representing the eight precious things
Her jacket was of red and yellow shot ramie and over is she wore a cape in green imperial satin with a checked collar
Her skirt was of scarlet flowered silk her shoes were of pink ramie and shaped like frogs' heads and her trousers were of raw silk with gold thread
She was holding a piece of fruit in her hand and eating it
There's the girl said Monkey
Make yourself like her at once
We're off to the sacrifice But she's much too small and delicate for me to turn into brother said Pig
Hurry up if you don't want me to hit you said Monkey
Don't hit me pleaded Pig in desperation
I'll see if I can make the change The idiot then said the words of a spell shook his head several times called Change and really did make his head look like the little girl's The only troubles was that his belly was still much too fat and disproportionately big
Change some more said Monkey with a laugh Journey to the West Hit me then said Pig
I can't change any more and that's that But you can't have a little girl's head on a monk's body said Monkey
You won't do at all like thatyou're neither a man nor a girl
Do the Dipper starsteps Monkey then blew on him with magic breath and in fact did change his body to make it look like the little girl's
Will you two old gentlemen please take the young master and the young lady inside and make no mistake about who they are said Monkey
My brother and I will be trying to dodge the monster and fooling around and we may come in here so that it will be hard to tell us from the real children
Have some fruit ready for them to eat and don't let them cry in case the Great King notices and our secret gets out
Now we're off to see if we can fool him The splendid Great Sage then told Friar Sand to look after the Tang Priest while Pig and he changed into Chen Guangiven and Pan of Gold
When the two of them were ready Monkey asked How are the victims presented
Tied up in a bundle or with their hands roped together
Are they steamed or chopped up into little bits Brother pleaded Pig don't do me down
I haven't got those magic powers We would never dare to said the old men
We would just like you two gentlemen each to sit in a red lacquer dish that would be put on a table
You would then be carried into the temple on the tables by a pair of youngsters Fine fine said Monkey
Bring the dishes in here for us to try out The old men sent for the two red dishes in which Monkey and Pig sat while four young men carried them for a few steps in the courtyard before setting them down again in the hall
Pig said Monkey with delight being carried around on dishes like this makes us like abbots sitting in the seats of honour I wouldn't be at all scared of being carried in and out of here till dawn said Pig but being carried into the temple to be eaten is no joke Just watch me said Brother Monkey and run away when he eats me How do you know who he'll eat first said Pig
If he eats the boy first I'll be able to get away but what shall I do if he eats the girl first At this one of the old men said During the sacrifices in other years some of the bolder of us have slipped into the back of the temple or hidden under the tables on which the offerings were made
They have seen that he eats the boy first and the girl afterwards Thank goodness said Pig thank goodness While the two brotherdisciples were talking they heard a mighty noise of gongs and drums and a blaze of lights outside as the villagers opened the front gates and poured in shouting Bring out the boy and the girl The four young men then carried Monkey and Pig out to the sobs and wails of the old men
If you do not know whether they lost their lives or not listen to the explanation in the next installment
Journey to the West A Devilish Blizzard Makes the Snow Whirl The Monk Who Seeks to Worship Buddha Walks on Ice The story tells how the believers in Chen Village noisily carried Monkey and Pig with pork mutton beef and wine straight to the Temple of Miraculous Response where they set them all out with the young boy and girl in the most prominent place
Monkey looked around and saw that the offertory tables were covered with fragrant flowers and wax candles In front of him was a tablet on which were inscribed in letters of gold GREAT KING OF MIRACULOUS RESPONSE There were no statues of any other gods
When the believers had set everything out properly they all kowtowed and made this prayer Great King our lord at this hour of this day of this month of this year Chen Cheng the master of the sacrifice and all the other faithful of different ages beg to offer in accordance with annual custom the little boy Chen Guangiven the little girl Pan of Gold pork mutton beef and wine for the delectation of the Great King
We beg you to give us the right amounts of wind and rain and to grant a good harvest for all our crops After praying they burnt paper horses and all went home
When they had all gone Pig said to Monkey Let's go home Where's your home Monkey asked
Let's go back to old Chen's place for a sleep Pig replied
You're talking nonsense again idiot said Monkey
You've made them a promise and now you've got to fulfil their wish You're the idiot not me despite what you've always saying replied Pig Why don't we just take him for a ride
You can't be serious about us being sacrificed for them Always finish what you begin said Monkey
We'll only be able to tidy this business up if we stay here till the Great King comes to eat us up
Otherwise we'll make him cause disasters which would be terrible As they were talking they heard the howling of a wind outside This is terrible said Pig
What made the wind come  Shut up said Monkey while I cope A moment later an evil creature came in through the temple doors
Look at him Gold armor golden helmet shining bright Red clouds enfold the jade belt at his waist
His eyes were gleaming like the stars at night His teeth resembled those on a pair of saws
Journey to the West Under his feet wafted sunset clouds Warm and scented were the mists all around
Cold blew the negative winds as he walked Heavy lay the air of death where he stood
He was just like an officer guarding an emperor Or a god at the gateway protecting a monastery
The monster stood blocking the entrance to the temple and asked Who is making the sacrifice this year Thank you for asking Monkey replied
This year the village heads are the family of Chen Cheng and Chen Qing This reply struck the monster as very odd
That boy has a lot of courage he thought and he's a good talker too
Usually the children who are offered say nothing the first time I ask them a question and are frightened out of their wits the second time
Before I've even grabbed them in my hand they are already dead
So why's this boy today so good at answering Instead of seizing him the monster asked another question
What is your name boy My name is Chen Guangiven and the girl is called Pan of Gold According to the old custom of this sacrifice I should eat you first said the monster
I have no objection said Brother Monkey
Enjoy your meal Hearing this the monster was once more afraid to grab Monkey so instead he blocked the doorway and shouted I'll have none of your answering back
Usually I eat the boy first but this year I shall start with the girl Better to follow the old custom said Pig in a panic
Don't break with tradition Without any more discussion the monster made a grab for Pig who leapt down turned back into himself and struck at the monster's hand with his rake The monster pulled his hand back and fled All that could be heard was a mighty clang
I've smashed his armor exclaimed Pig
Monkey who had resumed his own true form as well looked saw two fish scales the size of an ice dish and gave a shout of After him The two of them sprang up into the air where the monster who had come unarmed to his feast asked them from a cloud Where are you from monks and why have you come here to bully me spoil my offerings and ruin my reputation What you don't realize damned monster Monkey replied is that we are disciples of the holy priest Sanzang from Great Tang in the East who has been sent by his emperor to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven
We were spending last night at the Chen household when were told that an evil spirit Journey to the West pretending to be Miraculous Response demands the sacrifice of a boy and a girl every year
In our mercy we decided to save life and capture you damned monster
You'd better make a full and true confession at once How long have you been here calling yourself 'Great King' and at two a year how many little boys and girls have you eaten
Given me a full account and return them to me if you want your life spared At that the monster fled avoiding another blow that Pig struck at him with his rake He turned into a wild wind and went straight into the River of Heaven No need to chase him said Monkey
I'm sure the monster's a river creature
We'll have to work out a way of catching him and getting the master across the river tomorrow Pig accepted this suggestion and went straight back to the temple from where he carried the offerings of pork mutton and wine tables and all back to the Chen house
The Tang Priest Friar Sand and the Chen brothers were waiting for news in the hall when they saw Monkey and Pig burst in and put all the pork mutton and other offerings in the courtyard
What happened in the sacrifice Wukong Sanzang asked Monkey who related how he had told the monster who he was and chased him into the river to the immense delight of the two old gentlemen who ordered that the side rooms were to be swept out and furnished with beds Here the master and his disciples were invited to spend the night
Having escaped with his life back to the river the monster sat brooding silently in his palace while his river clansmen asked him Why are you so upset this year Your Majesty
Usually you are very happy when you come back from eating your sacrifice In ordinary years I bring you back some leftovers after the sacrifice said the monster but I did not even have anything to eat myself today My luck was out
I met enemies who all but killed me Who Your Majesty Disciples of a holy priest from Great Tang in the East who is going to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures They had turned themselves into a boy and a girl and were sitting in my temple
When they turned back into themselves they almost killed me
I've long heard people tell of Tang Sanzang a holy man who has cultivated his conduct for ten lifetimes one piece of his flesh will make you immortal
But I never expected he would have disciples such as those
He's ruined my reputation and stopped them worshipping me any more
I wish I could capture that Tang Priest but I don't think I can From among the watery tribe there slipped forward a female mandarin fish in patterned clothes She advanced with small respectful steps towards the monster bowing frequently as she said Your Majesty there will be no problem about catching the Tang Priest
But if you do capture him will you reward me with a feast If you have a plan we shall combine our efforts to catch the Tang Priest the monster said
I shall take you as my sworn sister and we shall eat his flesh together The mandarin fish bowed in thanks then said I have long known that Your Majesty has the powers to call up wind and rain or to throw rivers and sea into turmoil But can you make it snow Yes the monster replied
As you can make it snow the mandarin fish continued can you also cause cold and make ice I'm even better at that the monster said
The fish then clapped her hands with delight and said In that case it will be very very easy Journey to the West Will you tell me this very easy way of succeeding the monster asked
Your Majesty must lose no time the fish replied It's now the third watch about midnight You must make magic to cause a cold wind and a heavy fall of snow at once The River of Heaven must be frozen solid
Those of us who are good at transformations will make ourselves look like people and appear at the end of the track with packs on our backs carrying umbrellas and luggage poles and pushing carts We shall walk across the ice in an endless stream
That Tang Priest is so impatient to fetch the scriptures that when he sees all those people walking along he's bound to want to cross the ice himself
All Your Majesty needs to do is to sit quietly in the middle of the river until you hear his footsteps then crack the ice apart so that he and his disciples all fall into the water
They'll all be caught in one package Marvellous marvellous exclaimed the monster who was utterly delighted at the suggestion
He left his watery palace and went up into the sky where he caused winds and snow and made it so cold that the river froze
The Tang Priest and his three disciples slept in the Chen house Shortly before dawn they all began to feel very cold in their bedding
Pig was shivering unable to get back to sleep so he called Brother it's cold Idiot said Monkey you've got no sense of how to behave Monks are not affected by summer or winter
You shouldn't mind the cold Disciple said Sanzang it really is cold
Double quilts now give no warmth Hands put in sleeves find only ice
Strands of frost grow from withered leaves Frozen bells hang from frozen pines
The cold is so intense the earth splits open The water in the pond is a solid block
No old man can be seen in the fisherman's boat No monk is to be met with in the mountain temple
The woodman wishes he could gather more fuel The prince is glad to pile more charcoal on the flames
Travelers' beards are turned to iron The poet's brush is waterchestnut hard
Even a fur jacket now seems too thin Journey to the West A marten coat feels much too light
The monk on his hassock is frozen rigid Behind the paper screen the traveler is scared
Even in many a layer of bedding One shivers and shakes from top to toe
As neither master nor disciples could sleep they rose and dressed
When they opened the door to look outside they saw to their astonishment a vast expanse of white It was snowing
No wonder we were so cold said Monkey if it's been snowing so heavily When the four of them looked they saw that it was a splendid fall
Dark masses of cloud Chilling dreary mists
Under dark masses of cloud The North wind howls cold Through chilling dreary mists A heavy snowfall blankets the ground Indeed
The sixsided snowflakes Are flying jewels In the great forest Jade hangs from every tree
First like flour then like salt
The white parrot loses its whiteness The crane's feathers no longer stand out
It adds to the waters of a thousand rivers Outdoes the plumtrees in the Southeast
As if three million dragons of jade were defeated Journey to the West The sky is filled with fragments of armor and scales
Here you will not find Dongguo's soleless sandals The bed where Yuan An froze to death The place where Sun Kang studied in the snow's reflected light The boat that Wang Ziyou took one snowy night Wang Gong's cloak Or the rug that Su Wu had to eat
All you will see are village houses set like inlaid silver Three thousand miles of jadelike river and hills
What splendid snow Sprinkling the bridge with willow catkins Covering the cottage with pear blossom
When the bridge is sprinkled with willow catkins The fisherman beside it dons his cape of straw When the cottage is covered with pear blossom The old man inside bums his firewood
The traveler is hard put to it to buy a drink The slave cannot find the plum blossom for which be is sent
The heavy fall of snow takes off the butterfly's wings The howling blizzard strips the goose of its feathers
Rolling drifts are blown by the winds Layer upon layer hides the road
Freezing gusts come through the curtains A chilly wind blows into the bed
This is Heaven's promise of a good harvest Good news that is cause for celebration
Journey to the West The snow was falling in abundance like fragments of jade or cotton wool
When master and disciples had sighed in admiration of it for a long time the two old Chen brothers told two servants to sweep a way through the snow and two more to bring the monks hot water with which to wash their faces
A little later boiling hot tea cheesecakes and a charcoal stove were all carried out to the side room where master and disciple sat around them
Venerable benefactor the Tang Priest asked could you tell me if you distinguish between the seasons of the year here This may be a remote place said the old man and our customs and people may be different from those in your distinguished land but our crops and animals grow under the same sky so of course we distinguish between the four seasons In that case why is there such heavy snow today and why is it so cold Sanzang asked
Although it has been August the old man replied the frost last night marked the beginning of September
We generally have frost and snow here in September That is different from the East said Sanzang
We have frost and snow in the winter As they were talking servants came in with tables and invited them to take some porridge
By the time they had finished eating the snow was heavier than ever and before long it lay two feet deep
Sanzang began to weep with anxiety
Please don't worry so said old Mr Chen and don't be upset because the snow is deep
We have plenty of grain here enough to feed you venerable gentlemen for half a lifetime You do not know why I am suffering benefactor Sanzang replied
When all those years ago His Majesty the Tang Emperor graciously commanded me to make this journey and escorted me in person by carriage to the frontier pass he offered me a parting meal with his own hands asking me when I would be back
I did not realize how many difficult mountains and rivers would lie in my way so I casually replied that I could be back with the scriptures in three years
It is now already seven or eight years since I left and I have yet to gaze on the face of the Buddha I am worried that I have exceeded His Majesty's time limit and afraid of all the evil monsters and other vicious creatures ahead
Today I have had the good fortune to stay in your great mansion and last night my disciples were able to thank you by doing you a small favour I was hoping to ask for a boat to ferry us across the river never expecting that Heaven would send this heavy fall of snow
Now the roads are blocked and I do not know when I shall complete my mission and return home Do not worry sir said old Mr Most of the time for your journey has already passed
You will only have to wait here a few days for the skies to clear and the ice to melt then we will spend everything we have to see you across the river A servant then came in to invite them to breakfast which they ate in the main hall followed not long afterwards by lunch
Sanzang felt embarrassed by all this lavish hospitality so he said repeatedly As you are being so kind as to let us stay we must insist on eating more ordinary fare Venerable sir Mr
Chen replied we are so grateful for having the children saved from the sacrifice that we could not thank you enough even if we gave you banquets every day Journey to the West After this the snow stopped and people began to move around
Seeing how unhappy Sanzang was old Mr Chen had the garden swept and a fire made in a brazier then invited them to the snowcave to cheer themselves up by enjoying the snow view
What a silly idea laughed Pig
Spring is the time for enjoying gardens It's much too cold in all this snow and anyhow there's nothing to be seen now You don't know anything you idiot said Monkey
Snowscapes are very peaceful and elegant It will be a pleasure to see them and it will make the master feel better too That's right that's right said old Mr
The visitors were then taken into the garden and this is what they saw
Although it was autumn The scenery was winter's
Jade stamens formed on the hoary pine Silvery flowers hung from the dying willow
Powder was piled on the lichen by the steps Jeweled shoots sprang from the bamboo at the window
The craggy mountain tops The fishpond
On the craggy mountain tops The sharp and pointed peaks were like jade bamboo
In the fishpond The clear and living water now was ice Gone was the beauty of the lotus by the bank The rose of Sharon's delicate fronds hung low
The autumn begonia Was weighed right down The winter plum Was just putting out new growth
Journey to the West The Peony Pavilion The Pomegranate Pavilion The Osmanthus Pavilion All piled deep in goosedown The Place for Forgetting Cares The Place for Entertaining Visitors The Place for Recreation All covered as if with butterflies' wings
The yellow chrysanthemums by the fence were woven of jade and gold A few maples were dappled white and red
Many a courtyard was too cold to enter The sight of the snowcave made one feel like ice
Here was set a brazier of bronze With heads of animals and legs like elephants Where a toastinghot fire of charcoal burnt And some lacquered armchairs With cushions of tigerskin And screens of paper set all around for warmth
On the walls were hung ancient paintings by famous artists showing The Seven Worthies going out through the pass A solitary fisherman on a cold river Amid a landscape of snowy peaks and mountains
Su Wu eating his rug Breaking off plum branches to meet the envoys Journey to the West And writing in the cold of a frozen forest
There was no end of Houses near a river pavilion where fish can be bought Mountain tracks buried in snow where no wine is on sale
Were it big enough to live in Who would need to go to magical Penghu
After they had admired the scenery for a long time they sat down in the snowcave and told the elderly neighbors about their mission to fetch the scriptures When they had drunk the fragrant tea old Mr
Chen said Venerable gentlemen may I offer you some wine As a monk I do not drink replied Sanzang but my disciples may drink a few cups The old man was delighted
Bring vegetarian food he ordered and warm some wine to keep the cold out of these gentlemen Servants then carried out tables that were set round the brazier
They all drank several cups with the two elderly neighbors then everything was tidied away
By now it was getting late and the visitors were invited back into the hall for an evening meal
They could hear passersby in the street saying Oh It's cold today The River of Heaven is frozen solid That's terrible said Sanzang to Brother Monkey
The river's frozen In a sudden cold snap like this I think that only the shallow water near the bank can have frozen said old Mr
Then another passerby said The whole  miles of it are frozen as smooth as a mirror and some people are setting out across it from where the road ends Hearing that people were walking across Sanzang wanted to go out and take a look
Do not be in such a hurry venerable sir said old Mr
It's late now Wait till morning He then said goodbye to the two elderly neighbors and after supper the visitors slept in the side room once more
Pig rose at dawn and said Brother it was even colder last night
I think the river really must have frozen solid Sanzang went to the door bowed low to Heaven and prayed All you gods who protect the teachings on my journey West I have faithfully worshipped the Buddha and crossed many a river and mountain with great suffering and never a word of complaint
I am deeply grateful for Heaven's help in bringing me this far and I also give most humble thanks that the river has now frozen
When I bring the scriptures back I shall report all this to the Tang Emperor and reward you sincerely When he had finished his prayer he told Friar Sand to saddle the horse so that they could cross the river while it was frozen
Please do not be in such a hurry said old Mr Stay here a few more days until the ice has melted and I shall arrange for a boat to carry you across I don't know whether we should go or stay said Friar Sand
You can't rely on what people say and you can only believe what you see with your own eyes I'll saddle the horse and you can take a look for yourself Journey to the West A good suggestion said old Mr
Servants he ordered saddle six of our horses but not the Tang Priest's horse Then with six young pages in attendance they went in line to the bank of the river to look Indeed
The snow is piled up like mountains When the clouds disappear the dawn is bright
A thousand pinnacles soar above the icelocked pass Frozen rivers and lakes are completely smooth
The North wind chills to the bone The slippery ice is bitterly cold
The fish stay by the plants in the pond The wild birds linger in the stubble
Beyond the frontier fingers are lost to frostbite The boatman on the river breaks his teeth with shivering
Snakes' stomachs split Birds' legs break The ice forms mountains thousands of feet high
The flowing silver stops in ten thousand valleys Cold is the river's liquid jade
The East produces frozen silkworms And mice make their holes in the Northern ice Wang Xiang lay on the ice to melt it And caught a carp for his mother to eat
When the Emperor Guangwu crossed the river A bridge of ice formed overnight for him
Many are the layers of ice on the pond Journey to the West And the deep pool is frozen solid
There are no more waves on the mighty River of Heaven The gleaming ice stretches out as hard as a road
When Sanzang and his party reached the bank of the river they reined in their horses to look and saw that there really were people setting out from where the road reached the bank
Benefactor asked Sanzang where are those people going to across the ice On the other side of the river said old Mr
Chen is the Womanland of Western Liang
Those people are all traders
What costs a hundred cash on this side can be worth ten thousand over there and vice versa and it's because such big profits can be made for such a small expenditure that people risk their lives to go there
Normally they form groups of five to a dozen or so and sail across but now that the river has frozen over they are prepared to walk over at mortal peril Fame and profit are what make the world go round said Sanzang
They are risking their lives for profit and my disciples loyally obey orders for the sake of fame
there's not much to choose between them He then told Monkey to go back to their benefactors' house pack the luggage and bridle and saddle the horse so that they could head West while the ice held
Monkey agreed with a chuckle
Master said Friar Sand there's a saying that goes 'For a thousand days you need a thousand pints of rice' Now that we are staying at the Chen house why don't we wait here a few days longer till the skies have cleared and the ice melted then get a boat to take us across
Rushing like this will only lead to trouble Wujing Sanzang replied how can you be so stupid
If it were March and the weather were warming up every day we could wait for it to thaw
But now it is September and it is getting cooler very day so it would be absurd to wait for the thaw
It would set our journey a long time back Stop all that idle chatter said Pig jumping down from his horse
I'm going to find out how thick the ice is You idiot said Monkey you could test the depth of the water the other evening by throwing a stone into it but you could never do that now that the ice is so thick What you don't understand brother said Pig is that I can hit it with my rake
If I smash through it it's too thin for us to walk on but if I don't move it at all that'll show it's thick enough for us to cross What you say is right observed Sanzang
The idiot hitched up his clothes strode to the edge of the river raised his rake with both hands and brought it down with all his might There was a hollow thump as nine white scars appeared on the ice His hand had been painfully jarred
We can go said the idiot with a grin we can go
It's frozen solid right down to the bottom The news delighted Sanzang who took them all back to the Chen house and told them to prepare to travel
Seeing that repeated pleas were not going to make their visitors stay the two old men gave them some dry cooked grain buns and steamed bread
The whole household kowtowed to the monks in respect then carried out a tray of silver and gold pieces and knelt before them
We are so grateful to you gentlemen for saving the lives of our children that we would like to offer you this towards the cost of a meal on the journey Journey to the West Sanzang shook his head and waved his hand as he refused to accept it I am a monk he said and what would I want with money I would never be able to produce it on the journey
We have to beg for what we eat
The food you have given us will be plenty When the old men repeatedly implored them to accept it Monkey took just under half an ounce of it between his fingers that he handed to Sanzang with the words Master accept this offering so as not to be ungrateful to the two old gentlemen Only then did they take their leave
Once the horse's hoofs slipped on the ice at the edge of the river so that Sanzang almost fell of
It's hard going Master said Friar Sand Wait said Pig
Ask old Mr Chen for some rice straw What for Brother Monkey asked
You wouldn't know said Pig
If you wrap rice straw round the horse's hoofs it won't slip and the master won't fall off When old Mr
Chen heard this from the bank he at once sent someone back to fetch a bundle of rice straw from the house then invited Sanzang to dismount while Pig wrapped the straw round the horse's hoofs after which they set out across the ice
When they had taken their leave of the old Chen brothers and gone a mile or so from the bank Pig handed the nineringed monastic staff to Sanzang
Master he said hold this staff sticking out sideways as you ride You idiot said Monkey you're trying another dirty trick
You're meant to be carrying the staff so why are you giving it to the master to carry You've never walked across ice said Pig so you wouldn't know that there are always crevasses Step on one and you'll go in
If you don't have something like a carryingpole sticking out sideways then you'll fall into the water and have no more chance of climbing out that if you were in a big pot with a lid on it
You've got to have a prop like this to be safe This idiot must have years of experience of walking on ice thought Monkey smiling to himself and they took Pig's advice
the venerable elder held his monastic staff sideways Monkey his iron cudgel Friar Sand his demonquelling staff and Pig who had the luggage on a carryingpole over his shoulder held his rake sideways at waist height
Thus master and disciples pressed ahead without worry until nightfall when they ate some of their dry rations
Not daring to delay they hurried on over the ice that glistened and reflected the light of the moon and the stars across its white expanses
The horse never rested for a moment nor did master and disciples close their eyes as they kept going all night
They ate some more dry rations at dawn and pressed on towards the West
As they were walking they heard a loud creaking noise from under the ice which so frightened the white horse that it almost fell over
Disciples asked Sanzang with horror what was that noise The river has frozen so solid that it's made the earth rumble said Pig
Or perhaps the river's frozen right to the bottom here in the middle Half reassured but still half terrified Sanzang whipped the horse forward and they carried on
Journey to the West Since coming back to his watery palace the evil monster had been waiting under the ice with all his spirits for a long time
As soon as he heard the horse's hoofs he used his magic to make the ice burst noisily open giving Monkey such a fright that he sprang up into midair
The other three and the white horse sank into the water where the evil monster captured Sanzang and took him back to his underwater palace with all his spirits
Where is my sister the mandarin fish he shouted stridently at which she came forward did obeisance and said Your Majesty I am not worthy to be your sister How can you say such a thing good sister the monster replied
Once a word is spoken a fourhorse chariot can't bring it back
I said that if I caught the Tang Priest by following your plan I would take you as my sworn sister
Today your plan has proved itself to have been a superb one and the Tang Priest has been caught I could not possibly go back on my word
Little ones he ordered his underlings bring a table whet a sharp knife open this monk up cut out his heart skin him and slice up his flesh
I also want music played while I share him with my sister and we both obtain eternal life Your Majesty said the mandarin fish don't eat him yet
His disciples may make trouble if they come here searching for him
It would be better to wait a couple of days until we know those damned wretches won't come looking for him before we cut him up Then Your Majesty will sit in the place of honour while we your kinsfolk play music sing and dance around you and wait on you and you will be able to take your pleasure at your ease
Wouldn't that be best The monster accepted the suggestion and had Sanzang stored away in a sixfootlong stone chest behind the palace
Pig and Friar Sand meanwhile recovered the luggage in the river loaded it on the back of the white horse and swam up through the waves as they parted the waters
When Monkey saw them from up in the air he asked Where's the master He's not the Tang Priest now said Pig
He's the Drowned Priest
We can't find him anywhere so let's go back ashore and decide what to do Now Pig was a mortal incarnation of Marshal Tian Peng who had once commanded eighty thousand sailors on the Heavenly River in the sky Friar Sand had come from the Flowing Sands River and the white horse was the grandson of the Dragon King of the Western Ocean so they were all good swimmers
With the Great Sage showing them the way from midair they were soon back at the Eastern bank where they dried and brushed the horse and wrung out their clothes
Monkey then landed his cloud and they went back together to the Chen household where a messenger had already reported that only three of the four venerable gentlemen who were going to fetch the scriptures were now returning
The two aged brothers hurried outside to meet them Gentlemen they said seeing their wet clothes we tried so hard to persuade you to stay longer and look what has come of your refusal
Where is the venerable Tang Priest He isn't the Tang Priest any more said Pig
He's the Drowned Priest Alas alas said the aged brothers bursting into tears
We said that you should wait until the snow had melted and we could send you all across in a boat but he refused to agree and now he's dead Old men said Monkey don't upset yourselves over your friend
I can assure you that the master will not die
I'm certain that the Great King of Miraculous Response has captured him by magic
So stop worrying have our clothes washed and starched our passport dried out and the white horse fed
My brothers and I will find the damned creature rescue the master and wipe this evil monster out Then he'll give you village no more trouble and you will I hope have a safe and peaceful future Old Mr
Chen greatly encouraged to hear this ordered a vegetarian meal to be provided
Journey to the West The three brothers ate their fill handed the horse and the luggage over to the care of the Chen household got their weapons ready and hurried off to find their master and catch the monster
Indeed The true nature was harmed by treading on the ice How could they be complete without the Cinnabar
If you do not know how they rescued the Tang Priest listen to the explanation in the next installment
Sanzang's Great Misfortune Is to Fall into the River Guanyin's Fish Basket Saves the Tang Priest The story tells how the Great Sage Monkey took his leave of the old Chen brothers went with Pig and Friar Sand to the bank of the river and told the two of them to decide which of them would go into the water first
Brother said Pig you should go first neither of us two has very special powers To be frank with you brother replied Monkey
I wouldn't need any help from either of you in dealing with mountain spirits but I can't cope in the water
If I go into rivers or seas I have to make hand spells to keep the water away or else change into something like a fish or a crab
But if I'm making a hand spell I can't get a good swing with my cudgel use my powers or kill evil spirits
I asked you two to go in because I've long known that you're both good swimmers Brother said Friar Sand I'll go but I don't know what we'll find at the bottom of the river
I think we should all go
You should turn yourself into something or else let me carry you through the water to find the monster's den You go first and discover what's been happening
If the master hasn't been hurt and is still there we can do our best to attack the monster
But if the monster has used magic on the master and he's has been drowned or eaten there will be no point in searching too hard we'd better find something else to do instead You're right brother said Monkey
Which of you will carry me Pig was secretly delighted at this question
Goodness only knows how many times that ape has put one over on me he thought
As he can't swim I'll carry him and put one over on him this time Brother he said chuckling I'll carry you Realizing that Pig was up to something Monkey decided to beat him at his own game and replied Very well you're stronger than Friar Sand Pig then took Monkey on his back
Friar Sand parted a way through the waters of the River of Heaven for the brotherdisciples
When they had covered thirty or forty miles on the riverbed the idiot made a grab for Monkey who pulled out one of his hairs and turned it into a double of himself that he put on Pig's back while changing his real self into a pig louse that clung firmly to the idiot's ear
Pig suddenly stumbled as he walked along threw Monkey forward and made him fall
Now as the double was only a hair transformed it floated up and disappeared
Journey to the West Brother said Friar Sand to Pig what are you doing
Why have you fallen over in the mud instead of walking along properly
And even if you have to do that where have you dropped Monkey He couldn't stop himself falling Pig replied and he's vanished
Never mind whether he's alive or dead We two will go and find the master No said Friar Sand we need him
He's no swimmer but he's cleverer than us
If he not coming I won't go with you Monkey could restrain himself no longer
Pig he shouted at the top of his voice from inside the ear
I'm here When Friar Sand heard this he said with a laugh That's done it You're the one that's had it you idiot You had a nerve trying to put one over on him What are we going to do now
We can hear him but he's disappeared Pig knelt in the mud and started to kowtow desperately saying I did wrong brother I did wrong
When we've rescued the master I'll apologize to you properly on shore
Where did you talk to us from
You scared me to death Please please turn back into yourself
I'll carry you and I promise not to knock you about any more You've been carrying me all the time said Monkey
I won't play any tricks on you
Now get going and fast The idiot staggered to his feet still mumbling apologies and pressed on with Friar Sand
After another thirty or forty miles they looked up to see a tall building on which was written in large letters RESIDENCE OF THE RIVER TURTLE
This must be where the monster lives said Friar Sand
We two can't go up to the doors and challenge him to battle without finding out how things stand Wujing said Brother Monkey to Friar Sand is there water inside and outside the door No said Friar Sand
In that case you two hide near here while I take a look round said Monkey
The splendid Great Sage climbed out of Pig's ear shook himself turned into a female shrimp with long legs and reached the doors with two or three jumps
When he took a good look around he saw the monster sitting up above the door with all his watery tribe drawn up around him and the female mandarin fish sitting at his side They were all discussing how to eat the Tang Priest
Monkey looked carefully around but could see the master nowhere
Then he noticed another female shrimp coming over and standing in the portico to the West
Monkey leapt forward and called Sisterinlaw where is this Tang Priest that His Majesty and everyone else are talking about eating His Majesty caught him yesterday when he made all that snow and ice the female shrimp replied He's now in a stone chest behind the palace
If his disciples don't come here to make trouble we'll have music and feast on him tomorrow When Monkey heard this he kept up his act for a little longer then went straight round to the back of the palace where he found a stone chest just like a stone pigtrough in a sty or a stone coffin He measured it found that it was six feet long lay on it and listened
He could hear Sanzang sobbing inside
Monkey said nothing but put his ear against the lid listened more carefully and could make out Sanzang gnashing his teeth and saying amid moans Journey to the West If only my fate had not always been so bad Disasters in rivers all my life have I had
Soon after I was born I was floated on the water And now that have I drowned never I will not see Lord Buddha
Not so long ago the Black River made me weep And now the breaking ice has consigned me to the deep
I wonder if at any time my followers will come To let me fetch the scriptures and complete my journey home Monkey could not restrain himself from calling to him Master don't be so upset about troubles by water
As the Classic of Water Disaster has it 'Earth is the mother of the Five Elements and water is their origin
Without earth there can be no life and without water there can be no growth' I'm here Save me disciple said Sanzang hearing Monkey's voice
Don't worry said Monkey I promise we'll save you when we've captured the monster Act fast said Sanzang
If I'm here for another day I'll die of suffocation No problem said Monkey no problem
I'm off He turned sprang out through the main doors turned back into himself and called for Pig
What's happening asked the idiot and Friar Sand as they came up to him
The monster caught the master with that trick Monkey replied
He's unhurt but the monster has put him inside a stone chest
You two challenge the monster to battle at once while I get out of the water
Capture him if you can and if you can't then pretend to be beaten and lure him out of the water for me to kill Out you go brother and don't worry said Friar Sand
We'll find out what the monster's really like Monkey then made a wateraverting spell with his hands shot up through the waves and stood on the bank to wait
Watch while Pig charges at the doors in a murderous mood yelling Damned monster give us our master back The little devils inside the doors rushed back in panic to report Your Majesty there are people outside asking for their master It must be those bloody monks here said the monster
Fetch my armor and weapons at once The little devils ran to fetch them and when the monster was in his armor and holding his weapons in his hand he ordered that the doors be opened
As he came out Pig and Friar Sand who were standing one to each side could see how he was dressed and equipped
He was a fine monster Just look Journey to the West On his head a gleaming helmet of gold On his body golden armor that made a rainbow
His belt was studded thick with pearls and jade The strange boots on his feet were of smoky yellow leather
His nose was as high as a mountain ridge His brow as majestically broad as a dragon's
Fierce and round were his eyes that flashed Spikes of steel were his sharp neat teeth His short matted hair seemed to be ablaze And his long whiskers bristled like golden spikes
In his mouth he was chewing a tender reed While he wielded a nineknobbed mace of copper
The noise when the doors were opened wide Rivaled the crashing of thunder in spring
Few such could be seen in the world of mortals The Great King truly deserves his title
The evil spirit came outside accompanied by a hundred or more of his little devils who brandished their swords and spears as they formed themselves up into two companies Where are you from monks he asked Pig and why are you making this horrible noise here You got away before but I'll get you now damned monster Pig shouted back
Stop pretending you don't know who I amwe've had words already
I'm a disciple of the holy priest from the Great Tang who's going to worship the Buddha and collect the scriptures in the Western Heaven
You and your little tricks calling yourself the Great King of Miraculous Response and eating boys and girls in Chen Village Can't you recognize me
I was the Chen family's little girl Pan of Gold Monk said the monster you're a disgrace
You deserve to be punished for fraudulent impersonation if you turned yourself into that girl
You wounded the back of my hand although I never ate you
I let you off that time so why have you come to my front door looking for me Journey to the West What do you mean let me off said Pig
You made that cold wind and the snow froze the river and are going to kill the master
As soon as you give him back there'll be no more trouble but if you so much as start to say no you'll get it from this rake of mine and it'll show you no mercy The evil spirit's response to this was a mocking laugh
That's fancy talk monk he said but it's a load of nonsense except that I did make the cold the snow and the ice and I have captured your master
You may think you can get him back by coming here and shouting but this time things are different Last time I was unarmed as I was going to a banquet which was why you took me by surprise and wounded me
This time I'll fight three rounds with you if you don't make yourself scarce
If you're a match for me I'll give you back your master but if you're not you'll be eaten too What a good little boy said Pig Just what I expected to hear from you
Watch out for my rake So you only became a monk in middle life said the monster
You really do have some miraculous responsiveness my boy Pig replied
How did you know that If you fight with a rake that must mean you used to be a hired hand in a vegetable garden and stole it said the monster
My boy said Pig this isn't a farming rake
Just look at it Its mighty prongs are like dragon claws Set with gold in the from of serpents
In battle with a foe it makes cold winds Till it gives off flames in a longer fight
It kills off demons for the holy priest Subduing evil spirits on the journey West
When it stirs up clouds it bolts out sun and moon Making the colours of sunset brightly shine
It could knock down Mount Tai to the terror of the tigers Turn the oceans upside down alarming all the dragons
I could spare you for the sake of your mighty powers But if I struck you with the rake it would make nine holes Journey to the West Refusing to believe this the monster raised his copper mace and struck at Pig's head
Pig parried the blow with his rake and said Damn you you're just an evil creature turned spirit in middle life How can you tell that the monster asked
As you fight with a mace I think you must have worked as a furnaceman for a silversmith got your hands on that hammer and stolen it Pig replied
It's no silversmith's hammer the monster said
Look at it Its nine knobs all are like the buds of flowers Growing on a sprig of an evergreen plant
This never was a product of the earthly world For it came from the gardens of immortal beings
Its green and purple fruit matured by the Jade Pool Its pure fragrance was formed beside the Nephrite Pond
Because I worked and tempered it with diligence and skill It now is hard as steel and miraculously sharp
Spears swords and halberds are not its worthy rivals Battleaxe and partisan do not dare approach
No matter how sharp are the prongs of your rake If they touch my hammer they'll bend and they'll break This conversation between the two of them was too much for Friar Sand who came forward and said Monster stop all that empty talk
As the saying goes actions speak louder than words
Wait there and see how you like my staff The monster parried it with his mace and replied You're another one who became a monk in middle life How can you tell Friar Sand asked
From the look of you you must have been a miller before the monster replied
What makes you think that Friar Sand asked
Why would you fight with a noodlemaking pole if you weren't a miller the monster asked
Journey to the West You evil thing said Friar Sand What you can't see is that Few are the weapons like this one in the world Which is why you do not know what this staff of mine is called
It grew in a shadeless part of the moon Was shaped from the trunk of a Salatree
The jewels set around it shine with many colours And solid is the blessing that is packed inside
Once it was present at the Jade Emperor's banquets Now it protects the priest from the Tang
On this road to the West it is utterly unknown But great is its fame in the palaces of Heaven
It is known as the precious demonquelling staff And with a single blow it could pulverize your brow The evil spirit allowed no more arguments and the three of them now became deadly foes They fought a fine battle under the water Mace staff and rake Wuneng and Wujing against the monster
One was Marshal Tian Peng come to earth One a great general down from Heaven
Both showed their prowess in attacking the water monster Who put up a good fight against the heavenly monks
They had the good fortune to complete the great Way Overcoming each other in an endless sequence
Journey to the West Earth defeated water When water was dried out the riverbed showed
Water gave birth to wood Which blossomed when it was growing well
Dhyana and meditation were all the same Refining cinnabar and alchemy submitted to the Three Schools Earth was the mother Yielding sprouts of metal And metal yielded the liquid that gave birth to the babe
Water was the root That nurtured wood's flourishing Which rivaled in its glory the glow of sunset
Because the elements were crowded together They all turned hostile and started to fight
See how bright are the nine knobs on the mace While the staff is decorated with manycoloured silks
The rake crushed positive and negative Divided the Nine Bright Shiners And swung in a tangle without any order
They were ready to die to save the Tang Priest Prepared to give their lives for Sakyamuni Buddha
They kept the mace of copper busy without respite Parrying the blows of the staff and the rake
When the three of them had been fighting under the water for four full hours without either side emerging as victor Pig realized that they were not going to beat the monster and gave Friar Sand a nod
Pretending that they were beaten the two of them turned and fled trailing their weapons behind them
Journey to the West Hold your ground here little ones said the monster to his underlings while I go after those wretches
When I catch those damned monks I'll bring them back for you all to eat Watch him as he emerges above the water in pursuit of the two of them like the wind driving fallen leaves or a rainstorm beating down withered blossoms
Monkey meanwhile had been standing on the bank watching the water with unwavering eyes
Suddenly he saw the waves thrown into turmoil as with a great roar Pig leapt ashore
He's coming he said he's coming Next Friar Sand reached the bank saying He's coming he's coming Then came the monster after them shouting Where've you gone No sooner had his head come into view than Monkey struck with his cudgel shouting Take that The evil spirit swerved to avoid it then parried with his copped mace
While the one stirred up the waves in the river the other showed his prowess on the shore
Before three rounds of the fight had been fought the monster unable to keep up his resistance did a feint and plunged back into the water whereupon the wind fell and the waves subsided
Thank you brothers said Monkey going back up the high bank
Brother said Friar Sand you may not think that monster is up to much on the shore but he's a real terror underwater Pig and I attacking together were only as good as him alone
How are we going to deal with him and rescue the master We've no time to lose said Monkey He may kill the master I'll trick him into coming out said Pig
You wait up in the air and say nothing at all
When you reckon his head is above the water hit him a good hard one on the forehead from upsidedown
Even if that doesn't kill him his head will ache and he'll feel faint When I catch him one with my rake that'll settle his score Good idea said Monkey good idea
That's what they call a coordinated attack and it will do the trick The two of them went back into the water
The evil monster fled to his palace in defeat where the other demons greeted him and the mandarin fish asked Where did Your Majesty chase those two monks to They have an accomplice the monster replied
When they jumped ashore he swung an iron cudgel at me
I dodged it and fought back Goodness only know how heavy that cudgel is I couldn't keep it off me with my mace
He sent me back here beaten in less than three rounds Can you remember what their accomplice looks like Your Majesty the mandarin fish asked
He's a monk with a hairy face that looks like a thunder god's the monster replied pointed ears a broken nose and fiery eyes with golden pupils At this the mandarin fish shuddered
Thank goodness Your Majesty could see how good a fighter he was and ran away she said
You would never have survived another three rounds
I know who that monk is Journey to the West Who is he then the monster asked
When I was in the Eastern Ocean many years ago I once heard the old dragon king talk of his fame He's the Handsome Monkey King the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who made himself into a golden Immortal of the Supreme Monad and made havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago
Now he has submitted to the Buddha's teachings changed his name to Sun Wukong the Novice and is protecting the Tang Priest on his journey to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures
He has enormous divine powers and can do all sorts of transformations
Your Majesty you must not provoke him or have any more fights with him Before these remarks were out of her mouth the little devils from by the door came back to report Your Majesty those two monks are back here challenging you to battle again Good sister said the monster you are very wise
I won't go out but I'll see what happens He sent this urgent order
Little ones shut the doors firmly
As they say You can stand outside and roar But we won't unlock the door
They can hang around for a couple of days and when they can't take any more and go away we'll feast on the Tang Priest at our ease The little demons piled up rocks and made a clay cement to seal the doors firmly shut
When the repeated shouts of Pig and Friar Sand failed to bring the monster out the idiot lost his patience and started to smash the doors with his rake but they were so firmly barricaded that even though he broke up the doors themselves with seven or eight blows there were still so many layers of clay and rocks behind them that he had no hope of getting through
Brother said Friar Sand when he saw this that demon is so scared that he's barricaded his doors and won't come out
We'd better go back to the shore and discuss it with Monkey Pig agreed and they returned to the Eastern bank
When Monkey who was waiting up in the mist and clouds with his cudgel in his hand saw the two of them emerge with no demon after them he landed his cloud on the bank to meet them Brothers he asked why haven't you brought him up with you The monster has barricaded his doors and won't show himself said Friar Sand
When Brother Pig smashed his doors down he saw that the doorway was strongly blocked up with clay and rocks and as we can't fight him we've come back to discuss with you some other way of saving the master It sounds hopeless said Monkey
You two patrol the bank and don't let the monster escape while I'm away Where are you going brother asked Pig
I'm going to Potaraka to call on the Bodhisattva Monkey replied and find out about the monster's name and background
When I've found his ancestral home and captured his relations and neighbors I'll come back Journey to the West to get him and rescue the master But doing all that will be too much trouble and take far too long laughed Pig
I assure you it won't take any time or trouble replied Brother Monkey
I'll soon be back The splendid Great Sage set off from the river bank at high speed on his auspicious cloud and headed for the Southern Sea
Within an hour Potaraka Island was in view and he landed the cloud on Pota Cliff where the twentyfour devas the guardian god of the island Moksa the Novice the boy Sudhana and the Naga Maiden Pengzhu all came forward to bow in greeting and ask Why have you come Great Sage There is something about which I would like to see the Bodhisattva Monkey replied
The Bodhisattva left her cave this morning to go to her bamboo grove the devas replied
She allowed nobody to accompany her but as she knew that you would be coming today she told us to wait here to greet you
Since you will not be able to see her at once would you please sit under the Turquoise Cliff until the Bodhisattva comes out and decides what to do Brother Monkey did as they suggested but before he had sat down the page Sudhana came up to him and said with a bow Great Sage Sun thanks to you earlier kindness the Bodhisattva deigned to keep me I never leave her side and am always at the foot of her lotus throne
She has been very good to me Monkey who knew that he had previously been the Red Boy laughed as he said You were so confused by evil then that you only realize I'm a good person now you've been converted When he had been waiting for a long time but the Bodhisattva had still not appeared Monkey said anxiously Will you please report that I'm here
Time's being lost and I'm worried that my master may be killed We would not dare the devas replied
The Bodhisattva told us to wait till she came herself Monkey who was much too impatient to wait a moment longer rushed inside
The Handsome Monkey King Was impatient and very snide
The devas could not hold him back When he wanted to go inside
He strode deep into the grove Eyes wide as he peered around
He saw the Saviour sitting on Bamboo leaves on the ground
Journey to the West She was not washed or combed And her face was free of care
There were no tassels to hold in place The silken strands of her hair
She did not wear her plain blue robe But only a clinging vest A skirt of brocade round her waist And both arms left undressed
There was no shawl for her shoulders On her foot she wore no shoe
Her jade hand held a knife of steel With which she peeled bamboo
When Monkey saw her he could not restrain himself from shouting Bodhisattva your disciple Sun Wukong offers his pious respects Wait outside said the Bodhisattva
Bodhisattva Monkey replied my master is in trouble and I have come to inquire respectfully about the background of the evil monster in the River of Heaven Get out said the Bodhisattva and wait till I come out Not daring to push his demands any harder Monkey had to leave the bamboo grove and say to all the devas The Bodhisattva seems to be spring cleaning
Why is she cutting strips of bamboo in the grove and not properly dressed instead of sitting on her lotus throne We don't know said the devas
She left the cave and went into the grove this morning before dressing telling us to receive you here
It must be something to do with you Great Sage Monkey could do nothing but wait
Before long the Bodhisattva emerged from the grove carrying a basket made from purple bamboo
Wukong she said you and I are going to rescue the Tang Priest Journey to the West Monkey fell to his knees and replied Your disciple has the temerity to suggest that you should dress and take your seat on your lotus throne There will be no need to dress I shall go as I am the Bodhisattva replied after which she dismissed the devas and set off on an auspicious cloud
Monkey could only follow
In a moment they were on the banks of the River of Heaven When Pig and Friar Sand saw them they said to each other That brother of ours is too impatient
Goodness only knows what sort of row he must have made in the Southern Sea to make the Bodhisattva come rushing here before she was even properly dressed Before these words were out of their mouths Guanyin reached the bank and the two of them bowed low to her saying Bodhisattva we shouldn't have done it we were wrong forgive us The Bodhisattva undid the silken sash around her waistcoat tied one end to the basket and rose on a coloured cloud
Holding the other end of the sash she threw the basket into the river then pulled it up through the current reciting Die if you go live if you stay die if you go live if you stay When she had said this seven times she raised the basket again and this time it contained a glistening goldfish blinking its eyes and moving its scales
Wukong said the Bodhisattva go down into the water and rescue your master How can I Monkey said
The monster hasn't been caught yet Isn't that him in the basket the Bodhisattva asked
Pig and Friar Sand then bowed low and asked How could that fish have had such great powers It originally was a goldfish that I raised in my lotus pool the Bodhisattva replied Every day it would swim up to listen to sutras and it trained itself to have magic powers
The nineknobbed copper mace was an unopened lotus bud that it tempered and made into a weapon
One day I do not know when a high tide reached the pool and carried it here
When I was leaning on the balustrade looking at the lotuses this morning I noticed that the wretch had not come to pay his respects so I examined my fingers and the palms of my hands and worked out that it must have become a spirit and be planning to kill your master That was why I did not wait to dress before using my divine powers to weave a bamboo basket in which to catch him In that case said Monkey could you stay here a moment longer
We would like to let the faithful in Chen Village gaze upon your golden countenance Bodhisattva
This would be a great kindness and it would also teach common folk to believe and make offerings by showing them how that demon was subdued Very well said the Bodhisattva
Call them here Pig and Friar Sand then ran to the village shouting Come and see the living Bodhisattva Guanyin come and see the living Bodhisattva Guanyin All the villagers young and old men and women rushed to the edge of the river and fell to their knees and kowtowed in worship despite the mud and the water
Among them was a good painter who left to posterity the painting of the Bodhisattva Guanyin appearing with a fishbasket
The Bodhisattva then returned to the Southern Sea
Pig and Friar Sand cleared a way through the water straight to the River Turtle's Residence where they searched for their master
All the water monsters and fish spirits there were now dead and rotten
They went round to the back of the palace opened the stone chest carried the Tang Priest up out of the water and showed him to the crowds
The Chen brothers kowtowed and expressed their thanks saying My lord if only you had accepted our advice and stayed longer you would have been spared all this trouble Journey to the West Say no more about it replied Monkey
From next year onwards you people here won't need to make any more sacrifices The Great King has been removed and will never do you any harm again Old Mr
Chen I'd now like to trouble you to find a boat as soon as you can to take us across the river Yes I can I can said Chen Qing ordering people to saw wood into planks to build a boat When his retainers heard this they were all delighted to make offerings and there were many cries of I'll pay for the mast and the sail I'll fix the oars I'll provide the rigging and I'll hire the boatmen Amid all the noisy yelling on the bank a great shout came from the river Great Sage Sun don't waste other people's money building a boat
I shall carry you all master and disciples across the river When the crowd heard this they were all terrified
The more timid among them slipped home while the bolder stayed to watch shivering and shaking
A moment later a monster emerged from the water This is what it was like A divine squareheaded and extraordinary beast The miraculous creature the immortal of the waters
Wagging his tail he can live for many an age Hiding still and silent in the depths of the rivers
Leaping through the waves he rushes to the bank Or lies beside the sea facing sun and wind
He has mastered the true Way of nourishing his essence The Ancient Softshelled Turtle with his carapace of white
Great Sage called the Ancient Softshelled Turtle don't have a boat built
I'll take you four across I'll get you you evil beast said Monkey swinging his iron cudgel
Come to the bank and I'll kill you with this I am grateful to you Great Sage and have offered in good faith to carry you master and you disciples across the river so why do you want to kill me the monster asked
What good turn have I ever done you Brother Monkey asked
Great Sage said the Softshelled Turtle you may not realize that the River Turtle's Residence at the bottom of the river is my home which was handed down to me by many generations of ancestors
Because I acquired awareness of the fundamental and developed a divine spirit by cultivating my conduct I had my ancestral home rebuilt as the River Turtle's Residence
Nine years ago on a day when the sea was roaring and the waves were crashing that evil monster came here on the tide and used his power to make a vicious attack on me He killed many of my children and captured many of my clan As I was no match for him I had to let him take my home for nothing
Now that you have come to rescue the Tang Priest Great Sage and have Journey to the West asked the Bodhisattva Guanyin here to sweep away evil and capture the monster my house has been returned to me and my family reunited
We can now live in our old home instead of having to make mud shelters
That is why my gratitude to you is as great as a mountain and as deep as the sea
And it is not only my family that is grateful The whole village will now be spared from the annual sacrifice and the sons and daughters of many a family will be spared
You have indeed brought double benefits with a single action and that kindness is one that I have to repay Monkey's heart was warmed to hear this so he put his cudgel away and asked Is all that really true How could I possibly lie to the Great Sage who has done me so very great a kindness the Ancient Softshelled Turtle asked
If it's the truth you must swear an oath to Heaven Monkey said whereupon the Ancient Softshelled Turtle opened his red mouth and swore to Heaven If I do not faithfully carry the Tang Priest across the River of Heaven may my whole body be turned to blood Come ashore come ashore said Monkey with a smile
Only then did the Ancient softshelled Turtle approach the shore give a jump and climb up the bank
When they all went close they saw that he had a huge white shell about forty feet around
Master said Monkey let's climb on his back and cross over But disciple said Sanzang we could not get across that ice even though it was frozen so thick
I'm afraid that we would be even less safe on a turtle's back Do not be afraid Master said the Ancient Softshelled Turtle
I'm much safer than those thick layers of ice
I'll only fail in my spiritual endeavors if I roll to the side Master said Monkey no creature that can speak human language will tell a lie He then told Pig and Friar Sand to lead the horse forward
When they reached the banks everyone in the village came to see them off with deep bows
Monkey led the animal on to the turtle's white shell and asked the Tang Priest to stand to the horse's right Pig to its left and Friar Sand behind it while he stood in front
Just in case the Softshelled Turtle tried to misbehave Monkey undid his belt of tiger sinew threaded it through the turtle's nose and held it like a halter
Then with one foot on the turtle's shell and one on its head and with his iron cudgel in one hand and the halter in the other he shouted Take it easy Ancient Softshelled Turtle
One roll from you and I'll hit you on the head I'd never dare I'd never dare the turtle said and he started to walk across the water on his four feet as if going across dry land
All the people on the bank burnt incense kowtowed and recited Namo Amitabha Buddha This had indeed been a case of a true arhat coming down to the mortal world and the appearance of a living Bodhisattva
Everyone bowed watched them until they could be seen no more and then went home
In less than a day the master rode the White Softshelled Turtle across the  miles of the River of Heaven and landed on the other side with hands and feet still dry
When he had climbed ashore Sanzang put his hands together in thanks and said Ancient Softshelled Turtle I have put you to a great effort but I have nothing I can give you
I shall have to express my gratitude when I come back with the scriptures There is on need for any presents venerable sir said the turtle
I hear that the Lord Buddha in the Western Heaven has gone beyond death and life and knows everything in the past and the future
I have been cultivating my conduct here for over  years and although I have prolonged my life and learned human Journey to the West speech I cannot escape from my shell
I beg you venerable sir to ask the Lord Buddha on my behalf when I will be rid of this shell and able to take human form
I shall ask I shall ask Sanzang promised at which the Ancient Softshelled Turtle plunged back into the water and Monkey helped Sanzang to mount the horse
With Pig shouldering the luggage and Friar Sand walking alongside master and disciples took the main trail West
Indeed The emperor sent the priest on his journey to visit the Buddha Great were the hardships and long was the road over river and hill
Firm was his will and sincere was his heart for him death held no terror
The River of Heaven he crossed standing high on the old turtle's shell If you don't know how much further they had to go or what other terrible trials faced them listen to the explanation in the next installment
Feelings Run Wild and Nature Gets Loose Because of Desire In Confusion of Spirit the Heart Is Disturbed and the Demon Encountered The poem goes The heart must be frequently swept The dust of emotions removed Lest the Buddha be trapped in the pit
Only when the essence is pure Can the origin then be discussed
Trim the candle of nature Breathe in the way that Master Caoxi taught Control the ape and horse of the mind
Only when breath is calm by day and night Journey to the West Can one achieve the true adept's skill
This poem is set to the tune Nan Ke Zi and it tells how the Tang Priest escaped disaster under the ice of the River of Heaven and crossed to the other bank on the shell of the white turtle
As the four pilgrims headed West it was now the depths of winter but the mists in the forests were still light and the bony shapes of the mountains could be seen rising in their purity above the waters
As master and disciples carried on along their way they were obstructed by a big mountain
The road was rocky and they and the horse found the going rough
Sanzang reined the horse in and called for his disciples
Monkey led Pig and Friar Sand forward to stand in attendance and asked Master what are your instructions You can see how high the mountain in front of us is said Sanzang
I am worried that there may be tigers wolves monsters and demon beasts who will kill us
You must be very careful Don't worry Master said Monkey
We three brothers have got on very well together since we were converted to the pursuit of the truth With our magic powers to put down demons and monsters we've got nothing to fear from tigers wolves or demons This greatly reassured Sanzang who pressed ahead
When he reached the mouth of a gully and urged the horse up the slope he raised his head and saw that it was a splendid mountain Towering crags A steep and lofty range
Towering crags pierced the heavens The steep and lofty range blocked out the azure shy
Grotesque rocks were piled like sitting tigers Twisted slanting pines seemed to fly like dragons Beautifully sang the birds on the ridge Heavy hung the scent of plum blossom by the scar
Cold was the sluggish flow of the stream And menacing hung the dark clouds over the peak
They saw whirling snow And an icy wind Howling with the roar of hungry mountain tigers
Journey to the West Cold rooks could find no perches in the trees And wild deer did not know the way back home
Hard it was indeed for the traveler to make progress As he frowned with worry and covered up his head
The four of them were trembling in the cold and the snow as they crossed that high ridge and saw in a distant hollow high towers and elegant houses
Disciples said a relieved Sanzang from the back of his horse we have gone cold and hungry today but there are many buildings in that hollow that I an sure must be a farm or a Buddhist or Taoist monastery
Let us go there and beg some food before we continue on our way Monkey's immediate response was to take a good look
He saw that evillooking clouds and vapors hung over the place so he turned back to the Tang Priest and said Master that's a bad place How could it possibly be a bad place with all those towers pavilions and fine buildings Sanzang asked
You wouldn't know Master Monkey replied
There are any number of evil spirits and monsters along this road to the West who are good at making buildings by magic
They can make anything from towers and houses to halls and pavilions and all just as bait
As you know one of the nine kinds of dragon is called the clamdragon
Its breath comes out looking like fine buildings and pools
Clamdragon buildings appear when there is a heavy mist over a great river
Birds flying by will perch on them for a rest
The clamdragon eats everyone up even if there are thousands of them
It's a really lethal trick
The atmosphere over there looks thoroughly vicious
whatever you do don't go there Even if I may not I am still very hungry indeed said Sanzang
Yes Master you really must be replied Monkey Would you like to dismount and sit on this level ground here while I go somewhere else to beg food for you Sanzang followed this suggestion
While Pig held the halter Friar Sand put the luggage down opened up one of the bundles and took out a begging bowl that he handed to Monkey who gave him these parting instructions as he took it
Don't go any further Guard the master and make sure he stays sitting here until I come back with some food Then we can carry on West Friar Sand promised to do so
Monkey then spoke to Sanzang again Master this is a very dangerous place Whatever you do you mustn't move away from here
I'm off now to beg for food No need to say any more replied Sanzang Be back as soon as you can
I shall wait for you here Monkey turned and was about to go when he turned back to add Master I know that you haven't the patience to sit still but I'll make a spell to keep you safe here With that he took out his goldbanded cudgel and in a flash he drew a circle on the ground with it
He asked the Tang priest to sit in the circle with Pig and Friar Sand standing on either side and the horse and luggage nearby
Then he put his palms together and said to the Tang Priest The circle I've drawn is stronger than a wall of bronze or iron
No tiger leopard wolf demon fiend or monster will dare come anywhere near it But you must not step outside it
I guarantee that you'll come to no harm as long as you sit inside the circle but once Journey to the West you leave it very nasty things will happen to you
Please please please stay inside it whatever happens Sanzang did as he was told and they all sat down
Only then did Monkey set off due South on his cloud to beg for some food When he saw the ancient trees of another farmhouse reaching up to the sky he brought his cloud down for a closer look
This is what he saw Willows bent down by cruel snow A square pool frozen hard
A few sparse bamboos waving green The turquoise of a lofty and elegant pine
Thatched cottages that looked covered with silver A slanting bridge that seemed paved with flour
Daffodils by the fence were beginning to open While icicles hung low beneath the eaves
The icy wind carried many a strange fragrance The plum blossom was lost amid the driving snow
As Monkey walked towards the farm to take a look at it he heard the creak of a wicker gate opening as an old man came out He was leaning on a wooden stick and wearing a sheepskin hat a tattered tunic and rush sandals He looked up to the sky and said The Northwest wind in blowing so the sky will be clear tomorrow Before the words were out of his mouth a Pekinese dog came bounding out from behind him and started barking wildly at Monkey
Only then did the man turn to see Monkey carrying his begging bowl
Venerable benefactor said Monkey I'm with the monk sent to the Western Heaven by the emperor of Great Tang in the East to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures
As we were passing this way and my master is very hungry I have come to your honorable residence to beg for a vegetarian meal The old man nodded hit the ground with his stick and said Reverend sir don't beg here You've lost your way No I haven't said Monkey
The main trail West is over three hundred miles North of here said the old man so why aren't you on that That's where I've come from Monkey replied
My master is now sitting by the main trail waiting for me to bring him some food Journey to the West You're talking nonsense monk the old man replied
How could your master be waiting by the main trail for you to bring him some food Even if you could walk this far it would take you six or seven days to cover over three hundred miles and as long again to get back
By then he would have starved to death Honestly benefactor replied Brother Monkey with a smile I have only just left my master and it took me less time to get here than it would to drink a cup of tea
When I've been given the food I'll take it back for his lunch This alarmed the old man who drew back at once saying That monk's a demon a demon He was just about to go back inside when Monkey took hold of him and asked Where are you going benefactor
Give me some food at once It's very difficult the old man said very difficult
Try somewhere else You really don't understand benefactor Monkey replied
Just think I've had to come over three hundred miles to get here so it would probably be another three hundred miles to another house
You're trying to make my master starve to death I tell you frankly the old man said that we can only put three pints of rice in the pot for the six or seven members of the family and it's still cooking
Try somewhere else first There is an old saying Monkey replied that it's better to stay in one house than to call on three
I'm staying put The old man lost his temper with Monkey for being so persistent and raised his stick to hit him
This did not worry Monkey at all who allowed the old man to hit him on his shaven pate seven or eight times it felt like having the itches on his head scratched
You're a monk who likes being hit on the head said the old man
Hit me as much as you like oldy said Monkey
I'm keeping the score and you'll have to give me a pint of rice for every blow When the old man heard this he dropped his stick rushed inside shut the gate and shouted A demon a demon This made the whole household shake with fear as they shut the front and back gates in a great hurry
Watching the gates being shut Monkey thought I wonder if the old villain was telling the truth about the amount of rice they cook
As the saying goes the good are converted by Taoism and the stupid by Buddhism
I'm going in to take a look round With that the splendid Great Sage made a spell with his hands to make himself invisible and went straight to the kitchen to look
He saw that the pot was steaming and half filled with grain so he thrust his begging bowl into it filled it to the brim and went back on his cloud
The Tang priest meanwhile who had been sitting in the circle for a long time waiting for Monkey to come back stretched looked around and said Where has that ape gone to beg for food Goodness only knows where he isprobably fooling around said Pig with a laugh beside him Begging for food indeed
He's left us here in a pen What do you mean in a pen Sanzang asked
Journey to the West That's something else you wouldn't know Master Pig replied In the old days people used to draw circles on the ground to make pens He draws a circle with his cudgel and says it's stronger than a wall of bronze or iron But how could it possibly keep out any tigers wolves or evil monsters that came here
We'd be a meal served up to them on a plate What should we do about it Wuneng Sanzang asked him
We're not sheltered from the wind or the cold here Pig said If you ask me we should carry on West along the trail
Monkey went off begging on his cloud so he's bound to be back soon He'll catch up with us
If he's got any food we can eat it before going on
All we've got from sitting here so long is cold feet These words were to be Sanzang's undoing
he followed the idiot's advice and they all left the circle
The Tang Priest walked along the trail with Pig leading the horse and Friar Sand carrying the luggage
They soon reached the house with high towers which was a Southfacing compound
Outside the gates was a whitewashed wall above which rose a multicolored gatetower shaped like lotuses leaning together
The gates stood half open
While Pig tethered the horse to a stone drum by the threshold Friar Sand put the luggage down and Sanzang sat on the doorsill out of the wind
Master said pig this looks like a nobleman or a minister's house
There's nobody at the gates so I suppose they're all inside warming themselves up by the fire
Sit down and let me take a look Do be careful said the Tang Priest
Don't go charging into their house I know said the idiot I'm a lot better mannered now I'm a Buddhist
I'm not a village yokel any more The idiot tucked his rake in his belt straightened his black brocade tunic and went in through the gate in a very affected way
He saw a large hall with high curtained windows that was completely quiet and deserted There were no tables chairs or other furniture
When he went round the screen and further into the house he found himself in a passageway at the end of which stood a multistoried building with upstairs windows half open through which yellow damask bedcurtains could be glimpsed
I suppose they're still in bed because it's so cold thought Pig whereupon he marched up the stairs without worrying about the propriety of invading the private quarters of the house
When the idiot lifted the curtain and looked inside he almost collapsed with shock on the ivory bed inside the curtains was a pile of gleaming white bones with a skull the size of a bushel measure and thighbones some four or five feet long
When the idiot calmed himself the tears poured down his cheeks as he nodded to the skeletons and said with a sigh I wonder For what great dynasty you once were a marshal In what country's service did you hold high command
Then you were a hero fighting for mastery But now you are only a pile of old bones
Where are the widow and child making offerings Do no soldiers burn incense to honour your memory Journey to the West The sight is enough to make one sigh deeply
Alas for the man who once was a conqueror As pig was sighing with grief there was a flicker of fire behind the curtain I suppose there must be attendants at the back to offer him incense the idiot thought
When he rushed round the bedcurtain to look he saw that it was the daylight shining through the windows beside which stood a coloured lacquer table
On it were thrown some padded clothes in brocade and embroidery When the idiot picked them up to look at them he saw that they were three quilted brocade waistcoats
Not worrying about whether it was right to do so the idiot took them downstairs and went out through the main hall and the gates Master he shouted there's no sign of life hereit's a house of the dead
I went inside and went upstairs where I found a pile of bones behind a yellow bedcurtain
On one side of the upper floor were three quilted brocade waistcoats lookI've brought them back with me
We're really in luck as they're just what we need now that the weather has turned cold
Take your habit off Master and put one of these on underneath You'll be a lot more comfortable it'll keep the cold out No said Sanzang it's forbidden
The law says 'Taking whether openly or in secret is always theft' If anyone found out came after us and handed us over to the authorities we would definitely be found guilty of theft
You had better take them back in and put them where you found them
We shall just sit here for a while to shelter from the wind and carry on along our way as soon as Wukong is back
Monks should not be looking out for easy pickings like that But there's nobody around who could know said Pig not even a chicken or a dog The only people who know are ourselves Who's going to sue us
There's no evidence
It's just the same as if we'd picked it up Taking or stealing just doesn't come into it Nonsense said the Tang Priest
Even if nobody else knew about it Heaven cannot be fooled
As the Lord of Origin teaches us 'Do no evil in a dark house the eyes of the gods are like lightning' Take it back at once and stop hankering after what you have no right to The idiot was having none of this
Master he said to the Tang Priest with a grin I've worn several waistcoats in my life but never have I seen quilted brocade ones like this before
Even if you don't want to wear one please let me just try one on to warm my back up
When Monkey comes back I'll take it off and we can be on our way again In that cast said Friar Sand I'd like to try one too The two of them took off their outer tunics and put the waistcoats on instead
As soon as they had tightened the belts they collapsed unable to stay on their feet
The waistcoats were even worse than bonds In an instant both of them had their hands tied together behind their backs
Sanzang stamped his foot in despair and indignation and rushed forward to untie them but to no avail
The three of them set up endless yells that soon disturbed a demon king
Now these buildings had indeed been created by the magic of an evil spirit who spent all his life lying in wait there to catch people
Hearing the howls of anger as he sat in his cave he rushed out to find that he had several victims tied up
The monster called for his little demons to go there with him as he made all the enchanted buildings vanish
They returned to the cave holding the Tang Priest leading the horse and dragging Pig and Friar Sand
The old demon took his seat on his throne while the little devils pushed Sanzang to the foot of the steps and forced him to kneel on the floor
Journey to the West Where are you from monk the demon asked and how can you have the effrontery to steal my clothes in broad daylight I have been sent to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven by the emperor of Great Tang in the East replied Sanzang
As I was hungry I sent my senior disciple to beg for food He has not come back yet and it was because I ignored his good advice that I blundered into your immortal hall to shelter from the wind never imagining that my disciples would be so grasping as to steal your clothes
As I have no such wicked thoughts I told them to take the clothes straight back but they paid no attention and insisted on putting them on to warm their backs
Never did I imagine that we would fall into Your Majesty's trap and be captured
I beg you in your mercy to spare our lives so that we can fetch the scriptures
We will be eternally indebted to Your Majesty and your praises will be sung for ever after we return to the East But I'm always hearing people say that if you eat the flesh of the Tang Priest white hair can be turned black and teeth that have fallen out will grow again said the demon with a grin
You've come along today without even having been asked and now you expect me to spare you
What's your senior disciple called and where has he gone begging This question started Pig bragging
My elder brother is Sun Wukong the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who made havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago This news shocked the demon speechless
I've long heard of that damned ape's enormous powers he thought and now I'm meeting him when I least expected to
Little ones he ordered tie the Tang Priest up take my precious coats off the other two and fetch a couple of ropes to bind them
Take them to the back and when I've caught the senior disciple we can scrub them all clean put them in the steamer and cook them The little demons acknowledged his orders then bound the three of them together and carried them to the back
They tethered the white horse by the trough took the luggage indoors and sharpened their weapons ready to capture Monkey
Monkey meanwhile who had filled his begging bowl with rice in the farmhouse to the South rode his cloud back and landed it on a stretch of level ground on the mountainside to find the Tang Priest gone he knew not where The circle he had drawn with his cudgel was still there but travelers and horse had disappeared
When he looked towards where the buildings had been they had vanished too all that could be seen were mountains and grotesquely shaped rocks
Don't tell me he thought with horror
They've been caught He rushed after them following the horse's prints Westwards
About two miles later when he was feeling thoroughly gloomy he heard voices on the other side of the slope to the North of him
When he looked he saw an old man in felt clothes a warm hat and a pair of worn oiled cloth boots holding a dragonheaded stick and followed by a slave boy The old man had broken off a sprig of plum blossom and was singing a song as he came down the slope
Monkey put down his begging bowl and looked the old man in the face as he put his hands together and said Greetings grandfather Where are you from reverend sir replied the old man returning his bow
We are monks from the East going to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures said Monkey There are four of us altogether a master and three disciples
I went off to beg for some food as my master was hungry so I told the other three to wait for me at a stretch of level ground on that mountainside
When I came back they had gone and I don't know which way they went
May I ask you if you Journey to the West have seen them grandfather The question made the old man chortle
Did one of the three have a long snout and big ears he asked
Yes yes yes Monkey replied
And was there another with an evillooking mug leading a white horse and a fat monk with a white face That's right that's right said Monkey
Then you've all lost your way said the old man Don't bother looking for them
It's every man for himself The whitefaced one is my master and the funnylooking ones are my brother disciples Monkey replied
We're all set on going to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures
Of course I've got to look for them When I came this way just now I saw that they had lost their way and were heading straight into the demon's mouth the old man said
I would be very grateful grandfather replied Monkey if you could tell me which demon it is and where he lives
I want to call on him and ask for them back so that we can go on with our journey to the Western Heaven This mountain is called Mount Jindou and there is a Jindou Cave in front of it the old man replied
In the cave lives the Great King Rhinoceros His magic abilities are enormous and he is very powerful
All three of your people must be dead by now If you go looking for them you might not even be able to keep yourself alive The best thing would be not to go there
I won't try to stop you or to keep you hereI simply leave you to think it over Monkey bowed again to thank the old man and said Thank you venerable sir for your advice
But I have to search for them Tipping the rice out and giving it to the old man he put his begging bowl away at which the old man put down his stick to accept the bowl which he handed to his slave Then they both resumed their normal form fell to their knees and kowtowed saying Great Sage we dare not try to deceive you
We two are the mountain deity and local god of this place and we've been waiting here to receive you Great Sage
We'll look after the rice and your begging bowl to make it easier for you to use your magic powers
When you've rescued the Tang Priest you can do your duty to him by giving him the food Hairy devils shouted Monkey you deserve a flogging
If you knew I was here why didn't you meet me earlier instead of skulking around in disguise
It's a disgrace Because you have such a quick temper Great Sage we did not want to rush in and offend you the local god replied
That was why we disguised ourselves to tell you all that Very well said Monkey we'll postpone that beating
Look after my bowl while I capture that evil spirit The Great Sage then tightened his belt of tiger sinew hitched up his tigerskin kilt took his goldbanded cudgel in his hands and headed straight for the mountain in search of the cave
As he rounded a sheer wall he saw a pair of stone doors set among rocks beside the bluegreen rockface Outside the doors a crowd of little devils were practicing with sword and spear
Indeed there were Journey to the West Auspicious clouds Green lichens Rows of strange and craggy rocks Steep paths winding around
Apes howled and birds sang in the beauty of nature Phoenixes flew and danced in this land of immortals
The first blooms were open on plum trees facing South A thousand bamboos were green in the sun's warmth
Under the cliff Deep in the gorge Under the cliff the snow was piled up white Deep in the gorge the stream had turned to ice
Stands of cypress and pine preserved ancient beauty Camellia bushes all bloomed with the same red
Without waiting to have a thorough look the Great Sage made straight for the doors and shouted at the top of his voice Little devils go straight in and tell your master that I'm Sun Wukong the Great Sage Equaling Heaven and the disciple of the holy Tang Priest Tell him to send my master out at once if you lot don't all want to be killed The little devils all hurried in to report Your Majesty there's a monk at the gate with a hairy face and a crooked mouth
He's called the Great Sage Equaling Heaven Sun Wukong and he's asking for his master back The demon was delighted to hear this Just the person I wanted to come he said
Ever since leaving my palace and coming down to the mortal world I've had no chance to try out my martial skills
Now that he's here I'll have a worthy foe
Bring me my weapons little ones he ordered
All the big and little devils in the cave braced themselves and carried out as quickly as they could a twelvefootlong steel spear that they handed to the old demon who gave them their instructions
Little ones you must keep in neat formation
Those who advance will be rewarded and anyone who retreats will be executed Having been given their orders the little devils charged out through the doors behind the old demon who shouted Who is Sun Wukong Monkey stepped across from beside the entrance to see how ugly and murderous the demon king looked
Journey to the West A single jagged horn A pair of bright eyes
The thick skin protruded above his head Black flesh shone by his ears
When he stretched his tongue he could lick his snout His mouth when opened wide showed yellow teeth
His hair was indigoblue His muscles hard as steel
He was like a rhinoceros but could not see through water Resembled a buffalo but could not plough
Not useful like the ox who lows at the moon He could easily scare the sky and shake the earth
His purple hands were knotted with muscle As he stood erect with his spear of steel
One only had to consider his hideous looks To see why he deserved to be called Rhinoceros King
Your grandpa Monkey is here said the Great Sage Monkey stepping forward
Give me back my master and neither of us will be hurt
But if there's so much as half a 'no' from you I'll kill you and there'll be nowhere to bury your remains I'll get you you impudent devil of an ape the demon roared back
What powers do you have that give you the nerve to talk like that Evidently you've not seen them yet Monkey replied
Your master stole my clothes said the demon and now I've caught him and am going to cook and eat him
What sort of tough guy do you think you are daring to come here to ask for him back My master is a loyal upright and good monk he couldn't possibly have stolen any of your devilish goods Monkey replied
Journey to the West I made a magic villa by the mountain path the demon said and your master crept inside He was so carried away by his greed that he stole three quilted brocade waistcoats I caught him redhanded
If you really have any powers I'll give you a fight Hold out against me for three rounds and I'll spare your master's life fail and you go to the underworld with him Shut up damned beast Monkey replied A fight would suit me fine
Come here and try a taste of my cudgel The monster was not at all afraid to fight and he thrust his spear at Monkey's head It was a superb battle
Just watch The goldbanded cudgel was raised The longhandled spear parried
The goldbanded cudgel was raised Flashing like a golden snake of lightning
The longhandled spear parried Glistening like a dragon emerging from the sea
Outside the doors the little devils beat their drums Drawn up in battle order to add to his might While the Great Sage showed his skill Displaying his abilities freely all around
On one side a spear and spirits braced Against it a cudgel and martial prowess
Indeed it was hero set against hero A pair of wellmatched foes
The demon king breathed out coiling purple mists While the gleam of the Great Sage's eyes formed coloured clouds Only because the Tang Priest was in trouble Did both of them fight so bitterly without quarter
After thirty inconclusive rounds the demon king could see that Sun Wukong was a complete master of the cudgel who could advance or retreat without leaving any openings What a splendid ape he kept saying Journey to the West with admiration what a splendid ape
This was the skill that made havoc in Heaven Monkey too was impressed by the demon king's neat spearwork as he parried to left and right with great skill What a splendid spirit he said what a splendid spirit
He really is a demon who would know how to steal elixir pills The two of them then fought another ten or twenty rounds The demon king touched the ground with the tip of his spear and ordered his little devils forward
All those wretched fiends surrounded the Great Sage with their cutlasses staves swords and spears Monkey was completely unafraid I'm glad you've come along he shouted glad you've come along
Just what I wanted With his goldbanded cudgel he blocked and parried them in front and behind and to both sides but the devils would not give ground
Losing his patience Monkey threw his cudgel into the air shouted Change and turned it into over a thousand cudgels that came raining down from the sky like flying snakes terrifying the devils out of their wits and sending them scurrying back to their cave for their lives with their hands over their heads
Behave yourself ape said the demon with a mocking laugh and watch this trick He immediately pulled out from his sleeve a gleaming white ring that he threw up into the air with a shout of Get them It came whirling down catching all the goldbanded cudgels inside it and forcing Monkey to somersault away for his life as he was now disarmed
While the demon king returned to his cave in triumph Brother Monkey was at his wit's end Indeed The Way grew by one foot but the demon grew by ten Blind and confused they failed to see that the house was fake
Alas there was no place to be found for the dharma body In action and in thoughts they had made a great mistake
If you don't know how all this ended listen to the explanation in the next installment
In Vain Does the MindApe Use a Thousand Tricks Fire and Water Fail to Harm the Demon The story tells how the Great Sage Equaling Heaven went emptyhanded and beaten to sit down behind Mount Jindou tears streaming from both eyes Master he called out I had hoped Journey to the West As Lord Buddha graciously brought us together To go on to live with you Master for ever With you to train and to learn to be free
Of the favours received ever mindful I'd be
Our hearts were both joined and our fates were entwined As we studied the Way we shared the same mind
I never expected to be at my wit's end Unable to win with no stick in my hand Just when he was in the depths of misery Monkey thought That fiend knew who I was
I remember him saying something about the sort of skill that made havoc in Heaven when he was praising me during the fight
That means he can't be a common mortal monster he must be an evil star from Heaven come down to earth for love of worldly things
I don't know where he come down from so I'd better go up to Heaven to make some inquiries Only then did Monkey start using his mind and taking the initiative again
At once he somersaulted up on an auspicious cloud going straight to the Southern Gate of Heaven where he looked up to see the Broadvisioned Heavenly King Virupaksa bowing to him in greeting and saying Where are you going Great Sage There's something I must see the Jade Emperor about said Monkey
What are you doing here It is my turn today to supervise the Southern Gate of Heaven Virupaksa replied and before he could finish the four marshals Ma Zhao Wen and Guan bowed and said Great Sage we failed to greet you
Will you have some tea I'm busy Monkey replied and taking his leave of Virupaksa and the four marshals he went in through the gate and headed straight for the Hall of Miraculous Mist where the four Heavenly Teachers Zhang Daoling Ge Xianweng Xu Jingyang and Qiu Hongji the Six Officers of the Southern Dipper and the Seven Originals of the Northern Dipper all raised their hands in greeting to him in front of the palace hall For what purpose are you here Great Sage they asked adding
Have you yet finished escorting the Tang Priest It's too early to be talking like that yet Monkey replied
It is a very long journey with many a demon along the way and we've only completed half of it
At present we are in trouble at the Jindou Gave in Mount Jindou where a rhinoceros spirit has grabbed my master and taken him into the cave
When I went there and fought him he had such tremendous magic powers that he seized my goldbanded cudgel It's impossible for me to capture him
That's why I've come to accuse the Jade Emperor of lax supervision You're as wild and wicked as ever you ape said Xu Jingyang with a smile
Journey to the West No I'm not Monkey replied
I've spoken bluntly all my life as it's the only way to get anywhere That's enough of this talking said Heavenly Teacher Zhang Daoling
We will report your arrival Thank you very much Monkey replied
The four Heavenly Teachers reported all this to the Hall of Miraculous Mist and then took Monkey to the jade steps to the throne
Monkey make a loud reeer of respect then said Well old man I'm here to bother you
I won't bore you with all the dangers of escorting the Tang Priest to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven but we've now reached the Jindou Cave on Mount Jindou where a rhinoceros demon has captured the Tang Priest and taken him to his cave
I don't know whether the demon's planning to steam boil or dry him
When I went to the cave and fought him he knew who I was and he really does have miraculous powers He's taken my goldbanded cudgel so I can't capture him
I think he must be an evil star from Heaven gone down to earth for the love of worldly things which is why I've come here to submit a request
I beg Your Celestial Majesty in your mercy and perception to order an inspection of the evil stars and to send troops to capture the demon
I'm shaking with fear of Your Majesty He then made a deep bow and added I beg to submit this report Ge Xianweng who was standing at the side of the hall smiled as he said Why is it that you were recalcitrant before but are respectful now It's not that said Monkey not that at all I haven't become respectful
It's just that I don't have my cudgel today Having heard Monkey's memorial the Jade Emperor sent an order straight to the star officer Kehan Please inspect all the stars in all the heavens and find out if any of the divine kings of any of the constellations have gone down to earth out of love for worldly things
Report back afterwards Having been given this command the True Lord Kehan went off with the Great Sage to make his inspection
First they went to see the divine kings and the officials at the four gates of Heaven
Then they inspected all the True Ones within the Three Little Enclosures the Thunder Officers Tao Zhang Xin Deng Gou Bi Pang and Liu and the Thirtythree Heavens every one of which was in place
Next they checked the twentyeight zodiacal constellations Horn Gullet Base Chamber Orion Tail and Winnower in the East Dipper Ox Woman Barrens Roof House and Wall to the West and the constellations of the North and South as well but every constellation was peacefully in its place
They inspected the Seven Powers of Sun Moon Water Fire Wood Metal and Earth and the Four OthersRahu Ketu the Gases and the Comets
None of the stars in the sky had gone down to earth for love of worldly things
In that case said Monkey my journey to the Hall of Miraculous Mist was for nothing
I've disturbed His Jade Majestyit was most inconvenient of me You had better go and report back
I'll be waiting here for your reply The True Lord Kehan did as he had been told and Monkey began a long wait He made up a poem to record his feelings that went Pure winds a cloudless sky and blissful peace Calm gods bright shining stars and blessings clear Still is the Milky Way Heaven's troubles cease Throughout the world no sounds of war we hear
Journey to the West The True Lord Kehan reported back to the Jade Emperor on his thorough inspection No star or constellation in the sky is missing All the regional gods ad officers are present and nobody has gone down to earth for love of worldly things Having heard this report the Jade Emperor ordered that Sun Wukong was to select some heavenly generals to take down to earth to catch the demon
When the four Heavenly Teachers had been given this order they left the Hall of Miraculous Mist and said to Monkey Great Sage the Jade Emperor in his generosity orders you to select some heavenly generals to take down to earth to catch the demon as none of the stars has gone down there for love of worldly things Monkey bowed down and thought Most of the heavenly generals are not as good as I am
few are any better When I made havoc in Heaven the Jade Emperor sent a hundred thousand of his heavenly soldiers who spread out heavenandearth nets but not one of those commanders dared to fight it out with me
The only one who was a match for me was the Little Sage Erlang he sent later
That demon's powers are as good as mine so how will I ever be able to beat him Times have changed said the Heavenly Teacher Xu Jingyang
As the saying goes everything can always be beaten by something
Would you dare to disobey an imperial edict
Choose some heavenly generals according to your illustrious judgement and don't waste time it could be disastrous
In that case said Monkey I am very grateful to His Majesty for his kindness and I would not dare disobey his commands
Besides I don't want to have made this journey for nothing
So please ask the Jade Emperor to send Heavenly King Li the Pagodacarrier and Prince Nezha They have demonsubduing weapons so let's see what happens if they go down to earth and fight that fiend
If they can catch him I'll be in luck and if they can't we'll have to think again The Heavenly Teacher reported this to the Jade Emperor who ordered Heavenly King Li and his son Prince Nezha to take their heavenly troops to Help Monkey
The Heavenly King obediently went to see Monkey who said to the Heavenly Teacher I am extremely grateful to the Jade Emperor for sending the Heavenly King
There is another request I would like you to pass on I would like two thunder gods to stand in the clouds while the Heavenly King is fighting the demon and kill him by throwing thunder splinters at his head
This would be a very good method Splendid splendid said the Heavenly Teacher and he reported this request to the Jade Emperor who then ordered the Office of the Nine Heavens to send the thunder gods Deng Hua and Zhang Fan to help Heavenly King Li capture the demon
They then went out through the Southern Gate of Heaven with the Heavenly King and the Great Sage
They were soon there
This is Mount Jindou said Monkey and the Jindou Cave is in it
I would like you gentlemen to decide which of you is going to be the first to challenge the demon to battle The Heavenly King brought his cloud to a stop and encamped his troops under the Southern slopes of the mountain As you know Great Sage he said my boy Nezha has put down the demons in ninetysix different caves is very good at transformation and always carries his demonsubduing weapons around with him He should go into battle first That's right said Monkey
I'll take him with me The prince summoned up his martial prowess leapt to the mountaintop with the Great Sage and went straight to the entrance to the cave where they found the doors tightly closed and not an evil spirit to be seen by the Journey to the West rockface
Vicious fiend shouted Monkey going up to the doors open up at once and give me back my master When the little devils guarding the doors saw this they hurried back to report Your Majesty Sun the Novice has a little boy with him and he's challenging you to battle outside the doors I've got his goldbanded cudgel the demon king said and he'd find it hard to fight me emptyhanded so I suppose he must have found some reinforcements
Fetch my weapons He then went outside to look brandishing his spear The little boy was a pure and remarkable sight and full of strength and vigor
Indeed His face was like the moon when it is full Red lips a squarecut mouth and silver teeth
His eye shot lightning from their fearsome pupils Over his broad and finehued brow were tufts of hair
His sash danced in the wind like tongues of flame A silken gown gleamed golden in the sun
Bright rings held a bronze mirror at his chest And precious armor set off well his warrior's boots
Tiny in body but mighty in his voice Terrible Nezha protector of the faith
You're Heavenly King Li's third son Prince Nezha said the demon with a smile
Why have you come shouting at my door Because you have made trouble vicious fiend by harming the holy monk from the East
I'm here to arrest you at the command of the Jade Emperor I'm sure Sun Wukong must have asked you here said the demon king in a great fury
Yes I'm the demon who's got the holy monk
I wonder what fighting skills you've got little boy if you dare to talk such nonsense
Stay where you are and see how you like my spear The prince met the thrust at once with his demonbeheading sword
Once the two of them had come to blows the battle began Monkey rushed round the mountain shouting Where are the thunder gods
Hurry up and strike the fiend with your thunder splinters to help the prince subdue him The thunder gods Deng and Zhang stepped at once on their clouds and were just about to strike when Prince Nezha used magic to give himself three heads and six arms that wielded six weapons with which he hacked at the monster
The demon king then gave himself three heads and six arms too holding three long spears with Journey to the West which he parried them
The prince next used his demonsubduing dharma power and threw his six weapons up into the air
What were the six weapons
The demonbeheading sword the demonhacking cutlass the demonbinding rope the demonquelling pestle the embroidered ball and the firewheel
Nezha shouted Change and each one of them became ten each ten a hundred each hundred a thousand and each thousand ten thousand of the same weapons that flew at the demon like a hailstorm
The demon king was not afraid in the least Bringing out his gleaming white ring he threw it into the air with a shout of Catch them and as it came whistling down it trapped all the six different kinds of weapons so terrifying Nezha that he fled for his life emptyhanded
The demon king returned to his cave in triumph
When the two thunder gods saw this from up in the sky they smiled to themselves and said It's a good thing we realized how things were going and didn't throw our thunder splinters
If he'd caught them too we'd never have dared report back to the Heavenly Honoured Ones The pair of them landed their clouds and went with the prince to the Southern slope of the mountain The demon king really has got enormous powers they told Heavenly King Li
The wretched demon's magic powers are nothing much said Monkey with a laugh apart from that terrible ring
I wonder what sort of treasure it is and why it can catch everything when it's thrown into the air You don't have a shred of humanity in you Great Sage said Nezha angrily
We're thoroughly upset after being beaten and all for your sake too What have you got to laugh about You may be upset but what makes you imagine I'm not Monkey replied
I'm at my wit's end and as I can't cry about it laughing's the only thing I can do How are we going to bring all this to an end the Heavenly King asked
You lot can make whatever plans you like said Monkey but we can only capture him with what his ring can't catch The best things his ring can't catch are water and fire said Heavenly King Li
As the saying goes water and fire show no mercy You're right Monkey replied
Sit still here while I go up to Heaven again What for the two thunder gods asked
This time I won't bother with a memorial to the Jade Emperor said Brother Monkey I'll go straight in through the Southern Gate of Heaven to the Palace of Crimson Splendor to ask Yinghuo the Star Lord of Fire to come here and start a fire that will burn the demon and perhaps even reduce his ring to ashes so that we can capture him
Then you can have your weapons back and return to Heaven and my master can be saved The prince was greatly cheered up to hear this
Please don't lose any time Great Sage he said and get back as soon as you can
We'll wait here Monkey set his auspicious light going again and went straight back to the Southern Gate of Heaven where Virupaksa and the four generals met him and asked Why are you back again Great Sage Journey to the West Heavenly King Li sent Prince Nezha into battle Monkey replied but in their first fight the demon king took all his six weapons
I now want to go to the Palace of Crimson Splendor to ask the Star Lord of Fire to help us in the fight The four generals let him in not daring to delay him any longer
When he reached the Palace of Crimson Splendor the gods of fire all went in to report Sun Wukong is here to see you my lord The Star Lord of Fire of the South straightened up his clothes and came out to greet him with the words Kehan was here to inspect us yesterday and nobody here is longing for earthly things I know Monkey replied
Heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha have been defeated in battle and lost their weapons which is why I have come here to ask for your help Nezha is the God of the Third Altar the Seas who first made his name by subduing ninetysix caves of demons the Star Lord of Fire replied
His magical powers are tremendous so if he can't subdue the fiend what hope would I have of doing so I've discussed it with Heavenly King Li Monkey replied Water and fire are the most powerful things in heaven and earth
That fiend has a ring that can catch things I don't know what treasure it is As they say that fire can destroy everything I've come here to ask you Star Lord to lead your fire forces down to the mortal world to burn up that evil monster and rescue my master When the Star Lord of Fire heard this he mustered his divine troops and went with Monkey to the Southern slopes of Mount Jindou where he exchanged greetings with the Heavenly King and the thunder gods
Great Sage Sun said Heavenly King Li call that demon out again and I'll start fighting him When he throws his ring I'll get out of the way and the Star Lord can lead his forces to burn him up Yes said Monkey
I'll go with you The Fire Star Lord stood with Prince Nezha and two thunder gods on a high peak to challenge the demon to battle
When the Great Sage reached the mouth of the Jindou Cave he shouted Open up
Give me my master back at once Sun Wukong's back the little devils reported with urgency and the demon led his horde out of the cave to say to Monkey Impudent ape what soldiers have you brought here Heavenly King Li the Pagodacarrier came forward to shout back Vicious monster do you know who I am Heavenly King Li replied the demon with a laugh no doubt you want to avenge your distinguished son and get his weapons back I want my revenge and his weapons replied the Heavenly King and I'm also going to catch you and rescue the Tang Priest
Stay where you are while I get you with my sword The demon dodged the cut and thrust back with his spear
The two of them fought a magnificent fight in front of the cave
Just watch The Heavenly King hacked with his sword The demon's spear parried
Journey to the West The sword gleamed cold and breathed out fire The sharp spear belched out baleful clouds
One was the monster who had grown up in Jindou Cave The other had been sent from the Hall of Miraculous Mist
One wished to use his might to oppress the dharma nature One was employing his greatness to rescue the priest
The Heavenly King's powers made sand and gravel fly The demon fighting back stirred up the dust
The dust cast heaven and earth in darkness The sand and gravel made seas and livers turbid
The two of them struggled hard for victory Because the Tang Priest wanted to see the Buddha
When Monkey saw the two of them starting to fight he jumped up to the highest peak and said to the Star Lord of Fire Pay attention Watch as the demon produces his ring again when the fight is at its fiercest
When Heavenly King Li saw this he set his auspicious light moving and fled in defeat
At once the Star Lord of Fire issued the order to his troops from his peak to release all their fire together It was a terrifying sight
The Classic says that in the South is the essence of fire
Even a single spark Can burn a hundred thousand acres
The might of the Star Lord Could create a hundred different kinds of fire
He had fire spears fire swords Fire bows and crossbows And all his gods used different weapons
The sky was filled with cawing crows of fire Journey to the West Fire horses galloped on the mountaintops
Fire rats came in twos Fire dragons in pairs
The fire rats coming in twos breathed flame Making a thousand miles glow red The pairs of fire dragons belched thick smoke Casting a pall of darkness all around
The fire carts were brought out The fire gourds opened up
When fire banners waved the skies glowed sunsetred Fire cudgels made the whole earth blaze
Compared with this the charge of burning oxen was nothing This beat Zhou Yu's fire ships attacking Red Crag
It was a terrible heavenly conflagration A blazing burning storm of fire
But the onslaught by the fire did not frighten the demon in the least
He threw his ring up into the air and as it came whistling down it caught the fire dragons fire horses fire crows fire rats fire swords fire spears fire bows and fire arrows The demon then led his troops back to his cave in victory
The Fire Star Lord holding a useless banner called back his officers and went to sit with Heavenly King Li and the others on the Southern slope of the mountain Great Sage he said to Monkey I've never seen so ferocious a demon before
Now I've lost all my fireraising equipment what am I to do Stop complaining said Monkey with a smile
Will you gentlemen please sit here for a while while I go off again Where are you going this time Heavenly King Li asked
If that fiend isn't bothered by fire I'm sure he must be vulnerable to water
As the saying goes water defeats fire
I'm going to the Northern Gate of Heaven to ask the Star Lord of Water the planet Mercury to use the power of water to flood the cave and drown the demon king
Then I'll be able to return you all your things That's a very good idea said the Heavenly King except that I'm afraid your master might be drowned too Journey to the West No problem said Monkey
Even if he is drowned I have a way that will bring him back to life
But I'm wasting your time gentlemen and that is quite wrong In that case said the Star Lord of Fire please be on your way The splendid Great Sage went straight to the Northern Gate of Heaven by his somersault cloud
He looked up to see the Heavenly King Vaisravana bowing to him and asking Where are you going Great Sage Sun There is something about which I must see the Star Lord of Water in his Palace of Dark Vastness said Monkey
What are you doing here It is my turn to patrol today Vaisravana replied
As he was speaking the four heavenly generals Pang Liu Gou and Bi greeted him courteously and offered him tea
As I'm in such a hurry I won't trouble you said Monkey and taking his leave of them he went straight to the Palace of Dark Vastness where he sent all the gods of Water in to announce him
Sun Wukong the Great Sage Equaling Heaven is here they reported
As soon as he learned this the Star Lord of Water dismissed the gods of the Four Seas the Five Lakes the Eight Rivers the Four Streams the Three Great Watercourses and the Nine Tributaries as well as all the dragon kings then straightened his hat tightened his belt and went out through the gates of the palace to greet him and lead him inside Yesterday Kehan came here on his inspection the Star Lord said He wondered if any of my Water gods had become demons because they longed for worldly things
We are checking all the gods of rivers seas and streams but have not yet finished That demon king's no river god said Monkey He's a much more powerful spirit
The Jade Emperor sent Heavenly King Li Prince Nezha and two thunder gods down to the lower world to capture him but he caught Nezha's six magic weapons with a ring
So I had to go up to the Palace of Crimson Splendor to ask the Star Lord of Fire to take all his fire gods to start fires but the fiend caught the fire dragons fire horses and everything else with his ring
I reckon that as he isn't bothered by fire he must be vulnerable to water which is why I've come here to ask you to deploy your water capture the fiend for me return the heavenly generals' weapons and rescue my master too When the Star Lord of Water heard this he ordered the Earl of the Yellow River to go with the Great Sage to help him
I can carry water in this said the river earl taking a white jade bowl from his sleeve
But that can't hold very much said Monkey
How could it possibly drown the fiend I'm not lying when I tell you that this bowl can hold the waters of the Yellow River the earl replied
Half a bowlful is half the river and the whole bowlful is the whole river Half a bowlful will be all we need replied a delighted Monkey who then took his leave of the Star God of Water and hurried out through the gates of Heaven with the Earl of the Yellow River
The earl half filled his bowl in the Yellow River then went with the Great Sage to Mount Jindou where he greeted the Heavenly King the prince the two thunder gods and the Star Lord of Fire who started telling him what had happened until Monkey said Cut out the details
River earl come with me
When I shout at the doors telling them to open up don't wait till the doors are open Tip the water straight in and drown the whole Journey to the West den of demons
Then I'll fish out the master's body and bring him back to life The earl did as he was told following Monkey round the mountain to the mouth of the cave
Open up devils Monkey shouted and when they recognized his voice the little devils hurried in to report that he was back At this the demon king went out again brandishing his spear and taking his treasure as the doors opened with a loud noise
The river god threw all the water in his white jade bowl into the cave
Seeing it coming the demon threw down his spear and quickly took out his ring to seal the inner doors tightly
The water then all surged noisily out again giving Sun Wukong such a fright that he had to give an immediate somersault and leap straight back up to the mountaintop with the river god
The Heavenly King and the rest of them then stood on their clouds in front of the peak looking at the great waves of the mighty flood It was splendid water
Indeed
A mere scoopful Produces fathomless depths A divine achievement Fills a hundred rivers for the general good
Hear the great roaring shake the valley See the mighty waters flood the sky
A sound like thunder fills the world with awe Fierce are the waves with curling crests like snow
The towering waves now inundate the roads While countless billows wash against the mountains
Cold they are as nephrite Rolling with the sound of strings
As they crash against the rocks they scatter chips of jade The waters swirl in eddies as they ebb
The current sweeps across all dips and hollows Filling ravines and joining all the streams The sight filled Brother Monkey with alarm This is terrible he said
The water's flooding the peasants' fields and going everywhere except into the demon's cave
What are we to do He asked the river god to put Journey to the West his water away at once I can only let it out the earl replied I can't put it away again
As the saying goes spilt water can't be picked up Oh dear
But as the mountain was both high and steep the water flowed down it fast and in a few moments had all gone away along gullies and ravines
Some little devils leapt out from the cave and played around with great pleasure as before shouting yelling shaking their fists waving their sleeves and brandishing their cudgels and spears
So the water never got inside the cave at all said the Heavenly King
All that effort was for nothing Unable to control the great anger that surged up him Monkey charged the demon king's doors lashing out with both fists shouting Where do you think you're going
I'll get you The terrified little devils dropped their spears and cudgels and fled back into the cave to report in fear and trembling Your Majesty he's attacking again The demon king went out through the doors his spear at the ready and said Impudent ape you're such a hooligan
You've tried and failed to beat me several times Even fire and water have got nowhere near me So why are you here again
To throw your life away You've got it the wrong way round my boy said Brother Monkey
It's not me throwing my life away but you throwing yours away
Come here and I'll punch you one You're just trying to be awkward ape the demon king replied with a laugh
You can use your fists but I'll use my spear
Your skinny little fist is no bigger than a walnut It's not even the weight of a small hammer Very well then
I'll put my spear down and we'll try some boxing Well spoken said Monkey with a smile
Come on then The demon then hitched up his clothes and took up a stance with both of his fists raised They were the size of the mallets used in oilpresses
The Great Sage spread his feet apart summoned up his energy and started to show his skill as he traded blows with the demon king in front of the doors of the cave it was a splendid fight Goodness
They started with a foursquare stance Kicked with pairs of flying feet
Each threw with menace at the other's chest Hard blows that could cut out the heart
The Immortal pointing the way Lao Zi riding his crane Terrible as the tiger when he falls on his prey Vicious as the dragons sporting in the water
Journey to the West The demon king did a dragon roll The Great Sage fought like a roebuck with his antlers
They kicked up their heels like spitting dragons Twisting their wrists like skysupporting camels
The blue lion opened its jaws The carp leapt so high he risked breaking his back
Flowers were scattered around their foreheads And ropes pulled tight around their waists
The wind stayed close to the fan The driving rain made blossoms fall
When the demon used a Guanyin hand Monkey countered with an arhat's foot The longer punches were open and relaxed Not as intense as the short jabs to the body
When they had fought for several dozen rounds Their skills were equal no winner had emerged
While the two of them fought in front of the cave Heavenly King Li and the Star Lord of Fire were shouting and clapping in encouragement and admiration
The two thunder gods and Prince Nezha led the armies of the gods to leap down by where they were fighting to help Monkey while on the other side the devilish horde all came forward to guard their master with banners drums swords and cutlasses
Seeing that things were going badly Monkey pulled out a handful of hairs scattered them in the air and with a shout of Change turned them into three or four dozen little monkeys who rushed forward and held the demon still They put their arms round his legs grabbed him by the waist jabbed at his eyes and pulled his hair
The demon in his alarm pulled out his ring
When Monkey arid the Heavenly King saw him doing this they turned their clouds away and fled back to the top of the mountain to keep out of the way of the fight
As soon as the demon threw the ring into the air it came whistling down caught the three or four dozen little monkeys who were hairs transformed and turned them back into their original form The demon took them into the cave when he led his troops back in triumph shut the doors and celebrated
Great Sage said Prince Nezha you really are a tough guy
That was a superb display of boxing as skilful as putting embroidery on brocade
And by magically dividing yourself up you showed him how good you are Journey to the West You gentlemen were all watching from here said Monkey with a smile
How did the demon's technique compare with mine His boxing was slack and his footwork slow said Heavenly King Li where you were neat and quick
When he saw us going he was worried and when you used your selfdividing magic he was panicked which was why he had to use his ring magic The demon king would be easy enough to deal with said Monkey if it weren't for his ring
That's hard one to beat If we're to beat him said the Star Lord of Fire to the Earl of the Yellow River we have to get that treasure
We'll be able to capture him then But how else are we to get it apart from by stealing it Monkey asked
The two thunder gods laughed at this and said If we're going to do him the honour of stealing it there's nobody to compare with the Great Sage
When he made havoc in Heaven he stole imperial wine magic peaches dragon liver phoenix bonemarrow and even Lord Lao Zi's elixir That was some skill
Now he ought to be using it to get that ring You are flattering me said Monkey you are flattering me
You'd better sit here while I go and spy things out The splendid Great Sage sprang down from the peak and made his way stealthily to the mouth of the cave where he shook himself and turned into a most elegant fly
Look at him He had wings just as fine as membranes of bamboo A body as small as a plum blossom's heart His hands and his feet barely thicker than hairs And eyes full of lights that both sparkle and dart
He follows his nose when he smells something good And rides on the wind as he flies at great speed
The scales would not move if he come to be weighed And yet he's a lovable true friend in need
He flew quietly to the doors and crawled in through the narrow gap between them to see all the devils young and old dancing or singing in ranks on either side while the demon king sat on a high dais Before him were set snakemeat deer jerky bears' paws camels' humps wild vegetables from the mountain and fruit
He had a celadon jug of wine as well as some delicioussmelling koumiss and coconut toddy all of which he was drinking freely by the large bowlful
Monkey landed among the little devils and turned himself into a badger Journey to the West spirit
He inched his way nearer to the throne but even after taking a long look he could not make out at all where the treasure was hidden
He quickly withdrew and went round behind the throne where he saw hanging high from the ceiling in the rear hall the fire dragons groaning and the fire horses whinnying
He looked up to spy his goldbanded cudgel leaning against the Eastern wall This made him so happy that his heart had an itch he could not scratch and forgetting his disguise he went over picked the cudgel up resumed his own appearance tried out some movements with it and started to fight his way straight out of the cave
All the devils shook with terror and there was nothing the demon king could do about it as Monkey opened up a trail of blood pushing three over here and pulling a couple down there as he went straight out through the front doors
Indeed The demon was unready in his pride The cudgel went back to its owner's side
If you don't know whether all turned out for good or for ill listen to the explanation in the next installment
Monkey Makes Havoc in the Jindou Cave The Buddha Gives a Hint About the Owner The story tells how after recovering his goldbanded cudgel Monkey fought his way out of the cave and jumped up to the peak to see all the gods He was very pleased with himself
How did it go this time asked Heavenly King Li
I did a transformation and went into the cave said Monkey where I saw the devils dancing singing and drinking to celebrate their victory
But I heard nothing about where the demon keeps his treasure
When I went round to the back I heard the horses and dragons whimpering and realized they must be the fire beasts
My goldbanded cudgel was leaning against the Eastern wall so I took it and fought my way out of the cave You have your treasure now said the gods but how are we going to get ours back Easy said Monkey easy
With this iron cudgel I can beat him whatever he does
I'll recover your treasures As they were talking there rose from the mountainside a concerted sound of gongs and drums as well as earthshaking shouts
the Great Rhinoceros King was leading his host of spirits out in pursuit of Monkey who called out at the sight of them Great great Just what I want
Please sit down gentlemen while I go to capture him The splendid Great Sage raised his iron cudgel and struck at the demon's face with a shout Where do you think you're going damned demon
Take this Warding the blow off with his spear the demon insulted him back Thieving ape
You're a disgrace
How dare you steal my property in broad daylight I'll get you evil beast Have the decency to die
All you can do is use your ring to steal our property in broad daylight None of those things are really yours
Stay where you are and take this Once again the monster parried with his spear
It was a splendid fight Journey to the West The Great Sage was ferocious The demon was not gentle
Both sides fought with courage Neither would give in
The iron cudgel was a dragon's tail The long spear was a serpent's head
Blows from the cudgel whistled like the wind The spear's moves flowed as smoothly as a stream
The mountain darkened wreathed in coloured mists Auspicious clouds hung heavy on the woods
The birds in the air all stopped their flying The wild beasts of the field all hid away
The demons on one side raised battle cries While Monkey on the other was Ml of vigor
An iron club that no one could withstand Had fought its way along the long road West A long spear that was a worthy match And always held its power supreme on Mount Jindou
Once they joined battle there could be no respite They swore to carry on until one conquered
The demon king and the Great Sage had been fighting for six hours without either gaining the upper hand
As night was falling the evil spirit held out his spear and said Stop Wukong
It's too dark for fighting now Let's have a night's sleep and I'll go on having it out with you tomorrow Shut up damned demon replied Monkey abusively I've only just warmed up I don't care how late it is
I'm going to carry on till one of us has won The demon gave a shout made a feint with his spear and fled for his life leading his host of devils in retreat back to the cave where they shut the doors tight
Journey to the West When Monkey returned to the mountain top with his cudgel the gods from Heaven all congratulated him You really are strong and capable Great Sage Equaling Heaven they said and your powers are boundless You're overdoing your praises Monkey replied
No said Heavenly King Li coming up to him this is not empty praise You really are a tough guy
The force you were up against today was as strong as the Heaven and Earth nets all those years age Let's not go into all that ancient history said Monkey
That demon must be exhausted after his fight with me
I haven't been put to any trouble worth speaking of so if you'll all sit here and relax I'll go back into the cave find out where he keeps the ring and steal it if I possibly can Then I'll capture the monster find your weapons and return them to you to take back to Heaven It's late now said Prince Nezha
You'd better have a good night's sleep and go tomorrow morning You don't understand life my lad replied Monkey
Who ever heard of a burglar liking to steal in broad daylight
This sort of groping about has to be done in secret under cover of darkness
That's the way the job's done Stop arguing Your Highness said the Star Lord of Fire and the two thunder gods We don't know anything about that sort of thing and the Great Sage is an old hand
Let him make the most of the nighttime when the demon is exhausted and nobody is expecting anything to happen
Please go at once With a chuckle the splendid Great Sage tucked his iron cudgel away jumped down from the peak and went to the mouth of the cave where he shook himself and turned into a cricket
Indeed Hard mouth black skin and long antennae Bright eyes and legs that bend like branches
In the clear wind and in moonlight he sings by the wall When the night is still he talks like a human
As he weeps in the dew the scenery seems cold His marvellous voice now comes in fits and starts
Just when the homesick traveler least wishes to hear him He finds him lurking underneath the bed With a few bounds of his mighty legs Monkey was at the doors
Squeezing through the narrow gap between them he squatted at the foot of the wall looking carefully at where the light was coming from
He saw all the Journey to the West big and little devils devouring their food like wolves or tigers Monkey chirped for a while and a little later the banquet was cleared away and the devils all went to bed
About two hours later when Monkey had just reached the room at the back he heard the demon king ordering Little ones on the doors stay awake
Sun Wukong may change himself into something and sneak in here to steal Those who were on watch duty that night were neatly turned out and sounding their clappers and bells
This made it even easier for the Great Sage to go about his business
Creeping into the monster's bedroom he saw a stone bed on either side of which stood powdered and painted mountain and tree spirits They were spreading out the bedding and waiting on the old demon taking off his boots and clothes
When the old demon was undressed Monkey could see the ring gleaming white on his left arm It looked like a bracelet made from a string of pearls
Instead of taking it off the demon pushed it up his arm a couple of times to jam it more firmly into place before going to sleep
Seeing this Monkey changed himself again this time into a brownskinned flea that jumped up on the bed burrowed into the bedding climbed on the monster's arm and bit him so hard that he sat up with a yell of Bloody slaves you need some more flogging
You didn't shake out the quilt or dust the bed and I've just been bitten He rubbed the ring twice more and went back to sleep
Monkey climbed on the ring and bit him again so that the monster sat up again unable to sleep I'm itching to death he complained
Seeing that the security was so strict and that the demon kept the treasure on himself and was not going to take it off Monkey realized that he would be unable to steal it
So he jumped down from the bed turned himself back into a cricket left the bedroom and went straight to the back where he heard the groans and whimpers of the dragons and horses again but now from behind tightly shut doors Monkey turned back to his own form and went up to the doors to open the lock by magic He said a spell and rubbed the lock making its tongues both click open
He then pushed the doors open and rushed inside where it was as bright as day in the light from all the fire instruments and creatures
He noticed some weapons leaning against the walls on either side Prince Nezha's demonhacking cutlass and other arms as well as the fire bows arrows and the rest of the Star Lord of Fire's gear
Looking all around by the light of the fires he noticed to his delight a handful of hairs lying in a bamboo basket on a stone table behind the doors
Monkey picked them up blew on them twice with warm breath shouted Change and turned them into three or four dozen little monkeys
He told them to take the cutlass sword pestle rope ball wheel bow arrows spear carts gourd fire crows fire rats fire horses and everything else that had been caught in the ring then he mounted the fire dragon and started a blaze burning from the inside outwards
There was a great roaring and loud cracks that sounded like thunder and cannons
All the big and little demons were thrown into such panic and confusion that they wrapped themselves in their quilts covered their heads shouted and wept As they had nowhere to flee most of them were burnt to death
When the Handsome Monkey King returned in victory it was about midnight
When Heavenly King Li and the other gods spotted the dazzling fire from the mountaintop they rushed forward to see Brother Monkey riding the dragon and driving the little monkeys straight up to the peak
Come and get your weapons he shouted come and get your weapons The Star Lord of Fire and Nezha shouted greetings whereupon Monkey shook himself and put all the hairs back on his body
Nezha recovered his six weapons and the Star Lord told his subordinates to collect the fire dragon and the rest of the fire creatures and implements They were all laughing with pleasure as they congratulated Monkey
The blaze in the Jindou Cave gave the Great Rhinoceros King such a fright that his souls left his body He sat up at once threw open the doors of his bedroom and held the ring out in both hands to the East and the West to put out the fire Then he ran all around holding out his treasure which extinguished all the flames and smoke that filled the air and tried to rescue his demons most of whom were dead
He could only muster a hundred or so male and female and when he looked at where the weapons were kept he found them all gone
Going round to the back he saw Pig Friar Sand and the Tang Priest still tied up there the white horse still Journey to the West tethered to the trough and the luggage still in the room
I wonder which careless little devil started that fire he said angrily
Look what it has done Your Majesty said his attendants the fire was nothing to do with anyone in our household
It was probably a burglar who let all the fire creatures go and stole the magic weapons Only then did the demon realize what had happened
I'm certain it was Sun Wukong he said It can't have been anyone else
No wonder I couldn't get to sleep
The thieving monkey must have turned himself into something to get in here and bite my arm twice
He must have been trying to steal my treasure but failed because I was wearing it too tightly So he stole the weapons and released the fire dragon What a vicious idea he was trying to burn me to death
Evil monkey Your cleverness will get you nowhere
you don't know my powers yet
As long as I have this treasure I can go into the ocean without drowning and into fire without being burnt
If I catch that bandit I'll chop him up into little bits and burn him as a torch
That's the only way I'll feel better about it After he had been talking to himself in his misery for a long time he did not notice the cocks crowing for the dawn
Up on the mountaintop Prince Nezha who now had his six weapons back said to Monkey Great Sage it's light now and we must lose no time We should fight the demon while his morale is still low We'll support you with all the fire forces while you take him on and this time I think you'll be able to capture him You're right said Monkey We'll all pull together
Let's have some fun Every one of them braced himself and displayed his martial prowess as they headed for the mouth of the cave
Come out damned demon shouted Monkey and fight with me The two stone doors had been reduced to ashes by the blaze and the little devils inside were sweeping up and picking over the cinders
The approach of all the gods made them drop their brooms and their ash forks in panic as they rushed back inside to report Sun Wukong is here with a host of gods from Heaven demanding battle again The news caused the rhinoceros monster great alarm
He noisily ground his teeth of steel his eyes bulged with fury and he went out holding his spear and his treasure pouring out insults
I'll get you you thieving arsonist of an ape
What sort of powers do you have that give you the right to treat me with such contempt Damned devil retorted Monkey with a smile on his face if you want to know my powers I'll tell you
Since I was little my powers have been great My fame has spread in heaven and in earth
As a bright young thing I learned to be immortal Acquiring the traditions of eternal youth
I determined to visit the land of the heart And reverently went to the country of the sages
I learned the magic of infinite changes And roamed at will through cosmic space
Journey to the West My hobby was subduing the tigers on the hills When bored I forced the ocean dragons to submit
I was monarch of the Mountain of Flowers and of Fruit And showed off my power in the Water Curtain Cave
Often I decided to go up to Heaven And in my folly I occupied the place above
I was called the Great Sage Equaling Heaven And given the title of Handsome Monkey King
When they held a banquet of their magic peaches I was most angry at not being invited
Secretly I went to steal jade liquor Drinking this rare wine in their elegant pavilions
Liver of dragons the marrow of the phoenix And many other delicacies did I steal that day
I ate my fill of those immortal peaches And packed my stomach with pills of eternal life
I then purloined all kinds of Heavenly marvel And tucked away the treasures of that palace
Because the Jade Emperor had learned of my powers Heavenly soldiers were sent into battle The Nine Bright Shiners I sent on their way I wounded all five of the evil constellations
The generals of Heaven were no match for me A hundred thousand soldiers all lost their nerve
The Jade Emperor then was forced to summon The Little Sage Erlang to join in the fight
Journey to the West We both went through our seventytwo changes Each of us showing his spirit and strength
The Bodhisattva Guanyin came to their aid With her vase of pure water and her sprig of willow And Lao Zi used his Diamond Jade To take me a prisoner back up to Heaven
They led me in chains to the Jade Monarch's palace Where legal officials determined my fate
Strong soldiers were ordered to cut off my head But the hacks at my scalp only made sparks fly When they tried all their tricks but nothing killed me I then was escorted to the palace of Lao Zi
The Six Dings refined me with the fire of their furnace And made my whole body as hard as steel
After seven times seven days the furnace was opened And out I jumped more terrible than ever
The gods all shut their gates unable to resist And the sages decided to ask the Buddha's help
Great was the power of the Buddha's dharma Indeed his wisdom is infinitely mighty
I wagered with a somersault to jump out of his hand But he crushed me with a mountain that rendered me powerless
Then the Jade Emperor celebrated peace And the West was proclaimed to be a land of bliss
I was crushed by the mountain for five hundred years Never tasting a mouthful of tea or of food
Journey to the West When the Golden Cicada came down to earth He was sent from the East to visit the Buddha
He wants to bring the scriptures back to China So the Tang ruler could save his ancestors' souls
Guanyin converted me to the side of goodness To hold to the teachings and keep myself in check
Since I was released from the agonizing mountain I have been heading West to fetch the true scriptures Do not try to use your evil cunning devil
Return to me my master to worship the Buddha When he had heard all this the demon pointed at Monkey and replied So you're the thief who robbed Heaven
Stay where you are and take this The Great Sage parried the spear whit his cudgel and just as the two of them were starting to fight again Nezha and the Star Lord of Fire lost their tempers and flung all their magic weapons and fireraising equipment at the demon king
Monkey was more ferocious than ever while the thunder gods with their thunder splinters and the Heavenly King with his sword rushed into the fray together not worrying about rank and seniority
The demon king gave a mocking and majestic laugh discreetly brought the ring out of his sleeve and threw it into the air with a shout of Catch them It came whistling down catching the six magic weapons all the fireraising equipment and creatures the thunder gods' thunderbolt the Heavenly King's sword and Monkey's cudgel
Once again the gods were all emptyhanded and the Great Sage Sun disarmed
The triumphant demon turned round to say Little ones fetch rocks to make new doors and start digging and building to refurbish all the rooms inside
When that's done I'll slaughter the Tang Priest and his disciples as a thanksgiving to the local god and you'll all have a share The little demons all set to as they had been instructed
When Heavenly King Li led his troops back up the mountain the Star Lord of Fire was grumbling about Nezha's impatience and the thunder gods were angry with the Heavenly King for behaving badly The only person keeping quiet was the Earl of the Yellow River
Seeing how they were all unwilling to look each other in the face and were worried desperate resentful and trying to make himself look cheerful Brother Monkey said to them with a smile Don't be upset
Victory and defeat are all part of the soldier's routine
The demon's only soso in fighting skill
The only thing that makes him so dangerous is that ring which has caught all our weapons again Don't worry
I'll go and make some more inquiries about who and what he is But last time you asked the Jade Emperor to have an inspection of the whole of Heaven you found no trace of him said Prince Nezha
Where are you going to look for him now Journey to the West As I recall said Monkey the Buddha's dharma is boundless
I'll go to the Western Heaven to ask the Tathagata Buddha to look at all four continents with his allseeing eyes and find out where the demon was born where his home is officially registered and what his ring really is
Whatever happens we must capture him to avenge you gentlemen and allow you to return to Heaven happy In that case said the gods don't stay here a moment longer
Go at once Splendid Monkey said Go and with one bound of his somersault cloud he was soon at Vulture Peak Bringing down his auspicious right he looked all around It was a wonderful place
Nobly tower the sacred peaks Pure is the beauty of the many crags Magical summits rise to touch the jadeblue sky This is what holds the Western Heaven in place Dominating China with its great might
Its primal energy permeates earth and sky Covering all with splendor as its majesty spreads
The sounds of bells and chimes reverberate for long While voices can be heard reciting holy sutras
Under blue pines the faithful preach While arhats stroll among the cypresses
White cranes come with purpose to the Vulture peak Phoenixes choose to perch on its empty pavilions
Monkeys in twos pick immortal fruit Pairs of deer present milk vetch
The songs of hidden birds seem to pour out their woes One cannot put names to the strange and brilliant flowers
Ridge upon ridge enfold here many times over Smooth are the ancient paths that wind around
This is a place of purity and magic Journey to the West The noble home of the enlightened Buddha
As Monkey was admiring the mountain scenery someone called to him Where have you come from Sun Wukong and where are you going He turned round at once to see it was an honorable bhiksuni or nun
There is a matter on which I would like to see the Tathagata said Monkey with a bow
You're so naughty said the bhiksuni
If you're here to see the Tathagata why don't you go straight up to his monastery instead of admiring the scenery I only had the effrontery to look because this is my first visit Monkey replied
Come with me at once said the bhiksuni and Monkey went with her to the gates of the Thunder Monastery where their way was blocked by the eight vajrapanis the ferocious guardian gods
Wait here for a while Wukong while I make a report on your behalf said the bhiksuni
Monkey stood outside the gates while the bhiksuni went into the Buddha's presence put her hands together and said Sun Wukong is here on a matter over which he wishes to see you Tathagata The Buddha sent for Monkey and the vajrapanis then allowed him in
When Monkey had made his kowtows the Buddha asked Why are you here by yourself I was told that you were converted to the faith after the honorable Guanyin released you and that you were escorting the Tang Priest here to fetch the scriptures
What has happened I report to my Buddha said Monkey his head touching the ground that your disciple has been escorting the Tang Priest Westwards ever since my conversion
At the Jindou Cave in Mount Jindou we're up against an evil demon called the Great Rhinoceros King who has tremendous magic powers He is holding my master and fellow disciples as prisoners in his cave I have asked the demon to return them but his intentions are evil
When we fought he grabbed my iron cudgel with a gleaming white ring
I thought he might be some officer from Heaven with a yearning for earthly things so I went straight up there but on inspection could not find any missing
The Jade Emperor kindly sent Heavenly King Li and his son Nezha to help me but the demon took the prince's six weapons
Then I asked the Star Lord of Fire to burn him out but he took all the fireraising equipment and creatures
Next I asked the Star Lord of Water to drown him but not a drop touched him
I went to a lot of effort to steal back the cudgel and all the rest of it challenged him to another fight and lost it all to him again
I have no way of subduing him That is why I have come to ask my Buddha to show his disciple mercy and look to see where the monster is from
Then I'll be able to arrest his relations and neighbors capture him and rescue the master
Then we'll all be able to seek the true achievement together reverently When the Buddha heard this his allseeing eyes looked far away and all was revealed to him at once
I know who that monster is he said but I must not tell you
You cannot keep your mouth shut little monkey and once you put it about that I told you he would stop fighting you and come to make a row here on Vulture Peak I would only be asking for trouble for myself
Instead I will give you some dharma power to help you capture him What dharma power will the Tathagata give me asked Monkey kowtowing in thanks
The Tathagata Buddha then told his eighteen arhats to open their treasury and take eighteen grains of golden cinnabar sand with them
What does golden cinnabar sand do Monkey asked
Journey to the West Go and have another contest with the demon outside the cave the Buddha replied
Lure him out so that the arhats can drop their sand on him and fix him to the spot He will not be able to move his body or lift a leg and you will be able to beat him up as you see fit Splendid said Monkey with a smile splendid
Let's go straight away Not daring to delay the arhats fetched the golden cinnabar sand and set out while Brother Monkey thanked the Buddha once more
When they were on their way Monkey found on counting that there were only sixteen arhats What sort of place is this if you let people bribe their way out of their duties Monkey asked
What do you mean bribing their way out of their duties Eighteen of you were sent Monkey replied so why are there only sixteen of you now Before the words were out of his mouth the arhats Dragonsubduer and Tigerqueller came up to him and asked Wukong how can you be so wicked
We stayed behind to receive the Buddha's instructions You've too tricky said Monkey too tricky
If I'd called out any later I dare say you wouldn't have come at all All the arhats were laughing as they mounted their auspicious clouds
They were soon at Mount Jindou
When Heavenly King Li saw them he led his hosts out in greeting and started to tell them all that had happened
Spare us the details the arhats said Call him out as soon as you can The Great Sage made a spell with his hands went to the mouth of the cave and started shouting insults
Come out you bloated fiend come out and see if you can beat your grandfather Monkey The little devils flew in to report and the demon king said in fury Who's the thieving ape asked along to help him in his wickedness There are no soldiers with him the little devils replied
He's there by himself How could he possibly dare to come back here alone the demon king wondered
I've got his cudgel Does he want another boxing match Taking his ring and brandishing his spear the demon told the little devils to clear away the rocks blocking the entrance and leapt outside Damned ape he shouted insultingly make yourself scarce You've been beaten often enough
What are you here shouting for again Damned demon said Monkey you don't know what's good for you
The only way to stop me coming back is to surrender apologize and give my master and my fellow disciples back
Do that and I'll spare you I've already had those three monks of yours cleaned up the monster replied and soon I'm going to slaughter them Don't you realize that yet
Get lost At the word slaughter Monkey stamped his feet and his cheeks reddened as he could not hold back his anger for a moment longer
Dropping his guard he took a sidestep and swung his fist at the monster's face
The monster struck back with his spear and not realizing that Monkey was deliberately springing from side to side he allowed himself to be lured South further and further from the cave
Monkey then called on the arhats to throw their golden cinnabar sand at the demon all together It was a marvellous display of divine power
Indeed Journey to the West At first it spread like mist or smoke Drifting gently down from the sky
A vast expanse of whiteness In which nothing can be seen A blanket of obscurity That hides one's way in an instant
The woodcutter loses his mate when gathering firewood The young Taoist gathering herbs cannot see his home
The fine grains blow in the wind like flour The coarse ones roll like sesame seeds
The world is lost to sight the mountain peaks are dark And sunshine from the sky is blotted out
This is not the dust kicked up by horses Nor like the softness of a fragrant carriage
This cinnabar sand is a merciless thing Covering heaven and earth and capturing all demons
Only because the monster attacked the true Way Were the arhats commanded to show off its splendor
In their hands they were holding pearls of brilliance To shine with dazzling brightness at the right time
When the demon was being blinded by the flying sand he bent down to see that it was already three feet deep on the ground
In his alarm he sprang up at once to the level above it but before he had steadied himself it was already over two feet deeper
Now desperate he pulled his feet free took out his ring and threw it up in the air with a shout of Catch them As it came whistling down it caught all eighteen grains of golden cinnabar sand The monster went back into his cave
The emptyhanded arhats stopped their clouds
Why have you stopped dropping your sand arhats asked Monkey as he came towards them
Journey to the West There was a noise just now and all our golden cinnabar sand disappeared they replied
That thing must have caught it too said Monkey with a laugh
If he's as invincible as this however are we going to capture him the Heavenly King and the rest of them said
When will we ever go back to Heaven and how will we be able to face the Jade Emperor Then the two arhats Dragonsubduer and Tigerqueller said to Monkey Wukong do you know why we two were late setting out I was cross because I thought you were skulking somewhere and not coming said Monkey
I didn't know you were having a conversation The Tathagata Buddha gave us these instructions the arhats replied He said 'That fiend has very great magic powers If you lose your golden cinnabar sand tell Sun Wukong to go to Lord Lao Zi's Tushita Palace in the Lihen Heaven to find out about the fiend's background
If he does that he may be able to capture the monster easily' What a horrible thing to do said Monkey The Buddha's tricked me again
He should have told me before and spared you this long journey As those are the Buddha's clear instructions you should be on your way as soon as possible said Heavenly King Li Splendid Monkey
Saying I'm off he sent his somersault cloud straight in through the Southern Gate of Heaven where the four marshals raised their hands in greeting and asked how the capture of the demon was going
I haven't got him yet said Monkey without stopping but I now know where to find out about his background Not daring to delay him the four marshals let him pass through
He did not go to the Hall of Miraculous Mist or the Palace of the Dipper and the Bull but went straight to the gates of the Tushita Palace in the Lihen Heaven that lies beyond the thirtythree heavens where he saw two immortal boys standing in attendance Monkey did not report his name but rushed straight in to the consternation of the boys who grabbed him
Who are you they asked and where are you going I am the Great Sage Equaling Heaven Monkey replied and I'm here to see Lord Lao Zi How could you be so illmannered the boys said
Just wait there while we make a report Allowing no further discussion Monkey shouted at them and went straight in colliding with Lord Lao Zi who was coming out to meet him
Haven't seen you for ages old fellow said Monkey after bowing and uttering a respectful reeer Why are you here you little monkey instead of going to fetch scriptures asked Lord Lao Zi with a smile
To this Monkey replied To fetch the holy scriptures I toil day and night Journey to the West And now that I'm in trouble To see you would be right What have your troubles on the road to the Western Heaven to do with me Lord Lao Zi asked Monkey's answer was
Of the Buddha's West Heaven Please don't talk today
It's to follow a trail That I've come up this way But this is a Supreme Immortals' palace Lord Lao Zi replied so how can you be following anyone's trail up here Monkey went into the palace and looked about him with great concentration
When he had gone along a number of covered walkways he noticed a boy sleeping by the buffalo pen from which the waterbuffalo was missing
Old man shouted Monkey your buffalo's escaped your buffalo's escaped When did that wicked beast get away asked Lord Lao Zi with horror
The noise woke up the boy who knelt before Lord Lao Zi and said My lord I was asleep I don't know when it went When did you go to sleep you little wretch asked Lord Lao Zi angrily
I picked up an elixir pill in the elixir laboratory and ate it replied the boy with kowtows then went to sleep here I suppose you ate one of the sevenfired elixir tablets that must have been dropped when I refined them the other day damn you said Lord Lao Zi
One of those tablets would make you sleep for seven days
The evil beast took the chance to escape and go down to the mortal world when you went to sleep and left it unguarded That must have been seven days ago He then ordered an inspection to find out if it had stolen any treasures
It doesn't have any treasures only a terrible ring said Monkey
When Lord Lao Zi made an urgent check he found that nothing was missing except a diamond jade bangle
The evil beast must have stolen my Diamond Jade Bangle said Lord Lao Zi
So that's what his treasure is said Monkey that's what he fought me with
Goodness only knows how many of our weapons he's caught with that now he's rampaging around in the mortal would Where is that wicked beast now Lord Lao Zi asked
Journey to the West In the Jindou Cave on Mount Jindou where he's holding the Tang Priest and has captured my goldbanded cudgel
I asked for the help of heavenly soldiers and he took Prince Nezha's magic weapons
When I invited the Star Lord of Fire to come his fireraising equipment and creatures were taken
Although the Earl of the Yellow River couldn't drown him at least his gear wasn't taken
Then when I asked the Buddha to send his arhats to scatter their golden cinnabar sand the demon took all that too
It looks as though you are guilty of a very serious crime in allowing a thieving and murderous monster to get away That Diamond Jade Bangle is a treasure I refined and created after I went out through the Han Pass to convert the foreigners
Nothing can get anywhere near it not weapons fire or water
But if my Plantain Fan had been stolen not even I would have been able to do anything about it Monkey was feeling very pleased as he accompanied Lord Lao Zi who was carrying his Plantain Fan out of the palace by auspicious cloud
Once they were through the Southern Gate of Heaven they brought the cloud straight down to Mount Jindou where Lord Lao Zi greeted the eighteen arhats the thunder gods the Earl of the Yellow River the Star Lord of Fire Heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha who told him all about what had happened
For me to catch him Sun Wukong will have to go down to lure him out once more Lord Lao Zi said
Monkey jumped down from the peak and started yelling abuse once more
Bloated evil beast come out and be killed When the little devils reported once again the demon king said I wonder who the evil monkey has fetched this time He went out with his spear and his treasure to have Monkey cursing him once again
Vicious demon you're definitely going to die this time
Stay there and take this Monkey leapt straight at him punched the demon on the ear with a swing of his fist turned and fled
The demon was going after him wielding his spear when a shout came from the top of the mountain Go home buffalo
What are you waiting for When the demon looked up and saw Lord Lao Zi he trembled with fear
That thieving ape really is a devil How did he ever persuade my master to come When Lord Lao Zi recited a spell and fanned his fan once the monster surrendered the ring which the lord caught in his hand
When he fanned it again all the strength went out of the monster who reverted to his true form as a waterbuffalo
Lord Lao Zi then blew on the Diamond Bangle with magic breath put it thorough the buffalo's nose undid the sash at his own waist threaded it through the ring and held it
To this day waterbuffaloes still have devices called pegs put through their noses through which a rope can be run this does the same job
Lord Lao Zi then took his leave of the gods mounted the buffalo and rode on his multicolored cloud up to the Tushita Heaven taking the demon with him on its lead
Only then could the Great Sage Sun Heavenly King Li and all of the host charge into the cave killing all the hundred and more big and little devils and recovering their weapons and equipment
Monkey thanked Heavenly King Li and Nezha who went back to Heaven the thunder gods who returned to their residence the Star Lord of Fire who went to his palace the Earl of the Yellow River who went to his river and the arhats who returned to the Western Heaven
Finally he released the Tang Priest Pig and Friar Sand and took back his iron cudgel
When the three of them had thanked Monkey the horse and the luggage were got ready and master and disciples left the cave to find the main route to the West
Journey to the West As they were walking along they heard a call of Holy Tang Priest have a vegetarian meal which startled the master
If you do not know who was calling listen to the explanation in the next installment
The Dhyana Master Conceives after Eating a Meal The YellowWife Brings Waster to Remove a Devil Foetus Eight hundred kinds of virtue must be cultivated Three thousand good deeds must be secretly performed
Do not distinguish objects from self or friend from foe
That conforms with the teaching of the Western Heaven
The rhinoceros demon feared no weapons No blame attached to the failure of water and fire
Lord Lao Zi subdued him and took him to Heaven Turning the buffalo round with a smile
The story goes on to tell who was calling by the wayside
The mountain god and local deity of Mount Jindou came out carrying a bowl of purple gold Holy monk they said this bowl of rice was begged by the Great Sage Monkey from a pious household
You fell into the clutches of an evil demon because you would not heed good advice putting the Great Sage to endless trouble before he was finally able to free you today
Please eat this food before continuing on your way and do not be ungrateful for the Great Sage's respect and sense of duty I am very grateful to you disciple said Sanzang and I cannot find words to express all my thanks
If I had realized before that I should not step out of the circle I would never have been in such danger of being killed I tell you frankly Master said Brother Monkey that because you did not trust the ring I drew you ended up the victim of someone else's ring
It caused so much trouble and suffering
Oh dear oh dear oh dear What do you mean about another ring Pig asked
It was all your fault you eviltongued cretin for getting the master into that terrible danger said Monkey I had to turn heaven and earth upside down to fetch heavenly soldiers water fire and even the Buddha's cinnabar sand all of which was caught by his gleaming white ring
It was only because the Buddha gave a hint to the arhats who told me where the demon had come from that I could fetch Lord Lao Zi to subdue him
He was a waterbuffalo turned demon Good disciple said Sanzang with infinite gratitude when he heard this after this experience I shall definitely take your advice in future The four of them then ate the steaming food
Why is this rice still hot Journey to the West after such a long time Monkey asked
I heated it up myself when I knew that the Great Sage had succeeded replied the local deity on his knees
The food was soon eaten after which they put the bowl away and took their leave of the local deity and the mountain god The master remounted and they crossed the high mountain
Their minds freed from worries they returned to true perception dining on the wind and sleeping in the dew they continued to the West
When they had been travelling for a long time it was once again early spring They heard The soft call of swallows The beauty of orioles
The soft call of swallows tiring their fragrant voices The beauty of orioles and their frequent song
The land is covered with flowers like brocade The emeraldgreen hills seem piled with cushions
Fruit forms on the greengage trees on the ridge While an ancient cypress holds a cloud before the scar
Pale is the misty light on the fertile plain Warm sands are bathed in the glow of sunset
Orchards and trees now break into blossom Willows grow new shoots as the spring returns
As they were walking along they came to a little river in which the water flowed cool pure and deep
When he reined in his horse for a better look the Tang Priest could make out some of the roof of a thatched cottage under the green shade of willows
That must be a ferryman's house said Monkey pointing at the cottage
It looks likely enough replied Sanzang but I would not like to be too sure as I cannot see any boat Ferryman yelled Pig at the top of his voice putting the luggage down
Bring the boat over After a number of these shouts a rowing boat came creaking out from under the willows and was soon near their bank
When they looked carefully this is what they saw Short oars dividing the waves Lightly skimming on the water
The hull is painted in many colours Journey to the West Enclosing a full hold
Iron chains are neatly coiled in the bows And bright is the tiller in the stern
Although the skiff is only as light as a reed It is the equal of an oceangoing vessel
It may have no ivory mast or silken rigging But it does have cassia oars and a sternpost of pine
Indeed this is no ship for mighty voyages Just a ferry fit to cross a single stream Coming and going between the river's banks Never leaving the ancient crossing place
The boat was soon at the bank This way to cross the river called the boatman
Urging the horse forward for a closer look Sanzang saw that the boatman looked like this A head wrapped in a toweling cloth Feet in black shoes of silk
Many a patch on cottonpadded tunic and trousers And around the waist was a muchstitched cotton apron
Horny skin on the hands and muscles hard Eyes dim a wrinkled brow and an aged face
But the voice was a melodious as an oriole's song At a closer look she was clearly an old woman
Do you do the ferrying asked Monkey approaching the boat
Yes the woman replied
Journey to the West Why isn't the ferryman here Monkey asked
Why has he left it to his wife to pole the boat The woman smiled and said nothing as she put the gangplank into position
Friar Sand carried the luggage aboard while Monkey helped the master on then followed himself Pig led the horse on after which the plank was stowed
The woman pushed off and quickly rowed them across the river
When they were on the Western bank Sanzang told Friar Sang to open one of the bundles and take out some coins to give her
The ferry woman did not argue about the amount but moored the boat by its painter to a stake beside the water and went back into her cottage chuckling
As he was thirsty and the water was so clear Sanzang said to Pig Get the bowl and fetch me some water to drink Pig did as he was told and handed the water to his master who drank only about a third of it leaving twothirds for the idiot to snatch and down in a single draft before helping the master back on his horse
Master and disciples had been going less than an hour on the road West when Sanzang started to groan My stomach's hurting I've got the bellyache too said Pig who was behind him
It must be because you drank cold water said Friar Sand only to be interrupted by groans of It's agony from his master and Pig
The two of them were in unbearable pain and their abdomens were gradually swelling
When they felt with their hands there was something like a lump of flesh and blood moving and jerking around incessantly
Sanzang was feeling very unsteady when he noticed two bundles of straw hanging from the top of a tree in a village by the road
That's good Master said Monkey There's a wineshop there
I'll go and beg you some hot water and find out if anyone sells medicine there and will let you have some medicine to ease your pain Sanzang was very pleased with the suggestion so he whipped the white horse forward and was soon at the gates of the village where he dismounted
An old woman was sitting on a bundle of straw outside the gates twisting hempen thread
Monkey went up to her put his hands together in front of his chest in greeting and said We monks have come from the Great Tang in the East
My master is the Tang Emperor's younger brother and he has a stomachache because he drank some water from a river Which river did you drink from asked the old woman laughing aloud
From the clear river to the East of here replied Monkey
What a laugh chuckled the old woman what a laugh
Come inside and I'll explain Monkey supported Sanzang while Friar Sand helped pig into the thatched cottage where they sat down The two of them were groaning in agony from their protruding bellies their faces sallow and their foreheads creased with frowns
Please boil some water for my master missus said Monkey
He must have it and I'll be very grateful Instead of doing this she went into the back of the house still chuckling and called Come and see come and see There was a slap of sandals inside as two or three middleaged women came out to stare at Sanzang with grins across their faces
This made Monkey so angry that he shouted and bared his teeth at them sending them all scurrying and stumbling inside in terror
Journey to the West Monkey went after them grabbed the old woman and said Boil some water this minute and I'll spare your life My lord said the old woman hot water won't be any use
I can't do anything to help those two with their bellyaches
If you let me go I'll tell you all about it When Monkey released her she continued This is the Womanland of Western Liang
All of us in this country are female and there isn't a man among us which is why we were so pleased to see you
It's terrible that the reverend father has drank from that river which is called the Motherhood River
There is a Malewelcoming Post Station outside our capital with a Pregnancyrevealing Spring
In this country we only dare drink of the river's water when we reach the age of twenty
After drinking it we feel the stomach pains of pregnancy
Three days later we go to the Pregnancyrevealing Spring at the Malewelcoming Post Station
If we see a double reflection in the waters we give birth to a child
Because your master has drunk from the Motherhood River he's pregnant He's going to have a baby soon What will a hot drink do to help that Sanzang went pale with shock at the news
What am I to do disciple he asked
I'm going to have a child but I'm a man said Pig writhing around in his agony
Where will the child come out
How am I to give birth to it As the old saying goes a melon falls when it's ripe replied Monkey with a laugh
When the time comes a hole will open under your ribs for it to be born through This conversation made Pig shake with fear and the pain was more than he could bear I can't take any more he said I can't take any more
I'm dying I'm dying Stop fidgeting brother said Friar Sand with a grin stop fidgeting or else you'll get the umbilical cord in a twist and be ill before the birth The idiot's panic was now worse than ever as with tears in his eyes he held on to Monkey and said Brother ask the old lady where there are midwives with a gentle touch and send for some
The pains are coming very close to each other now They must be labor pains
It'll be very soon now If they're labor pains brother you'd better stop writhing about if you don't want your waters to break said Friar Sand still grinning
My good lady groaned Sanzang are there any doctors round here
Send one of my disciples to buy some medicine that will make me abort Medicine won't be any use said the old woman
There's a Miscarriage Spring in Childfree Cave in Mount Offspring Dissolved on the road due South from here
To end your pregnancy you must drink the water of that spring
But the spring water cannot be had now as a Taoist called the Asyouwill Immortal came here the other year and changed the Childfree Cave to the Hermitage of Immortals He's hoarding the waters of Miscarriage Spring which he won't give away
Anyone who wants water must take him rich gifts You have to offer mutton wine and fruit and be very reverent indeed before you can get a bowl of the water from him
You travelling monks couldn't possibly afford to do all that so you'll just have to let fate take its course and have the babies when your time comes Monkey who was very pleased to learn all this then asked how far it was to Mount Offspring Dissolved
Ten miles the old woman replied
Fine said Monkey
You can stop worrying Master
I'll go and get you some of the water Journey to the West Look after the master properly said the splendid Great Sage in his parting instructions to Friar Sand and if the people here try to bully him use your old trick of pulling a face to scare them till I get back with the water Friar Sand was preparing to do as he was told when the old woman came out with a big earthenware bowl that she gave to Monkey
Take this and fetch as much as you can she said so that we can keep some for emergencies Monkey left the thatched cottage with the bowl in his hands and was off on his cloud at which the old woman bowed to the sky and said That monk can ride on clouds my lord Then she went inside and called the other women out to kowtow to the Tang Priest
They started calling him arhat and Bodhisattva boiled water and prepared a meal to offer him
Monkey's somersault cloud soon brought him within sight of a mountain that blocked his cloud so he brought it down to gaze at the superb mountain
He saw A brocade of subtle blossoms Wild flowers spreading a green carpet Streams running into each other Brooks and clouds both at their ease
Dense grow the creepers in many a valley And trees are packed close on a distant ridge
While songbirds call wild geese fly over Deer drink and gibbons climb
The green line of peaks stands like a screen The blue rock face is shaped like a topknot
It is hard to reach it across the drifting sands None could tire of watching the waterfall
Taoist boys roam in search of herbs Foresters return with loads of firewood
It is a worthy rival to Mount Tiantai And better than the threefold Huashan summit
Journey to the West As the Great Sage was looking at the mountain he saw a farmhouse on its Northern slope from where the barking of dogs could be heard
The Great Sage went straight down the mountainside to the farm which was indeed a splendid place
A bridge across a lively stream A cottage sheltered by the hill Dogs barking by the broken fence A recluse who comes and goes at will
Monkey was soon at the gate where he saw an old Taoist sitting on a green cushion
Putting down the earthenware bowl Monkey went forward to greet him
The Taoist returned his greeting with a bow from where he sat and asked Where have you come from
What business brings you here to this hermitage I have been sent by the emperor of the Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven Brother Monkey replied
My master's belly is unbearably painful and swollen because he drank some of the water of the Motherhood River
When we asked the local people they said it was because he is pregnant and that there is no cure for this apart from the Miscarriage Spring in Childfree Cave in Mount Offspring Dissolved
So I have come especially to pay my respects to the Asyouwill Immortal and beg him for some of the spring water with which to save my master
Could you be so kind as to show me the way This was Childfree Cave said the Taoist with a smile but now it's called the Hermitage of Immortals
I am none other than the senior disciple of my master the Asyouwill Immortal
Tell me your name and I will announce you I am the senior disciple of the Patriarch Tang Sanzang said Monkey politely and my name is Sun Wukong Where are your presents your wine and your offerings the Taoist asked
I'm only a passing itinerant monk said Monkey so I haven't been able to arrange them Fool said the Taoist with a laugh
My master controls the spring and never gives any thing away for nothing
You'd better go and fetch your offerings if you want me to announce you or else go away and forget about it People will do more as a favour than on the emperor's command Monkey replied
Go and tell him my name and he's bound to do me this favour
He might even give me the whole spring The Taoist went in to report all this to the immortal who was playing his qin zither and waited till he had finished before saying Master there's a Buddhist monk outside who says he's Sun Wukong the senior disciple of Tang Sanzang
He is asking for some of the water of the Miscarriage Spring to save his master with Had the immortal not been told this the matter would have ended there but at the name of Sun Wukong anger surged up from his heart and evil grew from his gall
He sprang to his feet stepped down from the low table on which he was playing the qin changed from his informal clothes into his Taoist robes and rushed out Journey to the West through the gates of his hermitage with his AsYouWill hook in his hands
Where is Sun Wukong he shouted and Monkey turned to see that he looked like this On his head was a starcrown of many colours And his magic robe was red with threads of gold
The cloudshoes on his feet were thickly embroidered The jade belt at his waist was delicately worked
His wavetreading hosiery was of brocade And glimpses showed of a silk velvet underskirt
He held a golden AsYouWill hook Longhandled with a base shaped like a dragon
Bright were his phoenix eyes and lotuslike his brows Steelsharp were his teeth and his lips bright crimson
He looked more evil still than Marshal Wen Although he wore a different kind of dress
When Monkey saw him he put his hands together and said My name sir is Sun Wukong Are you really Sun Wukong said the Taoist master with a smile or are you just pretending to be What a thing to ask sir
As the saying goes a gentleman never changes his name whether he's travelling or staying at home
I am indeed Sun Wukong Why should I want to pretend Do you know who I am the Taoist master asked I've been converted to the Buddhist faith and follow Buddhist teachings Monkey said I've grown distant from the friends of my child hood on this long journey and I haven't visited any I'm afraid I don't quite recognize you
I only know your name because the people in the village West of Motherhood River told me that you are the Asyouwill Immortal You're busy on your journey and I am busy cultivating my true arts the Taoist replied so why have you come to see me Because my master is pregnant and has a belly ache after mistakenly drinking water from the Motherhood River said Monkey
I've come to your immortal abode to beg you for a bowl of water from the Miscarriage Spring with which to deliver him from his agony Journey to the West Is your master Tang Sanzang asked the Taoist with an angry glare
Yes yes said Brother Monkey
Did you ever meet the Boy Sage King asked the Taoist gnashing his teeth with hatred
That was the title of the demon Red Boy in the Firecloud Cave by Withered Pine Ravine on Mount Hao Monkey replied
Why are you asking about him immortal He is my nephew the immortal replied I am the brother of the Bull Demon King
He wrote me a letter telling me how Sun Wukong the vicious senior disciple of Tang Sanzang destroyed the boy
It was my great regret that I had no way of taking revenge on you here but now you've come to my door begging for water You are mistaken sir said Monkey putting on a smile
Your respected elder brother used to be a friend of mine and we were two of seven sworn brothers in my youth
The only reason I did not come to pay my respects earlier was because I did not know your address
Your good nephew has done very well He's now serving the Bodhisattva Guanyin as the page Sudhana He's much better off than the rest of us so why be so angry with me Damned ape shouted the Taoist master
How dare you argue like that
Is my nephew better off as a slave than he was when he enjoyed the delights of being a king
Learn to behave yourself and try a taste of my hook Monkey parried with his iron cudgel and said Don't talk about fighting
Give me some of the spring water instead Vicious ape the Taoist master said again you don't know whether you want to live or die
If you can hold out against me for three rounds I'll give you your water but if you can't I shall avenge my nephew by cutting you up and stewing you in soy sauce I'll get you you impudent and evil creature replied the Great Sage
If you want a fight try my cudgel The Taoist master blocked it with his hook and the two of them fought a fine battle by the Hermitage of Immortals
The holy monk conceived after drinking from a river So Monkey went to call on the Asyouwill Immortal Not knowing that the Taoist was in fact a monster Who had used his powers to seize the Miscarriage Spring
When he met Monkey old hatreds were revived
They were locked in struggle and neither would yield
As they talked on he became ever angrier Evilly determined to have his revenge
Journey to the West One came for water to save his master's life Which the other would not give for his nephew's sake
More lethal than a scorpion was the asoutwill hook While the goldbanded cudgel struck like a dragon The cudgel kept thrusting savagely at the chest While the hook made subtle cuts to the legs
Grievous were the wounds where the cudgel fell And the hook rose from the shoulders to strike at the head
The cudgel swung round the waist Like a hawk after a sparrow The hook struck thrice at the head Like a mantis catching a cicada
They came and went as they struggled for mastery The ebb and flow of battle taking them forward and back
There was nothing to choose between cudgel and hook Neither contender emerged as the victor
After the Taoist master had fought over ten rounds with the Great Sage but was no match for him Monkey struck at the head with more ferocity than ever his cudgel's blows falling like a stream of shooting stars
Completely exhausted the Taoist master fled down the mountainside trailing his AsYouWill hook behind him
Instead of pursuing him Monkey went to the hermitage in search of water only to find that the other Taoist had already fastened the gates
Holding the earthenware bowl in his hands he went straight up to the gates kicked through them with all his strength and rushed in
The Taoist disciple was crouching behind the well's railings The Great Sage shouted at him raised his cudgel and was about to kill him when the Taoist fled into the back
Monkey had just fetched a bucket and was on the point of filling it with spring water from the well when the master came up behind him caught his feet with the hook and sent him sprawling on the ground
The Great Sage pulled himself to his feet and started hitting back with his cudgel
The Taoist master swerved aside and said wielding the hook We'll see if you can steal the water from my well Come here shouted Monkey come here
I'll get you you evil creature and I'll beat you to death The Taoist master did not go for Monkey but just stood guard over the well preventing him from drawing any water Seeing that he was not moving Monkey whirled his cudgel round and round with his left hand and in Journey to the West his right took the bucket which he sent noisily down the well on the rope
The Taoist master came back to the attack with his hook
Monkey unable to hold him off onehanded was tripped round his legs again and sent sprawling dropping the bucket and rope down the well
What a way to behave remarked the Great Sage getting back on his feet and taking his cudgel in both hands to lash wildly back
Once again the Taoist master fled unable to face him
The Great Sage still wanted to draw some water but now he had no bucket and was also worried that he might be tripped by the hook again I'd better get someone to help me he thought
The splendid Great Sage turned his cloud round went straight back to the cottage door and shouted Friar Sand When Sanzang and Pig who were groaning and moaning in agony heard his shout they said with relief Friar Sand Wukong's back Friar Sand opened the door as quickly as he could asking Have you got the water brother When Monkey came in and told them what had happened Sanzang said with tears in his eyes What are we to do disciple I've come to take Brother Sand back to the hermitage with me Monkey replied
He'll fetch the water to save you while I fight that damned Taoist If both you healthy ones go and abandon us invalids who will look after us Sanzang asked
Don't worry venerable arhat said the old woman who was standing beside them You won't need your disciples We can look after you
We were very kind to you when you first came and now that we have seen how that Bodhisattva can travel by cloud we know that you are arhats and Bodhisattvas
We could never possibly harm you You women snorted Monkey you wouldn't dare hurt anyone You don't know your luck my lord the old woman replied with a smile
If you'd gone to any other house you'd never have come out in one piece What do you mean Pig groaned
All of us in this family are getting on the old woman replied and desire doesn't bother us any more which is why we didn't harm you
If you'd gone to another household with women of different ages the younger ones would never have let you go
They'd have forced you to sleep with them and if you'd refused they'd have murdered you and cut all the flesh off your bodies to put in perfume bags In that case I'd have been safe said Pig
The others smell lovely just right for a perfume bag but I'm a stinking boar and any flesh cut off me would stink too
I'd come to no harm Stop boasting said Brother Monkey with a smile and save your strength for the delivery Fetch the water as soon as you can
Don't waste any time the old woman said
Do you have a wellbucket on a rope I could borrow Monkey asked
The old woman went out to the back and brought in a bucket on a rope as well as a spare coil of rope that she handed to Friar Sand
Take both ropes in case the well is so deep you need them she said
Journey to the West Friar Sand took the bucket and the ropes left the cottage with Monkey and flew off on the same cloud
It took them less than an hour to reach Mount Offspring Dissolved where they landed directly outside the gates of the hermitage
Take the bucket and the ropes Monkey told Friar Sand and hide over there Let me challenge him to battle
When the fight's going good and strong sneak in fetch the water and take it back Friar Sand accepted his orders
Brandishing his iron cudgel the Great Sage Sun went up to the gates and shouted Open up
Open up When the gatekeeper saw him he hurried inside to report Master Sun Wukong's here again
The Taoist master was furiously angry That evil ape is utterly impossible
I've long heard of his powers and now I know what they really are
That cudgel of his is unbeatable Master said the other Taoist his powers may be great but you're as good as he is
You are a match for him He beat me the last two times said the master
Yes said the other but that was just because he went for you with such fury
You tripped him up with your hook twice when he was trying to draw water so that leveled the score didn't it He had to run away
If he's back now it must be because he's had to I expect Sanzang's been complaining too much as his pregnancy's so far advanced
I'm sure that he's feeling resentful of his master
You're absolutely bound to win this time master This pleased the Taoist immortal and made him feel very cheerful as he went out through the doors His face was wreathed in smiles his manner imposing and his hook in his hands
Wicked ape what are you back here for he shouted
Just to fetch some water Monkey replied
It's my well said the immortal and even if you were a king or a minister you'd still have to made me presents and offer mutton and wine before I gave you any
On top of that you're my enemy How dare you come here emptyhanded expecting water Do you refuse to give me any Monkey asked
Yes said the immortal I won't Vicious and evil beast Monkey yelled if you won't give me the water take this He dropped his guard to strike hard with his cudgel at the immortal's head
The immortal dodged the blow and struck back with his hook
It was an even finer combat than the previous one The goldbanded cudgel The AsYouWill hook And two fighters filled with hatred and anger
Journey to the West The flying sand and stones darkened earth and sky The clouds of dust and dirt made sun and moon seem sad
The Great Sage was fetching water to save his master That the evil immortal refused for his nephew's sake
Both sides fought with equal vigor In their battle that allowed no rest
They struggled for victory with tightclenched jaws Gritting their teeth as they strove to win
With growing skill And evergreater vigor They breathed out clouds to frighten gods and ghosts
Noisily rang the clash of their weapons As their battle cries shook the mountains and hills
They were a whirlwind wrecking a forest A pair of murderous fighting bulls
As the battle went on the Great Sage felt happier And the Taoist immortal had ever more energy
Each was determined to carry on the fight Neither would give up till the issue was resolved
The two of them leapt around in their fight from the gates of the hermitage to the mountain slope It was a long and bitter struggle
When Friar Sand rushed in through the gates with the bucket in his hand the Taoist disciple blocked his way and asked Who do you think you are coming to steal our water Friar Sand put down his bucket and ropes brought out his demonquelling staff and struck at the Taoist's head by way of an answer
Because the Taoist could not move out of the way fast enough the blow broke his arm and he fell to the ground straggling to escape
Journey to the West I was going to kill you you evil beast roared Friar Sand but seeing as you're human I feel sorry for you and I'll let you go
Now let me get my water The Taoist crawled to the back of the hermitage thanking heaven and earth for his escape
Friar Sand then filled his bucket with water from the well went out through the gates rose up on his cloud and called to Monkey I've got the water brother
Spare him now spare him Hearing this Monkey held the hook at bay with his cudgel and said Listen to what I have to say
I was going to wipe all of you out but you've broken no laws and your brother the Bull Demon King is a friend of mine
The first time I came you tripped me up with your hook a couple of times and I couldn't get the water
I lured you out to fight me so that my fellow disciple could get some water
If I'd used my full powers I'd have killed several of you never mind just one Asyouwill Immortal
But it's better to spare life than to take it so I'll let you live a few more years
Never ever try extortion on anyone who comes here for the water again The evil and foolish immortal moved and tried to hook Monkey once more but Monkey avoided the hook rushed at him and shouted Don't move The helpless immortal fell head first to the ground and was unable to get up
The Great Sage picked up his AsYouWill hook snapped it in two then broke the two pieces into four and threw them to the ground
Damned beast he said are you going to try any more nonsense The trembling immortal had to bear his humiliation in silence and the laughing Great Sage rose up on his cloud
There is a poem that testifies to this
It goes When true lead is melted it yields a true liquid If the true liquid is mixed right true mercury hardens
True mercury and true lead have no feminine quality Magic cinnabar and herbs are the elixir of immortality
When a child is recklessly formed and a pregnancy results The mother of earth succeeds without any effort
Heresy is pushed over and orthodoxy honoured The heart's lord succeeds and returns in smiles
The Great Sage set off his cloud and caught up with Friar Sand
They were very pleased to be returning with the magical water as they brought their cloud down at the cottage to find Pig leaning against the door and groaning with his big belly sticking out
Idiot said Monkey stealing up on him when did you get yourself pregnant Stop teasing me said the idiot in desperation
Did you fetch the water Monkey was going to keep the joke up but Friar Sand then arrived to report with a smile Here's the water Despite his agony Sanzang managed to lean forward in a kind of bow as he said Disciples I'm very grateful to you The old woman was pleased too and the whole household came in to bow and say Bodhisattvas Journey to the West this is wonderful wonderful She fetched a drinking bowl of decorated porcelain half filled it with the water and handed it to Sanzang with the words Venerable sir please drink it very slowly
One mouthful will be enough to end the pregnancy I won't need a bowl said Pig I'll drink the lot bucket rope and all Venerable sir the woman said don't give me such a terrible fright
If you drank the whole bucketful it would dissolve all your insides This gave the idiot such a fright that he behaved himself and drank only half a bowlful too
Within less time than it takes to eat a meal the two of them were in agony their intestines felt as if they were being wrung out and gave several loud rumbles
After that the idiot could contain himself no longer he emptied his bowels and his bladder
The Tang Priest also unable to contain himself wanted to go to the lavatory
Master said Brother Monkey you mustn't go anywhere you might be in a draft If you catch a cold you may get milk fever The woman then brought in two latrine buckets for the pair of them
When they had both used them several times the pain stopped and their stomachs gradually started to resume their normal size as the extra flesh and blood in them was dissolved
The woman then cooked them some plain rice porridge to settle their stomachs
Lady said Pig my stomach's very strong and it doesn't need settling
Boil me some water for a bath before I eat my porridge You mustn't have a bath brother said Friar Sand
Washing in he first month after childbirth can make you ill That wasn't childbirth said Pig just a miscarriage nothing to worry about
I want a bath to clean up The woman then boiled some water for them to wash their hands and feet
The Tang Priest could only manage two bowls of porridge while Pig downed a dozen or so and still wanted more
Idiot said Monkey with a laugh don't eat so much It wouldn't look pretty at all if you got a big belly like a sandbag No problem said pig no problem
I'm not a sow so I don't need to worry about that The women then went out to cook him some more rice
Will you give me the rest of the water the old woman asked the Tang Priest
Have you had enough of the water Monkey asked My stomach's stopped hurting said Pig and I'm sure the pregnancy's completely finished
As I'm fine now I don't need any more As they're both better now we'll give you the water said Monkey
The woman thanked him and buried the water in a glazed jar behind the house
That jar of water will be enough to pay for my coffin she told the rest of her family who were all delighted
A vegetarian meal was prepared tables and chairs were set out and the monks dined They took their time over the meal then retired for the night
Journey to the West The next morning they thanked the old woman and her family and left the cottage
Sanzang mounted the horse Friar Sand shouldered the luggage the Great Sage Monkey led the way and Pig held the bridle
This had been a case of Rinsing away the evil and leaving the body pure Dissolving the mortal foetus to restore the natural self
If you don't know what else happened in that country listen to the explanation in the next installment
The BuddhaNature Traveling West Enters Womankind The MindApe Makes a Plan to Escape from the Beauties When Sanzang and his disciples left the cottage they headed West and about a dozen miles later they entered the country of Western Liang
Wukong said the Tang Priest on his horse there is a city not far ahead and I can hear a great hubbub of voices from the marketplace
You must all be very very careful and on your best behavior
Do not make nonsense of the teachings of our Buddhist faith by running wild or becoming infatuated The three disciples were determined to obey his instructions
Before the Tang Priest had finished speaking they reached the street leading in from the Eastern gate
Everyone they saw was wearing a skirt and a woman's jacket a powdered face and oiled hair All the people young and old were women
When those buying and selling in the street saw the four of them coming they started to applaud laugh and say with smiles all over their faces Men men Sanzang was so alarmed that he reined in his horse unable to go any further forward
In a moment the streets were packed and the air was ringing with happy voices
I'm a gelded pig a gelded pig yelled Pig in a panic
Stop that nonsense idiot said Monkey
Just show them your face the way it used to be Pig then shook his head a couple of times stuck up his ears shaped like reed fans twisted his bristly dropping snout and give a roar that made all the women collapse with fright
There is a poem to prove it that goes The monk came to Western Liang on his way to the Buddha The streets were a feminine world where males were not seen
Peasants scholars and artisans merchants and fisherfolk Woodcutters tillers and stockraisersall were women
The beauties poured into the streets to welcome the men Journey to the West Young women come in crowds to hail the handsome groom
If Wuneng had not made full use of his hideous face The pilgrims could not have withstood a siege by the ladies
The women were then all so frightened that they dared not approach
Clutching their hands stooping shaking their heads chewing at their fingers trembling and shaking they blocked the streets to look at the Tang Priest
The Great Sage Monkey also pulled a hideous face to clear a way for them helped by grimaces from Friar Sand
Leading the horse pig stuck out his snout and was flapping his ears
As they moved forward they saw that the buildings along the city streets were wellbuilt and the shop fronts imposing
There were grocers and cornchandlers bars and teahouses multistoried shops where everything was sold towers and fine mansions with welldraped windows
Master and disciples turned one corner to come up against a female official standing in the street and shouting Envoys from afar you may not enter the city gates without permission
Please go to the government post station and register your names so that I can report them to Her Majesty
When they have been examined you will be allowed to proceed Hearing this Sanzang dismounted and saw that the words MALEWELCOMING POST STATION were written on a board across the door of the official building
Wukong said the venerable elder what the village people told us was true
There really is a Malewelcoming Post Station Brother Pig chuckled Friar Sand you'd better look in the Pregnancyrevealing Spring to see if you have a double reflection Stop trying to make a fool of me said Pig
I aborted after drinking the water from Miscarriage Spring
What would I need to look for Watch your words Wuneng watch your words said Sanzang turning back to give Pig his instructions before going forward and greeting the official
She led them into the main hall of the post station where they sat down and tea was sent for
Here too the staff all had their hair in bunches and wore skirts
There were many smiles as the tea was brought
A little later when it had been drunk the official gave a slight bow as she sat there and asked On what business have you emissaries come We are envoys sent to the Western Heaven by the Great Tang emperor in the East to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures Monkey replied
My master Tang Sanzang is the Tang emperor's younger brother
I am Sun Wukong his senior disciple and these two are my fellows Zhu Wuneng Pig and Sha Wujing Friar Sand
If you count the horse there are five of us altogether
We are carrying a passport with us that we beg to have inspected so that we may be allowed to continue on our way When the woman official had finished writing all this down she dropped to her knees to kowtow to them and said Forgive me my lords
I am only the superintendent of the Malewelcoming Post Station and I did not realize that you were gentlemen from a superior country who deserved to be met at a great distance from here She rose to her feet and ordered the staff to provide them with food and drink
Please make yourselves comfortable my lords while I go into the city to report to our queen Then your document will be dealt with Journey to the West and you will be seen on your way West with rich presents Sanzang was happy to sit there
The superintendent neatened her clothes and went straight into the city to the Tower of Five Phoenixes at the palace entrance where she said to the gate officer I am the superintendent of the Malewelcoming Post Station and I would like an audience with Her Majesty on a certain matter The gate officer reported this to the queen at once at which the superintendent was summoned straight to the throne hall to be asked what it was she had come to say
Your humble subject she replied has received in her post station Tang Sanzang the younger brother of the Tang emperor in the East He has three disciples called Sun Wukong Zhu Wuneng and Sha Wujing and a horse making five of them altogether They wish to go to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures
I have come especially to submit a memorial to Your Majesty asking whether they may be allowed to submit their passport for approval and proceed on their way The queen was delighted at his report and she said to her civil officials We dreamed last night of a gold screen shining with colours and a jade mirror full of light
They must have been good omens of what has happened today The women officials crowded round the steps of the throne and said with kowtows Your Majesty how can you tell that they were good omens for today This man from the East the queen replied is the younger brother of the Tang emperor
Since primal chaos was first cleared we have never seen a man in our country under all the queens who have reigned here
The fortunate arrival of the Tang emperor's younger brother must be a gift from Heaven
I have decided to use our country's wealth to persuade the emperor's brother to become king with me as his queen Then we can unite the male and the female and produce sons and grandsons to pass the throne on to
So weren't they good omens The joyful women officials all performed dances of obeisance
Your Majesty's idea of passing the throne on to future generations in an excellent one the superintendent of the post station further submitted but the three hideous disciples of the emperor's younger brother are not at all attractive What does the emperor's brother look like the queen asked and how are the disciples so unattractive The emperor's brother has a handsome face and an impressive bearing the superintendent replied
He really does look like a man from a great country ruled by a heavensent dynasty a son of China in the Southern Jambu continent
But the three disciples look thoroughly vicious with faces like demons In that case said the queen give presents to his disciples return their passport and send them on their way to the Western Heaven Keep only the emperor's brother here
Is there any reason why we should not To this the officials bowed low and replied Your Majesty's ideas are completely right and your subjects will respectfully implement them
The only difficulty is that we have no matchmaker to arrange the marriage
As the old saying goes Marriage and mating depend on red leaves A matchmaker ties the threads between husband and wife
Journey to the West From what you suggest the queen replied the royal tutor should be invited to be matchmaker and the superintendent of the Malewelcoming Post Station will be the mistress of ceremonies Go to the post station and ask for the consent of the emperor's younger brother
When he has agreed we shall go out of the city in our carriage to greet him The tutor and the superintendent left the palace to carry out their instructions
Sanzang and his disciples were just enjoying a vegetarian meal in the hall of the post station when someone was heard outside announcing the arrival of the queen's tutor and the superintendent
Why is the queen's tutor here Sanzang asked
Perhaps it's an invitation from the queen said Pig
It's either that or a proposal of marriage said Brother Monkey
But if she tries to force me to marry her and refuses to let us go what am I to do Wukong Sanzang asked
Just agree Master said Monkey
I'll find a way to cope Before they had finished their conversation the two women officials entered and bowed low to the venerable elder who returned their courtesies and said I am a humble monk
What wonderful powers do I have that you should bow to me thus The queen's tutor was discreetly delighted with his noble bearing thinking Our country will indeed be very fortunate if this man is to become our queen's husband When the two officials had finished bowing they stood on either side of Sanzang and said Imperial brother many many congratulations I am a monk Sanzang replied so what good fortune is there to congratulate me on Bowing again the queen's tutor said This is Womanland of Western Liang and no man has ever come here before
As Your Excellency the emperor's brother has graced us with your presence I am here on the orders of Her Majesty the queen to propose marriage Good gracious said Sanzang
I have come to your distinguished country with no children apart from my three boorish disciples
Which of them is it that Her Majesty wishes to marry I have just been to the palace to report the superintendent of the post station said and our queen was very very happy She said that last night she had an auspicious dream in which a golden screen shone with many colours and a jade mirror was full of light
When she learned that Your Excellency the emperor's brother was a man from the great land of Tang she decided to offer you all the wealth of our country to persuade you to stay here as her husband and sit on the throne Her Majesty would become queen consort
The royal tutor was commissioned to act as matchmaker and I was made mistress of ceremonies
We are here to ask for your hand At this Sanzang bowed his head in silence
A true man does not throw away his chance the queen's tutor said
There is nothing unusual about a man being asked to marry a woman and live in her house but rarely does it happen that one is offered the wealth of a state to do so
I beg the emperor's brother to assent quickly so that I may report back to Her Majesty The venerable elder seemed to have been struck dumb
Journey to the West Pig who was standing beside them put his hands to his snout and called Tutor please report back to Her Majesty that my master is an arhat who has long cultivated the Way He's not interested in your country's wealth or in Her Majesty's great beauty
Hurry up and return our passport and send him on his way to the West You can keep me here to be her husband
What about it The suggestion made the tutor tremble She was speechless with shock
You may be a man the superintendent said but you are much too ugly for Her Majesty You don't understand said pig Thick willow twigs make dustpans and fine ones make funnels There's a use for everything
There's not a man in all the world who's really ugly Idiot said Monkey stop that nonsense Let our master decide If he agrees the wedding is on and if he doesn't it's off
Don't waste the matchmaker's time Wukong said Sanzang you decide If you ask me Monkey replied you'd be very well off here
As the old saying goes A thousand miles can't keep apart A couple that's fated to wed Their lives and destinies are tied By a long and invisible thread
Where else will you find a place that offers you this much Disciple said Sanzang if we stay here out of a love for wealth and status who will go to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures
Would that not be a terrible thing to do to our Great Tang emperor Your Excellency the royal tutor replied I must tell you the truth
Our queen only intends to marry you the emperor's brother Your three disciples will be invited to the wedding banquet given presents have their passport returned and be allowed to go on their journey to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures What the royal tutor says is right replied Monkey We three mustn't make difficulties
We'll let our master stay here as the queen's husband
Hurry up and return us our travel document so that we can be on our way West
We will pay our respects to Her Majesty on our way back with the scriptures and ask for some money for the journey back to the Great Tang The royal tutor and the superintendent both bowed to Monkey and said We are very grateful to you sir for your helpfulness Tutor said Pig don't just talk about feeding us
Now that we've agreed get your mistress to lay on a banquet so that we can all drink a cup of betrothal wine
What about it Journey to the West Yes yes said the tutor a banquet will be provided The superintendent and the tutor returned in great delight to report back to the queen Sanzang meanwhile grabbed Monkey and started abusing him
You're trying to kill me you ape How could you say things like that Making me stay here to be her husband while you go to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha I'd die before I agreed to do that Don't worry Master said Monkey Of course I know your nature But faced with people like that in a place like this I had to play them at their own game What do you mean by playing them at their own game Sanzang asked
If you had been obstinate and refused her she would not have returned our travel paper or let us continue on our way Monkey replied
If she had turned vicious and called on all her underlings to slice your flesh off to make perfume bags or whatever we'd never have earned a good reward
We'd have had to use our magic powers for subduing and killing demons You know how hard we hit and how murderous our weapons are Once we got going we'd have wiped out everyone in the whole country
But they're people not demons even if they are blocking our way
And all along this journey you've been good and mercifulyou haven't killed a single soul How could you bear to kill so many innocent people That really would be evil Wukong replied Sanzang that is a very fine argument
But I'm afraid that when the queen takes me into her palace she will want me to perform my conjugal duties
I could not possibly lose my primal masculinity and ruin my conduct as a Buddhist monk or let my true seed escape and destroy my status in the faith As you have agreed to the marriage she is bound to treat you as king and come out in her carriage to fetch you Monkey replied
You must on no account refuse Take your seat in the phoenix and dragon carriage enter the throne hall and sit on the throne facing South as monarch
Tell the queen to fetch her royal seals and write an invitation summoning us to court Stamp our travel permit with the official seal and ask her to sign it herself and return it to us
Have a banquet laid on as a celebration for yourself and the queen and to say farewell to us too
When the banquet is over have the carriage got ready and tell her that when you have seen us three out of the city you will be coming back to sleep with her
This will put the queen and her subjects into such a good mood that they won't try to keep us any more let alone have any evil intentions towards us
When you have escorted us out of the city get out of the carriage Tell Friar Sand to stay with you and help you mount the white horse while I use some immobilizing magic to stop the queen and her subjects from moving
Then we can carry on West along the main road and when we've been travelling for a day and a night I'll say a spell to undo the magic and revive them so that they can go back into the city
This way none of them will be killed and you won't have to harm your essential spirit
This is what they call a plan to 'slip through the net with a false marriage' It works both ways doesn't it These words sobered Sanzang up and woke him from his dream He forgot his worries and thanked Monkey profusely
I am profoundly grateful to you good disciple for your brilliant suggestion Now that the four of them had agreed on a plan we shall leave them discussing it
The queen's tutor and the post station superintendent went straight through the gates of the palace to the steps of the throne without waiting to be summoned Your Majesty's auspicious dream was completely justified they announced
You two will be as happy together as fish and water Journey to the West When the queen heard their report she lifted the pearl curtain came down from her dragon throne and gave a smile that opened her cherry lips and showed her silvery teeth as she asked in her charming voice What did the emperor's brother say when you spoke to him When we reached the post station and had bowed to the emperor's brother the queen's tutor replied we told him of the proposal of marriage
He tried to decline it but fortunately his senior disciple agreed on his behalf He would like his master to marry Your Majesty and sit on the throne as king
He asked that you should first return their passport and send the three disciples on their way West
When they come back with the scriptures they will pay their respects to their master and Your Majesty and ask for some money for their journey back to Great Tang What did the emperor's brother say to that the queen asked with a smile
He did not speak the tutor replied but he is willing to marry Your Majesty
The only thing is that his second disciple wants a betrothal feast first When the queen heard this she ordered the office that dealt with foreign relations to lay on a banquet
She also had the state carriage prepared to take her out of the city to welcome her lord and husband
The female officials obediently swept the palace clean and laid on a banquet in the hall
Those who were setting out the banquet moved as fast as fire and those who were preparing the chariot did so with the speed of shooting stars
Western Liang was a country of women but its state carriage was no less splendid than a Chinese one
Six dragons snorting out coloured clouds A pair of phoenixes full of good omen
The six dragons supported the carriage as it came out The pair of phoenixes were riding upon it
Fragrant were the perfumes Dense the clouds of auspicious vapor
Officials with goldfishshaped pendants of jade now crowded around The women were all drawn up with their hair full of ornaments
Mandarinduck fans gave shade to the carriage While curtains of jade and pearl did shelter the queen
Beautifully sounded the songs to the panpipes While strings and woodwinds all played in harmony
A surge of joy soared up to the heavens Boundless bliss poured out from the heart
Journey to the West The triple silken canopy shook the sky Brilliant banners cast their light on the throne steps
Never before had the marriage cup here been drunk Today the queen would be taking a husband
The carriage soon left the city and reached the Malewelcoming Post Station
At once the queen's arrival was announced to Sanzang and his disciples who straightened up their clothes and came out to meet the queen's carriage
The queen raised the curtain and came out Which of these gentlemen is the Tang emperor's brother she asked
The gentleman in front of the post station who is wearing a long gown the tutor replied
The queen took a very careful look at him with her phoenix eyes her motheyebrows raised He was indeed an exceptional sight Look at him A noble manner Distinguished features
White teeth as if made of silver A squarecut mouth with lips of red
The top of the head flat the forehead broad and ample Fine eyes a clear brow and a long jaw
His ears had the round lobes of a great man His body was that of one with no ordinary talent
A handsome intelligent and gallant gentleman The ideal consort for the graceful queen
As the queen was gazing at him with delight and admiration she felt a great surge of desire and passion Opening her cherry lips she said Younger brother of the Great Tang emperor won't you ride in my royal carriage This made Sanzang blush from ear to ear He was too embarrassed to look up at her
Pig who was standing beside him put his hands to his snout and devoured the queen with his eyes She was a slim beauty
Journey to the West Brows like green willow Flesh like mutton fat Cheeks set off with plum blossom Hair like the plumage of a golden phoenix
The autumn waves of her eyes were full of charm Like bamboo shoot in spring was her graceful posture
Red tassels floated with elegance over her temples Pearls and kingfisher feathers adorned her highpiled hair Why talk now of the Princess Zhaojun's beauty
This queen is lovelier than the legendary Xi Shi
As her willow waist gently bends gold pendants tinkle Her lotus feet move lightly with her limbs of jade
The Lady of the Moon could not compare with her No heavenly fairy could be her match
Her exquisite palace clothes were not those of a mere mortal She was the Queen Mother of the West come to the Jade Pool
Seeing how beautiful she was the idiot could not help drooling His heart pounded and his limbs went weak he melted like a snow lion next to a bonfire
When the queen came closer to Sanzang she took hold of him and said in a most beguiling voice Dear emperor's brother won't you come into my dragon coach ride back with me to the throne hall and marry me The venerable elder trembled feeling unsteady on his feet It was as if he were drunk or stupefied
Don't be so shy and modest Master urged monkey who was standing beside him Please get into the carriage with your future wife
Have our passport returned to us as soon as possible so that we can continue on our journey to fetch the scriptures Sanzang could not bring himself to reply as he put his hand on Monkey unable to hold back his tears
Don't be so upset Master Monkey said Here's your chance to enjoy wealth and honour so make the most of it Sanzang had no choice but to do as Monkey bade him
Wiping his tears away he forced himself to smile as he stepped forward to Journey to the West Hold the queen's white hand Sitting in the dragon carriage
The queen was in raptures at the prospect of a husband The elder in his terror wanted only to worship the Buddha
One longed to embrace her man in the candlelit bedroom The other wanted to see the Worldhonoured on Vulture Peak
The queen was sincere The holy monk was pretending
The queen in her sincerity Hoped that they would grow old in harmony together
The holy monk pretending Controlled his tender feeling to nourish his primal spirit
One was so happy to see her husband She wished they could be man and wife in broad daylight
The other was afraid of woman's beauty Longing to escape her clutches and climb to the Thunder Monastery
The two ascended the carriage together But the Tang Priest's intentions were far away
When the civil and military officers saw their mistress enter the royal coach with the venerable Sanzang sitting beside her their faces were all wreathed in smiles The procession turned around and went back into the city
Monkey told Friar Sand to carry the luggage while he led the horse as they followed behind the coach
Pig rushed wildly ahead and when he reached the Tower of Five Phoenixes he started shouting This is very fine and splendid but it won't do it won't do at all
We've got to have some wedding drinks to toast the groom He so alarmed the women officials carrying ceremonial insignia who were leading the procession that they all went back to the queen's carriage to report Your Majesty the one with big ears and a long snout is making a row in front of the Tower of Five Phoenixes and demanding wedding drinks Journey to the West On hearing this the queen leant her fragrant shoulder against Sanzang pressed her peachblossom cheek against his and opened her sandalwoodscented mouth to murmur in her seductive voice Dear emperor's brother is the one with big ears and a long snout one of your distinguished disciples He is my second disciple Sanzang replied
He has an enormous appetite and he has spent all his life trying to get good things to eat
We must lay on some food and drink for him before we can get on with things The queen then asked anxiously if the office dealing with foreign relation had yet prepared the banquet
It is ready the women officials reported It is set out on the Eastern hall and includes both meat and vegetarian dishes Why both sorts the queen asked
Your subjects thought that the Tang emperor's brother and his distinguished disciples might be vegetarians the officials replied
That was why we had both sorts of food provided Dear emperor's brother said the queen with another little laugh of pleasure as she rubbed herself against Sanzang's fragrant cheek do you eat meat or vegetarian food I eat vegetarian food Sanzang replied but I have never given up wine
We must have a few cups of light wine for my second disciple to drink Before he had finished speaking the queen's tutor said to the queen If it pleases Your Majesty will you come to the Eastern hall for the banquet
Today is an auspicious day and at a lucky hour tonight you may marry the emperor's brother
Tomorrow a new ecliptic begins and I beg that the emperor's younger brother will enter the throne hall tomorrow to take his throne facing South as monarch and inaugurate a new reign The queen was delighted by this suggestion
Descending from the coach handinhand with Sanzang she went in through the palace's main gate This is what they saw and heard
Magic music wafting down from a gallery As the turquoise carriage came within the palace
The phoenix gates stood wide open amid gentle light The harem in all its splendor was not closed
Incense smoke curled aloft in the unicorn hall Shadows were moving behind the peacock screen
The buildings were magnificent as those of a mighty state The jade halls and golden horses were even more splendid
Journey to the West When they reached the Eastern hall the harmonious sounds of panpipes and singing could be heard and two rows of powdered beauties seen
In the middle of the hall two sumptuous banquets were set out a vegetarian one to the left and a meat one on the right
Below were two rows of individual places
The queen folded back her sleeves took a jade goblet with her ten delicate fingers and led Sanzang to the feast
Monkey went up to her and said We are all vegetarians so would you ask my master to sit at the vegetarian feast to the left while three places are set below him for us three disciples Yes that's right said the queen's tutor
Master and disciples are like father and sons
It would be wrong to seat them side by side The women officials quickly rearranged the seating and the queen gave goblets to each of them as she led them to their places
Monkey gave the Tang Priest a look to remind him to return her courtesies at which he came down from his seat with a jade goblet in his hand and led the queen to her place
The civil and military officials all kowtowed to the queen in gratitude and took their seats in order of precedence on either side Only then did the music cease and the toasts begin
Pig did not worry about anything as he relaxed his belly and ate for all he was worth
He did not care whether it was jadeflake rice steamed buns sweet cakes mushrooms gill fungus bamboo shoots treeear fungus day lilies agar laver turnips taro devilpepper yams or sealwort he wolfed the whole lot down together
Then he drank some six or seven goblets of wine and shouted Fill it up bring me another I want a big goblet
Give me a few more drinks then we can all go off and do what we've got to do What is there so important that makes us have to leave this fine banquet Friar Sand asked
There's an old saying replied the idiot with a grin 'that each man should stick to his trade
Some of us are getting married now and others of us have to be on our way to fetch the scriptures We mustn't ruin everything for the sake of a few more drinks
We want our passport returned as soon as possible
As they say 'The warriors stay on their horses all of them pressing ahead' When the queen heard this she sent for big cups and the officials in attendance quickly fetched some parrotshaped goblets cormorant ladles golden baskets silver beakers glass chargers crystal dishes immortals' bowls and amber goblets
Ambrosial liquor was now served out and everybody drank of it Sanzang then bowed rose to his feet put his hands together in front of his chest and said to the queen Your Majesty I am very grateful for this sumptuous banquet We have had enough now
Could you now go to the throne hall and return the passport so that I may see the three of them off from the city tomorrow morning Doing as he asked the queen led Sanzang by the hand as they ended the banquet and climbed the steps to the throne hall where she invited the Tang Priest to sit on the throne
No he said it would be wrong
As Your Majesty's tutor said a new ecliptic begins tomorrow only then will I dare to take the throne
Today the passport must be stamped so that they can be sent on their way The queen accepted his suggestions sat on the dragon throne again had a gilt chair placed to the left of it for Sanzang to sit on and told the disciples to bring the passport
The Great Sage asked Friar Sand to open the cloth wrapper and take it out then offered it with both hands to the queen who examined it carefully
At the top were nine stamps from the Great Tang emperor's seals and underneath were the seals of the countries of Elephantia Wuji and Tarrycart
When she had looked at them the queen said with a delightful tinkling smile in her voice Is your surname Chen emperor's brother My lay surname was Chen he replied and my religious name is Xuanzang
It was when the Tang emperor in his wisdom and mercy took me as his younger brother that he granted me the surname Tang Why do your illustrious disciples' names not appear on the passport the queen asked
Journey to the West My three stupid disciples are not men of Tang Sanzang replied
But if they are not from Tang why have they come here with you the queen asked again
My senior disciple Sanzang answered was originally from the country of Aolai in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body
My second disciple is from Gao Village in Stubet in the Western Continent of Cattlegift
My third disciple is from the Flowing Sands River They were all punished for offences against the laws of Heaven until the Bodhisattva Guanyin delivered them from their sufferings Since then they have been converted to the faith and have volunteered to escort me on my journey to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven to redeem their past crimes
I won each of them during the journey which is why their religious names have not been entered on the passport Would you like me to add their names to it said the queen
If that is Your Majesty's pleasure Sanzang replied
The queen then sent for brush and inkstone and when she had rubbed the inkstick on the stone to produce a thick and fragrant ink with which she filled the hairs of her writing brush she wrote the names of the three disciplesSun Wukong Zhu Wuneng and Sha Wujingat the bottom of the passport
Then she stamped it fair and square with her royal seal wrote her signature and handed it down to Monkey who told Friar Sand to wrap it up again carefully
The queen then presented them with a dish of small pieces of gold and silver came down from her throne and said to Monkey You three must take this to help with the costs of your journey and go to the Western Heaven as quickly as you can
When you come back with the scriptures we shall richly reward you again We are men of religion said Brother Monkey and we do not accept gold and silver
There will be places along the way for us to beg food from Seeing that they were not going to accept it the queen had ten bolts of damask and brocade brought out that she gave to Monkey with the words You are in such a hurry that we do not have time for this to be made up
Please take this to have some clothes made on the journey to keep you warm We monks may not wear damask or brocade Monkey said
We are only allowed to cover ourselves with cotton cloth Seeing that he would not accept the silk either the queen ordered that three pints of rice be brought out to provide them with a meal on their journey
The moment Pig heard the word rice he took it and put it with the bundles of luggage
Brother Monkey said to him the luggage is very heavy now
Will you be able to carry the rice as well You wouldn't know that rice is best eaten the same day it's cooked Pig replied
One meal and it'll be finished He then put his hands together in thanks May I trouble Your Majesty to come with me while I escort my disciples out of the city Sanzang asked When I have given them some parting instructions about their journey West I shall come back to enjoy perpetual glory with Your Majesty
Only when I am freed from these cares and worries will we be able to join together like a pair of phoenixes Not realizing that this was a trick the queen sent for her coach and climbed into it leaning her fragrant shoulder against Sanzang as they rode Westwards out of the city
Bowls has been filled with clean water and fine incense put in all the burners This was because the people were seeing their queen in her carriage and also because they were seeing a man the emperor's younger brother
All of them young and old alike were women with powdered and lovely faces and greenblack hair piled high in cloud coiffures
The coach was soon out of the town and outside the Western gate
Monkey Pig and Friar Sand joined in a common cause neatened up their clothes and went to meet the carriage There is no need to escort us a long way Your Majesty
We shall take our leave of you here Journey to the West Sanzang stepped down from the royal carriage raised his hands together to the queen and said Please go back now Your Majesty and allow me to fetch the scriptures When the queen heard this her face went pale with shock
She grabbed hold of the Tang Priest and said Dear emperor's brother I have offered you the wealth of my realm to become my husband Tomorrow you are going to take the throne as monarch and I am going to be your consort We have already eaten the wedding feast How can you go back on your word now This was too much for Pig who went wild
Thrusting his snout about and waving his ears he rushed to the royal coach shouting What would monks like us want to marry a powdered skeleton like you for
Let my master go This rough and violent behavior so frightened the queen that her souls all went flying and she collapsed in the coach
Friar Sand pulled Sanzang out of the crowd and helped him mount the horse
Just then a woman shot forward from the roadside shouting Don't go Tang emperor's brother
You and I are going to make love You ignorant wicked creature Friar Sand shouted at her striking at her head with his staff
The woman then made a whirlwind that carried the Tang Priest off with a great roar He had disappeared without shadow or trace
Indeed He escaped from the net of beauties To encounter a lecherous ogress
If you don't know whether the woman was a human being or a monster or whether the master lived or died then listen to the explanation in the next installment
The Tang Priest Is Tempted with Sex and Debauchery Because His Nature Is Upright He Resists Unharmed The story tells how the Great Sage and Pig were just about to use their magic to immobilize all the women when they suddenly heard the noise of a wind Friar Sand who was shouting looked round at once to find the Tang Priest gone
Who's taken the master Monkey asked
A woman made a whirlwind and carried him off in it Friar Sand reported
At this news Monkey jumped up with a whoosh to stand on his cloud and shade his eyes as he looked all around
He saw the gray dust cloud of a whirlwind that was heading Northwest
Brothers he turned back to shout come straight up on your clouds
We're going after the master Pig and Friar Sand tied the luggage on the horse and both sprang noisily into the air
All this gave such a fright to the queen of Western Liang and her subjects that they fell to their knees in the dust and said He is an arhat who has flown away in broad daylight Do not be alarmed Your Majesty
The Journey to the West Tang emperor's brother is a dhyana monk who has mastered the Way We were too blind to see who this man of China really was and we allowed ourselves all that longing for nothing
Please ride back to the palace in your carriage Your Majesty The queen felt ashamed as she went back into her capital with her officials and we shall say no more of them
Monkey and the other two disciples meanwhile were riding their clouds through the air after the whirlwind
They chased it to a high mountain where the gray dust settled and the wind fell so that they did not know which way the demon had gone
The brothers brought their clouds down to land to search for the way Suddenly they noticed a gleaming rock shaped like a screen
Leading the horse round behind it they found a pair of stone doors above which was written
DEADLY FOE MOUNTAIN PIPA CAVE In his ignorance Pig went up to the doors and was about to beat on them with his rake when Monkey rushed forward to stop him
Don't be in such a hurry brother he said
After following the whirlwind we had to look around for a while before we found these doors We don't know what's behind them If they're the wrong doors we'd stir up trouble offending the wrong people and we don't want to do that
You two take the horse round to the front of the rock screen and wait a moment I'm going to take a look around and find out what's happening here Then it'll be much easier to know what to do Friar Sand liked this idea
Splendid splendid he said You've found the subtle solution when things were looking rough the calm way out of the crisis The two of them then led the horse to the other side of the rock screen Monkey then showed his magic powers
Making a spell with his hands and saying the words he shook himself and turned into an exquisite bee
Just look at him Fine wings bending in the wind A narrow waist gleaming with the sun
With his sweet mouth he searched for stamens While the sting in his tail killed toads
Great was his achievement in making honey And he always entered the hive with courtesy
Now be would use a brilliant plan As he flew in under the eaves of the doorway
Monkey squeezed in through the crack between the outer doors then past the inner doors to see a female monster sitting in a flower pavilion with serving girls in brightlycoloured embroidered clothes and their hair sticking upwards in two bunches They were all very pleased but he could not hear what they were talking about Monkey flew up to them very quietly perched on the lattice of the pavilion and cocked his ear to Journey to the West listen
He saw two women with their tangled hair tied in a bun carrying two piping hot dishes of food to the pavilion and saying Madam this dish has steamed rolls with human flesh in them and that one has vegetarian ones with sweet beanpaste fillings Little ones said the shedevil with a smile Bring the Tang emperor's brother out Some of the serving girls in embroidered clothes went to the room at the back to help the Tang Priest out
His face was sallow his lips white and his eyes red as the tears streamed down his face The master's been drugged thought Monkey with a silent sigh
The shedevil went down from the pavilion and showed her ten fingers that were as delicate as spring onions as she grabbed hold of Sanzang and said Don't worry emperor's brother
This may not be as rich and splendid as the palace in the Womanland of Western Liang but it's peaceful and comfortable and an ideal place for reciting the Buddha's name and reading the scriptures
With me as your companion we'll be able to live in harmony till we're a hundred Sanzang said nothing
Don't be upset the shedevil said
I know that you had nothing to eat or to drink at your banquet in Womanland
Here are two dishes one of meat and one of vegetarian food Won't you take some to calm your nerves Sanzang thought deeply If I say nothing and eat nothing this shedevil may murder me She is worse than the queen who was at least human and knew how to behave
What am I to do My disciples don't know that I'm a prisoner here
If I let her murder me I'll be throwing my life away for nothing Though he racked his brains he could find no other plan so he pulled himself together and asked What is the meat dish and what is the vegetarian one The meat one is steamed rolls stuffed with human flesh and the vegetarian one steamed rolls with sweet fillings the shedevil replied
I would like some of the vegetarian ones said Sanzang
Servant girls said the shedevil bring hot tea and give your master some vegetarian steamed rolls A servant girl then brought in a tray of tea that she set before the Tang Priest
The shedevil broke a vegetarian roll open and handed it to Sanzang who offered a whole meat one to her
Why won't you open it for me emperor's brother the shedevil asked with a smile
I am a man of religion so I would not dare to break meat food said Sanzang
In that case said the shedevil Why did you eat wedding cake at the Motherhood River and why are you insisting on eating beanpaste now To this Sanzang replied When the river is high I'm carried away
When bogged down I have to slow down Journey to the West Monkey who could hear from his perch in the lattice just how friendly their conversation was getting started worrying that the master's true nature might become disturbed
It was more than he could bear so he resumed his own appearance and brandished his cudgel with a shout of Behave yourself you evil beast When the shedevil saw him she spat out smoke and light that covered the pavilion and told her underlings to shut the Tang Priest away
Then she seized her steel trident and leapt out through the door of the pavilion shouting abusively Hooligan ape
How dare you sneak into my house to set your dirty eyes on me
Stay where you are and take this The Great Sage parried the lunge from her trident and fell back fighting all the way
When they came to the outside of the cave where Pig and Friar Sand were waiting the sight of the hardfought battle so alarmed Pig that he led the white horse over to Friar Sand and said Look after the horse and the luggage
I'm joining in The splendid idiot then raised his rake with both hands and rushed forward with a shout Stand back brother while I kill this vicious beast Seeing Pig coming the shedevil used another kind of magic to breathe fire out of her nose and smoke from her mouth as she shook herself and charged him with her trident flying and dancing
Goodness only knows how many hands she had as she somersaulted towards them lashing out furiously
Monkey and Pig were both fought to a standstill
Sun Wukong said the shedevil you don't know when to keep your head down
I know who you are but you don't recognize me
Even your Tathagata Buddha from the Thunder Monastery is afraid of me
Where do you think you two little wretches are going to get
Come here all of you and watch me beat every one of you It was a fine battle Great was the shedevil's prowess As the Monkey King's anger rose
Then Marshal Tian Peng joined in the fight Showing off wildly wielding his rake
One was a manyhanded mistress of the trident Surrounding herself with smoke and with light The other two were impatient and their weapons powerful As they stirred up many a cloud of mist
The shedevil was fighting to win a mate But the monk would never lose his vital seed
Illmatched male and female fought it out Each showing heroism in the bitter struggle
Calmly the female had built up her strength longing for action Journey to the West The male was on guard in his love of pure stillness
This made peace between them impossible As trident fought for mastery with cudgel and rake
Powerful was the cudgel Even stronger the rake But the shedevil's trident was a match for them both
Nobody would yield on Deadly Foe Mountain No mercy was given outside Pipa Cave
One was happy at the thought of the Tang Priest as a husband The other two were going with him to collect the scriptures
Heaven and earth were alarmed by the battle Which darkened sun and moon and displaced all the stars
When the three of them had been fighting for a long time without anyone emerging as victor the shedevil shook herself and used the sting in her tail to jab the Great Sage in the head
Monkey yelled in agony at the unbearable pain and fled defeated
Seeing that things were going badly Pig withdrew too dragging his rake behind him
The victorious shedevil put her steel trident away
Monkey had his hands round his head and his face screwed up in agony as he shouted It's terrible it's terrible Brother said Pig going up to him why did you run away howling in pain just when you were fighting so well It's agony agony groaned Brother Monkey still holding his head
Is it an attack of your migraine Pig asked
No no said Monkey hopping around in pain
But I didn't see you get wounded said Pig so how can your head be hurting It's unbearable groaned Monkey
Just when she saw that I was beginning to beat her trident she braced herself and jabbed me in the head
I don't know what weapon she used but it's made my head ache so unbearably that I had to run away beaten In quiet places you're always boasting that your head was tempered in the furnace said Pig with a laugh so why was that too much for you Journey to the West Yes replied Monkey after my head was refined I stole the magic peaches and immortal wine and Lord Lao Zi's golden elixir tablets
When I made havoc in Heaven the Jade Emperor ordered the Strongarm Demon King and the Twenty eight Constellations to take me to be beheaded at the Dipper and Bull Palace The gods used their cutlasses axes hammers and swords on me struck me with thunderbolts and burned me with fire
Then Lao Zi put me in his Eight Trigrams Furnace and refined me for fortynine days None of that harmed me at all
Goodness only knows what weapon that woman used to make my head hurt like this Put your hands down and let me have a look said Friar Sand
Has it been cut open No no said Monkey
I'd better go back to Western Liang to get you some ointment to put on it said Pig
It's not cut open or swollen I don't need ointment said Monkey
Brother laughed Pig I wasn't at all ill when I was pregnant or after I lost the baby but you've got a carbuncle on your forehead Stop teasing him brother said Friar Sand
It's getting late our eldest brother's been wounded in the head and we don't know whether the master is dead or alive What on earth are we going to do The master's all right groaned Brother Monkey
I flew in as a bee and saw the woman sitting in a flower pavilion
Before long two servant girls came in with two dishes of steamed rolls one with fillings of human flesh and one with sweet fillings of beanpaste
She sent two other serving girls to help the master come out to eat something to soothe his nerves She was talking about being his companion
At first he wouldn't reply or eat any of the rolls but she was giving him so much sweet talk that he said he'd have a vegetarian one Goodness knows why
The woman broke one open and gave it to him and he passed her an unbroken meat one
'Why won't you open it for me' She asked and he said 'I am a man of religion so I would not dare to break meat food' Then she said 'In that case why did you eat wedding cake at the Motherhood River and why are you eating sweet fillings now' The master did not catch what she was driving at and replied 'When the river is high I'm carried away when bogged down I have to slow down' Listening to all this from the lattice I got worried that the master was going to forget himself so I turned back into myself and hit at her with my cudgel
She used magic too breathed out clouds told them to shut the master away and drove me out of the cave with her trident Friar Sand bit his finger and said That low bitch must have followed us at some stage she knows so much From what you say said Pig we mustn't rest
From dusk to the middle of the night we've got to keep going back and challenging her to fight We'll have to yell and make such a din that she can't go to bed or have it off with our master I can't go back said Monkey
My head's hurting too badly We can't challenge her to battle said Friar Sand
Our eldest brother's head is aching and our master is a true monk He won't let the illusion of sex disturb his nature
Let's spend the light sitting somewhere under the mountain that's sheltered from the wind
Then we can build up our energy and think of something else in the morning The three brother disciples tethered the white horse and guarded the luggage as they spent the night resting under the slope of the mountain
Journey to the West The shedevil then put aside thoughts of murder and started to wear a mile again as she said Little ones shut the front and back doors tight Then she sent out two scouts to keep an eye on Monkey and ordered them to report the moment any sound was heard at the door
Maids she commanded tidy the bedroom and get it ready Bring candles burn incense and ask the Tang emperor's brother in
I'm going to make love with him The Tang Priest was then helped out from the back while the shedevil looking utterly bewitching took him by the hand and said As the saying goes pleasure's worth more than gold
You and I are going to have some fun as man and wife The venerable elder clenched his teeth and let out not a sound
He would have preferred not to go with her but he was afraid she might kill him so in fear and trembling he accompanied her into the bridal chamber he was as if stupefied and dumb
He would not lift his head and look up let alone catch sight of the bed and the curtains in the room and even less did he see the intricately carved furniture or her hairstyle and clothing
He was deaf and indifferent when she spoke of her desire
He was indeed a fine monk His eyes saw no evil beauty His ears heard no voluptuous words
To him the brocade and the lovely face was dung The gold the jewels and the beauty so much dirt
The love of his life was contemplation He never took a step from Buddha land
He did not care for female charms Knowing only how to nourish his true nature
The shedevil Was full of life And unbounded desire
The venerable monk Seemed almost dead His mind fixed on meditation
One was soft jade and warm fragrance The other was dead ash and withered wood
One spread open the bridal sheets Journey to the West Full of voluptuousness The other fastened his tunic more tightly His heart ever true
One longed to press her breasts against him and entwine their limbs In rapturous union The other wanted only to sit facing the wall Like the monk Bodhidharma
The shedevil took off her clothes Displaying her smooth skin and fragrant body The Tang Priest pulled his robes together Covering the roughness of his hide and flesh
The shedevil said There is room on my pillow and under my sheet
Why not come to bed The Tang Priest replied My head is shaven and I wear monk's robes
I may not join you She said I would like to be Liu Cuicui in the story He replied But I am not like the Monk of the Moonlight The shedevil said I am more lovely than Xi Shi herself Long was the king of Yue buried on her account the monk replied
Do you remember the lines the shedevil asked 'I'm willing to die and be buried under flowers Even as a ghost shall I live and love' To this the Tang Priest replied My true masculinity is my great treasure Journey to the West I could not lightly give it to a bag of bones like you The two of them kept up their battle of words till it was late in the night and the Tang Priest's resolution was unmoved
The shedevil kept tugging at his clothes refusing to let go of him while the master kept up his resistance
The struggle went on till the middle of the night when the shedevil finally lost her temper and called Bring rope little ones Sadly she had her beloved man tied up like a dog and dragged outside to the portico
Then the silver lamps were blown out and everyone went to bed for the night
Before they knew it the cocks had crowed three times
On the mountainside the Great Sage Monkey leaned forward and said This head of mine ached for a while but now it doesn't hurt or feel numb
It's just a bit itchy If it's itchy then what about letting her jab it again for you said Pig with a grin
We've got to make her let him go said Monkey spitting 'Let him go let him go' mocked Pig
I bet our master spent last night having a go Stop arguing you two said Friar Sand It's light now
We've got to capture that demon as quickly as we can Brother said Monkey you stay here and look after the horse Don't move
Pig come with me The idiot braced himself tightened the belt round his black cotton tunic and went with Monkey as each of them leapt up to the top of the car and arrived beneath the stone screen weapon in hand
You stand here said Monkey
I'm afraid that the shedevil may have harmed the master during the night so wait while I go in and find out
If he was seduced by her into losing his primal masculinity and ruining his virtue then we'll all split up
But if he kept his spirit firm and his dhyana heart was unmoved we'll have to hold out till we've killed the shedevil and rescued the master Then we can head West Idiot said Pig
As the saying goes can a dried fish be a cat's pillow
Even if she didn't succeed she'll have had a good grab at him Stop talking such nonsense said Monkey
I'm going to have a look The splendid Great Sage took his leave of Pig and went round the rock screen
Then he shook himself turned back into a bee and flew inside where he saw two serving girls sound asleep with their heads pillowed on their watchkeepers' clappers and gongs
When he reached the flower pavilion he found that the devils were still asleep exhausted after being up half the night and not aware that it was dawn
Monkey then flew on to the back of the cave where he could half hear Sanzang's voice
He looked up to see the master with his hands and feet all roped together under the portico
Landing lightly on Sanzang's head he said Master Recognizing his voice Sanzang said Is that you Wukong
Rescue me Did you have a good time last night Monkey asked
I would have died first Sanzang replied through clenched teeth
Journey to the West Yesterday it looked to me that she was in love with you Monkey continued so why has she been torturing you like this She pestered me for half the night Sanzang replied but I never undid my clothes or even touched the bed
She only tied me up and left me here when she saw that I was not going to give in to her
Whatever happens you must rescue me so that I can go and fetch the scriptures By now their conversation had woken the shedevil up
Ferocious though she was she still could not bear to lose Sanzang
As she woke up and sat up she heard him saying fetch the scriptures rolled straight out of bed and shrieked What do you want to go and fetch scriptures for instead of being my husband This alarmed Monkey who left the master spread his wings flew out turned back into himself and shouted for Pig
The idiot came round the stone screen and asked Well
Did it happen No laughed Monkey it didn't
She kept pawing him but he wouldn't go along with her so she lost her temper and tied him up
Just when he was telling me what had happened the fiend woke up and I had to rush out in a panic What did the master say Pig asked
He told me that he never undid his clothes Monkey replied and never even touched the bed That's wonderful said Pig He's a true monk
Let's go and save him The idiot was too crude to bother with arguing he lifted his rake and brought it down with all his might against the doors smashing them to pieces
This gave the serving girls who were asleep with their heads pillowed on their watchkeepers' clappers and gongs such a fright that they ran to the inner doors shouting Open up
The two ugly men who came here last night have smashed the front doors down The shedevil was just coming out of her bedroom when four or five serving girls came rushing in to report Madam the two ugly men who were here yesterday have come back and smashed the front doors down On hearing this the shedevil ordered Little ones boil water at once for me to wash and comb my hair Then she told them Carry the emperor's brother roped up as he is and lock him up in the back room
I'm going out to fight them Out went the splendid monster brandishing her trident and shouting abusively Vicious ape
Dirty hog
Ignorant beast
How dare you come knocking down my doors Filthy whore Pig retaliated you tie our master up and then you have the nerve to talk tough like that
You tried to seduce our master into being your husband Give him back now and we'll spare your life
If there's so much as a hint of a 'no' from you this rake of mine will smash your whole mountain down The demon did not allow any more argument but summoned up her spirits and used the same magic as before to breathe out smoke and fire as she thrust at Pig with her steel trident
Swerving aside to avoid the blow Pig struck back with his rake
When Monkey joined in to help him with his cudgel the shedevil used more magic to give herself endless pairs of hands with which to parry their weapons to left and to right
When they had fought four or five rounds the mystery weapon jabbed Pig in the lip making him flee for his life dragging his rake behind him and pressing a hand to his mouth
Monkey who was also rather scared of her feinted with his cudgel and fled in defeat too
The shedevil went back into her cave in victory telling her underlings to build up a temporary outer barrier with rocks
Journey to the West Friar Sand heard piggish groans as he was pasturing the horse and looked up to see Pig coming towards him with his hand on his face and moaning
What's up Friar Sand asked
It's terrible terrible the idiot groaned the pain the pain He was still complaining when Monkey turned up too saying with a grin Idiot
Yesterday you wished me a carbuncle on my forehead and today you've got one on your lip I can't bear it groaned Pig it's agony it's excruciating Just as the three of them were at a loss as to what to do an old woman came by with a green bamboo basket carrying wild vegetables from the hills to the South
Brother said Friar Sand to Monkey that woman's coming this way
I'll ask her who this evil spirit is and what weapon she has that causes such terrible wounds You stay here while I go and ask her Monkey said and taking a quick look he saw that there was a halo of auspicious cloud directly above the old woman's head and that fragrant mists were all around her
Recognizing who it was Monkey called out Come and kowtow brothers
This lady is the Bodhisattva This so surprised them that Pig kowtowed despite his pain Friar Sand bowed low as he held the horse and Monkey fell to his knees and called I submit to The Merciful and Compassionate Deliverer from Suffering the Miraculously Responding Bodhisattva Guanyin Seeing that they had recognized her the Bodhisattva rose up into midair on her auspicious cloud and appeared in her true form as the carrier of the fish basket
Going up into the sky with her Monkey kowtowed and reported Bodhisattva please forgive your disciple for failing to come to meet you
Because we were so busy trying to save the master we did not realize that you had come to see us
We are now up against a monster we can't beat and we beseech you Bodhisattva to help us She is indeed a very terrible monster the Bodhisattva replied
Her trident is really the two claws she was born with and what causes such agonizing wounds is a sting in her tail called 'horsekiller poison'
She was originally a scorpion spirit who used to listen to the Buddha preaching the scriptures on the Thunder Monastery When the Tathagata Buddha saw her and mistakenly tried to push her away with his hand she used her tail to sting him on his left thumb
The Buddha in his pain told one of the vajrapanis to arrest her and she is now here
You will have to ask someone else for help as I too have to keep my distance from her Monkey then bowed again and said I beg the Bodhisattva for further instructions
Please tell your disciple whom I should go to see to ask for help Go to the Palace of Light inside the Eastern Gate of Heaven and look for the Star Officer of the Pleiades
He will be able to subdue her Having spoken she turned into a beam of golden light and went straight back to the Southern Ocean
The Great Sage Monkey then brought down his cloud and said to Pig and Friar Sand Don't worry brothers
Our master has a star to save him Where Friar Sand asked
The Bodhisattva has just told me to ask the help of the Star Officer of the Pleiades Monkey said
I'm off Brother groaned Pig his hand still on his mouth please ask the star lord for some ointment to stop this pain Journey to the West You don't need any ointment laughed Monkey
After a night's pain it'll get better just as mine did last night Stop all that talk said Friar Sand and get there as fast as you can The splendid Monkey set off at once on his somersault cloud and was outside the Eastern Gate of Heaven in an instant
The Heavenly King Virudhaka suddenly appeared to greet him courteously and ask Where are you going Great Sage I want to go to the Palace of Light to see the Star Lord of the Pleiades because the Tang Priest I'm escorting to the West to fetch the scriptures is being pestered by a devil Monkey said
Then the four marshals Tao Zhang Xin and Deng appeared to ask Monkey where he was going
I'm looking for the Star Officer of the Pleiades to subdue a demon and rescue my master he said
To this they answered The star officer has gone on an inspection to the Starviewing Tower today at the Jade Emperor's command Is that true Monkey asked
We left the Dipper and Bull Palace with him Heavenly Lord Xin said and we would not dare lie about it He has been gone for a long time Heavenly Lord Tao said so he may be back by now
Great Sage you would do best to go to the Palace of Light first and if he is not back go on to the Starviewing Tower This delighted the Great Sage who took his leave of them and went to the gate of the Palace of Light
Finding that the star officer was indeed not there he was just about to leave when he noticed a column of soldiers outside
Behind them was the star lord returning in his court dress sewn with golden thread
This is how he looked The Five Peak pins in his hat gleamed gold The mountain and river tablet he held was of the finest jade
The Seven Stars hung from his waist amid clouds and mist Bright were the rings of jade on his Eightpole sash
His pendants chimed with a rhythmical sound The wind rushing past made a noise like bells
The Star Officer of the Pleiades came holding his kingfisher fan While clouds of heavenly incense filled the hall
Journey to the West When the soldiers in the front ranks saw Monkey standing outside the Palace of Light they hurried back to report My lord the Great Sage Sun is here The star officer put away his clouds and tidied his court dress then when the attendants carrying his insignia of office stood aside to left and right he stepped forward to greet Monkey courteously and ask Why are you here Great Sage I have come especially to pay my respects and beg you to rescue my master from disaster Brother Monkey replied
What disaster and where the star officer asked
He is in the Pipa Cave on Deadly Foe Mountain in Western Liang Monkey replied
What evil monster is there in the cave that you should need to send for me asked the star officer
The Bodhisattva Guanyin appeared to us just now Monkey said and told us that she is a scorpion spirit She specially mentioned you sir as the only person who would be able to control her
That is why I have come here to ask your help I would have preferred to submit a memorial to the Jade Emperor the star officer replied but as you have come here Great Sage and as I am much obliged to the Bodhisattva for recommending me I would not like to lose any more time Excuse me if I don't offer you tea let's go down to subdue the demon
I can report back to His Majesty on my return At that the Great Sage went out with the star officer through the Eastern Gate of Heaven and straight back to Western Liang Seeing Deadly Foe Mountain not far off Monkey Pointed to it and said That's the mountain The star lord brought his cloud down and went with Monkey to the slope in front of the stone screen
Get up brother said Friar Sand to Pig on seeing them
Brother Monkey is back with the star officer Forgive me said the idiot his hand still pressed over his mouth forgive me but I'm too ill to pay you all the courtesies But you are one who cultivates his conduct the star lord said
How can you be ill The shedevil jabbed me in the lip when I was fighting her Pig replied and it still hurts Come here said the star lord and I'll cure it for you Only then did the idiot put his hands down as he groaned Please please cure it for me
I'll pay you well when it's better The star lord then touched his lip and blew on it at which the pain stopped
A delighted Pig went down on his knees and kowtowed to the star lord
Wonderful wonderful he said
Will you touch my head too asked Monkey with a smile Why the star lord asked
You weren't jabbed with the poison I was yesterday said Monkey and it only stopped hurting after last night
It's still rather numb and itchy and may be bad again when the weather turns overcast which is why I would like you to cure it The star officer then touched and blew on his head too thus removing the remaining poison and stopping the numbness and itching
Journey to the West Brother said a wrathful Pig let's go and fight that vicious creature Yes yes the star lord said you two call her out so that I can put her in her place Monkey and Pig leapt up the slope and went round the stone screen once more
Yelling insults the idiot used his hands like picks and hit with his rake to clear a way through the wall of stones that had been built outside the mouth of the cave
Once through these outer defenses he struck again with his rake to smash the inner doors to sawdust giving the little devils behind them such a shock that they ran inside to report Madam those two hideous men have smashed the inner doors now The shedevil had just had the Tang Priest untied and sent for some vegetarian breakfast for him when she heard the inner doors being smashed
Leaping out of her flower pavilion she thrust at Pig with her trident
He parried with his rake while Monkey joined in the fight from the side
The shedevil went right up to them and was just going to use her vicious trick when the two of them who now knew what she was about turned and fled
As soon as the two of them were round the rock Monkey shorted Where are you star lord The star lord stood up at once on the mountainside in his original form as a giant rooster with twin combs When he raised his head he was six or seven feet tall and as soon as he crowed the monster reverted to her true appearance as a scorpion spirit the size of a pipa mandolin
When the star officer crowed again the monster's whole body crumbled in death
There is a poem as evidence that goes With fancy combs and a tasseled neck Hard claws long spurs and angry eyes Nobly he leaps complete in all his powers Towering majestic as three times he cries
He is no common fowl who by a cottage crows But a star down from the sky in all his glory
Vainly the vicious scorpion took a human form Revealed now as herself she ends her story
Pig went forward and said one foot planted on the monster's back Evil beast You won't be able to use your horsekiller poison this time The monster did not move whereupon the idiot pounded her to mincemeat with his rake
The star lord gathered his golden light around him once more and rode away on his cloud
Monkey Pig and Friar Sand all raised their clasped hands to Heaven in thanks We have put you to much trouble they said
We shall go to your palace to thank you another day When the three of them had finished expressing their gratitude they bot the luggage and the horse ready and went into the cave where the young and old serving girls were kneeling on either side saying My lords we Journey to the West are not evil spirits but women from Western Liang who were carried off by the evil spirit
Your master is sitting in the scented room at the back crying On hearing this Monkey took a very careful look around and seeing that there were indeed no more devilish vapors he went round to the back and called Master The Tang Priest was very pleased indeed to see them all there
Good disciples he said I have put you to such a lot of trouble
What has happened to that woman That damned female was really a scorpion said Pig
Luckily the Bodhisattva Guanyin told us what to do Brother Monkey went to the palaces of Heaven to ask the Star Lord of the Pleiades to come down and defeat the demon I've beaten her to pulp
That's why we dared to come right inside to see you Master The Tang Priest thanked them deeply
They then looked for some meatfree rice and noodles and laid on a meal for themselves that they ate
The kidnapped women were all taken down the mountain and shown the way back home
Then they lit a firebrand and burned down all the buildings there before helping the Tang Priest back on his horse and continuing along the main road West
Indeed They cut themselves off from worldly connections Turning away from the lures of desire By pushing right back the ocean of gold In their minds and their hearts their awareness was higher
If you don't know how many years were to pass before they finally won their true achievement listen to the explanation in the next installment
The Spirit Goes Wild and Wipes Out the Bandits The Way in Confusion Sends the MindApe Away As the poem goes The heart that is empty of all things is said to be pure In utter placidity not giving rise to a thought
The ape and the horse must be tethered not left to run wild The spirit must always be cautious not seeking for glory
Journey to the West Wake up to Three Vehicles wipe out the Six Bandits And all human destinies then become clear
Extinguish the evil of sex and rise to enjoy The pleasures of paradise that can be found in the West
The story tells how Tang Sanzang bit on the bullet straggled with all his powers to preserve the purity of his body and was rescued from the Pipa Cave when Monkey and the others killed the scorpion spirit
There is nothing to tell about the next stage of their journey and it was soon summer again
What they saw was Fragrant winds carrying the scent of wild orchids New bamboo cool as the skies clear after rain No travelers to pick artemisia on the hillside And the fragrant flowers of cattails filling the streams
Bees are bewitched by pomegranates' beauty While siskins delight in the willow trees' shade How can the wayfarers offer dumplings to Qu Yuan
Dragon boats should be mourning his death in the river
Master and disciples were just enjoying the early summer scenery as they spent the day of the Dragonboat Festival without being able to celebrate it when a high mountain rose in front of them to block their way forward Sanzang reined in his horse and turned back to say Be careful Wukong
I'm worried that there may be demons on that mountain ahead Don't worry Master said Brother Monkey We are all faithful believers
I'm not scared of demons This reply pleased the venerable elder greatly who Whipped on his noble charger Gave the dragon steed his head
Journey to the West Before long they were above a rockface on the mountain and when they raised their heads to look around this is what they saw Cypress and pine that touch the azure heavens Creepers climbing up hazels on the cliffs
A hundred thousand feet high A thousand sheercut strata
A hundred thousand feet high are the towering pinnacles A thousand sheercut strata of the chasm's sides
Mosses and liverwort cover damp rocks Locust and juniper form a great forest
Deep in the forest Birds are heard unseen Singing their songs with beautiful voices
The water in the brook is a torrent of jade The fallen blooms by the path are piles of gold
The mountain is steep The going is hard And hardly a pace is on level ground
Foxes and David's deer come in twos White stage and black gibbons greet one in pairs
The bowl of the tiger fills one with terror The call of the crane resounds through the sky
Plum and red apricot provide one with food No names can be put to the many wild flowers
Journey to the West After climbing the mountain slowly for a long time the four of them crossed the summit and on the Western slopes they saw a stretch of level sunlit ground
Pig put on a great show of energy telling Friar Sand to carry the luggage while he raised his rake in both hands and tried to drive the horse ahead
But the horse was not afraid of him and carried on at the same slow pace despite all the noises he made to speed it up
Why are you trying to make the horse go faster brother Monkey asked
Let it walk slowly at its own speed It's getting late Pig replied and I'm hungry after that day on the mountain
We'd better get a move on and find a house to beg some food from In that case let me speed him up said Monkey waving his goldbanded cudgel and shouting at which the horse slipped its halter and started to gallop along the track with the speed of an arrow
Do you wonder why the horse was afraid of Monkey but not of Pig
It was because five hundred years earlier Monkey had been given a post in the Imperial Stables in the Daluo Heaven as Protector of the Horses the name has been passed on right till the present day which is why all horses are still afraid of monkeys The venerable elder could not keep hold of the reins
he simply held tight to the saddle and gave the horse its head as it galloped six or seven miles towards some farm land before slowing down to a walk
As Sanzang was riding along he heard a gong being struck as over thirty men armed with spears swords and staves emerged from both sides of the track to block his way and say Where do you think you're going monk This made the Tang Priest shake with fright so badly that he lost his seat and fell off the horse
Spare my life Your Majesty he pleaded as he squatted in the undergrowth by the path Spare my life The two chiefs of the gang then said We're not going to kill you
Just give us your money Only then did the venerable elder realize that they were bandits
As he raised his head to look at them this is what he saw One's blue face and protruding fangs were worse than an evil god's The other's bulging eyes were like the Star of Death
The red hair at their temples seemed ablaze Their brownish bristles were as sharp as needles
Both wore berets of tiger skin And kilts of marten fur
One carried a cudgel with wolftooth spikes The other a rope of knotted rattan
They were no less terrible than mountain tigers And just as frightening as dragons from the waters
Journey to the West On seeing how murderous they looked Sanzang could only rise to his feet put his hands together before his chest and say Your Majesties I have been sent by the Tang emperor in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven
It has been many years since I left Chang'an and all my travelling money was finished long ago
We monks may only support ourselves by beggingwe don't have any money I beg you Your Majesties to show charity and allow me to pass The two bandit chiefs led their men forward and said We here are tigers
The only reason we stop travelers on the main roads is to get rich Charity doesn't come into it
If you've got no money take your clothes off and give us that white horse then we'll let you go on your way Amitabha Buddha said Sanzang
This habit of mine was begged piece by piece a bit of cloth from one family and a needle from another
If you take it you will be killing me
If you act as tough guys in this life you'll be reborn as animals in the next One of the bandit chiefs was so infuriated by this remark that he started to wave his cudgel about and went up to Sanzang to strike him
Unable to speak Sanzang could only think Poor man you may think you've got a cudgel
wait till you find out about my disciple's The bandit was in no mood for argument as he raised his cudgel and started to lay about Sanzang
Sanzang who in all his life had never told a lie in this desperate crisis had to make one up now Don't hit me Your Majesties
I have a young disciple following behind me who'll be here soon
He has several ounces of silver that he'll give to you Don't hurt the monk said one of the bandit chiefs
Tie him up The crowd of bandits then fell upon him roped him up and suspended him high from a tree
The three disasterbringing spirits were still following behind
Pig was chuckling aloud as he said The master's been going very fast
I don't know where he's waiting for us Then he saw Sanzang in the tree and said Just look at the master He could have just waited if he'd wanted to but he was in such high spirits he had to climb a tree and make a swing out of creepers Stop talking nonsense said Monkey when he saw what had happened
The master's been hung up there hasn't he
You two wait for a moment while I go up and look around The splendid Great Sage then rushed up the slope to look around and saw the bandits I'm in luck he thought with glee I'm in luck
Business has brought itself to my front door With that he turned round shook himself and turned into a trim little novice of only sixteen wearing a black habit and carrying a bundle wrapped in blue cotton cloth on his shoulder
Then he stepped out until he was by the master and called Master what's been happening
Who are these wicked people Rescue me disciple said Sanzang and stop asking so many questions What's it all about Monkey asked
These highwaymen blocked my way and demanded money Sanzang replied
As I don't have any they hung me up here I'm waiting for you to work something out
If you can't you'll just have to give them the horse You're hopeless Master laughed Monkey
Of all the monks in the world there can be few as soft as you
When the Tang Emperor Taizong sent you to worship the Buddha in the Western Heaven he never told you to give that dragon horse away Journey to the West Whatever was I to do when they hung me up here and were hitting me as they demanded things said Sanzang
What did you say to them Monkey asked
I was so desperate when they beat me that I had no choice I had to tell them about you Sanzang replied
Master said Monkey you're useless
Why ever did you squeal on me I told them that you were carrying some money said Sanzang
I only did it in desperation to stop them beating me Great said Brother Monkey great Thanks for the recommendation That just how to squeal on me
You can do that seventy or eighty times a month if you like and I'll do more business than ever When the bandits saw Monkey talking to his master they spread out to surround them and said Little monk get out the money your master told us you're carrying inside your belt and we'll spare your life
But if you even try to say no you're dead Don't shout gentlemen said Monkey putting his bundle down
I've got some money in here but not muchonly twenty horseshoe ingots of gold and twenty or thirty ingots of frosted silver not counting the smaller pieces
If you want it I'll get the whole packet out as long as you don't hit my master
As the ancient book has it 'Virtue is the root and wealth is only the tip of the branch'
This is just the tip of the branch We men of religion can always find a place to beg
When we meet a benefactor who feeds monks there'll be plenty of money and clothes for us We don't need much at all
As soon as you've let my master down I'll give you it all When the bandits heard this they were delighted and they all said The old monk is stingy but this little monk is very generous
Let him down Now that his life had been spared the venerable elder leapt on the horse and galloped back the way he had come making good use of the whip and not giving Monkey another thought
You've gone the wrong way Monkey called out in alarm then picked up his bundle and started to run after him only to find his way blocked by the bandits Where do you think you're going they asked
Give us your money or we'll have to torture you Now we're on that subject said Monkey we'll have to split the money three ways You're a bit of a rascal aren't you little monk said one of the bandit chiefs
You want to keep something without letting your master know All right then Bring it all out and we'll have a look at it
If there's a lot we'll let you keep a bit to buy fruit with on the side That's not what I mean at all brother said Monkey I haven't got any money
What I mean is that you've got to give me a cut of the gold and silver you two have stolen from other people This infuriated the bandit chief who shouted abusively You're asking for it little monk Wanting ours instead of giving us yours
Stay where you are and take this He lifted his knotted rattan cane and brought it down on Monkey's head six or seven times
Journey to the West Monkey pretended not to notice and his face was wreathed in smiles as he said Brother if you can only hit me like that you could still be hitting me at the end of next spring and you wouldn't really have hit me at all You have a very hard head exclaimed the shocked bandit No no you overpraise me I just get by with it Monkey replied
With that the discussion was cut short as two or three of the bandits rushed at Monkey and started lashing out at him
Keep your tempers gentlemen said Monkey while I get it out The splendid Great Sage then felt in his ear and pulled out an embroidery needle Gentlemen he said we monks really don't carry money with us All I can give you is this needle What lousy luck said one of the bandits
We've let the rich monk go and kept this bald donkey who's not got a penny to his name
I suppose you do tailoring
A needle's no use to us On hearing that they did not want it Monkey held the needle in his hand waved it and turned it into a cudgel as thick as a rice bowl
Young you may be little monk said the terrified bandits but you certainly have some magical powers Monkey then thrust the cudgel into the ground and said If any of you gentlemen can move it it's yours The two bandit chiefs rushed up to grab it but they could no more move it than a dragonfly can move a stone pillar it did not shift a fraction of an inch
How could those bandits have known that the goldbanded AsYouWill cudgel had been weighed on the scales of Heaven at  pounds
Then Monkey stepped forward lifted it effortlessly spun it in a writhing python movement pointed it at the robbers and said You're all out of luck
you've met Monkey The bandit chief rushed at him again and hit him another fifty or sixty times Your hands must be getting tired said Monkey
Let me hit you one now but don't think this is the real thing Watch him as he swings his cudgel shakes it and makes it as thick as the top of a well and seventy or eighty feet long A single blow of it struck one bandit chief to the ground He bit the dust and said no more
You're pretty cheek there baldy said the other bandit chief abusively
You've got no money and now you've killed one of us Just a moment said Monkey with a smile
I'm going to kill every one of you and wipe you all out With another swing of his cudgel he killed the other bandit chief at which all their men threw down their spears and clubs and scattered in terror fleeing for their lives
The Tang Priest galloped Eastwards until Pig and Friar Sand stopped him and asked Where are you going Master
This is the wrong way Disciples said Sanzang reining in his horse go back and tell your brother to be merciful with that cudgel of his and not kill all the bandits Stop here Master said Pig
I'll go The idiot ran straight back along the path shouting at the top of his voice Brother the master says you're not to kill them Have I killed anyone Monkey asked
Journey to the West Where have the bandits all gone said Pig They've all run away apart from the two chiefs
They're asleep here You poxridden pair said Pig addressing them no doubt you had a hard night of it and were so exhausted that you had to choose this of all places to sleep Walking closer to them he went on You're like me
you sleep with your mouths open and dribble It's because I smashed the beancurd out of them with my cudgel said Monkey
But people don't have beancurd in their heads said Pig
I beat their brains out said Monkey
The moment he heard Monkey say that the idiot turned and rushed straight back to say to the Tang Priest He's scattered them Splendid splendid said Sanzang
Which way did they go He hit them so hard he laid them out Pig replied
They can't go anywhere Then what do you mean by scattering them Sanzang asked
He killed them Pig replied If that isn't scattering their band what else is it How did he hit them Sanzang asked
He hit two big holes in their heads said Pig
Open the bundle said Sanzang Take out a few coins and buy some ointment somewhere to put on their wounds You're not being at all sensible Master said Pig
There's only any point in putting ointment on the wounds of people who are still alive
Why put it on gaping holes in people who are already dead Has he really killed them said Sanzang losing his temper and beginning to mutter abusive remarks about monkeys and macaques as he turned the horse round and rode back with Friar Sand and Pig to where the dead men lay covered with gore their heads pointing down the mountainside The sight was too much for the venerable elder
Dig a grave for them with your rake and bury them he told Pig while I say the Burial Sutra for them You're giving the job to the wrong man Master complained Pig
Monkey killed them so Monkey ought to bury them Why make me do the digging Brother Monkey who was already in a very bad mood after being told off by the master shouted at Pig Hooligan
Bury them at once I'll hit you if you waste any more time This so alarmed the idiot that he started digging with his rake
When he was three feet down he came to a layer of stones that the prongs of his rake could not shift so he threw the rake aside and rooted about with his snout
In the softer earth he could get two and a half feet down with one push and five feet with two
He then buried the two bodies and piled up a tombmound above them
Journey to the West Wukong said Sanzang fetch some incense and candles so that I can pray for them and recite sutras You understand nothing Monkey retorted pouting
We're in the middle of the mountains with no village or inn for miles around Where do you expect me to get candles and incense
There's nowhere I could buy them even if I had the money Out of my way ape said Sanzang with fury I am going to scatter earth on the tomb burn incense and pray Sanzang dismounted sadly by the tomb in the wild The holy monk prayed by the desolate grave These were the words of his invocation
I bow to you tough guys and ask you to hear my prayer I am from the land of Tang in the East
At the command of Emperor Taizong I was going to the West to fetch the scriptures when I met you gentlemen here
I do not know what province prefecture and county you came from to form your band in the mountains here
I spoke to you kindly and pleaded earnestly but you paid no heed as you repaid good with wrath
Then you encountered Sun the Novice who killed you with his cudgel
Out of consideration for your bodies left lying in the open I had them buried and a mound piled over them
I broke off some bamboo to serve instead of incense and candles although they give no light they come from a sincere heart
Only stones can I offer in place of food they have no flavor but they are given in honest faith
When you reach the Underworld to lodge your complaint and look for the roots of your misfortune remember that his surname is Sun and mine is Chen they are different
Know who it was who wronged you just as you would know a debtor and do not bring a case against the monk who is going to fetch the scriptures
You've shuffled off all the blame said Pig with a laugh
We two weren't there either when Monkey killed them Sanzang then picked up another pinch of earth and prayed again
Tough guys when you bring your case you must only indict Sun the Novice
It was nothing to do with Pig or Friar Sand When Monkey heard this he could not help laughing as he replied Master you've got no finer feelings at all
Goodness knows what efforts I've been to so that you can fetch your scriptures but now that I've killed those two bandits you tell them to go and bring a case against me
It's true that I did kill them but it was only for you
If you hadn't set out to fetch the scriptures and I hadn't become your disciple I'd never have come here and killed them
I'm damned if I don't invoke them too He took his iron cudgel pounded the grave three times and said Listen to me poxridden bandits You hit me seven or eight times then seven or eight times again you didn't hurt me or even tickle me at all but you did make me lose my temper One misunderstanding led to another and I killed you
You can bring a case against me wherever you likeI'm not scared The Jade Emperor knows me The Heavenly Kings do as I say
Journey to the West The Twentyeight Constellations are afraid of me The Nine Bright Shiners the star lords are scared of me
The city gods of counties and prefectures kneel to me the God of the Eastern Peak Who Is Equal to Heaven is terrified of me
The Ten Kings of the Underworld used to be my servants The Five Fierce Gods were once my juniors
The five Commanders of the Three Worlds and the Officers of the Ten Directions are all my very good friends So go and bring your case wherever you like Hearing Monkey speak in this most unpleasant way was another shock for Sanzang
Disciple he said my prayer was only intended to teach you to spare life and become good and kind Why do you have to take this all so seriously This is not something to fool around with Master Monkey replied
We must find somewhere for the night as soon as we can The master had no choice but to hold in his anger and remount
With the Great Sage Sun feeling disgruntled and Pig and Friar Sand also suffering from jealousy master and disciples were only getting on together on the surface underneath there was hostility
As they carried along their road Westwards a farmhouse came into sight to the North of the track
Pointing at it with the whip Sanzang told them that this was the place where they would find somewhere to spend the night
Very well said Pig and they went up to the farm to look at it
It was a fine sight
Wild flowers on the paths Trees shading the doorways
A mountain stream fell down a distant cliff Wheat and mallows grew in the fields
The reeds moistened by dew were beds for the gulls Poplars in the wind were perches for weary birds
Among blue cypress the pine's green was a rival Red rush competed with knotweed in fragrance
Village dogs barked The cocks crowed at dusk Wellfed cattle and sheep were led back by boys
Under clouds of smoke from the stoves the millet was cooked Now it was evening in the hill farm
Journey to the West As the venerable elder went closer an old man came out through the gateway of the farm noticed Sanzang and greeted him
Where have you come from monk he asked to which Sanzang replied I have been sent from the Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven
As I am passing this way and it is getting late I have come to beg a night's lodging from you benefactor It is a very long way indeed from your distinguished country to here the old man replied with a smile so how did you manage to cross so many rivers and climb so many mountains to get here by yourself I have three disciples who have come with me Sanzang said
Where are they the old man asked
There they are standing by the road said Sanzang
The old man looked up and was so appalled by their hideous faces that on the instant he turned to run back inside only to be held back by Sanzang who said Benefactor I beg you in your mercy to let us spend the night here The old man was shivering barely able to open his mouth shaking his head and waving his arms around as he said Thth ththey're not human
They're eeevil spirits Don't be afraid benefactor said Sanzang putting on a smile They just grew ugly
They're not evil spirits But my lord said the old man one's raksha demon one's a horsefaced devil and one's a thunder god When Monkey heard this last remark he shouted at the top of his voice The thunder gods are my grandsons the rakshas are my greatgrandsons and the horsefaced devils are my greatgreatgrandsons This sent the old man's souls flying as he paled and wanted to go in
Sanzang held him up as they went into the thatched main room of the house and said with a forced smile Don't be afraid of him They are all rough like that
They don't know how to speak properly As he was making his explanations a woman came out from the back holding a child of four or five by the hand What has given you such a fright sir she asked
Bring some tea wife he said and the woman let go of the child's hand and fetched two cups of tea from the inside
When the tea had been drunk Sanzang stepped down from his seat to greet her and explain I have been sent by Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven
I had just arrived here and was asking for a night's lodging in your distinguished mansion when the sight of my three disciples' ugly faces gave the old gentleman rather a fright If the sight of ugly faces gives you such a scare how would you cope if you saw a tiger or a wolf the woman said
Their ugliness I could take wife the old man replied What terrified me was the way they spoke
When I said they were like a raksha a horsefaced devil and a thunder god one of them shouted that thunder gods were his grandsons rakshas his greatgrandsons and horsefaced devils his greatgreatgrandsons
That was what really terrified me No need to be frightened said Sanzang no need
The one like a thunder god is my senior disciple Sun Wukong
The one like a horsefaced devil is my second disciple Zhu Wuneng or Pig
And the one like a raksha is my third disciple Sha Wujing or Friar Sand
Although they are ugly they are all faithful Buddhists who believe in the true achievement They are not evil monsters or vicious demons
They are nothing to be afraid of Journey to the West When the old man and his wife heard who Sanzang was and were told that the disciples were all devout Buddhists their nerves were finally somewhat calmed and they told Sanzang to invite them in
The venerable elder went to the door to call them over then told them The old gentleman was really appalled by the sight of you just now
When you go in to see him now you must all be on your best behavior and be very polite to him I'm handsome and cultured said Pig not rough and noisy like my brothers If it weren't for your long snout big ears and ugly face you'd be a very goodlooking man laughed Monkey
Stop quarrelling said Friar Sand This is hardly the place for a beauty contest
Get inside With that they carried the luggage and led the horse in entered the main room made a respectful call of greeting and sat down
The good and able wife took the child out and gave orders for rice to be cooked and a vegetarian meal prepared
When master and disciples had eaten it the night was drawing in so a lamp was fetched and they sat talking in the main room
Only then did Sanzang ask his host's surname
Yang the old man replied and on being asked his age said he was seventythree
How many sons do you have Sanzang asked
Only one the old man replied
It was my grandson that my wife brought in just now Won't you ask your son in
I would like to greet him said Sanzang
He's not worth your courtesy the wretch the old man replied
I was fated to raise a worthless son and he isn't at home now Where does he make his living Sanzang asked
The old man nodded and sighed as he replied It's sad story
I would be very happy if he were willing to make an honest living but his mind is set on evil and he won't work at farming All he wants to do is to rob houses hold up travelers burn and kill
His cronies are all worse than foxes and dogs
He went away five days ago and he hasn't come back Sanzang did not dare to breathe a word when he heard this but he thought Perhaps he was one of the ones Wukong killed Feeling very uneasy he bowed as he sat there Oh dear he said oh dear
How could such good parents have so wicked a son Monkey went up to the old man and said What do you want a rotten son like that for He's a murderer and a rapist and he'll get both of you into trouble too
Let me find him and kill him for you I wish I could be rid of him said the old man but if I did I have no other son
Evil though he is I'll need him to bury me Stop meddling in things that are none of your business brother said Friar Sand and Pig We're not the government What's it to us if his son's a bad lot
Benefactor could you give us a bundle of straw to spread out and sleep on over there
We'll be on our way tomorrow morning The old man rose to his feet and sent Friar Sand to take two bundles of rice straw to the yard at the back where they were to spend the night in a thatched shed
Monkey led the horse and Pig carried the luggage as they took their master to the shed and Journey to the West slept the night there where we shall leave them Now old Mr
Yang's son was indeed one of the bandits who had fled for their lives after Monkey killed their two chiefs on the mountainside the previous morning
Late that night in the small hours a group of them gathered together again and knocked at the front gate
Hearing the noise the old man pulled some clothes over his shoulders and said Wife those damned bandits are here Then open the gate and let them in she replied
Only then did he open up and what he saw was a crowd of bandits shouting We're starving we're staving Old Mr
Yang's son rushed in and made his wife get up to cook some rice
As there was no firewood in the kitchen he went into the yard to fetch some Back in the kitchen he asked his wife Where did the white horse in the yard come from There are some monks from the East who are going to get scriptures she replied They asked to stay here last night
Your parents treated them to supper and put them up in the thatched shed The news made the bandit clap his hands with glee as he came out of the hall saying What a piece of luck brothers what a piece of luck
Our enemies are right here in my own home What enemies the others all asked
The monks who killed our chiefs came here for the night he replied and they're asleep in the shed Lovely said the other bandits
Let's get those baldheaded donkeys We can chop them all up and pickle them in soy sauce We'll have their things and their horse and be avenging the chiefs into the bargain Take it easy said Yang the bandit
You lot go and sharpen your swords while we cook the rice
Let's all have a good feed before we do them in Whereupon the bandits sharpened their swords and their spears
The old man had heard all this so he crept stealthily round to the back to tell the Tang Priest and his disciples That evil son of mine has brought the gang here They know you're here and they want to murder you
Knowing how far you've come I couldn't bear to see you murdered so please pack your bags as fast as you can
I'll let you out through the back gate Sanzang now shivering with fright kowtowed to the old man in thanks then told Pig to lead the horse while Friar Sand shouldered the carrying pole and Monkey took the nineringed monastic staff
The old man opened the back gate to let them out then made his way quietly back to the front to go to bed
By the time the bandits had sharpened their weapons and eaten a good meal it was the fifth watch and almost dawn They crowded into the backyard to find their intended victims gone
Quickly lighting lamps and fires they made a long search but could find no traces of them anywhere except that the back gate was open They've got away out the back they all exclaimed After them
Catch them They all rushed along as fast as arrows and when the sun rose in the East they finally saw Sanzang who looked back when he heard shouts and saw a crowd of twenty or thirty men armed with spears and swords coming after him
Disciples he called the bandits have caught up with us
Whatever shall we do Journey to the West Don't worry said Monkey
I'll finish them off Wukong said Sanzang reining in his horse you're not to hurt them
Just scare them off Not a blind bit of notice did Monkey take of this as he swung his cudgel and turned to face them Where do you gentlemen think you're going he asked
Bloody baldies they shouted back abusively ringing Monkey in a circle give us back our chiefs When they started thrusting and hacking at him with their spears and swords the Great Sage whirled his cudgel once around made it as thick as a ricebowl and scattered the lot of them
Those who took the full impact of it were killed outright glancing blows broke bones and even a touch left an open wound
A few of the nimbler ones managed a getaway but the slower ones all had to pay their respects to King Yama in the Underworld
At the sight of so many people being struck down a panicstricken Sanzang made his horse gallop West as fast as it could with Pig and Friar Sand rushing along beside
Which of you is old Yang's boy Monkey asked the wounded bandits who were still alive
The one in yellow my lord they groaned
Monkey went over took his sword from him and sliced off his head Holding the gory head in his hand he put his cudgel away and caught up with the Tang Priest by cloud Master he said waving the head in front of the horse here's the head of old Yang's wicked son Sanzang pale with horror fell out of the saddle
Evil macaque he said you will be the death of me terrifying me like that
Take it away at once Pig kicked the head to the side of the path and buried it with his rake
Do get up Master said Friar Sand putting down the carrying pole and supporting the Tang Priest
Pulling himself together as he sat there on the ground the venerable elder started to recite the Bandtightening Spell Monkey's skull was squeezed so tight that his face and ears turned bright red his eyes bulged and his head ached
Stop he pleaded rolling around in agony but even when Sanzang had said it a dozen times or more he still carried on
In his unbearable agony Monkey turned somersaults and stood on his head screaming Forgive me Master Say what you have to say Stop stop Only then did Sanzang stop reciting the spell
I've nothing to say to you he replied I don't want you with me any more
Go back Kowtowing despite his pain Monkey asked Master why are you sending me away Wicked ape said Sanzang you're too much of a murderer to fetch scriptures
I gave it to you yesterday for your cruelty in killing the two bandit chiefs on the mountainside
When we reached the old gentleman's house late yesterday evening he gave us a meal and a night's lodging and we only got away with our lives because he helped us to escape through the back gate
Even though his son was a bad lot that was none of our business and it was wrong of you to cut off his head to say nothing of all the other lives you destroyed Goodness knows how much you have damaged the harmony of heaven and earth
Despite my repeated advice there is not a shred of goodness in you I do not need yon at all
Clear off at once if you don't want me to say the spell again Don't say it don't say it pleaded Monkey in terror I'm going No sooner had the words left his mouth than he disappeared without a trace on his somersault cloud Journey to the West When the mind is full of murder Cinnabar cannot be treated
If the spirit is in disorder The Way stays uncompleted
If you don't know where the Great Sage had gone listen to the explanation in the next installment
The True Sun Wukong Makes His Complaint at Potaraka The False Monkey King Copies a Document in the Water Curtain Cave Angry and depressed the Great Sage Sun rose up into the air There were many places he would have liked to go to but could not In the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit he was afraid of being teased for coming back so soon after he had gone not like a real man
He did not think he would be allowed to stay long in the palaces of Heaven he could not face the immortals in the three magic islands in the sea and he could not bring himself to beg for the help of the dragon king in his dragon palace
He had nobody to turn to There's nothing for it he thought bitterly
I'll just have to go back to the master and pursue the true achievement He then brought his cloud straight down to stand in front of the Tang Priest's horse and say Please forgive me this time Master I'll never commit another murder and I'll do every thing you tell me
You must must let me escort you to the Western Heaven The moment the Tang Priest saw him he reined in the horse
His only reply was to start reciting the Bandtightening Spell which he did over and over again more than twenty times not stopping until Monkey lay weeping on the ground the band sunk a good inch into his head Why haven't you gone back Why are you still bothering me Sanzang asked
Don't say it again said Monkey don't
I've got places I can live but I'm afraid you'll never reach the Western Heaven without me You are a brutal murderer you macaque Sanzang angrily burst out You have got me into a lot of trouble on your account
I want nothing more to do with you Whether I get there or not is nothing to do with you Go at once
One more moment's delay and I'll say the spell again and I won't stop till your brains have all been squeezed out In unbearable pain and seeing that the master would not change his mind Monkey had no choice
Once again he shot up into the air on his somersault cloud and this time he had a sudden inspiration
That monk has let me down he thought
I'm off to Potaraka to lodge a complaint with the Bodhisattva Guanyin Journey to the West The splendid Monkey set off once more on his somersault cloud and in less than two hours he was at the Southern Ocean He stopped his auspicious cloud and then straight to Potaraka
Sun Wukong charged in to the Purple Bamboo Grove where Moksa the Novice appeared to greet him politely and ask Where are you going Great Sage I would like to see the Bodhisattva he replied
Moksa then led him to the mouth of the Tide Cave where the page Sudhana bowed and asked Why are you here Great Sage I want to lay a complaint before the Bodhisattva Monkey replied
At the word complaint Sudhana said with a smile What an evil tongue you have you ape It's just like when you tricked me after I caught the Tang Priest
Our Bodhisattva is an infinitely holy and good Bodhisattva who in her great mercy and compassion has made a vow to use the Great Vehicle to save all suffering beings What could she have done wrong for you to complain about At this Monkey who was already in thoroughly bad spirits exploded with fury He gave a shout that made Sudhana fall back Ungrateful little beast
Stupid fool You used to be a monsterspirit till I asked the Bodhisattva to win you over and convert you Now you're living in eternal bliss and freedom and you'll go on doing so as long as the heavens last You ought to be bowing low to thank me instead of being so thoroughly insulting
I come here with a complaint to lay before the Bodhisattva and you accuse me of having an evil tongue and complaining about her I see you're as hottempered a monkey as ever said Sudhana I was only teasing
no need to turn nasty As they were talking the white parrot came and flew around them which they recognized as a summons from the Bodhisattva
Moksa and Sudhana then led Monkey in to her lotus throne where he kowtowed to her howling aloud as the tears streamed down his cheeks
Telling Moksa and Sudhana to help Monkey to his feet the Bodhisattva said Wukong tell me straight out what it is that is upsetting you so
Don't cry
I shall deliver you from your troubles I've never been treated this badly in the whole of my life said a tearful Monkey continuing to kowtow to her
Ever since you saved me from the disaster sent by Heaven I've been a faithful Buddhist and protected the Tang Priest on his way to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures I've risked my skin to rescue him from demons even though it's been like taking crunchy bones out of a tiger's mouth or lifting the scales on a dragon's back
I've been trying so hard to win a true reward and wipe out my past sins
I never thought that the master would be so ungrateful that he'd ruin my chances of a good destiny because he couldn't tell right from wrong Explain what you mean by not telling right from wrong said the Bodhisattva and Monkey told her all the details of how the bandits had been killed and of how in his anger at so much slaughter the Tang Priest had said the Bandtightening Spell many times over without going into the rights and wrongs of the case then repeatedly sent him away
He said he had come to her because he had no way of getting up to heaven or into the earth
The Tang Priest is travelling West on his emperor's orders said the Bodhisattva and would not allow anyone to be killed for no good reason He is a monk whose heart is set on kindness
Why did someone of your tremendous powers need to bother with killing so many smalltime bandits
Bandits like that are bad but they're human and it's wrong to kill them
It's not the same as with evil beasts demons and spirits
Killing them is a good deed
Killing those men was cruel
You could have saved your master by just making them run away In my impartial judgement it was wicked of you to kill them Journey to the West Even if I was wicked said Monkey I ought to be allowed to redeem it by doing good
He was wrong to sent me away like that
I beg you in your mercy Bodhisattva say the Bandloosening Spell and take it off I'll give the band back to you and go and live in the Water Curtain Cave The Tathagata Buddha taught me the Bandtightening Spell the Bodhisattva replied
He gave me three treasures when I was sent to the East to find a pilgrim to fetch the scriptures the brocade cassock the nineringed monastic staff and the three bands
He taught me the three secret spells but a bandloosening spell was not one of them In that case Bodhisattva I must say goodbye Monkey replied
Where will you go the Bodhisattva asked
I'll go to the Western Heaven to pay my respects to the Tathagata and ask him to teach me the Bandloosening Spell Monkey replied
Wait a moment while I find out for you whether the prospects are good No need said Monkey
Things are quite bad enough as they are already I'm not finding out about yours but about the Tang Priest's the Bodhisattva replied
The splendid Bodhisattva then took her seat on her lotus throne and sent her heart roaming through the three worlds while her perceptive eyes traveled all over the universe Within the instant she spoke Wukong your master is just about to be wounded and he will soon be coming to look for you
Wait here while I go to see the Tang Priest and tell him to continue taking you with him to fetch the scriptures and achieve the true reward The Great Sage could only agree and control his impatience as he stood at the foot of the lotus throne
The story returns to the Tang Priest who since sending Monkey away had done some fifteen more miles to the West with Pig leading the horse and Friar Sand carrying the luggage Disciples he said reining in the horse I'm extremely hungry and thirsty I've been going for many hours since we left that cottage before dawn and I've been thoroughly upset by that Protector of the Horses Which of you is going to beg me some food Down you get Master said Pig while I look round here for a village to beg some food in At this Sanzang dismounted while the idiot went up into the air on a cloud and took a good look all around
All he could see were mountains there was no hope of spotting a human house
Bringing the cloud back down Pig said to Sanzang There's nowhere to beg from here
I couldn't see a single farm when I looked around In that case said Sanzang fetch us some water to quench our thirst I'll get some from the stream on that mountain to the South said Pig and Friar Sand handed him the begging bowl
While Pig carried it off on his cloud the master sat and waited beside the path for a very long time getting more and more unbearably thirsty and there was no sign of Pig
There is a poem to prove it that goes Preserve the true spirit and nourish the breath for this is called essence Feeling and nature originally shared the same form
Journey to the West When spirit and heart are disordered all illness arises If essence and form both decline the primal will crash
Without the three contemplations all effort is wasted Should the four elements be too wretched there's no point in contending
Without earth and wood there can be no more metal or water How can the dharma body be won through idleness
Seeing his master in agony from thirst as Pig was not back with the water Friar Sand put the luggage down tethered the white horse and said Master make yourself comfortable
I'm going to hurry him up with that water Sanzang too tearful to speak nodded his head in agreement whereupon Friar Sand headed by cloud for the mountain to the South
Sanzang was left by himself to endure his excruciating pain
In his deep misery he was alarmed by a noise that made him sit up and look It was Monkey kneeling by the side of the path holding a porcelain cup and saying Without me you can't even have water to drink Master
Drink this cup of lovely cold water while I go to beg you some food I won't drink water you give me said Sanzang I'd rather die of thirst right here
I want no more of you
Go away But you'll never get to the Western Heaven without me said Monkey
Whether I get there or not is none of your business the Tang Priest replied Wicked ape
Why do you keep pestering me At that Monkey turned angry and started shouting abusively You've been lousy to me you cruel vicious old baldy With that he threw the bowl aside and swung his cudgel hitting Sanzang on his back
Sanzang fell to the ground barely conscious and unable to speak as Monkey took the two bundles wrapped in blue felt in his arms and disappeared without trace on a somersault cloud
As Pig was hurrying to the mountain to the South with the bowl in his hand he noticed a thatched cottage in a hollow
He had not spotted it when first he looked because it had been hidden in a fold of the mountain
Realizing that it was a house now he was close to the idiot thought If I show them my ugly mug they'll be so scared they won't possibly give me any food It'd all be wasted effort
I'd better turn into something a bit betterlooking The splendid idiot then made a spell with his hands said the magic words shook himself seven or eight times and turned himself into a consumptive monk with a fat sallow face who was mumbling something as he went up to the door and called out Benefactor have you any leftover rice in the kitchen for starving travelers
I'm from the East and I'm on my way to fetch scriptures from the Western Heaven
My master is back at the road hungry and thirsty
If you have any leftover rice stuck to the bottom of your pan I beg you to give me some to save our lives As it happened the men of the house were all out transplanting rice and sowing millet and the only people in were two women who had just cooked the rice for the midday meal and had filled two platters with it that they were preparing to take to the fields There was some rice left at the bottom of the pan
Seeing how sickly he looked they took what he said about going from the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven as Journey to the West delirious ravings
Afraid he might collapse and die in the doorway they made a great todo as they filled his bowl with rice from the bottom of the pan
The idiot took it from them reverted to his true form and went back the way he had come
As he was going along he heard a shout of Pig and looked up to see Friar Sand standing on the top of a precipice yelling Over here over here Friar Sand came down and walked straight towards him asking Why didn't you take some of the fresh water from this stream
Why did you go over there After I got here I saw a cottage in a hollow so I went and begged this bowlful of rice We could certainly use it said Friar Sand but the master is terribly thirsty so how are we going to carry some water back That's easy said Pig
Carry this rice in the fold of your habit while I go and fetch some water in this bowl The two of them were feeling very cheerful as they went back to the path only to find Sanzang lying face downwards in the dirt
The white horse had slipped its bridle and was running to and fro beside the path whinnying
There was not a sigh of the baggage Pig stumbled and beat his breast with horror Don't tell me he shouted don't tell me
The survivors of the gang Monkey drove away have come back killed the master and stolen the baggage Tether the horse said Friar Sand
Whatever shall we do
We've failed halfway along our journey
Master Tears poured down his face as he sobbed bitterly
Don't cry brother said Pig
As this is what's happened we'll just have to forget about fetching the scriptures
You look after the master's body I'll take the horse till I get to some town village market or inn where I can sell it for a few ounces of silver to buy a coffin to bury him in
Then we'll split up and go our separate ways Friar Sand unable to bear the loss of his master turned the body over to warm the face with his own
Poor poor master he cried then noticed hot breath coming from his master's nose and felt warmth in his chest
Come here Pig he shouted the master's still alive Pig came over and helped Sanzang to sit up
As Sanzang came to he groaned and said bitterly That evil macaque tried to murder me What macaque the other two asked
The venerable elder sighed and said nothing
Only when he had asked for and drunk a few mouthfuls of water did he reply As soon as you'd gone Wukong came to pester me again
When I still refused to take him back he hit me with his cudgel and stole the bundles wrapped in blue felt At this Pig ground his teeth as the fury rose higher and higher in him Damn that monkey he said
How could he do such a terrible thing
Look after the master he continued addressing Friar Sand I'm going to his house to get back the bundles Don't lose your temper said Friar Sand
Let's help the master over to that cottage in the hollow to ask for hot tea
Then we can heat up the rice you've begged already and get the master better before we go after Monkey Accepting this suggestion Pig helped the master back on the horse Carrying the bowl of water and with the rice in Friar Sand's habit they headed straight back for the door of the cottage
There was only an old woman at home and at the sight of them she hid herself as fast as she could
Friar Sand put his hands together in front Journey to the West of his chest and said Good lady we've been sent by the Tang court in the East to the Western Heaven
As our master is not very well I have come to ask you for some hot tea to warm his rice with We had a consumptive monk begging here just now who said he'd come from the East the old woman replied Now you say you're from the East too
There's nobody at home
Please try somewhere else Hearing this the venerable elder dismounted with Pig's help bowed to her and said Madam I used to have three disciples who worked together to protect me on my way to the Thunder Monastery in the country of India to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures
But because my senior disciple Sun Wukong is a born murderer and will not be kind I sent him away
To my utter surprise he sneaked up on me hit me across the back and stole my clothes baggage and bowl
I want to send one of my other disciples after him and as I can't stay by the roadside I have come here to ask if I may rest in your house for a while
It will only be till the luggage has been recovered
I won't stay long A consumptive monk with a fat sallow face begged some food from us just now the woman said He said he had come from the East and was going to the Western Heaven
There can't be another group of you That was me said Pig unable to keep a straight face any longer I made myself look like that
I thought my long snout and big ears would give you such a fright that you wouldn't give me any food
If you don't believe me my brother here has the rice from the bottom of your pan inside his tunic Recognizing the rice the old woman stopped trying to send them away
She asked them to sit down inside and prepared a pot of hot tea that she gave to Friar Sand to warm the rice with
He did this and handed it to his master who ate a few mouthfuls sat quietly to calm himself for a while then asked Which of you will go to fetch the luggage When you sent him away the other year replied Pig I went to fetch him
I know the way to his Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit Wait here while I go No said Sanzang not you
You have never got on with that macaque and besides you're very roughspoken If you say anything wrong he'll hit you Let Wujing go Friar Sand agreed at once and Sanzang gave him these instructions
When you get there you must keep a close watch on the situation
If he is willing to give you back the bundles then pretend to be very grateful when you accept them
If he won't you must on no account quarrel with him Go straight to the Bodhisattva in the Southern Sea tell her what has happened and ask her to demand them from him Friar Sand accepted his instructions and said to Pig I'm off to find Monkey now Whatever you do don't complain
Look after the master properly
You mustn't have a row with these people or they might not feed you
I'll soon be back I understand Pig replied with a nod
Off you go and come back soon whether you recover the luggage or not
Otherwise we'll have lost both ways Friar Sand then made a hand spell and headed off by cloud for the Eastern Continent of Superior Body Indeed
When the body is present but the soul files off nothing remains to keep it alive A furnace without fire can refine no cinnabar
The yellow wife leaves the lord to seek the metal elder Journey to the West Wood's mother puts on a sickly face to look after the master
Who knows when this journey will ever end Or when he will return from far away
The Five Elements give birth and yield to each other All is disorder until the mindape comes back
Friar Sand flew for three days and nights before he reached the Eastern Ocean
At the sound of its waves he looked down and saw Black mists up to the sky and gloomy vapors The ocean embracing the sun in dawn's cold light
But he was in no mood to enjoy the view as he crossed Yingzhou and the other islands of immortals and headed on East straight for the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit
Riding the sea wind and walking on the water it took him a lot longer before he saw a line of peaks like serried halberds and sheer rocks like screens
When he reached the highest peak he landed his cloud and found his way down the mountain heading for the Water Curtain Cave
As he approached he heard a great commotion the mountain was covered with yelling monkey spirits
When closer still he saw Monkey sitting on a high stone terrace holding a piece of paper in both hands from which he was reading We the Emperor Li of the Great Tang Dynasty in the East have called to our presence our younger brother the Master of the Law Chen Xuanzang and commissioned him to go West to seek the scriptures from the Lord Buddha in the Thunder Monastery at the Saha Vulture Peak in India
When our soul went wandering in the Underworld after we succumbed to a sudden illness we were fortunate enough to have our years of life extended and to be returned to the world of the living by the Lord of Darkness Since then we have held many masses and built altars to help the souls of the dead across to the other side
We were blessed by the appearance of the golden deliverer from suffering the Bodhisattva Guanyin who informed us that the Buddha in the West has scriptures that will deliver all lost souls We have therefore sent the Dharma Master Xuanzang to make the long journey across a thousand mountains in search of the sutras and the gathas
We request that in the states of the West through which he passed he be allowed to proceed in accordance with this passport and that his holy cause be not brought to naught
Given on an auspicious day in the autumn of the thirteenth year of Zhenguan of the Great Tang
Since leaving that mighty empire he has passed through many other states On the journey he has taken three disciples The senior one is Sun Wukong the Novice the second is Zhu Wuneng or Zhu Bajie and the third is Sha Wujing or Friar Sand
Journey to the West Having read the text of Sanzang's passport through once he read it out again at which Friar Sand could not help himself calling out at the top of his voice Brother why are you reading the master's passport out When Monkey heard this he jerked his head up and refusing to recognize Friar Sand shouted Arrest him
Arrest him All the monkeys rushed him and surrounded him pulling him and dragging him towards Monkey who shouted Who do you think you are
What a nerve coming so close to our immortals' cave Seeing how Monkey had turned cold and was refusing to recognize him any longer Friar Sand had no choice but to go up to him with a bow and say Elder brother it was wrong of our master to be so angry with you curse you and send you away
Pig and I ought to have persuaded him not to and we shouldn't have been away looking for water and begging for food for our starving thirsty master when you were so good as to come back
It was wrong of the master to be so stubborn and to refuse again to let you stay That was why you knocked him senseless and took the luggage
When we came back we revived the master and now I've come to see you
Unless you hate the master and have forgotten what you owe him for delivering you from your torment in the past won't you bring the luggage and come back with me to see him Then we can all go to the Western Heaven and win our true reward
If you really hate him so deeply that you won't come with me then please please give me the bundles Then you can enjoy the sunset of your life here in your native mountain
This way we'll all be fine Monkey's answer to this was to say with a derisive laugh that's not what I had in mind at all brother
The reason why I hit the master and took the luggage isn't because I'm not going to the West or want to stay here
I'm learning the passport off by heart so that I can go to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures myself I shall have all the glory of taking them back to the East
I'll make those people in the Southern Jambu Continent see me as a great master and I'll be famous for ever What you say isn't quite right replied Friar Sand with a smile
Nobody's ever heard of Sun the Novice going to fetch the scriptures
Our Tathagata Buddha created three stores of true scriptures and sent the Bodhisattva Guanyin to the East to find the pilgrim who would go to fetch them Our job is to escort the pilgrim across a thousand mountains and through all the countries along the way
As the Bodhisattva has told us the pilgrim was once the venerable elder Golden Cicada a disciple of Tathagata Buddha's
Because he was exiled from Vulture Peak and reborn in the East for not listening to the Lord Buddha's sermons on the scriptures he is the one who must make his true achievement in the West and return to the Great Way
We three were saved to protect him from the demons he would meet on the journey
No Lord Buddha's going to give you the scriptures if you turn up without the Tang Priest It'd just be wasted effort Brother said Monkey you've always been rather thick You don't know the half of it
You may say you've got a Tang Priest but what makes you think I haven't got one to escort to
I've chosen another holy monk here to escort No problem
We're starting off on our big journey tomorrow
If you don't believe me I'll show you him
Little ones he called bring my master out at once In they ran and they came out again leading a white horse a Tang Sanzang a Pig carrying the luggage and a Friar Sand with his monastic staff
I've never changed my name roared Friar Sand in fury at this sight
There can't possibly be another Friar Sand How dare you Take this The splendid Friar Sand raised his demonquelling staff with both arms and brought it down on his double's head killing him outright and revealing that he had really been a monkey spirit
This made Monkey so angry that he swung his goldbanded cudgel and led all the monkeys to surround him
Lashing about him Friar Sand fought his way out and escaped by cloud
That damned ape is being so thoroughly vicious that I'll have to report him to the Bodhisattva he thought and as Friar Sand had killed a monkey spirit and been driven away Monkey did not go after him
Going back to his cave he told his underlings to drag the corpse to one side skin it and cook its flesh on which he and the other monkeys then feasted with coconut toddy and the wine of grapes
Then he chose another monkey fiend Journey to the West who was good at transformations to turn into Friar Sand and started instructing him again as he prepared to travel to the West
There we shall leave him Meanwhile Friar Sand flew his cloud away from the Eastern Ocean and traveled for a day and a night to the Southern Ocean
Before long Mount Potaraka came into view not far away so he pressed forward then brought his cloud down so that he could stop and look It was a wonderful sight
Indeed It includes all the mysteries of heaven and earth Here is the confluence of the rivers Where sun and stars are washed and bathed Hither all creatures come The winds are born and the moon is rocked in the ripples
When the tidal wave rises high the leviathan is transformed Amid the mighty breakers the giant turtle swims
The waters are joined to the Western and Northern Seas The waves connect with the Central and Eastern Oceans
The four seas are linked as the artery of the earth In the magic islands are palaces of immortals
Forget about all the earthly paradises Look at Potaraka's cloudy cave
A wonderful sight
Noble the primal spirit of the peak at sunset Below the cliffs the winds make rippling crystal
Peacocks fly in the Purple Bamboo Grove Parrots talk in the branches of green poplar
Flowers of jade and jasper always bloom Precious trees and golden lotuses grow every year
Journey to the West White cranes come to pay homage at this peak Phoenixes often alight in the mountain pavilions
Even the fish here cultivate their true nature Leaping in the waves as they listen to the scriptures
As Friar Sand strolled on the mountain enjoying this magical view Moksa the Novice came up to him and said Why are you here instead of escorting the Tang Priest on his way to fetch the scriptures Sha Wujing Friar Sand bowed to him and replied There is something on which I would like an audience with the Bodhisattva
Could I trouble you to take me to her Moksa who realized that he was looking for Monkey asked no further questions but went straight to the Bodhisattva and said The Tang Priest's junior disciple Sha Wujing is here to pay homage When Monkey who was still there below the lotus throne heard this he said with a smile The Tang Priest must be in trouble if Friar Sand is here to ask for your help Bodhisattva The Bodhisattva then asked Moksa to bring him in
Friar Sand prostrated himself on the ground to kowtow to her then looked up about to start making his complaint when he saw Monkey standing beside her Without a word he struck at Monkey's face with his demonsubduing staff
Instead of hitting back Monkey dodged the blow and got out of the way
I'll get you you thoroughly evil treacherous ape roared Friar Sand
You're trying to deceive the Bodhisattva too Don't hit him shouted the Bodhisattva
Tell me what's been happening Only then did Friar Sand put down his precious staff and kowtow to the lotus throne again saying with raging fury We're lost count of the number of murders this ape has committed on the journey
The other day he killed two highwaymen and the master let him have it so when we were spending the next night at the bandit chief's home it came as a shock when he butchered as many of the gang as he could and took a severed head all dripping with blood to show to the master
It gave the master such a fright that he fell off his horse said some nasty things to Monkey and sent him packing
After he'd gone the master was so hungry and thirsty that he sent Pig off to look for some water and because Pig took a very long time to get back he sent me off after him
We never imagined that Monkey would come back hit the master with his iron cudgel and steal the two bundles wrapped in blue felt while we were away We came back and brought the master round Then I went all the way to the Water Curtain Cave to fetch Monkey To my amazement he turned cold and refused to recognize me
He was reading the master's passport aloud over and over again When I asked him why he said that as he couldn't escort the Tang Priest any further he was going to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven and take them back East himself Then they'd treat him as a great master and he'd be famous for ever
When I asked who'd give him scriptures if the Tang Priest wasn't with him he said he'd chosen a holy monk and asked him to come out
There was a white horse a Tang Priest a Pig and a Friar Sand Tm Friar Sand' I said 'and the one and only Friar Sand too'
I hit him one with my staff and he turned out to be a monkey spirit
When Monkey came after me with his hordes I decided to come here to tell you Bodhisattva and ask for your help
I never realized he'd get here before me by somersault cloud or that he'd fool you with his fine words Journey to the West You must not make such slanders Wujing the Bodhisattva said
Wukong has been here for four days I never let him go back and he didn't send for another Tang Priest to go to fetch the scriptures But what about that Monkey in the Water Curtain Cave
I'm telling you the truth replied Friar Sand
Calm down said the Bodhisattva I'll send Wukong back to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit with you to take a good look round If he's real he'll be hard to wipe out but if he's a fake you'll be able to eliminate him easily
You'll find out which he is when you get there At this Brother Monkey and Friar Sand took their leave of the Bodhisattva
They were making their journey To the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit The rights and wrongs to reveal To the cave with a curtain of water To tell the false from the real
If you don't know how they told them apart you had better listen to the explanation in the next installment Two Minds Throw Heaven and Earth into Uproar One Body Cannot Achieve True Nirvana When Monkey and Friar Sand took their leave of the Bodhisattva they departed from the Southern Ocean by two beams of auspicious light
Now Monkey's somersault cloud was much faster than Friar Sand's immortal's cloud so Monkey was drawing ahead when Friar Sand pulled him back and said There's no need for you to show me your heels like that brother rushing ahead to sort things out at home
Wait for me to come with you Although Brother Monkey's intentions were good Friar Sand could not help being suspicious
The two of them then flew their clouds together and were soon in sight of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit
They brought their clouds down and had a good look at the outside of the cave where there was indeed a Monkey sitting on a high stone terrace drinking and making merry with his monkey hosts
He looked exactly the same as the Great Sage yellow hair held in a golden band fiery eyes with golden pupils a brocade tunic a tigerskin kilt a goldbanded iron cudgel in his hands and deerskin boots
He had the same Hairy face like a thunder god Cheeks like the planet Saturn Pointed ears and a forehead broad Journey to the West And long protruding fangs
In an explosion of fury the Great Sage left Friar Sand behind as he went up to the other brandishing his cudgel and shouting abusively What sort of demon do you think you are How dare you
You make yourself look like me you steal my children and grandchildren you occupy my immortal's cave and on top of that you live it up like this When the other Monkey heard all this he did not deign to reply but went for him with his own iron cudgel
When the two Monkeys were together there was no way of telling the true from the false It was a splendid fight Two cudgels and a pair of monkey spirits A couple of truly formidable foes
Both want to escort the Tang emperor's brother Each longs to achieve what will make him famous
The true Monkey now accepts Sakyamuni's teachings The false demon only pretends to be a Buddhist
In magic powers and transformations The false and true are evenly balanced
One is the Sage Equaling Heaven of primal energy The other an earth spirit who has long refined his powers
One wields an AsYouWill goldbanded cudgel The other an iron bar that follows the heart's desire
As they block and parry neither comes out on top
First they fight each other outside the cave But soon they carry on the struggle in mid air
Each of them rose on his clouds and light till they were fighting up in the clouds of the ninth heaven
As Friar Sand stood beside them he dared not intervene in their fight as he really could not tell the true Monkey from the false one
He longed to draw his sword and join in but he was frightened of wounding the real Monkey
When he had endured this dilemma for a long time he shot back down to the mountain scar where he used his demonquelling staff to fight his way to the outside of the Water Curtain Cave Here he sent all the demons fleeing in terror turned the stone benches over and smashed the tableware from which they had been eating Journey to the West and drinking to their hearts' content
But although he looked everywhere for the blue felt bundles he failed to find them
Now the Water Curtain Cave was so called because the waterfall screening its entrance looked from a distance like a white cloth curtain and only appeared as the waterfall it was from close to
As Friar Sand did not know that the entrance to the cave was behind it he was unable to find the way in so he took his cloud back up to the Ninth Heaven and started swinging his staff again still unable to strike
Friar Sand said the Great Sage you can't help much here Go back and tell the master what's been happening to us while I drive this demon to Potaraka Island in the Southern Ocean for the Bodhisattva to identify me as the real Monkey The other Monkey then repeated what he had said
As they looked and sounded exactly the same Friar Sand really could not tell them apart He could only do as he was told and ride his cloud back to rejoin the Tang Priest
The two Monkeys meanwhile fought and shouted their way to the Southern Ocean where they went straight to Potaraka Island still throwing blows and abuse at each other
Their unending shouts disturbed all the devas who protected the Law so that they went to the Tide Cave and reported Bodhisattva two Sun Wukongs really have fought their way here The Bodhisattva came down from her lotus throne and went with Moksa the page Sudhana and the Naga Maiden to the entrance where she shouted Stay where you are evil beast Each Monkey grabbed hold of the other one while the real one said Bodhisattva this damned fiend really does look just like me
Our fight started at the Water Curtain Cave and has been going on for a very long time without getting anywhere
Friar Sand's mortal eyes are too weak to tell us apart so he can't help at all
I sent him back West to report to the master while I fought this bloody impostor here for you to distinguish the true from the false Your eyes are perceptive Bodhisattva The other Monkey then said exactly the same
Look long and hard though they did the devas and the Bodhisattva could not tell which was which
Let go of each other and stand one on each side while I take another look the Bodhisattva said
Doing as she told them the one on her left said I'm the real Monkey and the one on her right said He's an impostor The Bodhisattva then called Moksa and Sudhana to her and whispered these instructions I want one of you to stand very close to each of them while I recite the Bandtightening Spell quietly
The one in agony will be the real one and the one who isn't will be the impostor One of them went up to each of the Monkeys but as the Bodhisattva secretly said the words of the spell they both yelled out in pain clutched their heads and rolled on the ground shouting Stop
Stop The moment she did they grabbed each other again and went on fighting and shouting
At her wit's end the Bodhisattva ordered the devas and Moksa to help but none of them dared strike a blow for fear of wounding the real Monkey
Sun Wukong called the Bodhisattva and both the Monkeys answered her
As you were once appointed the Protector of the Horses said the Bodhisattva When you made havoc in the Heavenly Palace all the heavenly generals recognize you Go to the upper world let it distinguish between you two
Come back and tell me the result The Great Sage thanked the Bodhisattva for her kindness and the other Monkey also thanked her
Journey to the West Pulling and tugging at each other and keeping up their ceaseless clamour they went straight to the Southern Gate of Heaven where the Heavenly King Virupaksa led the four heavenly generals Ma Zhao Wen and Guan and all the other gate gods great and small to block the entrance with their weapons Where are you going he shouted
This is no place for a brawl Sanzang sent me away for killing some bandits while I was escorting him to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures the Great Sage replied I went to Potaraka to complain
To my horror this evil spirit turned himself into my double knocked the Tang Priest over and stole the luggage
Friar Sand went to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit looking for me and found that this evil spirit had seized my cave
Then he went to Potaraka to tell the Bodhisattva and ask for her help When he saw me there he made the outrageous accusation that I'd got there first by somersault cloud and told the Bodhisattva a pack of lies to cover up
Luckily she could vouch for me and didn't believe Friar Sand so she sent us both back to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit to find out what had happened As you can see this evil spirit looks just like me
We fought our way from the Water Curtain Cave to Potaraka Island to see the Bodhisattva but she couldn't tell us apart so I've now fought him all the way here in the hope that all the eyes of all the heavens will be able to see that I'm the real Monkey Then the other Monkey told the same story
No matter how long they looked all the gods of the heavens could not tell them apart
If you can't tell which is which the two Monkey shouted get out of the way and let us go to see the Jade Emperor As the gods could not stop them they opened the gates wide to let them go straight to the Hall of Miraculous Mist
Marshal Ma and the four Heavenly Teachers Zhang Ge Xu and Qiu all reported to the Jade Emperor Two identical Sun Wukongs from the mortal world have charged in through the gates of Heaven and say that they want to see Your Majesty Before they had finished the two Monkeys came roaring straight in so alarming the Jade Emperor that he came down from his throne and stood in the palace hall
Why are you two making such a row in the heavenly palace and shouting in our presence the Jade Emperor asked Do you want to die Long live Your Majesty said the Great Sage
Now that I'm a devout Buddhist I'd never dare try to bully my betters
It's just that this evil spirit has turned himself into my double He then told the whole story concluding and I beg that Your Majesty will unmask the impostor Then the other Monkey said the same thing all over again
The Jade Emperor ordered Heavenly King Li the Pagodacarrier to look at them both in his demonrevealing mirror kill the false one and preserve the true one
The Heavenly King caught them both in his mirror and invited the Jade Emperor and the other deities all to look
Both Monkeys could be seen in it wearing the same golden band and the same clothes There was not the slightest difference between them
Unable to tell them apart the Jade Emperor had both of them driven out of the palace
The Great Sage gave a mocking laugh and so did the other Monkey
Then they grabbed each other by the hair and by the throat fought their way out of the heavenly gates and landed on the road to the West
Let's go and see the master said one of them and the other replied Let's go and see the master After Friar Sand had taken his leave of the two Monkeys it took him three days and nights' travelling to return to the farm where he told the Tang Priest everything that had happened The Tang Priest was full of regrets
I said that Sun Wukong had hit me and stolen the bundles never realizing that an evil spirit had turned itself into an imitation Monkey Journey to the West The evil spirit made doubles of yourself the white horse Pig carrying our luggage and me said Friar Sand
I was so furious that I killed the fake Friar Sand he was really a monkey spirit
That made them all run away then I went to tell the Bodhisattva my troubles She sent Monkey and me back to identify the demon but he was so much like the real Monkey that I couldn't help in the fight which is why I've come back to report to you Master Sanzang paled with horror at this news while Pig roared with laughter Great great he guffawed
Just as this kind old lady said there are several lots of pilgrims going to fetch the scriptures
They're one lot aren't they Everyone in the house young and old alike came to ask Friar Sand Where have you been looking for money for your travelling expenses these last few days I went to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body to look for my eldest brother and fetch the baggage Friar Sand replied with a smile Then I went to Potaraka Island in the Southern Ocean to see the Bodhisattva Guanyin and to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit again before coming back here How long was your return journey the old man of the family asked
About  miles Friar Sand replied
That would be a very long way to walk in only a few days the old man said You must have gone by cloud to get there How else do you think he got across the sea said Pig What you and I do is like walking compared with Monkey
he'd have been there and back in a day or two said Friar Sand
When the family heard this they realized that they must all be gods or immortals
No we're not said Pig We're senior to them As they were talking they were interrupted by a noisy quarrel in mid air and when they rushed out to look they saw two Monkeys fighting
The sight made Pig's hands itch
I'm going up to tell them apart he said and with that the splendid idiot leapt up into the air and shouted Stop yelling brother Pig's here Hit the evil spirit both Monkeys shouted hit the evil spirit All this both horrified and delighted the family who exclaimed We've got a whole lot of arhats who can ride on clouds staying with us
Even if we'd made a vow to feed monks we would never have been able to feed such holy men as these They were now more generous with their food and tea than ever
Then they began to worry that if the fight between the two Sun the Novices turned nasty heaven and earth might be turned upside down it could be disastrous
Seeing that behind the old man's delight lay these deep misgivings Sanzang said to him There's no need to worry or alarm yourself benefactor
When I made him submit and become my disciple he gave up evil and turned to good
Of course we will show you our gratitude That would be too great an honour the old man replied too great an honour Journey to the West Stop talking now benefactor said Friar Sand and you sit here Master
Pig and I'll each bring one of them back here to stand in front of you When you say the spell the one who suffers will be the real Monkey and the one who doesn't will be the impostor What a very good idea said Sanzang
Friar Sand then rose up into midair and said Stop it both of you
I'm taking you for the master to choose between you The Great Sage then let go of his opponent and so did the other Monkey
Friar Sand held one and told Pig to hold the other and they took them both down by their clouds till they stood in front of the thatched cottage
As soon as he saw them Sanzang began to say the Bandtightening Spell at which both Monkeys cried out together Why do you have to say that spell when we're fighting so hard
Stop Being a kind and merciful man the venerable elder stopped reciting the spell before he had been able to tell them apart The two Monkeys then broke free from Pig and Friar Sand and started fighting again
Brothers the Great Sage said look after the master while I fight this impostor down to get the Kings of the Underworld to tell which of us is which The other Monkey said likewise and the two of them soon disappeared grabbing and tugging at each other
Friar Sand said Pig why didn't you grab the luggage off the fake Pig when you saw him carrying it at the Water Curtain Cave The evil spirits surrounded me when I killed my double with the demonquelling staff Friar Sand replied They were going to get me so I had to flee for my life
After I'd been to see the Bodhisattva and gone back to the cave entrance again with Monkey I overturned all their stone benches and scattered the little demons but I couldn't see any entrance to the cave only a waterfall I came back emptyhanded as I couldn't find the luggage Let me tell you something said Pig
When I went there a few years ago to ask him to come back we met outside the cave
After I'd persuaded him to come he jumped down and went into the cave to change
I saw him go straight through the water the waterfall is the entrance
I bet that's where that devil has put our luggage As you know the way into the cave I think you'd better go and fetch our baggage from there while the demon's away said Sanzang Even if Wukong does come back I still won't have him I'm off then said Pig
There are thousands and thousands of little monkeys in front of the cave said Friar Sand
It'd be terrible if they were too much for you by yourself I'm not worried said Pig who rushed outside and headed off to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit to fetch the luggage
The two Monkeys fought their way round to the back of the Dark Mountain of the Underworld where all the demons shivered and shook with terror as they hid themselves
The ones who managed to run away first rushed straight to the Underworld government offices and reported to the Senluo Palace Your Majesties two Great Sages Equaling Heaven have come to the Dark Mountain and are fighting their way here Journey to the West The Ring of Qinguang in the First Palace reported this with alarm to the King of Chujiang in the Second Palace
The news was passed on in turn to King Songdi in the Third Palace the King of Biancheng in the Fourth Palace King Yama in the Fifth Palace King Impartial in the Sixth Palace the King of Taishan in the Seventh Palace the Metropolitan King in the Eighth Palace King Wuguan in the Ninth Palace and King Everturning Wheel in the Tenth Palace In an instant the Ten Kings all gathered together and sent an urgent message to King Ksitigarbha
Meanwhile the Underworld forces were mustered in the Senluo Palace ready to capture the true and the false Monkey
Just then there was the roar of a mighty wind as dreary mists filled the air and the two Monkeys came tumbling and rolling to the Senluo Palace
The Lords of the Underworld stepped forward to block their way and say Great Sages why are you making such disorder in our Underworld To this the real Great Sage replied I was escorting the Tang Priest on his journey to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven when bandits tried to rob him on a mountain in the land of Western Liang
He got angry with me when I killed a few of them and sent me away
I went to tell my troubles to the Bodhisattva in the Southern Ocean I never imagined that this demon would have the effrontery to turn himself into my double attack my master on the road and steal our baggage
When my fellowdisciple Friar Sand went back to my mountain to fetch the baggage he found that the demon had created an imitation of the master to take to the Western Heaven and fetch the scriptures so he rushed to the Southern Ocean to see the Bodhisattva Guanyin and found me there at her side
After he'd told his story the Bodhisattva sent me back to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit with him to see what was going on I found that this bastard had stolen my cave
We argued all the way to the Bodhisattva Guanyin's place but she couldn't tell which of us was the real me
Then I fought with him up to Heaven where none of the gods knew which of us was which and after that went to see the master
When the master recited the Bandtightening Spell my double was in just as much pain as I was
That's why I've brought this chaos to the Underworld in the hope that Your Majesties will look up the Registers of Life and Death for me to find out about the False Sun the Novice's background so that I can catch his soul and end this confusion of there being two minds The demon then said the same thing
The Lords of the Underworld called on the judges in charge of the records to go through them carefully from beginning to end There was nobody under the name of False Sun the Novice
They checked through the registers of hairy beasts again and found that under item  in the monkey section there was a record of how the Great Sage Sun had achieved the Way in his youth made havoc in the Underworld and removed his name from the registers of death so that from then on none of the monkeys were listed
When the judges had made their inspection they reported back to the palace
Holding their tablets of office the Lords of the Underworld said to Monkey Great Sage there are no names in the records that can be checked
You will have to go back to the world of the living to be told apart As they were saying this they heard the Bodhisattva King Ksitigarbha shout Wait wait
I'll send Examiner to tell you apart Now Examiner was the name of an animal who lay under the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha's sutra table
Just by lying there he could tell good from evil and wise from stupid among any of the snails fish hairy creatures feathered creatures insects heavenly immortals earthly immortals divine immortals human immortals and devil immortals in all the mountains rivers and countries of the four great continents in all cave heavens and in all blessed places
The animal lay on the ground in the courtyard of the Senluo Palace as Ksitigarbha instructed it
A little later it raised its head and said to Ksitigarbha I've found the name of the demon but I cannot say it to his face nor can I help catch him What would happen if you identified him to his face Ksitigarbha asked
Journey to the West If I did Examiner replied I am afraid that the evil spirit would turn nasty make disorder in the palace and destroy the peace of the Underworld Why won't you help capture him Ksitigarbha went on to ask and Examiner replied The evil spirit's magic powers are no less than those of Sun Wukong
No matter how much dharma power the gods of the Underworld have they would never be able to catch him In that case how is the evil spirit to be got rid of Boundless is the Buddha's Dharma Examiner replied
Ksitigarbha was now enlightened As you two look the same and have the same magic powers he said to both Monkeys if you want to be told apart you will have to go to Sakyamuni Buddha in Thunder Monastery You're right they both replied together you've right
You and I'll go to the Western Heaven to be told apart by the Lord Buddha They then took their leave of Ksitigarbha and were seen out by the Ten Kings of the Underworld as they went up to the Turquoise Cloud Palace after which devils were sent to close the entrance to the Underworld
Watch the two Monkeys as they fly by cloud and mist to the Western Heaven
There is a poem about it that goes Troubles arise if one has two minds Doubts cloud everything from sea to sky
One desires fine horses and the highest rank Craving for eminence at the royal court
Fighting North and South without respite They parry to East and West with never a pause
In dhyana the secret of mindlessness must be learned Nourish the babe in silence and form the holy foetus
The two of them fought as they flew through the air grabbing tugging pulling and snatching at each other all the way to the outside of the Thunder Monastery on Vulture Peak in the Western Heaven
Even before they arrived the four Bodhisattvas the eight vajrapanis the five hundred arhats the three thousand protectors the nuns monks lay people and all the holy hosts were standing beneath the sevenprecious lotus throne listening to the Tathagata expounding the Dharma This is what he was explaining
Journey to the West There is existence in nonexistence nonexistence in nonnonexistence
There is matter in nonmatter emptiness in nonemptiness
What exists is nonexistent and what does not exist is not nonexistent
Nonmatter is matter nonemptiness is emptiness
Emptiness is emptiness and matter is matter
Matter is not permanent matter matter is empty
Emptiness is not permanent emptiness emptiness is matter Know that emptiness is not empty and that matter is not matter
This is what is meant by insight and understanding the Wonderful Voice
All the host kowtowed in submission Amid the sound of chanting the Tathagata released a shower of heavenly petals left his throne and said to them You are all of one mind
Watch the struggle of two minds coming here They all raised their eyes to look and saw the two Monkeys come shouting and yelling to the holy Thunder Peak
The eight vajrapanis were so alarmed that they stepped forward to block their way and say Where do you two think you are going This evil spirit has turned himself into my double Monkey replied so I wish to go to the lotus throne to ask the Tathagata to tell that I am the real Sun Wukong and he is an impostor As the vajrapanis could not stop them they yelled at each other right to the foot of the lotus throne where they kowtowed and each of them said Your disciple has been escorting the Tang Priest here to fetch the true scriptures Goodness only knows how much effort I've spent dealing with demons and capturing monsters along the way
Recently we were robbed by bandits and I admit that I did twice kill some of them
The master was so angry with me that he sent me back and wouldn't let me come with him to worship your golden self
The only thing I could do was to go back to the Southern Ocean to tell my troubles to Guanyin
I never imagined that this evil spirit would make himself look and sound just like me knock the master over and steal our luggage
My brother Friar Sand went to my mountain looking for me and this monster talked a whole lot of fancy nonsense about having his own holy monk to go and fetch the scriptures
When Friar Sand got away and fled to the Southern Ocean to tell the whole story to Guanyin she sent us both back to my mountain
After that the two of us the real me and the impostor side by side fought our way to the Southern Ocean Heaven the Tang Priest and the Underworld but nobody could tell which of us was which
That is why I've had the effrontery to come here to beg you in your infinite charity and mercy to identify me as the true Sun Wukong Then I'll be able to escort the Tang Priest here to worship you in person and fetch the scriptures to take back to the East so that the great teachings will be made known for ever Hearing the two of them saying the same things in the same voice none of the host could tell them apart
only the Tathagata himself knew He was just about to expose the impostor when a coloured cloud brought Guanyin from the South to see our Buddha
Noble Guanyin said our Buddha putting his hands together in front of his chest can you tell the true Sun the Novice from the false one I could not tell them apart when they visited my island the Bodhisattva replied
Since then they have been to Heaven and the Underworld and still nobody could say which was which
That is why I have come to beg you Tathagata to identify the true Sun Wukong To this the Buddha replied with a smile You all have very great dharma powers but you can only scan everything that happens under the sky
You cannot know all the creatures and categories under the sky When the Bodhisattva asked what these categories were the Buddha replied There are five kinds of immortal heavenly earthly divine human and demonic
There are five kinds of beast snail scaly furry feathered and insect
This wretch is not heavenly earthly divine human or demonic He is not a snail or Journey to the West scaly or furry or feathered or an insect
Now there are also four kinds of ape that cause confusion and don't come under any of the ten categories May I ask what these four kinds of ape are the Bodhisattva asked
The first kind is the intelligent stone monkey the Buddha replied He can do all kinds of transformation knows all about the seasons of Heaven and earthly advantages and can move the stars and their constellations about
The second kind is the redrumped mandril that knows all about the Yin and the Yang and human affairs can go into or out of anywhere and knows how to prolong its life and avoid death
The third kind is the magicarmed gibbon that can catch the sun or moon shrink mountains see what is auspicious and what is not and fool around with heaven and earth
The fourth kind is the sixeared macaque which has wonderful hearing and perception It knows about the past and the future and understands all creatures
These four kinds of ape do not come within any of the ten categories and are not listed among the creatures that live between heaven and earth
I can see that the false Sun Wukong is just such a sixeared macaque
Wherever he stands he can know what is happening hundreds of miles away and hear everything that is said
That is why he has such wonderful hearing brilliant perception and knowledge of the past the future and all beings that is why he looks and sounds just like Wukong
He is a sixeared macaque As soon as the macaque heard the Tathagata Buddha say who he really was he started shaking with fear and took a great leap to get away
The Tathagata at once ordered his hosts to strike and the macaque was immediately surrounded by the four Bodhisattvas eight vajrapanis five hundred arhats three thousand protectors and all the monks nuns and lay people as well as Guanyin and Moksa
The Great Sage Monkey rushed forward too Don't hit him Wukong said the Tathagata
I shall capture him for you The macaque's fur stood on end as he realized that there would be no escape so he shook himself and turned straight into a bee who started to fly straight up only to fall down again as the Tathagata's golden begging bowl was clapped over him The host all thought he had got away
Stop talking said the Buddha with a smile
The evil spirit has not escaped
He is under my bowl They all surged forward to see him in his true form of a sixeared macaque as the bowl was lifted
The Great Sage could not restrain himself Swinging his iron cudgel he killed the demon with a single blow to the head and that is why this species is now extinct It was more than the Tathagata could bear
This is terrible he said this is terrible You shouldn't be sorry for him said the Great Sage
He wounded my master and stole our bundles
According to the law he should get his head cut off for wounding in the course of theft and daylight robbery Go back at once to escort the Tang Priest here to fetch the scriptures said the Tathagata
The Great Sage kowtowed to him in thanks and said I wish to report to the Tathagata that my master definitely refuses to have me The journey would be a lot of trouble for nothing
I beg you in your kindness Tathagata to say the Bandloosening Spell Then I can take this gold band off and give it back to you and you can let me return to lay life Stop those silly ideas and behave yourself said the Tathagata
I shall send Guanyin to take you back to him Of course he'll accept you
Protect him well and when you succeed and reach ultimate bliss there will be a place on a lotus throne for you too Journey to the West When the Bodhisattva Guanyin heard this she put her hands together to thank him for his mercy then took Wukong off by cloud followed by Moksa and the white parrot
They were soon back at the thatched cottage by the road
As soon as Friar Sand saw them he hurried out to ask the master to greet the Bodhisattva at the door
Tang Priest she said it was a sixeared macaque pretending to be Wukong who hit you the other day
Fortunately the Tathagata could tell who he was and Wukong has now killed him You must now take Wukong back
There are many demon obstacles on the way ahead and you must have his protection if you are to reach Vulture Peak see the Buddha and fetch the scriptures so stop being angry with him I shall respectfully obey Sanzang replied
Just as he was kowtowing in thanks there was the roar of a whirlwind from the East carrying Pig with the two bundles on his back
Seeing the Bodhisattva the idiot kowtowed to her and said Your disciple left the master the other day and went back to the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit to look for this luggage I found the imitation Tang Priest and imitation Pig and killed the pair of them They were both monkeys
Then I went inside and found the bundles Nothing's missingI've checked them over So I came straight back by wind
What happened to the two Monkeys The Bodhisattva then told him how the Tathagata had told the two of them apart
The idiot was delighted and gave thanks at great length
Master and disciples then said farewell to the Bodhisattva who went back to the sea
The four of them were now once more of a single will and a single mind all grievances had been washed away and anger removed
They thanked their hosts in the thatched cottage retied the luggage saddled up the horse and headed West
Indeed A separation on the journey muddled the Five Elements At the demonsubduing gathering enlightenment returned
The spirit returned to the house of the mind and dhyana was calmed When the six perceptions were controlled the elixir was completed
If you don't know how long it was till Sanzang saw the Buddha and asked for the scriptures after setting out again listen to the explanation in the next installment
Sanzang's Way Is Blocked at the Fiery Mountains Monkey First Tries to Borrow the Plantain Fan The many species are at root the same Journey to the West All flows into the boundless sea
Every thought and worry is in vain All types and forms together blend
When the achievement is complete Great will be the full and shining dharma Do not allow your differences to divide
Keep everything together Gather all into the elixir furnace Refine it till it is red as darkest gold
Then in its brilliance and beauty On dragons it may ride at will
The story tells how Sanzang took back Brother Monkey as the Bodhisattva had instructed him and headed towards the Western Heaven united in heart with Pig and Friar Sand They were no longer in two minds and the ape and the horse were firmly under control
Time shot by like an arrow days and nights alternated with the speed of a shuttle
After the scorching heat of summer they were now in the frosts of late autumn
What they saw was The sparse clouds blown away by the wild West wind Cranes calling in the distant hills amid the frosty woods
This is a chilly time When mountain rivers seem longer than ever
The swan returns through the Northern frontier passes Migrating birds go back to their Southern fields
The traveler feels lonely on the road Monastic robes do not keep out the cold
Journey to the West As master and disciples pressed ahead they began to feel hotter and hotter in the warm air
It is autumn now so why is it getting hotter again Sanzang asked reining in his horse
Don't know said Pig
There's a country in the West Sihali where the sun sets People call it 'the end of the sky'
At about six o'clock every evening the king sends people on the city walls to band drums and blow bugles to cover the sound of the sea boiling
That's because when the fire of the sun falls into the Western Ocean there's a great seething noise like something burning being plunged into water
If they didn't cover the noise with their drums and bugles the shock would kill all the little children in the city
That's where I think we arethe place where the sun sets When the Great Sage heard this he could not help laughing Don't talk such nonsense you idiot
We're a long way from Sihali yet
The way our master keeps dithering and changing his mind we won't get there in three lifetimes even if we go on from childhood to old age then to childhood again and then to another old age and a third childhood Tell me then brother said Pig if this isn't where the sun sets why's it so scorching hot The seasons must be out of joint said Friar Sand
I expect they're following summer rituals here although it's autumn Just as the three disciples were arguing they saw a farm by the side of the road
It had a red tiled roof red brick walls and red painted doors windows and furniture It was red everywhere
Wukong said Sanzang dismounting go to that house and find out why it's so burning hot The Great Sage put his goldbanded cudgel away neatened his clothes and swaggered along the road like a fine gentleman
When he reached the gate to have a look an old man suddenly appeared from inside This is what he looked like He wore a robe of hempcloth Not quite brown or red A sunhat of woven bamboo In between black and green
The knobby stick in his hand Was neither crooked nor straight His long boots of leather Were not new but not yet old
His face was the color of copper His beard bleached white like yarn
Long eyebrows shaded his jadeblue eyes And his smile showed golden teeth
Journey to the West The old man had a shock when he looked up to see Monkey Where are you from you freak he asked steadying himself on his stick
What are you doing at my gate Venerable patron replied Monkey with a bow don't be afraid I'm no freak
My master and we three disciples have been sent by the Great Tang emperor in the East to fetch the scriptures from the West
As we've now reached your residence I have come to ask you why it's so boiling hot here and what this place is called Only then did the old man stop feeling worried and reply with a smile Please don't take offence reverend sir
My old eyes are rather dim and I failed to recognize your distinguished self There's no need to be so polite said Monkey
Which road is your master on the old man asked
That's him standing on the main road due South Monkey replied
Ask him over ask him over the old man replied to Monkey's pleasure
Monkey waved to them and Sanzang came over with Pig and Friar Sand leading the white horse and carrying the luggage They all bowed to the old man
The old man was at the same time delighted by Sanzang's fine appearance and alarmed by Pig's and Friar Sand's remarkable ugliness
Inviting them in he told the younger members of the family to bring tea and cook a meal
Hearing all this Sanzang rose to his feet to thank the old man and ask Could you tell me sir why it has turned so hot again although it is autumn now These are the Fiery Mountains the old man replied We don't have springs or autumns here
It's hot all the year round Where are the mountains Sanzang asked
Do they block the way to the West It's impossible to get to the West the old man replied
The mountains are about twenty miles from here You have to cross them to get to the West but they're over  miles of flame Not a blade of grass can grow anywhere around
Even if you had a skull of bronze and a body of iron you would melt trying to cross them This answer made Sanzang turn pale with horror he dared not to ask any more questions
Just then a young man pushing a red barrow stopped by the gate shouting Cakes
Cakes The Great Sage pulled out one of his hairs and turned it into a copper coin with which he bought a cake off the young man
The man accepted the money and without a worry he lifted the cover off his barrow to release a cloud of hot steam took out a cake and passed it to Monkey
When Monkey took it in his hand it was as hot as a burning coal or a redhot nail in a furnace
Just look at him as he keeps tossing the cake from one hand to another shouting It's hot it's hot I can't eat it If you can't stand heat don't come here the young man replied
It's always this hot here You don't understand at all my lad said Monkey
As the saying goes If it's never too cold and it's never too hot Journey to the West The five kinds of grain will be harvested not If it's so hot here how do you get the flour to make your cakes To this the young man said You ask me where we can obtain the flour for the pan
Politely we request it from Immortal Iron Fan What can you tell me about this immortal Monkey asked
The immortal has a plantain fan the young man replied If you ask it to the fan puts out the fire at the first wave makes a wind blow at the second wave and brings rain at the third wave
That is how we can sow and reap the crops to support ourselves
Without it nothing would be able to grow On hearing this Monkey rushed back inside gave the cakes to Sanzang and said Don't worry Master Don't get upset about what's going to happen the year after next
East these cakes up and I'll tell you all about it Sanzang took the cakes and said to the old man Please have a cake sir I could not possibly eat one of your cakes before we've offered you any of our tea and food the old man replied
Sir Monkey replied there's no need to give us food or tea But could you tell me where the Iron Fan Immortal lives What do you want to know about the immortal for the old man asked
The cakeseller told me just now that the immortal has a plantain fan said Monkey
If you borrow it the first wave puts the fire out the second raises a wind and the third brings rain That's why you're able to sow and reap the crops to support yourselves
I want to go to ask the immortal to come so we can put out the flames on the Fiery Mountains and cross them
And you'll be able to sow reap and live in peace It's a nice idea said the old man but as you have no presents the immortal wouldn't come What sort of presents would be wanted Sanzang asked
Every ten years the old man replied we go to visit the immortal
We take four pigs and four sheep all decorated with flowers and red ribbons delicious fruit in season chickens geese and the best wine We bathe ourselves and go very reverently to pay a respectful visit to the mountain and ask the immortal to leave the cave and come here to perform magic Where is this mountain Monkey asked
What's it called
How far is it from here
I'm going there to ask for the fan It lies Southwest of here the old man said and it's called Mount Turquoise Cloud
When we believers go to worship at the magic mountain the journey takes us a month as it's about  miles altogether No problem said Monkey
I can be there and back in no time Journey to the West Wait a minute said the old man Have something to eat and drink first and we'll get some provisions ready for the journey You'll need two people to go with you
Nobody lives along the way and there are many wolves and tigers It'll take you many a day to get there
You must be serious about it No need said Monkey with a laugh no need
I'm off As soon as he had said that he disappeared
My lord the old man said in astonishment
He's a god who can ride clouds We shall say no more of how the family redoubled their offerings to the Tang Priest but tell of Monkey who arrived at Mount Turquoise Cloud in an instant brought his auspicious light to a stop and started looking for the entrance to the cave He heard the sound of an axe and saw a woodcutter felling a tree in the forest on the mountainside Hurrying forward Monkey heard him saying
I recognize the ancient woods amid the clouds The path is overgrown the hillside steep
From Western hills I see the morning rain Returning to the South the ford's too deep Going closer to the woodman Monkey said Greetings woodman Putting down his axe the woodcutter returned his courtesy and asked him where he was going
May I ask if this is Mount Turquoise Cloud said Monkey
Yes the woodcutter replied
Where is the Iron Fan Immortal's Plantain Cave Monkey asked
There's a Plantain Cave here the woodcutter replied but no Iron Fan Immortal only a Princess Iron Fan
She's also called Raksasi They say the immortal has a plantain fan that can put out the flames of the Fiery Mountains
Is that her Yes yes the woodman said
She's a sage and she has this treasure that puts out fire Because she protects the people who live over yonder they call her the Iron Fan Immortal
We have no need of her here so we just call her Raksasi She's the wife of the Bull Demon King Monkey went pale with shock at the news Another person who's got it in for me he thought
When I subdued the Red Boy the other year he said this bitch was his mother
When I met the Red Boy's uncle at Childfree Cave on Mount Offspring Dissolved he refused me the water and wanted revenge
Now I'm up against his parents
How am I ever going to borrow the fan Seeing Monkey deep in thought and sighing endlessly the woodcutter said with a smile Venerable sir you're a man of religion You shouldn't have any worries
Just follow this path East and you'll be at the Journey to the West Plantain Cave within a couple of miles I'll be frank with you woodcutter said Monkey
I'm the senior disciple of the Tang Priest who has been sent by the Tang emperor in the East to go to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven The other year I had words with Raksasi's son Red Boy at the Firecloud Cave and I'm afraid that Raksasi may refuse to let me have the fan because she's still nursing a grudge That's why I'm worried A real man knows how to play it by ear the woodcutter replied Just ask for the fan Forget about your old quarrel
I'm sure you'll be able to borrow it Monkey made a respectful chant and said Thank you very much for your advice
I'm off Brother Monkey then took his leave of the woodcutter and went straight to the mouth of the Plantain Cave
Both doors were tightly shut and the scenery outside was magnificent
It was a splendid place
Indeed The rocks were the hones of the mountain And also the spirit of the earth
Clouds at sunset held night rain And mosses lent the freshness of their green
The towering peaks outdid those of Penglai The fragrant calm was like a magic island's
Wild cranes were perching in the lofty pines While warblers sang in the weeping willows
This was indeed an ancient site The home of immortals for ten thousand years
The resplendent phoenix sang in the parasol trees While azure dragons hid in the running waters
Vines hung over the winding paths And creepers covered the steps of stone
Apes on the cliffs screeched to welcome the rising moon In tall trees birds sang for joy at the clear blue sky
The groves of bamboo were as cool as if it had rained Journey to the West The flowers along the path were embroidered velvet
At times a cloud of white would blow from a distant peak It had no single form as it drifted in the wind
Open up Brother Bull Monkey shouted as he went up to the doors
They opened with a creak and out came a young girl carrying a flower basket in her hand and hoe over her shoulder
Indeed Though clad in rags and dressed in no fine array Her face was full of spirit her heart set on the Way
Monkey went up to her with his hands together in front of his chest and said Would you kindly tell the princess that I'm a monk going to the West to fetch the scriptures I'm here to beg the loan of her plantain fan as we can't get across the Fiery Mountains What monastery are you from the girl asked and what is your name
Please tell me so that I can announce you I'm from the East Monkey replied and my name is Sun Wukong The girl went back into the cave knelt to the princess and said Your Highness there's a monk from the East called Sun Wukong outside who would like to see you to ask for the loan of the plantain fan to cross the Fiery Mountains The name Sun Wukong was like a pinch of salt thrown into a flame or oil poured on a fire Her face went bright red and evil anger flared up in her heart
So that damned monkey's here at last she said with hatred
Girl she shouted fetch me my armor and my weapons She then put on her armor tied her pair of bluetipped swords at her waist fastened it all firmly and went out
Monkey slipped over to the entrance to see what she looked like and this is what he saw
A flowered kerchief tied around her head A cloudpatterned robe of quilted brocade
A belt of two tiger sinews round her waist Revealing a skirt of embroidered silk
Her shoes like phoenix beaks were but three inches long Her trousers in dragonbeard style were adorned with gold
Brandishing her swords she gave out angry shouts Journey to the West She looked as lethal as the goddess of the moon
Where's Sun Wukong Raksasi shouted as she came out of her cave
Monkey stepped forward bowed and replied Monkey offers his respectful greetings sisterinlaw I'm no sisterinlaw of yours she shouted angrily and I'll have no greetings from you Your worthy husband the Bull Demon King was once my sworn brother Monkey replied There were seven of us altogether
As I learn that you are my brother Bull's good lady of course I must call you sisterinlaw Damned ape said Raksasi if you're my husband's sworn brother why did you have to do that terrible thing to our boy Who is your son Monkey asked as if he did not know
He's the Red Boy the Boy Sage King of the Firecloud Cave by Withered Pine Ravine on Mount Hao Raksasi replied
You ruined him and now you've come to our door to pay with your life We've been longing to get our revenge on you but didn't know where to find you
You'll get no mercy from me Putting on the broadest of smiles Monkey replied You haven't gone into it thoroughly enough sisterinlaw
You've no reason to be so angry with me Your good son had captured my master and would have steamed or boiled him if the Bodhisattva hadn't taken the boy as his disciple and rescued my master
He's now the page Sudhana on the Bodhisattva's island and he's accepted the pursuit of the true reward from her He is now beyond life and death and above filth and purity He will live as long as heaven earth the sun and the moon
But far from thanking me for saving his life you're getting angry at me
That's wrong of you You smoothtongued ape Raksasi snapped back
My boy may be alive but when is he ever going to come here
When am I going to see him again It'll be easy for you to see your son again Monkey replied still smiling
Just lend me the fan to put the fires out When I've taken my master across the mountains I'll go to the Bodhisattava's place in the Southern Ocean and ask him to come here to see you and give your fan back No problem
Then you'll be able to see that he's completely unharmed
If he'd been wounded at all you'd have had every right to be angry with me
But he's as handsome as ever You ought to be thanking me To this Raksasi's reply was
Shut up ape fiend Stick your head out for me to hack with my sword If you can stand the pain I'll lend you the plantain fan
If you can't you'll be going straight down to Hell to see King Yama Monkey then clasped his hands together in front of him and replied with a smile Enough said sisterinlaw
I'll stretch my bald head out and you can take as many hacks as you like until you're exhausted
But you must lend me the fan With no more argument Raksasi swung both of her swords around and brought them down with loud thunks a dozen or more times on Monkey's head He was not bothered at all
Raksasi was so frightened by this that she turned to run away
Where are you going sisterinlaw Monkey said
Hurry up and lend me that fan Journey to the West My treasure isn't something to be lent out casually Raksasi replied
Well said Monkey if you refuse now you'll just have to try a taste of your brotherinlaw's cudgel The splendid Monkey King held on to her with one hand while pulling his cudgel out from his ear with the other With one wave it became as thick as a ricebowl
Raksasi broke free from his grip and raised her swords to strike back at him
Monkey started swinging his cudgel to hit her with and the fight began in front of Mount Turquoise Cloud All talk of kinship was forgotten and their minds full of hatred alone
It was a fine battle The woman had worked hard to make herself a monster She loathed the ape and would avenge her son
Although Monkey was seething with fury He would have made concessions for his master's sake
First he had asked to borrow the plantain fan Being patient and gentle not fierce
In ignorance Raksasi hacked with her sword While Monkey decided to speak of kinship
Women should never fight with men For men are harder and can crush them
Terrible was the goldbanded cudgel Fine were the movements of the blue frostbladed sword With blows to face and head As both of them grimly refused to yield
Blocking to left and right they used their martial skill Great was the cunning with which they stood or fell back
Just when they both were beginning to enjoy themselves The sun set in the Western sky before they noticed
Raksasi made ghosts and deities feel small With many a wave of her true magic fan Journey to the West Raksasi and Monkey fought it out till evening As Monkey's cudgel struck so hard and his technique was so flawless she realized that she would never be able to beat him She brought out her plantain fan and with a single wave blew Monkey right out of sight There was no way he could stand his ground
With that she went back to her cave in triumph
The Great Sage was thrown around in the air unable to come down to earth or find any refuge
He was like a dead leaf in a whirlwind or a fallen blossom carried along by a torrent
Only after a whole night's buffeting did he manage to land on a mountain the next morning and hold on hard to a rock by putting both arms round it
He needed a long time to calm himself and take a good look around before he realized that he was on Little Mount Sumeru
What a terrible woman he said to himself with a deep sigh
How ever did she get me here
I remember coming here once to ask the Bodhisattva Lingji to subdue the Yellow Wind Monster and rescue my master
The Yellow Wind Ridge is over a thousand miles South of here so as I've been blown back from the West I must have come thousands and thousands of miles
I'll go down and find out some more from the Bodhisattva Lingji before I go back Just as he was making his mind up he heard a resounding gong so he hurried down the mountain and straight to the dhyana monastery
The lay brother on the gate recognized Monkey and went in to announce The hairyfaced Great Sage who asked the Bodhisattva to subdue the Yellow Wind Monster some years back is here again Realizing that this must be Sun Wukong the Bodhisattva hurried down from his throne to greet him and lead him inside with the words Allow me to congratulate you
I suppose you have fetched the scriptures now It'll be a long time yet said Monkey a long time But why are you visiting my mountain if you have yet to reach the Thunder Monastery the Bodhisattva asked
Since in your great kindness you subdued the Yellow Wind Monster for me some years ago Monkey replied goodness only knows how much we've suffered on our journey
Now we are at the Fiery Mountains but we can't cross them When I asked the local people they told me about an Iron Fan Immortal who had an iron fan that could put the fires out
I went to visit the immortal only to discover that she's the wife of the Bull Demon King and the Red Boy's mother
I told her that her son is now Guanyin Bodhisattva's page but she has it in for me because she can't see him She refused to lend me her fan and fought me
When she realized that my cudgel was too much for her she waved her fan and sent me hurling through the air till I landed here
That's why I've come blundering into your monastery to ask the way back
How far is it from here to the Fiery Mountains The woman is called Raksasi or Princess Iron Fan replied Lingji with a smile
That plantain fan of hers is a miraculous treasure formed by heaven and earth behind Mount Kunlun ever since primal chaos was first separated This leaf is the very essence of the negative Yin principle which is why it can put out fire
If she fans somebody with it he'll be blown  miles before that negative wind drops
But this mountain of mine is only some  miles from the Fiery Mountains You must have stopped here because you have the power to delay clouds Great Sage
No ordinary mortal would have been able to stop She's terrible said Monkey How ever is my master going to get across those mountains Journey to the West Don't worry Great Sage Lingji replied
The Tang Priest is fated to succeed on this journey with you How can you tell Monkey asked
Many years age when the Tathagata gave me his instructions Lingji replied he presented me with a Windfixing Pill and a Flying Dragon Staff
The Flying Dragon Staff was used to subdue the Yellow Wind Monster but I haven't yet tried out the Windfixing Pill and I'll give it to you today It'll stop the fan from being able to move you You'll just have to ask to get it and put the fire out with it
You'll have an instant success Monkey bowed deeply and expressed profound thanks
The Bodhisattva then produced a brocade bag from his sleeve and took out of it the Windfixing Pill This he gave to Monkey to sew up securely inside the lapel of his tunic I won't detain you here any longer Lingji said as he saw Monkey out through doors
Head Northwest and that will get you to Raksasi's mountain Taking his leave of Lingji Monkey rode his somersault cloud straight back to Mount Turquoise Cloud and was there in a moment
Open up open up he shouted hammering on the doors with his iron cudgel
Monkey's here to borrow the fan This so alarmed the servant girl inside the doors that she ran back and reported Your Highness he's here to borrow the fan again The news frightened Raksasi who thought That damned monkey really has got some powers
If I fan anyone else with my treasure they go  miles before stopping
How can he be back so soon after being blown away
This time I'll fan him two or three times and he'll never be able to find his way back here She sprang to her feet tied all her armor firmly on and went out of the cave with her swords in her hands shouting Sun the Novice aren't you afraid of me
Why have you come back here to get yourself killed Don't be so stingy sisterinlaw said Monkey with a smile You've got to lend me it I'll bring it back as soon as I've escorted the Tang Priest across the Fiery Mountains I give you my word as a gentleman
I'm not the sort of low creature who borrows things but doesn't give them back Damned macaque Raksasi shouted back
You're outrageous and you understand nothing
I've got to avenge the loss of my son so how could I possibly be prepared to lend you my fan
Clear off if you don't want a taste of my sword The Great Sage not at all afraid struck back at her hands with his iron cudgel and the two of them fought six or seven rounds
By then Raksasi's arms were becoming too tired to wield the swords while Brother Monkey was feeling strong and fighting well
Seeing that the balance of the fight was tilting against her Raksasi took out the fan and fanned it once in Monkey's direction
He stood unmoved put his iron cudgel away and said with a chuckle This time it's different Fan as much as you like If I move an inch I'm no man She fanned twice more and still he did not move
By now she was so alarmed that she put her pride and joy away at once went straight back into the cave and shut the doors firmly When Monkey saw this he used magic
He tore the lapel of his tunic open put the Windfixing Pill in his mouth shook himself turned into the tiniest of insects and squeezed in through the crack between the doors where he saw Raksasi shouting I'm thirsty I'm thirsty
Quick bring me some tea The servant girl who attended her fetched a pot of the best tea and poured a large cup of it so noisily that the surface was frothy Monkey was delighted
With a quiet buzz of his wings he flew under the froth
Raksasi was so parched that she drained the tea in two gulps
Once inside her stomach Monkey reverted to his own form and shouted at the top of his voice Sisterinlaw lend me the fan Journey to the West Raksasi went pale with shock
Little ones she called to her underlings are the front doors shut Yes they all said
If the doors are shut then how can Sun the Novice be inside the cave and shouting she asked
He's shouting from inside you the servant girl replied
Where are you playing your conjuring tricks Sun the Novice Raksasi asked
I've never been able to do conjuring tricks in all my life Monkey replied My magic and my powers are all real I'm fooling around in your own insides good sisterinlaw I've just seen your lungs and your liver
I know you're very hungry and thirsty so I'll give you a bowlful to quench your thirst With that he stamped his foot giving Raksasi an unbearable cramp in her stomach that left her sitting groaning on the floor
Don't try to say no sisterinlaw Monkey then said
I'm giving you a pastry in case you're hungry He butted upwards causing such a violent heart pain that she could only roll around on the ground her face sallow and her lips white from agony Spare me brotherinlaw spare me was all she could say Only then did Monkey stop hitting and kicking
So you call me brotherinlaw now do you he said
I'll spare your life for my brother Bull's sake
Get me the fan and quick You shall have it brotherinlaw you shall have it she said
Come out and get it Fetch it and show it to me Monkey said
She told the servant girl to fetch a plantain fan and stand holding it beside her
Monkey poked his head up her throat to see it and said As I'm sparing your life sisterinlaw I won't smash my way out under your ribs I'll come out through your mouth
Open wide three times With that Raksasi opened her mouth and Monkey turned back into the tiny insect to fly out and alight on the fan
Not realizing what had happened Raksasi went on to open her mouth twice more Come out brotherinlaw she said
Monkey turned back into himself took the fan and said Here I am
Thanks for the loan With that he strode forward while the underlings opened the doors to let him out of the cave
The Great Sage then turned his cloud around and headed back East A moment later he had landed the cloud and was standing by the red brick wall Pig was very pleased indeed to see him Master he said Monkey's here
He's back Sanzang went out with the old man of the farm and Friar Sand to greet him and they all went back inside
Propping the fan against the wall Monkey asked Tell me sir is this the fan Yes yes the old man said
This is a great achievement disciple said Sanzang
Fetching this treasure must have cost you a great deal of trouble No trouble at all said Monkey
Do you know who that Iron Fan Immortal is
She's Raksasi the wife of the Bull Demon King and the Red Boy's mother Her other name is Princess Iron Fan
I found her outside her cave and asked to borrow the fan but all she could talk of were her old grudges
She took a few cuts at me Journey to the West with her swords but when I gave her a bit of a scare with the cudgel she fanned me with the fan and blew me all the way to Little Mount Sumeru
I was lucky enough to be able to see the Bodhisattva Lingji who gave me a tablet that stops winds and showed me the way back to Mount Turquoise Cloud
Then I saw Raksasi again but this time her fan did not move me an inch so she went back into her cave and I turned into a tiny insect to fly back in after her
When the damned womanasked for some tea I slipped in under the froth at the top got inside her and started giving her a few punches and kicks
She couldn't take the pain She kept saying 'Spare me brotherinlaw spare me' As she agreed to lend me the fan I spared her life and took the fan
I'll give it back to her after we've crossed the Fiery Mountains When Sanzang heard this he was extremely grateful
Master and disciples then took their leave of the old man and traveled about fifteen miles West The heat was becoming unbearable
The soles of my feet are being roasted Friar Sand complained
My trotters are getting burnt and it hurts said Pig
The horse was going much faster than usual too The ground was so hot that they could not stop but every step was painful
Please dismount Master said Monkey and brothers stay here while I use the fan to put the fire out
When the wind and the rain come the ground will be a lot cooler and we'll be able to get across the mountains He then raised the fan and fanned it hard once in the direction of the fire
tongues of flame rose above the mountains
He fanned again and they were a hundred times as high
He fanned a third time and now they were a couple of miles high and beginning to burn him
Monkey fled but not before two patches of fur had been burnt away
He ran straight back to the Tang Priest and said Hurry back hurry back the flames are coming The master remounted and headed back East with Pig and Friar Sand some seven miles before stopping and asking What happened Wukong It's the wrong one Monkey said flinging the fan down it's the wrong one
The damned woman fooled me When Sanzang heard this he frowned and felt thoroughly depressed What are we to do he sobbed the tears flowing freely down his cheeks
Brother said Pig why did you come back in such a mad rush and send us back here The first time I fanned there were flames Monkey replied the second time the fire got fiercer and the third time the flames were a couple of miles high
If I hadn't run fast all my fur would have been burnt off But you're always telling us that you can't be hurt by thunder and lightning and that fire can't burn you said Pig with a laugh How come you're afraid of fire now Idiot said Monkey you don't understand anything
The other times I was ready that's why I wasn't hurt
Today I didn't make any flameavoiding spells or use magic to defend myself
That's why two patches of my fur were singed If the fire's so fierce and there's no other way to the West what are we going to do Friar Sand asked
We'll just have to find somewhere where there isn't any fire Pig replied Which way will that be Sanzang asked
East North or South there's no fire those ways said Pig
But which way are the scriptures Journey to the West Only in the West Pig replied
I only want to go where the scriptures are Sanzang said We're well and truly struck said Friar Sand
Where there are scriptures there's fire and where there's no fire there are no scriptures While master and disciples were talking this nonsense they heard someone call Don't get upset Great Sage
Come and have some vegetarian food before you take your discussions any further The four of them looked round to see an old man wearing a cloak that floated in the wind and a hat the shape of a half moon In his hand he held a dragonheaded stick and on his legs were boots of iron
With him was a demon with the beak of an eagle and the cheeks of a fish carrying on his head a copper bowl full of steamed buns millet cakes cooked millet and rice
The old man bowed to them on the road to the West and said I am the local god of the Fiery Mountains As I know that you are escorting this holy monk Great Sage and can't go any further I have brought this meal as an offering Eating doesn't matter Monkey replied
When are these fires going to be put out so that my master can cross the mountains If you want to put the fires out you must first ask Raksasi to lend you the plantain fan the local god said
Monkey went to the side of the path picked the fan up and said This is it isn't it
The more I fan the flames the more fiercely they burn
Why Because it's not the real one said the local deity with a laugh when he looked at it
She fooled you Then how am I to get the real one Monkey said
The local god bowed again and had a slight smile on his face as he replied If you want to borrow the real plantain fan you will have to ask the Strongarm King If you don't know all about the Strongarm King listen to the explanation in the next installment
The Bull Demon King Gives Up the Fight to Go to a Feast Monkey Tries the Second Time to Borrow the Plantain Fan The Strongarm King is the Bull Demon King the local god explained
Did he set these mountains ablaze and pretend they were the Fiery Mountains Monkey asked
No no the local god replied
If you'll promise to forgive me for doing so Great Sage I'll speak frankly What's there to forgive Monkey said
Speak frankly You started this fire Great Sage the local god replied Journey to the West That's nonsense said Monkey angrily I wasn't here
Do you take me for an arsonist You don't realize who I am the local god said
These mountains haven't always been here
When you made havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago and were captured by the Illustrious Sage Erlang you were escorted to Lord Lao Zi put in the Eight Trigrams Furnace and refined
When the furnace was opened you kicked it over and some of its bricks that still had fire in them fell here as the Fiery Mountains
I used to be one of the Taoist boys who looked after the furnace in the Tushita Palace but Lord Lao Zi was so angry with me for failing in my duty that he sent me down to be the local god here I was wondering why you were dressed like that said Pig forcefully you're a Taoist turned local god Tell me why I need to find the Strongarm King said Monkey only halfconvinced
He's Raksasi's husband the local god said
He's abandoned her now and gone to live in the Cloudtouching Cave in Mount Thunder Piled
A fox king there who'd lived for ten thousand years died leaving an only daughter Princess Jade with property worth a million but nobody to manage it
Two years ago she visited the Bull Demon King and found out about his tremendous magical powers She decided to give him her property if he'd come to live in her cave as her husband
So the Bull Demon King abandoned Raksasi and hasn't been back to see her for ages
If you can find him Great Sage and persuade him to come here you'll be able to borrow the real fan First you'll be able to blow the flames out to take your master across the mountains
Second you'll put an end to this disastrous fire so that the land here can come back to life
And third I'll be pardoned and allowed to go back to Heaven and return to live under Lord Lao Zi's command Where is Mount Thunder Piled and how far is it from here Due South the local deity said and over a thousand miles Once he knew this Monkey told Friar Sand and Pig to look after the master and ordered the local god to stay with them
There was then a roaring like the wind as he disappeared
In less than an hour he saw a high mountain that touched the sky
Bringing his cloud down he stood on the peak to look around and this is what he saw Was it tall Its peak touched the azure sky
Was it big Its roots went down to the Yellow Springs
While the sun warmed the front of the mountain The winds behind the ridge blew cold
On the sunwarmed front of the mountain The flowers and trees never knew what winter was In the cold winds behind the ridge Journey to the West The ice and frost did not even melt in summer
From a dragon pool a river flowed in gullies Flowers bloomed early by the tiger's cave in the crag
The river split into a thousand jade streams The flowers bloomed together like brocade
On the twisting ridge grew twisted trees Beside the knotted rocks were knotted pines
Indeed there were A high mountain Steep ridges Sheer precipices Fragrant flowers Fine fruit Red creepers Purple bamboo Green pines Turquoise willows
It looked the same throughout the seasons Changeless forever like a dragon
After looking for a long time the Great Sage walked down from the towering peak to find his way through the mountain
Just when he was feeling bewildered a slender young woman came towards him holding a spray of fragrant orchid
The Great Sage slipped behind a grotesque rock and took a good look at her This is what she was like A ravishing beauty to enchant a nation Walking so slowly on her little lotus feet
Journey to the West Her face was like Wang Qiang or the woman of Chu
She was a talking flower Scented jade
The hair was swept down from her coiffure like jadeblue crows The green of her eyes made one think of autumn floods
Her silken skirt showed a glimpse of tiny feet From her turquoise sleeves came long and elegant wrists
She would put anyone into the mood for love Red were her lips and white her pearly teeth
Her skin was as smooth and her brows as fine as the Jinjiang beauty She was more than a match for Wenjun or Xue Tao
As the young woman slowly approached the rock the Great Sage bowed to her and said Where are you going Bodhisattva Before he spoke she had not noticed him but when she looked up and saw how hideous the Great Sage was she was petrified unable to move forward or back All she could do was shiver and force herself to reply Where are you from
How dare you question me If I tell her about fetching the scriptures and borrowing the fan the Great Sage thought this damn woman might be some relation of the Bull Demon King's
I'd better pretend to be some kinsman of the Bull Demon King come to invite him to a banquet When he would not answer her questions the woman turned angry and shouted Who are you and how dare you question me I'm from Mount Turquoise Cloud Monkey replied with a bow and a forced smile I don't know the way as it's my first time here
Could I ask you Bodhisattva if this is Mount Thunder Piled It is she replied
Where might I find the Cloudtouching Cave the Great Sage asked
What do you want to find it for the woman asked
I've been sent by Princess Iron Fan in the Plantain Cave on Mount Turquoise Cloud with an invitation for the Bull Demon King Monkey replied
The moment the woman heard him speak of Princess Iron Fan sending an invitation to the Bull Demon King she flared into a rage and went crimson from ear to ear Journey to the West She ought to know better the low bitch
It's less than two years since the Bull Demon King came here and goodness only knows how much jewelry gold silver fine silk and brocade I've given her since then I send her firewood every year and rice every month She's doing nicely thank you
So what's the shameless hussy doing sending him an invitation When the Great Sage heard this and realized that she was Princess Jade he deliberately pulled out his iron cudgel and shouted at her You're a damned bitch using your wealth to buy the Bull Demon King You could only get him to marry you for your money
You ought to be thoroughly ashamed of yourself instead of being so insulting At this all of her souls sent flying and she fled trembling with terror stumbling and tripping over her shoes while the Great Sage ran after her shouting and roaring
Once they were out from under the shade of the pines they were at the entrance to the Cloudtouching Cave
She ran inside and the doors slammed shut behind her Only then did Monkey put his cudgel away and take a good look
A thick forest Sheer precipices Luxuriance of creepers Fragrance of orchids
The spring washed over jade and through bamboo Grotesque and cunning rocks held precious stones
The distant peaks were wreathed in mists Sun and moon lit up the cloudy crags
Dragons howled tigers roared Cranes called and warblers sang
Fresh and lovely was its elegant peace And the scenery was radiant with precious flowers
It was a match for Tiantai's magic caves And finer than the Peng and Ying islands in the sea
We will say nothing of how Brother Monkey admired the view but tell how the young woman dripping with sweat after running and her heart beating wildly from terror went straight to the study where the Bull Demon King was quietly perusing a book on cinnabar alchemy
She threw herself into his arms feeling thoroughly put out scratched and tugged at his face and ears and howled aloud
Journey to the West Don't upset yourself so my lovely said the Bull Demon King all smiles
What do you want to tell me She then began to prance and jump about in her fury as she said abusively You're killing me damned monster What makes you say that he asked all smiles
I brought you here to look after me and protect me because I'd lost my parents and people who'd been around all said that you were a tough guy she said
But you're just another henpecked hack The Bull Demon King took her in his arms and said How've I done you wrong my lovely
Take your time and tell me about it
I'll make it up to you I was taking a stroll among the flowers outside the cave just now picking orchids she said When a monk with a face like a thunder god rushed up to me and started bowing I was so scared I couldn't move
When I calmed down enough to ask him who he was he said he'd been sent by that Princess Iron Fan with an invitation for you
I was so angry I had something to say about that and he started abusing me and chased me with his cudgel
He'd have just about killed me with it if I hadn't run so fast So you see bringing you here was a disaster It's killing me At this the Bull Demon King apologized to her very earnestly
It took a long time and many tender attentions from his before she finally calmed down
I tell you the truth my lovely the demon king said forcefully
The Plantain Cave may be rather out of the way but it's a place of purity and elegance
That wife of mine has had the highest moral principles since childhood and she's also an immortal who has attained the Way She runs her household very strictly There's not even a page there She couldn't possibly have sent a monk with a face like a thunder god I wonder what evil fiend he is
He must have used her name to come and see me
I'm going out to have a look The splendid demon king strode out of the study and into the hall to put on his armor and take his iron cudgel
Who are you and why are you behaving so outrageously he shouted as he went out through the doors
Monkey who was watching from one side saw that he now looked quite different from the way he had five hundred years earlier
His wrought iron helmet shone like water or silver His golden armor was trimmed with silks and brocades The toes of his deerskin boots turned up their soles were white
The silken belt at his waist included three lion's tails
His eyes were as bright as mirrors His brows as elegant as red rainbows His mouth like a bowl of blood His teeth a row of copper plates
At his resounding roar the mountain gods took fright Journey to the West Evil ghosts were overawed by his majestic power
His fame was known throughout the seas for raising chaos He was the Strongarm Demon King here in the West
The Great Sage then tidied his clothes stepped forward chanted a deep reeer of respect and asked Can you still recognize me eldest brother Are you Sun Wukong the Great Sage Equaling Heaven the Bull Demon King replied returning his bow
Yes yes said Monkey
It's such a long time since last we met
I only got here to see you because I asked a woman some questions just now
I must congratulate you on how well everything is growing Cut that out the Bull Demon King shouted back
I heard about you making havoc in Heaven and being crushed under the Five Elements Mountain by the Lord Buddha Then you were released from your heavenly punishment to protect the Tang Priest on his way to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures in the Western Heaven Why did you have to destroy my son the Sage Boy Bullcalf I'm very angry with you
Why are you here looking for me Please don't misjudge me brother said the Great Sage with another bow
Your good son captured my master and was going to eat him I was no match for him Luckily the Bodhisattva Guanyin rescued my master and converted your boy He's now the page Sudhana He's even taller than you He lives in a temple of great bliss and enjoys eternal ease
There's nothing wrong with any of that so why be angry with me Smoothtongued macaque retorted the Bull Demon King
Even if you can talk your way out of having ruined my son what do you mean by upsetting my beloved concubine and chasing her up to my doors I made a polite inquiry of the lady because I could not find you Monkey replied
I never realized she was your second wife so when she was rude to me I acted rough
Please forgive me Very well then the Bull Demon King said
I'll let you off this time for the sake of our old friendship I'm very grateful indeed for your immense kindness the Great Sage replied
But there is one thing I'd like to trouble you with
I hope you'll be able to help me out You macaque the Bull Demon King shouted at him you think you can get away with anything I spare your life but instead of making yourself scarce you have to keep pestering me
What do you mean by helping out Let me be honest with you the Great Sage replied
I'm stuck at the Fiery Mountains on my journey escorting the Tang Priest and we're not getting anywhere
The local people told me that your good lady Raksasi has a plantain fan I tried to borrow it
I went to visit my sisterinlaw but she refused to lend it me which is why I've come to see you
I beg you brother in the greatness of your heart to come with me to sisterinlaw's place and borrow the fan for me so that I can blow out the fires and get my master across the mountains
Then I'll return it right away At this the Bull Demon King's heart blazed with wrath You told me you knew how to behave he said noisily gnashing his teeth of steel I suppose all this was not just to borrow the fan
I'm certain my wife has Journey to the West refused to lend it you because you've mistreated her So that's why you came to see me On top of that you send my beloved concubine fleeing in terror
As the saying goes 'Don't push around Your best friend's wife Don't try to destroy The joy of his life' You've been pushing my wife around and trying to destroy the concubine who's the joy of my life It's an outrage
Take this If you want to hit me brother I'm not afraid said Monkey All I want is the treasure
I beg you to lend it me If you can last out three rounds with me the Bull Demon King said I'll make my wife lend it to you
And if you can't I'll kill you and have my revenge Good idea brother Monkey replied I've been so lazy
I haven't been to see you for ages and I don't know how your fighting powers now compare with the old days
Let's have a match with our cudgels The Bull Demon King was in no mood for further argument and he hit at Monkey's head with his mace
Monkey hit back with his goldbanded cudgel
It was a splendid fight The goldbanded cudgel The rough iron mace Are no longer friends
One said You destroyed my son you macaque The other Don't be angry
he has found the Way How could you be so stupid as to come to my door I am here to visit you with a special purpose One wanted the fan to protect the Tang Priest The other was too mean to lend the plantain leaf
Friendship was lost in the exchange of words Journey to the West In anger neither had any sense of brotherhood
The Bull Demon King's mace moved like a dragon The Great Sage's cudgel sent gods and demons fleeing
First they fought in front of the mountain Then they both rose on auspicious clouds
They showed their great powers up in midair Doing wonderful movements in multicoloured light
The clash of their cudgels rocked the gates of Heaven They were too evenly matched for either to win
The Great Sage and the Bull Demon King fought over a hundred rounds without either emerging as the victor
Just as they were becoming locked in their struggle a voice called from the peak King Bull my king sends his respects and invites you to honour him with your presence at a banquet At this the Bull Demon King blocked the goldbanded cudgel with his iron mace and called out You stay here macaque I'm going to a friend's house for a meal
I'll be back With that he landed his cloud and went straight back into the cave My lovely he said to Princess Jade the man you saw with a face like a thunder god is the macaque Sun Wukong A bout with my mace has sent him packing he won't be back
Stop worrying and enjoy yourself
I'm going to a Mend's place for some drinks He then took off his helmet and armor donned a duckgreen jacket of cut velvet went outside and mounted his wateraverting goldeneyed beast Telling his underlings to look after the palace he headed Northwest in clouds and mist
While the Great Sage watched all this from the peak he thought I wonder who the friend is and where he's gone for his banquet
I'll follow him Splendid Monkey then shook himself and turned into a clear breeze to follow him
He soon reached a mountain but the Bull Demon King was nowhere to be seen
The Great Sage turned back into himself and started to search the mountain
He found a deep pool of pure water beside which was inscribed in large letters on a tablet of stone RAGGED ROCK MOUNTAIN GREEN WAVE POOL Old Bull must have gone into the water Monkey thought and underwater spirits are lesser dragons dragon or fish spirits or else turtle tortoise or terrapin spirits
I'd better go down and have a look Journey to the West Making a handspell and saying the magic words the splendid Great Sage shook himself turned into a mediumsized crab weighing thirtysix pounds jumped into the water with a splash and went straight down to the bottom of the pool
He saw an ornamental arch of delicate tracery to which was tethered a wateraverting goldeneyed beast
On the other side of the arch there was no more water Monkey crawled through and took a careful look
From one side he heard music and this is what he saw
Cowry gateways to a palace red Like nothing else in the world
The roof tiles were of yellow gold The door pivots of whitest jade
The screens were of tortoiseshell The balustrades of coral and of pearl
Auspicious clouds glowed all around the throne From the sky above right down to the ground
This was not the palace of Heaven or the sea Although it more than rivaled an island paradise
A banquet for host and guests was set in the lofty hall Where all the official wore their hats with pearls
Jade girls were told to bring ivory bowls Exquisite beauties to play fine music
The great whale sang Giant crabs danced Turtles played pipes and drums While pearls shone over the goblets and boaras
Birdlike script adorned the turquoise screens While shrimpwhisker curtains hung along the corridors
From the eight notes mingled came wonderful music Whose tones rose up to the clouds above
Journey to the West Greenheaded singsong girls stroked zithers of jasper While redeyed dragonflies played jade flutes
Mandarin fish carried dried venison in on their heads While dragon girls had the wings of golden pheasants in their hair
What they ate were The rarest delicacies of the heavenly kitchen What they drank were The finest vintages of the purple palace
The Bull Demon King was sitting in the seat of honour with three or four lesser dragon spirits on either side Facing him was an ancient dragon surrounded by dragon sons dragon grandsons dragon wives and dragon daughters
Just as they were feasting and drinking the Great Sage Sun marched straight in to be spotted by the ancient dragon who ordered Arrest that vagrant crab The dragon sons and grandsons fell upon him and seized him
Spare me spare me said Monkey suddenly reverting to human speech
Where are you from crab vagrant the ancient dragon asked
How dare you come into my hall and behave in this disgraceful way in front of my distinguished guests
Tell me this moment if you want to be spared the death penalty The splendid Great Sage then made up a pack of lies to tell him Ever since coming to live in the lake I've had to make my home in cliffs and caves
Over the years I've learned to stretch myself out So now I am known as the Sideways Manatarms
Dragging my way through weeds and through mud I have never been taught correct social behavior
If in my ignorance I have caused offence I beg Your Majesty to show me mercy Journey to the West When the spirits at the banquet heard this they all bowed to the ancient dragon and said This is the first time that the Sideways Manatarms has come to your palace of jasper and he does not understand royal etiquette
We beg Your Excellency to spare him The ancient dragon thanked the spirits and ordered Release the wretch
Put a beating on record against his name and have him wait outside The Great Sage acknowledged his kindness then fled for his life till he reached the archway outside
That Bull Demon King is drinking for all he's worth in there he thought I'm not going to wait till the feast breaks up
And even if I did he still wouldn't lend me the fan
I'd do better to steal his goldeneyed beast and turn myself into a Bull Demon King Then I can trick Raksasi into lending me the fan and I'll be able to escort my master across the mountains
That'll be best The splendid Great Sage then reverted to his original form untied the goldeneyed beast leapt into the carved saddle and rode straight up from the bottom of the water
Once out of the pool he made himself look like the Bull Demon King
Whipping on the beast he set his cloud moving and was soon at the mouth of the Plantain Cave in Mount Turquoise Cloud
Open up he shouted and at the sound of his voice the two servant girls inside the gates opened them for him
Taking him for the Bull Demon King they went in to report Madam His Majesty's come home At the news Raksasi quickly neatened her hair and hurried out on her little lotus feet to meet him
Climbing out of the saddle the Great Sage led the goldeneyed beast inside
He was bold enough to try to deceive the beauty whose mortal eyes failed to see who he really was as she led him inside hand in hand
The maids were told to prepare places and bring tea and as the master was back the whole household tried its hardest
The Great Sage and Raksasi were soon talking
My good lady said the false Bull Demon King it's been a long time I hope that everything has gone well for Your Majesty Raksasi replied going on to ask What wind brings you back to your abandoned wife now that you have married your new darling There's no question of having abandoned you the Great Sage replied with a smile It's just that I've been away a long time since Princess Jade invited me to her place I'm kept very busy with domestic matters to deal with and friends to attend to
I hear that soandso Sun Wukong is very near the Fiery Mountains with the Tang Priest and I'm worried that he might come and ask you to lend him the fan
I can't forgive him for destroying our son I want my revenge If he turns up just send someone to tell me
When I get him we can cut his body up into ten thousand pieces as revenge for what we have suffered You Majesty replied Raksasi in tears at what he had just said as the saying goes 'A man with no woman is risking his wealth a woman with no husband is risking her health' That macaque practically killed me At this the Great Sage pretended to fly into a terrible rage When did that bloody monkey go he swore
He hasn't gone yet Raksasi replied
He was here yesterday to borrow the fan and as he'd destroyed our boy I put my armor on and went out to cut him to bits with my swords
But he endured the pain called me his sisterinlaw and said that you and he were once sworn brothers He was my seventh sworn brother five hundred years ago the Great Sage replied Journey to the West He said not a word when I swore at him Raksasi continued and didn't strike back when I cut him
Finally I blew him away with the fan
Goodness only knows where he got some windfixing magic from but this morning he was back shouting outside the door again and the fan wouldn't move him no matter how hard I waved it
When I swung my swords around and went for him with them he wasn't being polite any more
I was so scared of the force of his cudgel I came back in here and had the doors tightly shut
Somehow or other he managed to get right into my belly and it practically killed me
I had to call him brotherinlaw and lend him the fan before he'd go The Great Sage put on a great show of beating his chest and saying How terrible how terrible
You did wrong wife You should never have given that treasure to the macaque Don't be angry Your Majesty Raksasi replied
I lent him a false fan and tricked him into going away Where's the real one the Great Sage asked
Don't worry she replied don't worry
It's safely put away She then told the serving girls to lay on wine and a feast to welcome him back
Your Majesty she then said offering him a goblet of wine please don't forget the wife of your youth in the joy of your new marriage
Won't you drink this cup of wine from home The Great Sage had no choice but to accept the goblet and smile as he raised it
You drink first wife he said I've left you looking after the home by yourself good lady for too long while I've been busy with my other property
Let this be a gesture of my gratitude Raksasi took the goblet back lifted it again and handed it to the king with the words As the old saying goes The wife is the equal but the husband is the father who supports her
You don't need to thank me It was only after more such politeness that the two of them sat down and began drinking
Not wanting to break his vow to avoid meat the Great Sage only ate some fruit while he talked to her
After they had each had several cups Raksasi was feeling a little drunk and rather sexy She started to press herself against the Great Sage stroking and pinching him Taking him by the hand she whispered tender words to him leaning her shoulder against him she spoke quietly and submissively
They shared the same cup of wine drinking a mouthful each at a time and she fed him fruit
The Great Sage pretended to go along with this and smile He had no choice but to lean against her
Indeed The hook to catch poetry The broom to sweep away sorrow The remover of all difficulties is wine
The man though virtuous unbuttoned his lapel The woman forgot herself and began to laugh
Her face had the complexion of a peach Her body swayed like a willow sapling
Many a word came babbling from her mouth Journey to the West As she pinched and nipped in her desire
Sometimes she tugged at her hair Or waved her delicate fingers
She often raised a foot And twitched the sleeves of her clothes
Her powdered neck sunk lower And her fine waist started to wiggle
She never stopped talking for a moment As she opened gold buttons to half show her breasts
In her cups she was like a landslide of jade And as she rubbed her bleary eyes she did not look at her best
Watching her get drunk the Great Sage had kept his wits about him and he tried to lead her on by saying Where have you put the real fan wife You must watch it very carefully all the time
I'm worried that Sun the Novice will trick it out of you with some of his many transformations At this Raksasi tittered spat it out of her mouth and handed it to the Great Sage It was only the size of an apricot leaf Here's the treasure she said
The Great Sage took it but could not believe that it really was How could a tiny little thing like this blow a fire out he wondered
It must be another fake Seeing him looking at the treasure so deep in thought Raksasi could not restrain herself from rubbing her powdered face against Monkey's and saying Put the treasure away and have another drink darling
What are you looking so worried about The Great Sage took the chance to slip in the question How could a little thing like this blow out  miles of fire She was now drunk enough to have no inhibitions about speaking the truth so she told him how it was done
Your Majesty I expect you've been overdoing your pleasures day and night these last two years since you left me That Princess Jade must have addled your brains if you can't even remember about your own treasure
You just have to pinch the seventh red silk thread with the thumb of your left hand and say 'Huixuhexixichuihu' Then it'll grow twelve feet long It can do as many changes as you like
It could blow  miles of flame out with a single wave The Great Sage committed all this very carefully to memory put the fan in his mouth rubbed his face and turned back into himself Raksasi he yelled at the top of his voice Have a careful look I'm your brotherinlaw
What a disgusting way you've been carrying on in with me and for what a long time too
You're shameless quite shameless Journey to the West In her horror at realizing it was Sun Wukong she pushed the dining table over and fell into the dust overcome with shame and screaming
I'm so upset I could die I could die Not caring whether she was dead or alive the Great Sage broke free and rushed straight out of the Plantain Cave
He was indeed not lusting after that female beauty and glad to turn away with a smiling face
He sprang on his auspicious cloud that took him up to the top of the mountain spat the fan out of his mouth and tried the magic out
Pinching the seventh red tassel with the thumb of his left hand he said Huixuhexixichuihu and indeed it grew to be twelve feet long
On close examination he found it quite different from the false one he had borrowed before
It glittered with auspicious light and was surrounded by lucky vapors Thirtysix threads of red silk formed a trellis pattern inside and out
But Brother Monkey had only asked how to make it grow and had not found out the spell for shrinking it
So he had to shoulder it as he went back by the way he had come
When the Bull Demon King's feast with all the spirits at the bottom of the Green Wave Pool ended he went outside to find that the wateraverting goldeneyed beast was missing
The ancient dragon king called the spirits together to ask them Which of you untied and stole the Bull Demon King's goldeneyed beast The spirits all knelt down and replied We wouldn't dare steal it
We were all waiting singing or playing at the banquet
None of us was out here I am sure that none of you palace musicians would have dared to take it the ancient dragon said
Have any strangers been here A crab spirit was here not long ago during the banquet and he was a stranger At this the Bull King suddenly realized what had happened
Say no more he exclaimed
When you sent your messenger with the invitation this morning there was a Sun Wukong there who'd come to ask to borrow my plantain fan as he couldn't get the Tang Priest he's escorting to fetch the scriptures across the Fiery Mountains I refused
I was in the middle of a fight with him that neither of us was winning when I shook him off and came straight here to the banquet
That monkey's extremely quick and adaptable I'm sure that the crab spirit was him here in disguise to do a bit of spying He's stolen my beast to go and trick the plantain fan out of my wife This news made all the spirits shake with fright
Do you mean the Sun Wukong who made havoc in Heaven they asked
Yes the Bull Demon King replied
If any of you gentlemen have any trouble on the road West keep your distance from him whatever you do But if all that's true what about Your Majesty's steed the ancient dragon asked
No problem the Bull Demon King replied with a smile
You gentlemen may all go home now while I go after him With that he parted his way through the waters sprang up from the bottom of the pool and rode a yellow cloud straight to the Plantain Cave on Mount Turquoise Cloud where he heard Raksasi stamping her feet beating her breast howling and moaning
He pushed the doors open to see the wateraverting goldeneyed beast tethered by them
Where did Sun Wukong go wife the Bull Demon King said
Journey to the West Seeing that the Bull Demon King was back the serving girls all knelt down and said Are you home Your Majesty Raksasi grabbed hold of him banged her head against his and said abusively Damn and blast you you careless fool
Why ever did you let that macaque steal the goldeneyed beast and turn himself into your double to come here and trick me Which way did the macaque go the Bull Demon King asked grinding his teeth in fury Beating her breast Raksasi continued to pour out abuse
The damn monkey tricked me out of my treasure turned back into himself and went
I'm so angry I could die Do look after yourself wife the Bull Demon King said and don't be so upset
When I've caught the macaque and taken the treasure off him I'll skin him grind his bones to powder and bring you his heart and liver That'll make you feel better He then called for weapons
Your Majesty's weapons aren't here the serving girls replied
Then bring your mistress' weapons the Bull Demon King replied
The servants brought her pair of bluetipped swords and the Bull Demon King took off the duckgreen velvet jacket he had worn to the banquet and tied the little waistcoat he wore next to his skin more tightly He then strode out of the Plantain Cave a sword in each hand and headed straight for the Fiery Mountains in pursuit of Monkey
It was a case of The man who forgot a kindness Tricking a doting wife The fierytempered old demon Meeting a mendicant monk
If you don't know whether this journey was illfated or not listen to the explanation in the next installment
Zhu Bajie Helps to Defeat a Demon King Monkey's Third Attempt to Borrow the Fan The story tells how the Bull Demon King caught up with the Great Sage Sun and saw him looking very cheerful as he went along with the plantain fan over his shoulder
So the macaque has also tricked the art of using the fan out of her the demon king thought
If I ask him for it back to his face he's bound to refuse and if he fans me with it and sends me sixty thousand miles away that would be just what he wants
Now I know that the Tang Priest is sitting waiting by the main road
When I was an evil spirit in the old days I used to know his second disciple the Pig Spirit
I think I'll turn myself into a double of the Pig Spirit and play a trick back on him
That macaque will no doubt be so pleased with himself that he won't really be on his guard Journey to the West The splendid demon king could also do seventytwo transformations and his martial skills were on a par with those of the Great Sage
it was just that he was rather more clumsily built was less quick and penetrating and not so adaptable
First he hid the swords then he said the words of the spell turned himself into the exact likeness of Pig went down and met Monkey face to face
I'm here brother he called
The Great Sage was indeed delighted
As the ancient saying goes a cat that's won a fight is more pleased with himself than a tiger
Monkey was so confident of his powers that he did not bother to investigate why the new arrival was here but seeing that he looked like Pig called out Where are you going brother The Bull Demon King made up an answer on the spot
You'd been away for so long that the master wondered if the Bull Demon King's magic powers were too much for you and you couldn't get the treasure So he sent me to meet you There was no need to worry said Monkey
I've already got it How did you manage that the Bull Demon King asked
Old Bull and I fought over a hundred rounds without either of us getting the upper hand till he broke off the fight and went to the bottom of the Green Wave Pool in Ragged Rock Mountain for a banquet with a whole lot of lesser dragons and dragons
I tailedhim there turned into a crab stole the wateraverting goldeneyed beast made myself look like him and went to the Plantain Cave to trick Raksasi She as good as married me on the spot and I conned it out of her You had to go to a lot of trouble brother the Bull Demon King replied
Can I hold the fan Not realizing that this Pig was an impostor or even considering the possibility the Great Sage Sun handed him the fan
Now the Bull Demon King knew the secret of making the fan shrink or grow and as soon as he had the fan in his hands he made a spell with them that nobody could see shrunk it back to the size of an apricot leaf and reverted to his true form
Bloody macaque he swore do you know who I am now As soon as he saw this Monkey regretted making so terrible a mistake
With a cry of anguish he stamped his feet and yelled Aagh
After all these years I've been hunting wild geese a gosling has pecked out my eye He was now leaping around in a thunderous fury and he took a crack at the Bull Demon King's head with his iron cudgel
The demon king then fanned him with the fan not realizing that the Great Sage had inadvertently swallowed the windfixing pill he had in his mouth when he turned himself into a tiny insect to go into Raksasi's stomach This had made all his entrails his skin and his bones so solid and firm that no matter how hard the Bull Demon King fanned he could not move him
This alarmed the Bull Demon King who put the treasure in his mouth and fought back swinging a sword in each hand
The two of them fought a splendid battle up in midair The Great Sage Equaling Heaven The Bull Demon King of evil All for the sake of a plantainleaf fan
When they met each showed his powers Journey to the West The careless Great Sage got the fan by a trick But allowed the Bull King to take it back
One mercilessly raised the golden cudgel The other wielded with skill his bluetipped swords
The mighty Great Sage belched out coloured mists While the evil Bull King breathed brilliant lights
Well matched in courage Both of them wicked They gnashed and ground their teeth in terrible wrath
Heaven and earth were darkened by the dust they kicked up Gods and ghosts alike hid from the flying stones
How dare you try to turn a trick against me I'll get you for what my wife promised you Coarse was their language and fierce were their tempers
For tricking my wife you deserve to die When I sue you the sentence will surely be death The cunning Great Sage Equaling Heaven The murderous Strongarm Demon King Both of them only wanting to fight Neither of them willing to pause and discuss
Equal the effort of swords and of cudgel Had either relaxed he'd have gone straight to Hell
The story now tells not of those two locked in their struggle but of the Tang Priest sitting by the road and finding the heat unbearable He was also very anxious and thirsty May I ask you he said to the local deity what that Bull Demon King's powers are like Journey to the West He has very great magic the local god replied and his dharma powers are unlimited
He and the Great Sage Sun are well matched Wukong is a very good traveler Sanzang replied
He can normally go six or seven hundred miles and back in an instant Why has he been away all day
I'm sure he must be fighting the Bull Demon King With that he called for Pig and Friar Sand and asked Which of you will go to meet your elder brother
If he is up against an enemy you will have to help him in the fight get the fan and come back I am very impatient to cross these mountains and continue along our way It's getting late Pig replied and I'd like to go to meet him
The only thing is that I don't know the way to Mount Thunder Piled But I do the local god said
Tell the Curtainlifting General to keep your master company while you and I go there Sanzang was delighted
I am most grateful to you for going to such trouble he said and I shall thank you again when you have succeeded Pig then summoned up his spirits tightened the belt round his black brocade tunic and took his rake in his hands as he rose up on his cloud with the local god and headed due East
As they were going along they heard great shouts and were buffeted by strong winds
Stopping his cloud for a good look he saw that it was all caused by Monkey and the Bull Demon King fighting
Why don't you join in Marshal Tian Peng the local deity asked
What are you waiting for At that the idiot brandished his rake and said with a great shout Brother I'm coming Idiot said Monkey bitterly you've ruined things for me But the master told me to come to meet you Pig protested He asked the local god to guide me as I don't know the way That's why I'm a bit late
How can you say I've ruined things for you I'm not angry with you for being late Monkey replied
It's this damned bull who's a thorough disgrace I'd got the fan off Raksasi but he turned himself into your double and came to meet me I was so pleased to see you that I passed him the fan He turned back into himself and we've been fighting it out ever since That's why I said you'd ruined things for me This news put Pig into a flaming temper
Raising his rake he shouted abuse to the Bull Demon King's face I'll get you you poxridden bag of blood
I'll get you for pretending to be me your own ancestor to trick my brother and stir up trouble between us Watch as he starts lashing out wildly with the rake
The Bull Demon King who had been fighting Monkey all day was tiring and he also realized that he would never be able to withstand the onslaught of Pig's rake so he fled in defeat
But his way was blocked by a force of spirit soldiers led by the local god of the Fiery Mountains
Wait Strongarm King the local deity said
All the gods and heavens are protecting Tang Sanzang on his journey West to fetch the scriptures The Three Worlds all know about him and the Ten Directions are supporting him
Please lend him your plantain fan to blow out the flames so that he can cross the mountains without danger or disaster
Otherwise Heaven will hold you criminally responsible and you're bound to be executed Journey to the West You haven't looked into the rights and wrongs of this at all King Demon Bull replied
That damned ape has done one evil thing after another he's stolen my son bullied my concubine and defrauded my wife I wish I could swallow him whole and turn him into shit to feed to the dogs
I'll never lend him my treasure Before the words were all out of his mouth Pig had caught up with him and was saying abusively I'll get you you poxy bull
The fan or your life The Bull Demon King had to turn round to fight Pig off with his swords while the Great Sage Monkey wielded his cudgel to help him
It was a fine fight they had there A boar turned spirit A bull become monster A monkey who had robbed Heaven and found the Way
Dharmanature can always overcome what has been created Earth must be used to combine with the prime cause
Pointed and sharp were the nine teeth of the rake Flexible and keen were the two sword blades
The movements of the iron cudgel dominated the fray The local god formed the cinnabar head
The three of them struggled to overcome Each of them scheming to give play to his powers
Metal money is best at making the bull draw the plough If the boar goes in the oven wood is finished
Unless the heart is in it the Way cannot be completed To keep the spirit controlled the monkey must be tied up
Amid wild shouts and desperate pleas The three types of weapon whistled through the air
There was no kindness in the blows of rake and sword The goldbanded cudgel rose for good reason
Their fight put out the stars and dimmed the moon The sky was filled with a cold dark dreary fog
Journey to the West The demon king fought hard and courageously for mastery falling back all the while When the dawn came after a whole night of battle there was still no victor and in front of them now was the entrance to the Cloudtouching Cave on Mount Thunder Piled
The earsplitting noise that the three of them the local god and the spirit soldiers were making alarmed Princess Jade who sent her serving girls to see who was causing the din The little demons on the doors came in to report It's our master
He's fighting the man with a face like a thunder god another monk with a long snout and big ears and the local god of the Fiery Mountains and his men The moment Princess Jade heard this she ordered the senior and junior officers of the guard to take their swords and spears and help their lord
Good to see you said the Bull Demon King with delight good to see you All the demons rushed wildly into the attack
It was more than Pig could cope with and he fled in defeat trailing his rake behind him
The Great Sage sprang aloft out of the multiple encirclement on a somersault cloud the spirit soldiers broke and ran
Old Bull led his host of demons back to the cave in victory and the doors were shut tightly behind them He's tough damn him said Monkey
He started fighting me at about four yesterday afternoon and we were nowhere near a result when you two came along to help last night
He fought for half a day and a whole night without showing any sign of tiring
And that bunch of little devils who came out just now were a rough lot too
Now he's shut the doors of his cave and won't come out
What are we to do It was about ten yesterday morning when you left the master brother Pig said so why was it four in the afternoon when you started fighting him
What were you doing for the six hours in between I reached this mountain soon after I left you Monkey replied and saw a woman When I questioned her she turned out to be his favorite concubine Princess Jade
I gave her a bit of a fright with my cudgel so she fled into the cave and sent her Bull Demon King out
He and I swapped a few insults then started fighting
We'd been at it for a couple of hours when someone came to invite him to a banquet
I tailed him to the bottom of the Green Wave Pool on Ragged Rock Mountain and turned into a crab to do a little spying Then I stole his wateraverting goldeneyed beast and changed myself into the Bull Demon King's double to go back to the Plantain Cave on Mount Turquoise Cloud where I conned Raksasi into giving me the fan
I went outside to try the magic spell out on the fan and made it grow but I didn't know how to make it shrink again
As I was walking along with it on my shoulder he turned himself into your spitting image and tricked it back off me again That's how I wasted six hours As the saying goes Pig replied it's just like a boatful of beancurd sinking it came out of the wet and it disappeared into the wet
Easy come easy go But how are we going to take our master across the mountains if we're having so hard a time getting the fan
We'll just have to go back and make a bloody detour Don't get impatient Great Sage the local god said and don't try to be lazy Marshal Tian Peng If you make a detour that will mean leaving the straight and narrow
you'll never cultivate your conduct that way
As the old saying goes 'In walking never take a short cut' You mustn't talk about detours
Your master is waiting by the main road desperate for your success Yes yes said Monkey his resolve stiffened don't talk nonsense idiot The local deity is right
As for that Bull Demon King we'll have to Journey to the West Straggle for mastery Use our powers Until we can make the whole earth change
Since coming to the West he has never met a rival The Bull King was originally the mindape transformed
Only today do the sources flow We must hold out till we borrow the fan
Put out the flames in the cool of the dawn Smash through obstinate emptiness to visit the Buddha
When all is fulfilled we will rise to heavenly bliss And all go to the assembly under the Dragonflower Tree These words braced Pig's spirits too and eagerly he said Yes yes yes Go go go
Never mind what the Bull King's powers are Wood grows in the nor'nor'west and is matched with a pig The bullcalf will be led back to the earth
Metal was born in West sou'west and was an ape Without any conflict or conquest and full of peace
We must use the plantain leaf as if it were water To put out the flames and bring harmony
Hard work by night and day with never a rest Will lead us to success and the Ullambana feast Journey to the West The two of them led the local deity and his spirit soldiers forward then battered the doors of the Cloudtouching Cave to pieces with the rake and the cudgel
This so terrified the guard commanders that they rushed inside to report Your Majesty Sun Wukong's brought his troops here and has smashed down our front doors The Bull Demon King was just then telling Princess Jade what had happened and feeling thoroughly fed up with Monkey
The news of the front doors being smashed made him beside himself with fury so he put his armor on immediately and went outside with his iron mace in his hands shouting abusively Damned macaque
You must think you're a very big shot indeed coming here to play the hooligan and smash down my front door Old skinflint retorted Pig going forward who do you think you are trying to put other people in their place
Don't move
Take this Idiot the Bull Demon King replied Chaffguzzler You're not worth bothering with Tell that monkey to come here You don't know what's good for you cudchewer called Monkey
Yesterday you were still my sworn brother but today we're enemies
Watch this carefully The Bull Demon King met their onslaught with spirit and the ensuing fight was even finer than the one before
The three heroes were locked in a melee What a battle Rake and iron cudgel showing their might Leading the spirit soldiers to attack the ancient beast
The beast displayed his terrible strength when fighting alone Reviving his powers that rivaled those of Heaven
The rake hit hard The mace struck The iron cudgel showed its heroic powers
The three weapons rang against each other Blocking and parrying never giving way
One said he was the champion Another claimed I am the best The earth soldiers who were watching could hardly tell them apart
As wood and earth were locked in combat
Journey to the West Why won't you lend us the plantain fan You had the effrontery to mistreat my wife To ruin my son and terrify my concubine
I haven't punished you for all of that yet And now you harass us and beat down my doors Be on your guard against the AsYouWill cudgel
A touch of it will tear your skin open Mind you avoid the teeth of my rake
One blow and nine wounds all gush blood The Bull Monster fearlessly gave play to his might Wielding his mace with skill and with cunning
Their movements turned the rain clouds upsidedown As each of them snorted out his mists and winds
This was indeed a battle to the death As they fought it out together with hatred in their hearts
Taking new stances Offering openings high and low They attacked and they parried with never a mistake
The two brother disciples were united in their efforts The solitary mace showed its might alone
They battled from dawn till eight in the morning Till the Bull Demon had to abandon the fight
With death in their hearts and no thought of survival the three of them fought another hundred or so rounds till Pig took advantage of Monkey's miraculous powers to put all his brute strength into a rain of blows from his rake that were more than the Bull Demon King could withstand
He turned and fled defeated back to his cave only to find the entrance blocked by the local god and his spirit troops Journey to the West Where do you think you're going Strongarm King the local god shouted
We're here As he could not get into his cave the Bull Demon King fled only to be pursued by Pig and Monkey
In his panic the Bull Demon King tore off his helmet and armor threw away his mace shook himself turned into a swan and flew away
Monkey looked around and said with a grin Pig Old Bull's gone The idiot had not the faintest idea of what had happened and neither had the local god as they looked all around and aimlessly searched Mount Thunder Piled
Isn't that him flying up there said Monkey pointing
It's a swan Pig replied
Yes said Monkey it's what Old Bull turned himself into So what are we going to do about it the local god asked
You two charge in there wipe all the demons out without quarter and tear down his den Monkey replied
That will cut off his retreat while I go and match transformations with him We shall say no more of Pig and the local god smashing their way into the cave as they had been instructed
Putting away his goldbanded cudgel and saying the words of a spell while making the necessary hand movements Monkey shook himself and turned into a vulture who soared up into the clouds with his wings beating noisily then swooped down on the swan seizing its neck and gouging at its eyes
Realizing that this was Sun Wukong transformed the Bull Demon King braced himself and turned into a golden eagle who gouged back at the vulture
Then Monkey turned into a black phoenix to chase the eagle only to be recognized by the Bull King who turned into a white crane and flew off South with a loud call
Monkey stopped braced his feathers and turned into a red phoenix who called loudly too
At the sight of the phoenix the king of all the birds whom no bird dared treat with disrespect the white crane swooped down beside the precipice with a beat of his wings shook himself and turned into a riverdeer grazing in a timid stupid way at the foot of the cliff
Monkey spotted him came swooping down too and turned into a hungry tiger that came running after the riverdeer swishing his tail hungrily
The demon king had to move fast as he transformed himself into a huge leopard with spots like golden coins who turned to savage the hungry tiger
Seeing this Monkey faced the wind shook himself and turned into a goldeneyed lion with a voice like thunder a brazen head and an iron brow
He spun round to devour the leopard at which the Bull Demon King immediately became a giant bear that ran after the lion
Monkey then rolled himself up and became an elephant with tusks shaped like bamboo shoots and a trunk like a python that he stretched out to wrap round the bear
The Bull Demon King chuckled and switched back into his own original shape as a great white bull with a craggy head and flashing eyes Each of his horns was like an iron pagoda and his teeth were rows of sharp swords He was about ten thousand feet long from head to tail and stood eight thousand feet high at the shoulder
What are you going to do to me now damned macaque he shouted to Brother Monkey at the top of his voice at which Monkey too reverted to his own form pulled out his goldbanded cudgel bowed forward and shouted Grow He then grew to be a hundred thousand feet tall with a head like Mount Taishan eyes like the sun and moon a mouth like a pool of blood and teeth like doors
He raised his iron cudgel and struck at the Bull Demon King's head and the Bull Demon King hardened his head and charged Monkey with his horns
This was a ridgerocking mountainshaking heavenscaring earthfrightening battle and there is a poem to prove it that goes
Journey to the West The Way grows by one foot the demon by ten thousand The cunning mindape puts him down by force
If the Fiery Mountains' flames are to be put out The precious fan must blow them cool
The yellowwife is determined to protect the primal ancient The mother of wood is set on wiping out the demons
When the Five Elements are harmonized they return to the true achievement Evil and dirt are refined away as they travel to the West
The two of them gave such a great display of their magic powers as they fought on the mountain that they alarmed all the deities the Goldheaded Protector the Six Jias the Six Dings and the Eighteen Guardians of the Faith who were passing through the air came to surround the demon king
He was not in the least afraid as he butted to East and West with his straight shining iron horns and lashed to North and South with his strong and hairy tail
Sun Wukong stood up to him head on while all the other gods surrounded him till in his despair the Bull Demon King rolled on the ground turned back into his usual form and headed for the Plantain Cave
Monkey too put away his magical form and joined in the chase with all the gods but once in the cave the demon king shut the doors fast
The gods then threw a watertight encirclement around Mount Turquoise Cloud
Just when they were all about to storm the doors they heard the shouts of Pig arriving with the local god and his spirit soldiers
How are things in the Cloudtouching Cave Monkey asked greeting him
I finished off Old Bull's woman with one blow from my rake grinned Pig and when I stripped her I found she was a jadefaced fox spirit
Her demons were all donkeys mules bulls badgers foxes raccoon dogs riverdeer goats tigers elk deer and things like that We killed the lot of them and burnt down all the buildings in the cave
The local god tells me he's got another woman who lives here so we've come here to wipe her out too You've done well brother said Monkey Congratulations
I tried competing with Old Bull in transformations but I couldn't beat him
He turned into a simply enormous white bull and I made myself as big as heaven and earth
We were just battling it out when all the gods came down and surrounded him After a long time he turned back into himself and went into the cave Is this Plantain Cave Pig asked
Yes yes Monkey replied Raksasi's in here Then why don't we storm the place and wipe the lot of them out to get the fan said Pig his blood still up
Are we going to let the two of them live to be any older and wiser and love each other with tender passion The splendid idiot then summoned up his strength to bring his rake down on the doors so hard that doors rockface and all collapsed with a mighty rumble
The serving girls rushed inside to report Your Majesty Journey to the West someone's smashed the doors in and we don't know who he is The Bull Demon King himself had just run panting in and was still telling Raksasi about his fight with Monkey for the fan when he heard this report which made him very angry indeed
At once he spat out the fan and gave it to Raksasi who took it in her hands and said tearfully Your Majesty give the macaque the fan if he'll call his troops off Wife the Bull Demon King replied it may only be a little thing in itself but I hate and loathe him
Wait here while I have it out with him again Once more the demon put on his armor chose another pair of swords and went out to find Pig smashing the doors down with his rake
Without a word Old Bull raised his swords and cut at Pig's head
Pig parried with his rake and fell back a few paces till he was outside the doors where Monkey swung his cudgel at the Bull Demon King's head
The Bull Monster then mounted a storm wind and sprang away from the cave to fight Monkey once more on Mount Turquoise Cloud
All the gods surrounded him while the local god's soldiers joined in the fray from either side
It was a splendid fight Mists obscured the world Fog shrouded heaven and earth
A whistling evil wind sent sand and pebbles rolling Towering wrath had the ocean's waves breaking
With a newlysharpened pair of swords And a body encased in armor once more His hatred was deeper than the sea And loathing made his fury greater than ever
In his pursuit of glory the Great Sage Equaling Heaven No longer regarded the other as an old friend
Pig was using his might to obtain the fan While the gods and protectors tried to capture the Bull
Neither of the Bull King's hands could rest As he blocked to left and right with heavenly skill
Birds folded their wings unable to fly past Fish stopped leaping and sank to the bottom
Ghosts wept gods howled the earth and sky were dark Journey to the West Dragons and tigers were terrified and the sun was dimmed
The Bull Demon King fought over fifty rounds for all he was worth till he abandoned the field and fled North unable to hold out any longer
He was soon blocked by the Vajrapani Bofa from the Hidden Demon Cave on Mount Wutai whose magical powers were very extensive Bull Monster he shouted Where are you going
I have been commanded by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha to spread out heavenandearth nets and arrest you here As he spoke the Great Sage Pig and all the gods caught up
In his desperation the demon king turned and fled South only to find his way blocked by the Vajrapani Shenzhi of the Cave of Cool Purity on Mount Emei who shouted I am here on the Buddha's orders to take you The Bull Demon King was now so terrified and exhausted that he turned and fled East only to be blocked by the Vairocana monk the Vajrapani Dali of Mo'er Cave on Mount Sumeru who shouted Where are you going Old Bull
I am on a secret mission from the Tathagata to catch you The Bull Demon King withdrew in terror once more this time to the West where he came up against the imperishable king the Vajrapani Yongzhu from the Golden Brightness Ridge on Mount Kunlun shouting Where are you going damn you
I have been personally instructed by the venerable Buddha of the Thunder Monastery in the Western Heaven to cut off your escape this way
Nobody will let you pass The Old Bull was now trembling with fear but it was too late for regrets
On all sides he was surrounded by the Buddha's troops and heavenly generals It really was as if he were caught in a high net from which there was no escape
In his despair he heard Monkey coming after him at the head of his forces so he sprang on his cloud and went up
At just that moment Heavenly King Li the Pagodacarrier was encamped in the sky with Prince Nezha the Fishbellied Yaksa and the Mighty Miracle God Not so fast he shouted not so fast
I am here on the mandate of the Jade Emperor to exterminate you In his extremity the Bull Demon King shook himself turned back into the giant white bull and tried to gore the Heavenly King with his iron horns while the Heavenly King hacked at him with his sword
Soon Brother Monkey arrived
Great Sage Prince Nezha shouted at the top of his voice I can't greet you properly as I'm in armor
Yesterday my father and I went to see the Tathagata Buddha who sent a note to the Jade Emperor It said that the Tang Priest was held up by the Fiery Mountains and that you couldn't subdue the Bull Demon King Great Sage The Jade Emperor then ordered my father to bring his forces here to help But this damned creature's magical powers are tremendous Monkey replied and he's turned himself into this
What are we going to do about him Have no doubts replied Nezha with a smile
Watch me catch him The prince then shouted Change gave himself three heads and six arms and took a flying leap upon the Bull Demon King's back With one swing of his demonbeheading sword he had the bull's head off before he even realized he had done it
The Heavenly King threw down his sword and went to meet Monkey
But another head grew out from the Bull Demon King's throat its mouth breathing black vapors and its eyes flashing golden light
Nezha cut again but as the head fell a new one appeared
Nezha's sword cut a dozen Journey to the West heads off and a dozen new heads immediately grew again
Nezha then hung his firewheel on the bull's horns blew on the magic fire and made it blaze so fiercely that the Bull Demon King bellowed in desperate pain shaking his head and tail and trying for all he was worth to escape
Just when he was about to do another transformation and get away his true image was fixed in Heavenly King Li's demonrevealing mirror Now he could make no more changes and he had no way of escape
He could only call out Spare my life I wish to be converted to the Buddhist faith If you value your life hand the fan over at once said Nezha
My wife is looking after it the Bull Demon King replied
Hearing this reply Nezha undid his demonbinding rope and slipped it round his neck then took him by the nose ran the rope through it and led him along by hand
Monkey meanwhile gathered together the four vajrapanis the Six Dings the Six Jias the Guardians of the Faith Heavenly King Li the Mighty Miracle God Pig the local god and the spirit soldiers to crowd around the white bull and lead him back to the entrance to the Plantain Cave
Wife Old Bull called bring the fan out and save my life As soon as she heard this Raksasi took off her jewelry and brightcoloured clothing dressed her hair like a Taoist nun and put on a white silk habit like a Buddhist one
She came out through the doors carrying the twelvefoot fan with both hands and at the sight of the vajrapanis the gods the Heavenly King and Nezha she fell to her knees in terror kowtowing in worship and saying I beg you Bodhisattvas to spare my husband and me
I present the fan to my brotherinlaw Monkey for him to win his glory with Monkey went forward took the fan and rode back East by auspicious cloud with the others
Sanzang and Friar Sand had been waiting a very long time sometimes sitting and sometimes standing for Monkey to come back
They were extremely anxious by the time the sky was suddenly filled with auspicious clouds and the earth was lit up by blessed light as all the gods came whistling through the air towards them
Wujing said the venerable elder in terror whose divine soldiers are coming from over there Master said Friar Sand who could recognize them it's the four vajrapanis the Goldenheaded Protector the Six Jias the Six Dings the Guardians of the Faith and all the other passing gods
The one leading the bull is Prince Nezha and there's Heavenly King Li the Pagodacarrier holding a mirror My eldest brother is carrying the plantain fan and that's second brother and the local god behind him
The others are all escort troops Hearing this Sanzang put on his Vairocana mitre and his cassock then went with Friar Sand to welcome the gods and thank them with these words What merits do I your disciple have that I put all you holy ones to the trouble of coming down to earth To this the four vajrapanis replied Congratulations holy monk The great task has now been achieved
We were sent to help you on the Buddha's orders You must now continue your selfcultivation and not slacken for a moment Sanzang replied amid kowtows that he accepted their commands
The Great Sage Sun took the fan close to the Fiery Mountains waved it as hard as he could and put the flames out Their glare disappeared
He waved the fan again and the rustle of a cool breeze could be heard and at the third wave the sky was overcast with cloud and a fine rain began to fall
There is a poem that bears witness to this
Journey to the West For hundreds of miles the mountains of fire Lit heaven and earth with notorious flames
When fire roasts the five passions the elixir cannot be made When flame burns the three passes the Way is not pure
To borrow the plantain fan and bring down rain Heavenly gods had to help with their spiritual power
When the bull is led to the Buddha it must stop being evil When water and fire are allied the nature is calm
Having been relieved of his cares Sanzang stopped worrying
All the hosts then reverently thanked the vajrapanis who all returned to their mountains and the Six Dings and Six Jias went back into the sky to give their protection
The deities who had been passing by all went on their way and the Heavenly King and Nezha led the bull back to hand him over to the Buddha
This left only the local mountain god waiting there with Raksasi under his guard Why aren't you on your way Raksasi Monkey asked
What are you standing there waiting for I beg you in your mercy Great Sage she replied to give me back the fan You've got a cheek damned bitch roared Pig
We've spared your life and that should be enough for you What do you want the fan for
When we've crossed the mountains we'll be able to sell it for food
Do you think we're going to give it to you after all the trouble and effort we've been to
It's raining so be off home with you She bowed again and said But the Great Sage promised to give it back when he'd put the fire out I'm very sorry about all that has happened
It was only because I was feeling so upset that I put you to all that trouble
We too have learned to live like human beings The only thing is that we had not been converted to the pursuit of the true achievement
Now our true bodies have turned to the West and we will not dare do anything wicked again
I beg you to return the fan so that I can reform and cultivate myself Great Sage said the local deity let us make full use of this woman's knowledge of the art of extinguishing fire to put these fires out for good and give her back her fan Then I will be able to live here in peace help the people who live here and be given offerings of blood and food
This would truly be a great kindness to me I heard the local people saying that when the fan puts the flames out in these mountains they can only gather one harvest before they start burning again said Monkey
How are we going to be able to put them out forever All you have to do to put the flames out forever said Raksasi is wave the fan fortynine times
Then they'll never burn again Journey to the West Now that Brother Monkey knew this he took the fan and fanned the mountains with it fortynine times as hard as he possibly could whereupon heavy rain began to pour down
The fan really was a treasure where there were flames it rained and where there were not the sky was clear
By standing where there no flames master and disciples avoided getting wet
After spending the night sitting there they got the horse and luggage ready the next morning and returned the fan to Raksasi
If I don't give it back to you Monkey said people might say I don't keep my word
Take the fan with you go back to your mountain and don't make any more trouble
As you've achieved human form I'll spare your life Taking the fan from him Raksasi said the words of the spell pinched the thread so that it shrank back to the size of an apricot leaf and put it in her mouth
She then thanked them all and prepared to cultivate her conduct as a hermit Later she too achieved the true reward and her name was made eternally famous through the scriptures
Raksasi and the local god expressed their deep gratitude to the four sages and escorted them along their way
As Monkey Pig and Friar Sand escorted Sanzang along his way their bodies felt cool and the ground under their feet was pleasantly damp
This was indeed a case of With the help of trigrams Kan and Li the primal is compounded When fire and water are balanced the Great Way is completed
If you don't know how many years it was till they returned to the East listen to the explanation in the next installment
Cleansed and with a Washed Heart He Sweeps the Pagoda The Devils Are Captured and Converted the Body Is Cultivated Through all the hours it must never be forgotten When success is won all time will be put away
For five years and sixty thousand miles Do not let the holy water dry up Do not allow the fire to flag
When water and fire are in balance no harm will arise The Five Elements are joined as if with hooks
Ying and Yang in harmony climb the cloud tower Riding the phoenix to the purple palace Journey to the West And flying on the crane to magical Yingzhou This lyric is set to the tune Lin jiang xian
It tells how Tang Sanzang and his disciples with the help of water and fire cooled their natures and borrowed the fan that was pure Yin to blow out the flames on the distant mountains
It took them many days to cover the  miles as they made their way West feeling relaxed and free of care
It was now the time when late autumn was becoming early winter and this is what they saw The petals of wild chrysanthemums wilting The tender new blossom of the plum
In all the villages crops are gathered in Delicious broth is everywhere enjoyed
As the trees are stripped of leaves distant forests can be seen Ravines are thickly frosted and the quiet valleys pure
In response to the cold season The silkworms are put away to hibernate
In pure Yin and Yang The moon rules over the primal ocean Where water is at the full Shun's sun shines with merciful brightness
Earth vapors sink Sky vapors rise
The rainbow is no more to be seen While slowly ice forms over the pond
Flowers fall from the creepers on the cliff While bamboo and pine show still greener in the cold
When the four of them had traveled a lot further they approached a walled and moated city
Reining in the horse the Tang Priest spoke to his disciples Wukong what sort of place is that with all those tall and Journey to the West magnificent buildings Monkey looked and saw that the city was like this
A wall of bronze shaped like a dragon And in the form of a crouching tiger From all directions fine carriages approach And many a wheel has smoothed the roads to it
Amazing beasts are carved on the balustrades of marble Statues of great men stand on pedestals of gold
This is indeed a blessed capital A true metropolis
Its vast domains are firmly held The dynasty has flourished for a thousand years
To the monarch's goodness the barbarians submit Here is the holy gathering from islands and from sea
Before the palace steps is purity Peace reigns on the highways
The bars are full of noise and song Bliss is found in the houses of pleasure
Outside the palace grow trees of eternal spring Where phoenixes sing their greetings to the dawn
Master said Monkey that city is a royal capital The world is full of prefectural cities and county seats laughed Pig
What makes you so sure that this is a royal capital You don't seem to realize that royal capitals are different from prefectural cities and county towns Monkey replied
Just look It's got over ten gates and the wall must measure twenty or thirty miles around Those towers are so high they disappear into the clouds
How could anything except a royal capital be as grand as that Journey to the West You're right brother said Friar Sand it is a royal city
But what's it called How can I tell Monkey replied There aren't any signs or banners
We'll have to go into it and ask The venerable elder whipped on his horse and was soon at a gate where he dismounted to cross the bridge and go in to look
They saw the six main streets and the three markets where commerce was flourishing as well as the imposing clothes of the noble and great
Then as they were walking along they saw a dozen or so Buddhist monks in chains and cangues heavy boards locked round their necks begging from door to door They were dressed in rags
The fox mourns for the death of the hare sighed Sanzang All things are sorry for their own kind
Go and ask them Wukong why they are being punished like that Doing as he had been told Monkey asked What monastery are you from monks
Why are you in cangues and chains My lord said the monks all falling to their knees we are from the Golden Light Monastery and we have been wronged Where is the Golden Light Monastery Monkey asked
Just round the corner they replied
Monkey led them to the Tang Priest and asked them How have you been wronged
Tell me We don't know where you're from but you look a little familiar to us my lords the monks replied We don't dare talk here
Please come to our poor monastery where we can tell you our woes Very well said the venerable elder we shall go to their monastery and ask them all the details They went with them to the monastery gate over which was a board on which was written in letters of gold NATIONPROTECTING GOLDEN LIGHT MONASTERY FOUNDED BY ROYAL COMMAND When master and disciples went inside to look around this is what they saw
Cold were the lamps in the ancient hall Wind blew the leaves along deserted cloisters
A thousandfoot pagoda touched the clouds Pine trees grew to nourish the nature
Journey to the West Fallen blooms carpeted the unvisited grounds Spiders span cobwebs all over the eaves
The drumstand was empty The bell hung in vain And the frescoes could barely be seen through the dust
Still was the pulpit where no priest could be seen Silent the dhyana hall except for the birds
The desolation made one long to sigh Its dreariness caused great pain
Although an incense burner stood before the Buddha All was cold ash withered flowers and desolation
All this made Sanzang miserable and he could not help his tears flowing
The monks in their cangues and chains pushed open the doors of the main Buddhahall and invited him to step inside and worship the Buddha
Sanzang entered offered the incense of his heart and said the recitation three times
Then he turned round again to see six or seven young monks locked to the pillars outside the abbot's lodgings It was more than he could bear
When he entered the abbot's lodgings and all the monks came to kowtow to him they asked You reverend gentlemen look rather different Are you from Great Tang in the East You must have second sight Monkey said with a laugh
We are indeed but how could you tell We don't have second sight my lords the monks replied
It's just that because we're so distressed at the injustice we've suffered and because there's nowhere else we can turn we have been calling on heaven and earth for days on end
Some heavenly deity must have been moved by us because last night we all had the same dream We were told that a holy monk was coming from Great Tang in the East who would save our lives and right our wrongs
We knew who you were today because you looked rather unusual This pleased Sanzang greatly
What country is this and what injustice have you suffered he asked
My lord said the monks on their knees this country is called Jisai and it's one of the biggest in the West In the old days the foreign states all around used to send tribute
Yuetuo in the South Gaochang to the North Western Liang in the East and Benbo to the West
Every year they used to offer fine jade bright pearls beautiful women and magnificent horses
We never had to resort to arms or send expeditions against them
they naturally acknowledged us as their suzerain If they did that your king must understand the Way and your civil and military officials be wise and good Sanzang said
Journey to the West My lord the monks replied to Sanzang's question our country's civil officials are not wise our generals are not good and our monarch does not understand the Way
Auspicious clouds used to gather round the pagoda of our monastery and mists of good omen rose high above it
The glow above it at night could once be seen from thousands of miles away the coloured vapors were admired by the countries all around
That was why this was a divinelyappointed capital to which all the foreigners sent tribute
But three years ago at midnight on the first day of the first month of autumn it rained blood
The next morning everyone was terrified and miserable
All the ministers submitted a memorial to the throne they didn't understand why heaven was so angry with us
Taoists were asked to perform purifications and Buddhist monks to recite sutras as an offering to heaven and earth
Goodness only knows why but our golden pagoda has been contaminated and for the last two years no foreign countries have sent tribute
Our king wanted to send armies to punish them but the officials said that the reason why foreign countries weren't sending tribute was that the auspicious clouds and mists of good omen had disappeared and this was because we monks had stolen the treasure from the pagoda in our monastery
The stupid king did not investigate and those corrupt officials had all us monks arrested We have been beaten and tortured in every possible way
There used to be three generations of us monks in this monastery but the two older generations both died off because they couldn't take the beating and torture
Now we've been arrested and made to wear these cangues and chains
Your Honour we could never be so wicked as to steal the treasure from the pagoda
We implore you to take pity on your fellows and in your great mercy and compassion make wide use of your dharma powers and save our lives At this Sanzang nodded and said with a sigh This is an obscure business that will be hard to sort out
The court is ruling badly and you are suffering a calamity
If it was the rain of blood that contaminated your pagoda why did you not report the fact to your king at the time Instead you let yourselves in for this calamity We are only common mortals your lordship and had no wayof telling what heaven had in mind
Besides our elders didn't understand
What could we be expected to do about it What's the time Wukong Sanzang asked About four in the afternoon Monkey replied
I would like to see the king to present our passport Sanzang said but I cannot solve these monks' problem and report on it to His Majesty
When I left Chang'an I made a vow in the Famen Monastery that on my journey West I would burn incense at every temple I passed worship the Buddha in every monastery I came across and sweep every pagoda I saw
Today I have met these monks who have been wronged on account of their pagoda
Will you get me a new broom while I take a bath I shall then go up to sweep it and find out what has contaminated it and why it does not gleam any longer Once I have found out the truth it will be much easier to report on it in person to the king and rescue them from their misery As soon as the monks in cangues and chains heard this they hurried to the kitchen to fetch a big vegetable chopper that they handed to Pig
Take this chopper your lordship they said and cut through the iron locks holding the young monks to the pillars so that they can prepare you some food and tea and wait on your master while he eats and bathes
Meanwhile we shall go out on the streets again to beg for a new broom for your master to sweep the pagoda with There's no problem about opening locks laughed Pig
We don't need knives or axes Just ask the hairyfaced gentleman he's been opening locks for years Monkey then stepped forward and used lockopening magic
one touch and the locks all fell open
The young monks all ran into the kitchen to clean up the cooking pots and stove and prepare the meal
When Sanzang and his disciples had eaten and it was Journey to the West gradually getting dark the monks in cangues and chains came in with two brooms to Sanzang's great delight
As they were talking a young monk came in to light the lamp and invite Sanzang to take his bath
By now the sky was bright with the moon and the stars and from the lookout towers the watches of the night were being beaten out on the drum
It was indeed the time when Cold breezes blow around the walls And lamps are lit in every house
Along the streets all the doors are shut The gates of the three markets are all closed
The fishing boat is sheltered under the trees The ploughing ox is let off its rope
The woodman gives his axe a rest While the schoolboy can be heard reciting his lessons
When Sanzang had bathed he put on a narrowsleeved tunic tightened the belt around his waist put on a pair of boots and took the new brooms You sleep here while I sweep the pagoda he said to the monks
The pagoda was contaminated by the rain of blood Monkey said and it hasn't shone for many a long day There may be evil things living up there
If you go up by yourself on this cold and windy night I'm worried that something might go wrong
Why don't I go with you Very good idea Sanzang replied and each carrying a broom they first went up into the main Buddha hall where Sanzang lit the glazed lamp burned incense and bowed to the Buddha saying Your disciple Chen Xuanzang has been sent by the Great Tang in the East to worship out Tathagata Buddha on Vulture Peak and fetch the scriptures I have now reached the Golden Light Monastery in the kingdom of Jisai where the monks tell me that their pagoda has been contaminated and that they have been unjustly punished because the king suspects them of having stolen the treasure
Your disciple is now going devoutly to sweep the tower in the hope that my Buddha in his great responsiveness will reveal the cause of the contamination and spare these folk from injustice When he had prayed he and Brother Monkey opened the door of the pagoda and began to sweep it from the ground upwards
That pagoda Towered to the stars Journey to the West Thrust up into space
It was called the glazed tile pagoda The golden sarira spire
The stairway spiraled like the inside of a cave The door seemed to be the door of a coop
The gleam of the vase reached the moon at the horizon The sea breeze carried the sound of its bells
Look at the eaves and corbel brackets The finial in the clouds
The eaves and corbel brackets Were of masonry through which the scented breezes blew
The finial in the clouds Had mist dragons coiling around the pagoda
The view stretched out for hundreds of miles To climb it was to climb to the heavens
At the doors of every story were set glazed lamps But full of dust not light
All around under the eaves ran marble balustrades Covered with filth and insects
Inside the tower By the Buddha statues Incense no longer burned
Outside the windows In front of the divine face Cobwebs covered all
The incenseburners were full of mousedroppings Journey to the West The lamps untouched by oil
Because the treasure had been spirited away Many a monk had died for nothing
Sanzang was determined to sweep out the pagoda And restore to it the beauty that it had before
When he had swept one story the Tang Priest went on to sweep the next and so he continued till he reached the seventh story By now it was the second watch of the night and he was beginning to feel exhausted
You're tired Monkey said Sit here and let me sweep it for you How many stories does it have Sanzang asked
About thirteen I suppose Monkey replied
Overcoming his weariness the Tang Priest said I must sweep it myself to fulfil the vow By the time he had swept another three stories his back and his legs were aching
At the tenth he collapsed and said Sweep the last three floors for me Wukong Monkey summoned up his energy went to the eleventh floor and a moment later up to the twelfth
As he was sweeping there he heard voices from in the roof
That's odd he thought Very odd indeed
It's the third watch They can't be people talking up there as late as this
I'm sure it's evil spirits
Let's have a look The splendid Monkey King put his broom quietly under his arm tucked up his clothes slipped out through the door and stepped on a cloud to take a better look
Sitting in the middle of the thirteenth story were two evil spirits with a dish of food a bowl and a jug of wine They were playing the fingerguessing game and drinking
Monkey used his magic powers to get rid of the broom and bring out his goldbanded cudgel with which he barricaded the entrance to the pagoda and shouted So you're the ones who stole the pagoda's treasure you monsters The two of them jumped up in their panic grabbed the jug and bowl and flung them at him
Monkey deflected them with his iron cudgel and said I won't kill you because I need you to give evidence He just used his cudgel to force them to talk
The devils were pinned against the wall unable to struggle or even move
All they could do was to repeat Spare us spare us It was nothing to do with us
The thief isn't here Monkey used holding magic to carry them singlehanded down to the tenth story where he said Master I've got the thieves This news woke up Sanzang who had been dozing with a start of pleasure Where did you catch them he asked
Dragging the demons over and forcing them to kneel to his master Monkey replied They were drinking and playing fingerguessing up in the roof When I heard the din they were making I shot up by cloud to the roof and blocked their escape
I wasn't rough with them because I was worried that a single blow would kill them and we'd have nobody to give evidence That's why I brought them here nice and gently
You can take Journey to the West statements from them Master and find out where they're from and where the stolen treasure has been hidden The demons were still shivering and shaking and saying Spare us Then they made this true statement
We were sent by the Infinitely Sage Dragon King of the Green Wave Pool on the Ragged Rock Mountain
His name's Benborba and mine is Baborben
He's catfish spirit and I'm a snakehead fish spirit
Our Infinitely Sage Ancient Dragon has a daughter called the Infinitely Sage Princess
She is as lovely as flowers or the moon and brilliant as well The Ancient Dragon got a husband for her who would live in the palace
He has tremendous magic powers and he's called Prince Ninehead
He came here the other year with the dragon king to demonstrate his powers by making a blood rain that contaminated the pagoda and stealing the precious sarira relic of the Buddha
The princess then went up to the Daluo Heaven and stole the Queen Mother's ninelobed magic fungus plant from in front of the Hall of Miraculous Mist We keep it at the bottom of the pool and it shines day and night with golden light and a coloured glow
Recently we've heard that Sun Wukong is on his way to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven They say his powers are enormous and that all along the way he has been looking out for wrongs to right That's why we keep getting sent here to patrol and stop him when the comes
If that Sun Wukong turns up we're ready for him At this Monkey gave a mocking laugh What an evil beast he said He's unspeakable No wonder he invited the Bull Demon King to his place for a banquet the other day
He's been extending his contacts among all these damned demons because he's up to no good Before he had finished speaking Pig and two or three of the young monks came up the steps from the bottom of the pagoda with lanterns Master Pig said why don't you go to bed now that you've swept the pagoda instead of staying here talking You've come at just the right moment brother said Monkey
The pagoda's treasure was stolen by the Infinitely Sage Ancient Dragon
He sent these two little devils I've just captured to patrol the pagoda and keep their ears open for news of us What are they called and what sort of spirits are they Pig asked
They've just confessed everything Monkey replied
This one's called Benborba and he's a catfish spirit and that one's Baborben and he's a snakehead fish spirit Pig then lifted his rake to strike them
If they're evil spirits and they've already confessed he said what are we waiting for Let's kill them No said Monkey you don't understand
Keep them alive so that they can tell it all to the king and lead us to catch the thieves and get the treasure back The splendid idiot then put his rake down again
He and Monkey each carried one of them down the stairs
Spare us the demons kept pleading
I'd like to turn you two fish into soup for those monks who've been mistreated so unjustly muttered Pig
The two or three young monks who were thoroughly delighted led the venerable elder down the pagoda stairs with their lanterns One of them ran ahead to tell the other monks Good news he shouted good news Our troubles are over
The reverend gentlemen have caught the evil spirits who stole the treasure Journey to the West Fetch chains Monkey said run them through their shoulderbones and lock them up here
Watch over them while we get some sleep
We'll decide what to do next tomorrow The monks then kept a very close watch on the demons while Sanzang and his disciples slept
Before they knew it it was dawn
Wukong and I will go to court to present the passport Sanzang said and he put on his brocade cassock and Vairocana mitre
When he was dressed in his majestic vestments he strode forward accompanied by Monkey who had tightened his tigerskin kilt and straightened up his tunic and was carrying the passport
Why aren't you taking those two demons with you Pig asked
We'll submit a memorial to the throne first Monkey replied then I expect the king will send men for them They then went to the palace gates seeing no end of red birds and golden dragons adorning the deep red gateways of the pure capital
At the Gate of Eastern Splendor Sanzang bowed to the officer in charge and said May I trouble Your Honour to report that a monk sent from Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven begs an audience with His Majesty to present his passport The gate officer did indeed make this report going to the steps of the throne to say There are two Buddhist monks with strange faces and strange clothes outside who say they have been sent by the Tang court in the East of the Southern Continent of Jambu to go to the West to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures
They request an audience with Your Majesty in order to present their passport The king then sent for them
As the Tang Priest took him into the palace all the civilian and military officials were alarmed at the sight of Monkey
Some called him the monkey monk and others the thundergod monk they were all too terrified to look at him for very long
The Tang Priest bowed to the king with a dance and a loud chant of obeisance while the Great Sage stood leaning to one side with his arms crossed not moving
The venerable elder then submitted this memorial I am a priest who has been sent by the Great Tang in the East of the Southern Continent of Jambu to worship the Buddha and fetch the true scriptures in Thunder Monastery in the land of India in the West
As my route lies across your distinguished country I would not dare cross without authorization and I beg you to verify the passport I have with me and allow me to proceed The king was very pleased to hear all this so he summoned the holy priest from Tang to the throne hall where an embroidered stool was set for him to sit on
Sanzang went into the hall by himself and handed over the passport before gratefully accepting the courtesy stool
When the king read the passport through he was delighted It appears that when your Great Tang emperor was ill he could choose an eminent monk who would not flinch from a long journey to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures
But all the monks in our country want to do is to steal thus destroying the country and ruining their sovereign When Sanzang heard this he put his hands together and replied How can you be so sure they are destroying the country and ruining their sovereign This country of ours is the leading one in the Western Regions
The foreign states all around always used to send tribute because of the golden pagoda in the Golden Light Monastery in this capital A multicolored glow Journey to the West used to shine from the pagoda right up to the sky
But recently the pagoda's treasure has been stolen by the wicked monks in the monastery and for three years now there has been no coloured glow and no tribute from the foreigners
It is all extremely upsetting for us Your Majesty said Sanzang smiling as he put his hands together in front of his chest a little mistake can lead to a great disaster
Soon after entering the gates of your heavenly capital yesterday I saw a dozen or so monks in cangues
When I asked them why they told me that they were from the Golden Light Monastery and were the victims of injustice
On close investigation in the monastery I found that it was no fault of the monks there
When I swept the pagoda in the middle of the night I captured the thieving devils who had stolen the treasure Where are they asked the delighted king
My disciples have them locked up in the Golden Light Monastery Sanzang replied
The king ordered royal guards to be sent at once to the Golden Light Monastery to fetch the thieving devils so that he could interrogate them himself
Your Majesty I think it would be best if my disciple went with the guards Where is he the king asked
Standing by the steps of the throne Sanzang replied
The king was shocked by what he saw How can your disciple be so ugly when you reverend sir are so handsome he asked
When he heard this the Great Sage Sun shouted at the top of his voice Your Majesty you should no more judge people by their faces than you'd measure the sea with a bucket
Good looks would never have captured the thieving devils This calmed the king's alarm and he said You are right holy monk
We do not know how to select men of talent here
The ones who catch the thieves and recover the treasure are best He then ordered his aides to have a carriage prepared and told the royal guards to look after the holy monk as he went to fetch the thieving devils
The aides had a large palanquin with a yellow canopy got ready in which eight guardsmen carried Monkey with eight more as escorts who shouted to clear the way to the Golden Light Monastery
By now the whole city had heard the news everyone came out to see the holy monk and the thieving devils
Hearing the shouts Pig and Friar Sand imagining that the king must have sent some of his officials hurried out to meet them only to see Monkey riding in the palanquin
Now you're yourself again brother laughed Pig What do you mean Monkey asked putting his hand on Pig to steady himself as he stepped out of the chair
There you are being carried by eight men in a carrying chair under a royal yellow canopy said Pig Isn't that the way the Handsome Monkey King should travel
That's why I said you're yourself again Stop joking said Monkey who then had the two devils brought for him to escort to the king Won't you take me along too Friar Sand asked
You stay here and look after the luggage and the horse Monkey replied
Journey to the West My lords said the monks in cangues and chains why don't you all go to see His Majesty
We can look after your things here In that case we'll all go to report to the king said Monkey and then have you released With Pig manhandling one devil and Friar Sand the other Monkey got back into the palanquin and led the devils to the court
They were soon at the steps of the throne hall where the king was told that the devils had arrived
He came down from his dragon throne to examine them with the Tang Priest and his civil and military officials
One of the devils had bulging cheeks black scales a pointed mouth and sharp teeth
The other had slimy skin a fat belly a big mouth and long whiskers
Although they had legs and could walk it was obvious that they had only assumed a certain appearance of humanity through transformation
Where are you from you thieving devils you evil spirits the king asked
How long have you been preying on this country Which year did you steal our treasure
How many of you bandits are there What are your names
I want it all and I want the truth The two devils fell to their knees before him and although blood was gushing from their necks they did not feel the pain This was what they had to say
Three years ago on the first day of the seventh month the Infinitely Sage Dragon King brought a crowd of his relations to live in the Southeast corner of this country in the Green Wave Pool on Ragged Rock Mountain about forty miles from here
He has an extremely attractive daughter for whom he found a husband to live in our palace Prince Ninehead
His magic powers are unbeatable He knew that you had a rare treasure in your tower so he plotted with the dragon king to steal it First he made it rain blood and then he stole the Buddha relic
Now it lights up the dragon palace which is as bright as day even in the darkest night
Then the princess used her powers to sneak up and steal the Queen Mother's magic fungus to keep the treasure warm in the pool
We two aren't the bandit chiefs We're just private soldiers sent here by the dragon king who were captured last night
This is the truth As you have made this confession the king said why don't you tell me your names I am Benborba one of them replied and he is Baborben
I am a catfish monster and he is a snakehead monster The king then told the royal guards to keep them safely behind bars and ordered Release all the monks of the Golden Light Monastery from their cangues and chains and have the Office of Foreign Affairs prepare a banquet in the Unicom Hall to congratulate the holy monks on their great achievements in catching the thieves
We shall now invite them to capture the ringleaders The Office of Foreign Affairs then laid on a double banquet of both meat and vegetarian food for which the king invited Sanzang and his disciples to take their places in the Unicorn Hall
May I ask your title holy monk he said to Sanzang who replied his hands together My lay surname is Chen and my Buddhist name Xuanzang
My emperor granted me the surname Tang and the title Sanzang What are your disciple's titles the king asked
They do not have titles Sanzang replied
The senior one is called Sun Wukong the second one Zhu Wuneng and the third Sha Wujing These were the names the Bodhisattva Guanyin of the Southern Sea gave them
When they became my disciples I called Wukong Sun the Novice Wuneng Bajie and Wujing Friar Sand Journey to the West The king then asked Sanzang to take the place of honour while Monkey sat at his left and Pig and Friar Sand at his right
Their banquet was all vegetarian fruit vegetables tea and rice
In front of them was a table of meat dishes at which sat the king and below him were a hundred or more tables set with meat dishes for all the civil and military officials
The officials all thanked the king for his kindness and the disciples sat down with the permission of their master
When all were seated the king raised his goblet and though Sanzang would not drink his three disciples all drank to the success of the banquet
Woodwinds and strings then began to sound as the court musicians performed
Just watch Pig as he eats for all he is worth gobbling his food down whole like a tiger or a wolf and emptying the table
Soon more soup and food was brought only to disappear in the same way
Every time servants brought more wine he drained the cup never refusing
The feast went on till after midday before it broke up
When Sanzang expressed his thanks for the sumptuous banquet the king wanted to keep him longer
It was just a gesture to thank you holy monks for catching the demons He then ordered the Office of Foreign Affairs to move the banquet to the Jianzhang Palace so that he could discuss with the holy monks how the ringleaders were to be captured and the treasure brought back to the pagoda
If we are to capture the thieves and recover the treasure Sanzang said another banquet won't be needed
We shall take our leave of Your Majesty now and set off to catch the demons But the king insisted on taking them to the Jianzhang Palace for another banquet
Which of you holy monks will lead the force that is to capture the monsters he asked raising his goblet
Send my senior disciple Sun Wukong Sanzang replied
The Great Sage raised his clasped hands and bowed in acknowledgement
If the venerable Sun is going how big a force of cavalry and foot will he need the king asked and when will he be setting out At this Pig could not restrain himself from shouting We won't need any soldiers and we don't care when we go
With a good meal and a few drinks inside us he and I can go and catch them right now just by laying our hands on them Bajie said Sanzang with delight you're getting very keen Very well then said Monkey
Friar Sand you guard the master while we two go Even if you two venerable elders don't need troops the king said surely you need weapons We don't need your weapons laughed Pig
We carry our own On hearing this the king fetched two huge goblets and drank a toast to them on their journey
We won't have any more to drink said Monkey But we'd like the royal guards to bring those little demons to us
We need them as guides The king gave the order and they were brought out at once
Then Monkey and Pig each firmly grasping a demon rode the wind and used carrying magic to take them off to the Southeast
Indeed
Only when king and court saw the magical clouds Journey to the West Did they realize that the four of them were truly holy monks
If you don't know how the capture went and what they found listen to the explanation in the next installment
Two Monks Wipe out the Demons in the Dragon Palace The Sages Destroy Evil and Recover the Treasure The story tells how the king of Jisai and his officials high and low watched as the Great Sage Monkey and Pig disappeared by wind and cloud carrying the two demons with them Then all of them bowed in homage to heaven saying Their fame is well founded Only today can we really believe that such immortals and living Buddhas exist As Monkey and Pig vanished into the distance the king bowed again to thank Sanzang and Friar Sand
Our mortal eyes were only able to see that your illustrious disciples had the power to capture thieving devils We never realized that you were superior immortals with the power to ride on winds and clouds I do not have any dharma powers Sanzang replied
On my journey I have depended very much on my three disciples I tell you the truth Your Majesty said Friar Sand
My senior fellowdisciple is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who has been converted He once made havoc in Heaven and none of the hundred thousand heavenly troops was a match for his goldbanded cudgel He had the Supreme Lord Lao Zi and the Jade Emperor both scared
My next senior fellowdisciple is Marshal Tian Peng now a faithful Buddhist He once commanded  sailors on the River of Heaven
I'm the only one of us with no magic powers I was the Curtainlifting General before I took my vows
We're useless at everything except capturing demons and monsters arresting thieves and runaways subduing tigers and dragons and kicking the sky into a well And we know a thing or two about stirring up the sea and turning rivers upsidedown
Oh yes and then there's riding clouds and mists summoning wind and rain moving the stars around in the sky carrying mountains and chasing the moon but those are just extras All this made the king treat them with very great respect Indeed
Inviting Sanzang to take the place of honour he kept addressing him as Buddha and referring to Friar Sand and the others as bodhisattvas
All the civil and military officials were delighted and the citizens of the country kowtowed to them
The story switches to the Great Sage Monkey and Pig riding their storm wind to the Green Wave Pool on the Ragged Rock Mountain where they stopped their clouds
Blowing a magic breath on his goldbanded cudgel Wukong told it to change and turned it into a monk's knife with which he cut an ear off the snakehead and the lower lip of the catfish then threw the two demons into the water with a shout of Tell the Infinitely Sage Dragon King that Lord Sun the Great Sage Equaling Heaven is here If he wants me to spare the lives of him and his family he'd better hand over the treasure from the pagoda of the Golden Light Monastery in Jisai at once
If there's even the hint of a 'no' from him I'll give this pool such a stirring that there'll be no water left in it and then exterminate his whole family Journey to the West Having been given this order the two little devils fled for their lives in great pain jumping into the water chains ropes and all to the alarm of the various turtle alligator shrimp crab and fish spirits who crowded round them to ask Why are you roped and chained Once of them shook his head and waved his tail with his hand over his ear the other stamped and beat his chest as he covered his mouth
There was much shouting and commotion as they both went to the dragon king's palace to report Disaster Your Majesty The Infinitely Sage Dragon King was drinking with his soninlaw Prince Ninehead when the two of them arrived What disaster the dragon king asked putting down his cup
We were on sentry duty last night they reported when the Tang Priest and Sun the Novice captured us as they were sweeping the pagoda
We were chained up and taken to see the king this morning Then Sun the Novice and Pig dragged us here One of us had an ear cut off and the other a lip Then they threw us into the water to come to ask for the treasure from the top of the pagoda They then told the whole story in great detail
The news about Sun the Novice the Great Sage Equaling Heaven gave the ancient dragon such a fright that his souls left his body and were scattered beyond the sky Soninlaw he said to the prince shivering and shaking anyone else would have been easy enough to deal with but if it's him it's terrible Relax fatherinlaw the prince replied
I've been studying the martial arts since childhood and made friends with quite a few of the world's heroes He's nothing to be scared of
After three rounds with me I guarantee the wretch will surrender with his head hanging so low he won't even dare look you in the face The splendid demon jumped to his feet put on his armor took the weapon he used a crescentbladed halberd walked out of the palace parted the waters and when he reached the surface called out What's all this about a 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven'
Come and give yourself up at once Standing on the bank Pig and Monkey saw how the evil spirit was dressed
A silver helmet on his head Outshone the whitest snow The suit of armor that he wore Was higher than autumn frost
Over it was a battlerobe of brocade With dragons cloudpatterns and pearls The rhinocerospatterned belt at his waist Was like a python wrapped in gold
He held a crescent halberd That flew and flashed like lightning Journey to the West The pigskin boots on his feet Moved as smoothly as water or waves
From a distance he seemed to have only one face and head But seen from close to there were faces all around him Eyes in front and eyes behind That could see in all directions Mouths to the left and mouths to the right Nine of them all talking
One shout from him would make the sky shake Like the call of the crane resounding through the stars
As nobody answered he shouted again Which of you is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven Touching the golden band round his head and fingering his iron cudgel Monkey replied I am Where do you live the demon asked
Where are you from
What brought you to Jisai to look after the king's pagoda Why did you have the effrontery to capture and mutilate two of our officers
And why are you here demanding battle now Thieving devil replied Monkey abusively it's obvious you don't know who I am Come a little closer and I'll tell you
My people come from the Mount of Flowers and Fruit From the Water Curtain Cave in the middle of the sea
Since childhood I have made my body indestructible The Jade Emperor created me Heavenequaling Sage
When I made havoc in the Dipper and Bull Palace All the gods of Heaven were not enough to beat me
The Buddha then was asked to use his great and subtle powers His infinite wisdom went beyond the mortal world
Journey to the West When I matched my powers with his and made my somersaults His hand turned to a mountain and crushed me underneath
There I was kept for full five hundred years And only was released when converted by Guanyin Because Sanzang was going to the Western Heaven To seek the Buddha's words at distant Vulture Peak
She freed me then to escort the holy monk To clear up all the monsters and purify my conduct
Our journey led to Jisai in the regions of the West Where there monkish generations have been cruelly mistreated
When in our mercy we asked them what had happened We learned that the pagoda no longer shone with light My master swept it clean to find out the reason
In the deep silence of the night's third watch We captured the demons and extracted their confessions
They said you were the thief who had stolen the great treasure Conspiring to be a robber with the ancient dragon king And the princess who is also known as Infinitely Sage
Your rain of blood washed out the pagoda's magic light And you brought the treasure back to use it here yourselves
The confession that they made was true in every detail And we have come here now on His Majesty's own orders
That is why we looked for you and challenge you to battle Never will you need to ask my name again
Give the king back his treasure this instant If you want to save the lives of all members of your family
Journey to the West Should you in your folly try to make resistance Your pool will be dried out and your palace smashed to ruins When the prince heard all this he replied with a touch of a mocking smile If you're monks going to fetch the scriptures you shouldn't be trumping up charges where it's none of your business
So what if I stole their treasure You're going to fetch your Buddhist scriptures and it's nothing to do with you Why are you here looking for a fight Thieving devil said Monkey you've got no idea of right and wrong
The king's done us no favours We don't drink his kingdom's waters or eat its grain We were under no obligation to do thing for him
But you have stolen his treasure contaminated his pagoda and brought years of misery to the monks in the Golden Light Monastery
They are our fellow believers so of course we'll make an effort for them and right their wrong So it looks as though you want a fight said the prince
As the saying goes the warrior avoids unnecessary combat but once I start there'll be no mercy you'll be dead in next to no time and that will be the end of going to fetch the scriptures Bloody thieving devil Monkey cursed back you must think you're quite a fighter talking big like that
Come here and take this The prince was not flustered in the least as he blocked the cudgel with his crescentbladed halberd A fine battle ensued on the Ragged Rock Mountain
Because the monster stole the treasure the pagoda was dark Monkey went to catch the demons for the sake of the king The little devils fled for their lives back into the water The ancient dragon took counsel in his terror
Prince Ninehead showed his might As he went out in armor to exercise his powers
The angry Great Sage Equaling Heaven Raised his goldbanded cudgel that was very hard Indeed
In the monster's mine heads were eighteen eyes Shining bright as they looked in all directions
Monkey's iron arms were immensely strong And auspicious lights glowed all around
Journey to the West The halberd was like a new moon's crescent The cudgel like flying frost
Why don't you give up trying to right wrongs You were wrong to steal the pagoda's treasure
Behave yourself damned devil And give me back the treasure if you want to live Cudgel and halberd fought for mastery Neither emerged as victor in the fight
The two of them fought hard for over thirty rounds without either of them emerging as winner
Pig who was standing on the mountain admiring the sweetness and beauty of their fight raised his rake and brought down on the evil spirit from behind Now the monster's nine heads all had eyes in them and he could see Pig coming behind him very clearly so he now used the buttend of his halberd to block the rake while holding off the cudgel with the blade
He resisted for another six or seven rounds until he could hold out no longer against the weapons that were swinging at him from before and behind when he rolled away and leapt up into the sky in his true form as a nineheaded bird He looked thoroughly repulsive the sight of him was enough to kill one with horror
His body all covered in feathers and down His girth was some twelve feet measured around And he was as long as an old crocodile
His two feet were as sharp as bookshaped blades And his nine heads were all set in a circle
When he opened his wings he could fly superbly Not even the roc could match his great strength
His voice could resound to the edge of the sky With an echo even louder than the call of the crane
Bright flashed golden light from his many pairs of eyes His pride far outstripped that of ordinary birds
Journey to the West The sight alarmed Pig who said Brother I've never seen anything as ugly in all my days
What sort of blood could that monstrous bird have been born of There's nothing like him Monkey replied nothing
I'm going up to kill him The splendid Great Sage then leapt up on his cloud into midair where he struck at the monster's head with his cudgel
The monster now displayed the power of his body as he swooped down his wings outspread then turned with a roaring noise to come low over the mountain and shoot out from his waist another head with a mouth open wide like a bowl of blood His beak gripped Pig's bristles at the first attempt then he dragged Pig to the pool and pulled him in
Once back outside the dragon palace he turned himself back into what he had been before threw Pig to the ground and said Where are you little ones Thereupon the mackerel trout carp mandarin fish hard and softshelled tortoises and alligators who were all armored demons rushed forward with a shout of Here Take this monk and tie him up for me said the prince
This will be revenge for our patrolling sentries Shouting and pushing the spirits carried Pig inside to the delight of the ancient dragon king who came out to meet the prince with the words Congratulations soninlaw
How did you catch him The prince then told him the whole story after which the ancient dragon ordered a celebratory banquet which we need not describe
Instead the story tells how Monkey thought in terror after the evil spirit had captured Pig This monster is terrible
But if I go back to the court to see the master the king will probably laugh at me
But if I challenge him to battle again how will I deal with him singlehanded Besides I'm not used to coping in water
I'll just have to turn myself into something to get inside and see what the evil spirit has done with Pig
If it's possible I'll sneak him out of there to help me The splendid Great Sage then made magic with his fingers shook himself turned into a crab again and plunged into the water till he was outside the archway again
He knew the way from when he had come here the previous time and stolen the Bull King's wateraverting goldeneyed beast
When he reached the gateway to the palace he walked in sideways to see the ancient dragon king the nineheaded monster and their whole family drinking together to celebrate Not daring to go too close
Monkey crawled under the eaves of the Eastern verandah where several shrimp and crab spirits were fooling around and amusing themselves
He listened to them for a while then said imitating their way of talking Is the longsnouted monk the prince brought here dead or alive He's alive the spirits all replied and tied up
Can't you see him groaning under the Western verandah over there Monkey then crawled quietly over to the Western verandah where he did indeed find Pig tied to a column and groaning
Can you recognize me Pig he asked Pig knew who it was from Monkey's voice This is terrible brother he said
The monster got me Looking all around to make sure there was nobody there Monkey cut through the ropes with his claws and told Pig to go
What am I to do brother Pig said
He's got my rake Do you know where he put it Monkey asked
I think he must have taken it into the main hall of the palace Pig replied Journey to the West Wait for me under the arch said Monkey and Pig slipped quietly out to save his skin
Monkey climbed up on the roof of the main hall from where he saw the intense glow of Pig's rake down on the left made himself invisible and sneaked it out of the palace
Once under the archway he called Pig take your weapon You go on ahead brother said Pig now reunited with his rake I'm going to attack that palace
If I win I'll capture the whole family of them and if I lose you'll be waiting by the bank to rescue me Monkey who was delighted at the suggestion urged him to be careful
I'm not scared of him Pig replied
I know a thing or two when it comes to water Monkey then left him and came up through the water
Pig meanwhile tightened the belt round his black tunic grasped his rake with both hands and charged in with a great warcry that sent all the members of the watery tribe rushing into the palace and shouting Disaster
The longsnouted monk has broken free from his bonds and is charging back in The ancient dragon king the nineheaded monster and the rest of the family were caught off their guard and all they could do was jump to their feet and flee for cover
The idiot not fearing for his life charged into the hall laying about him with his rake as he went He smashed everything doors tables chairs winecups and all else too
There is a poem to prove it that goes When the mother of wood was taken by the water monster The mindape did not flinch from a difficult rescue
One used his secret skills to open the locks The other one showed his might in hatred and wrath
The prince fled taking his princess to safety Not a sound was heard from the shivering dragon
The palace's crimson windows and doors were all smashed The dragon's descendants were all scared out of their wits
Pig smashed the tortoiseshell screens to powder and the coral trees to fragments
When the nineheaded monster had hidden his princess safely inside he grabbed his crescentbladed halberd and went for Pig in the front of the living quarters of the palace shouting Bloody idiot How dare you terrorize my family Thieving devil retorted Pig
How dared you capture me
This was none of my fight till you brought me into it
Give the treasure back at once for me to take back to the king and that'll be that
Otherwise every last member of your family will be killed The demon was in no mood for kindness
he ground his teeth and started fighting Pig
Only then did the ancient dragon calm down enough to lead his dragon sons and grandsons to surround and attack Pig with their spears and swords
Seeing that things were going badly for him Pig feinted and fled followed by the ancient dragon and his host
A moment later he shot up through the water and they all surfaced at the top of the pool
Journey to the West Monkey who had been waiting on the bank suddenly saw them coming out of the water after Pig so he put one foot on a cloud and brought out his iron cudgel with a shout of Stay where you are His first blow smashed the ancient dragon king to pulp
It was a terrible sight his corpse and the scales that had come off it floated on the surface of the pool which turned red with his gore
His sons and grandsons all fled for their lives in terror while Prince Ninehead took the body back to the underwater palace
Brother Monkey and Pig did not pursue them but went back to the bank to discuss what had happened I've knocked a bit of the stuffing out of him said Pig
I went charging in with my rake and smashed everything to smithereens
They were all scared witless I was just fighting the prince when the ancient dragon king went for me Thanks for killing him
Now those bastards have gone back they'll be too busy with mourning and the funeral to come out again
Besides it's getting late now
What are we going to do Never mind about it being late replied Monkey This is our chance Get back down there and attack again
You must get the treasure so that we can go back to court The idiot was feeling lazy so he made all sorts of excuses to get out of going down again but Monkey insisted Don't worry so brother
Just draw him out again as you did just now and I'll kill him As the two of them were talking they heard the roar of a mighty wind as dark and gloomy clouds came from the East heading South
When Monkey took a closer look he saw that it was the Illustrious Sage Erlang with the Six Brothers of Plum Hill They had falcons and hounds and were carrying foxes hares waterdeer and deer that they had killed All of them had bows and crossbows at their waists and were carrying sharp swords as they arrived on their wind and clouds
Pig said Monkey here come my sevensagesworn brothers Let's stop them and ask them to help us in this fight
This will really stack the odds in our favour If they're your sworn brothers they owe you that said Pig
The only trouble is that the eldest of them the Illustrious Sage once made me surrender so I feel too embarrassed to face him said Monkey
I'd like you to go up stop the clouds and say 'Wait a moment please True Lord The Great Sage Equaling Heaven would like to pay his respects' I'm sure he'll stop then
I can only face him after he's landed The idiot then shot up on his cloud to the top of the mountain to stop Erlang True Lord he shouted at the top of his voice could you slow down for a moment
The Great Sage Equaling Heaven would like to see you On hearing this Lord Erlang ordered the six brothers to stop and exchanged polite salutations with Pig Where is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven he asked
Awaiting your summons at the foot of the mountain Pig replied
Brothers said Erlang go and ask him up at once The six brothers Kang Zhang Yao Li Guo and Zhi all came out of their camps and said Great Sage our eldest brother has sent us with an invitation for you Monkey went forward paid his respects to them then accompanied them to the top of the mountain where Lord Erlang received him took him by the hand and returned his courtesies Great Sage he said allow me to congratulate you on being rescued from your terrible sufferings and being converted to the Buddhist faith Soon you will have succeeded and will be sitting on your lotus throne Journey to the West I don't deserve your congratulations Monkey replied
I am under enormous obligations that I've hardly begun to repay
I've been rescued and am heading West but it's too soon to say whether we'll succeed
As we agreed to rescue some monks from disaster in the kingdom of Jisai we are here to capture a demon and demand the return of a treasure
Seeing that you are passing this way eldest brother I wonder if I could persuade you to stay and help us
May I ask where you have come from and whether you'd be willing to help I'm just on my way home from a hunting trip with my brothers because I had nothing to do Erlang replied
I'm grateful to you Great Sage for asking me to stay out of consideration for our old friendship
Of course I'll help subdue a demon if that is what you wish
What kind of demons are there here Have you forgotten the six brothers asked
This is the Ragged Rock Mountain and below it is the Green Wave Pool the Infinitely Sage Dragon's palace The Infinitely Sage Ancient Dragon is no troublemaker said Erlang with astonishment
How could he have robbed the pagoda Recently he's had a soninlaw living with him Monkey replied a nineheaded monster turned spirit
He plotted it all with his fatherinlaw They made it rain blood on Jisai then stole the sacred Buddha relic from the top of the pagoda in the Golden Light Monastery
The king in his ignorance had the monks arrested and tortured
I captured two of their underlings in the pagoda who'd been sent out on patrol when my master in his mercy swept it out one night and they confessed everything in the palace this morning
When the king asked our master to capture these monsters we two were sent here
In the first fight the nineheaded monster grew another head that shot out from his waist and carried Pig off
I had to transform myself to go into the water and rescue him
Then there was another big fight in which I killed the ancient dragon king The swine have recovered the body and are now in mourning
We two were just discussing how to draw them into battle again when we saw you arriving
That's why I have had the effrontery to ask to see you As you've killed the ancient dragon king you'll have to hit them so hard that the monster won't know what to do Erlang replied
Then you can clean up the whole den of them Yes said Pig but it's late now There's a soldier's saying that you should never put off an attack Erlang replied It doesn't matter that it's late Don't be so impatient brother said Kang Yao Quo and Zhi
The demon's family is here so we don't think he'll run away
Brother Monkey is a distinguished guest and Ironhaired Pig has been converted too We have wine and good food in our camp Why don't we tell the little ones to light the stove and set out a banquet here It would be a way of congratulating them and a chance to talk at the same time
After a good night's feasting there'll be plenty of time for the battle tomorrow Erlang was very pleased with the suggestion
An excellent idea brothers The underlings were then ordered to set out the banquet
We couldn't possibly refuse you gentlemen's generous invitation Monkey replied
But now we're monks we may only eat vegetarian food
We can't eat meat We have vegetarian food in plenty Erlang replied and monastic wine too All the brothers then drank and talked of the old days under the light of the moon and the stars when the sky was their canopy and the earth their mats
Journey to the West How true it is that the night is long in loneliness and short in pleasure
Soon the East started to become light and Pig feeling very cheerful and energetic after a few drinks said It's getting light
I'm going down to challenge them to battle Be careful Marshal said Erlang
Just lure him out for my brothers and me to deal with I understand grinned Pig I understand Watch as he tucks up his clothes grabs his rake makes waterdividing magic jumps in goes straight to the archway and charges into the palace with a great warcry
The dragon sons were wearing the hempen clothes of mourning as they watched and wept over the dragon's body while the dragon grandsons and the prince were preparing the coffin at the back Then in came Pig roaring abuse at them
He landed a terrible blow from his rake that made nine holes in a dragon son's head
The dragon's widow fled inside in terror with the rest of them
The longsnouted monk's killed my son now she howled and on hearing this the prince led the dragon grandsons out to fight wielding his crescentbladed halberd
Pig raised his rake to parry the halberd and fought a fighting retreat till he jumped out of the water
The Great Sage Equaling Heaven and the seven sworn brothers all leapt into the fray thrusting furiously with sword and spear One of the dragon grandsons was chopped up into mincemeat
Seeing that things were going badly the prince rolled in front of the mountain turned back into himself spread his wings and started circling around
Erlang then took his golden bow fixed a silver pellet to it pulled it to its full extent and fired it in the air
The monster pulled in its wings and swooped down to bite Erlang with the head that shot out from its waist
Erlang's slim dog leapt up barked and bit off the head which dripped blood
The monster fled for his life in great pain heading straight back for the Northern Sea Pig wanted to go after him but Monkey stopped him
Don't chase him he said Never corner a defeated enemy
Now the dog's bitten that head off I'm sure he'll be more dead than alive I'm going to turn myself into his double
I want you to part the waters and chase me in there to find the princess and trick the treasure out of her You don't have to chase him if you don't want to said Erlang and his six sages but by letting a creature like that stay alive you are only creating trouble for the future The nineheaded gory monsters that are still found today are its descendants
Pig did as he was told and parted a way through the waters for Monkey looking just like the monster to flee with himself in noisy pursuit
They soon reached the dragon palace where Princess Infinitely Sage asked Why are you in such a state prince Pig beat me Monkey replied and chased me in here I'm no match for him
Hide the treasures somewhere safe Not realizing in her alarm that he was an impostor she fetched a golden casket from the rear palace that she gave to Monkey with the words
This is the Buddha relic Then she fetched a white jade box that she gave to Monkey saying This is the ninelobed magic fungus
Hide the treasures away where they'll be safe while I fight two or three rounds with him to cover you
When the treasures are safe come and join in the fight Monkey then tucked the treasures into his clothes rubbed his face and turned back into himself Have a good look princess he said
Am I really your husband As the princess made a desperate grab for the boxes Pig ran up and knocked her to the floor with a blow on the shoulder from his rake
Journey to the West The ancient dragon's widow was fleeing as Pig grabbed her and raised his rake to smash her Stop said Monkey Don't kill her
Keep her alive for when we go back to announce our victory at court Pig then lifted her up out of the water while Monkey followed him to the bank with the two boxes
Thanks to your power and prestige elder brother we have recovered the treasures and wiped out the thieving devils said Monkey That was no credit of ours said Erlang
In the first place the king's good fortune equaled heaven and in the second you worthy brothers showed your boundless powers The brothers then all said As you have now succeeded Brother Monkey we shall take our leave of you Monkey expressed his thanks profusely and tried to persuade them to go to see the king
None of them agreed and they led their forces back to Guankou
Monkey carried the boxes and Pig dragged the dragon wife back to the city in next to no time travelling by cloud and mist
The liberated monks of the Golden Light Monastery were waiting for them outside the city and when they saw the two of them suddenly alight from the clouds they went up and kowtowed ushering them into the city
The king was then sitting in the main hall of the palace talking with the Tang Priest
A monk came ahead and took his courage in his hands to go in through the palace gates and report Your Majesty Lords Monkey and Pig are back with one of the thieves and the treasures The moment he heard this news the king hurried down from the throne hall to welcome them with the Tang Priest and Friar Sand He was full of expressions of gratitude for their amazing achievement and he ordered a thanksgiving banquet
We don't need any drinks now said Sanzang
We can only feast when my disciples have returned the treasure to the pagoda He then asked Monkey why it was that they were only back then as they had left the day before Monkey then told him all about the battle with the prince the death of the dragon king meeting the True Lord Erlang the defeat of the evil monsters and how he had got the treasures through trickery and transformation
Sanzang the king and all the civil and military officials were delighted
Can the dragon wife talk in human speech the king then asked Of course she knows human speech Pig replied
She was married to a dragon and had a lot of dragon sons and grandsons In that case said the king she'd better tell us the whole story of their crimes I don't know anything about the theft of the Buddha relic she said That was all done by that husband of mine the dragon who's a ghost now and our soninlaw the nineheaded monster
They knew that the light from your pagoda came from the Buddha relic that they stole under cover of the blood rain When asked how the magic fungus was stolen she answered My daughter the Infinitely Sage Princess sneaked into the Daluo Heaven and stole the Queen Mother's ninelobed magic fungus from in front of the Hall of Miraculous Mist
The magic vapors of the fungus have nourished the relic which will now be indestructible and shine for tens of thousands of years
Even if it's buried or put in a field it will give out thousands of beams of coloured light and auspicious vapors the moment it's brushed
You have now taken it back and killed my husband all my sons my soninlaw and my daughter Please spare my life There'll be no mercy for you Pig replied
Journey to the West There's no such thing as a family that's all criminal said Monkey I'll spare your life on one condition
you look after the pagoda for me for ever A poor life is better than a good death the dragon wife replied
Spare my life and I'll do whatever you want Monkey sent for an iron chain that was fetched by one of the aides
He put it through the dragon wife's collarbone and said to Friar Sand Please ask the king to come and watch the treasures being put back in the pagoda The king then had his carriage prepared and left the court handinhand with Sanzang accompanied by the civil and military officials
He went to the Golden Light Monastery and climbed the pagoda where the relic was placed in a precious vase on the thirteenth floor just under the roof The dragon wife was chained to the central column of the pagoda
Spells were then said to summon the local deities and city gods of the capital and the Guardians of the monastery who were ordered to bring the dragon wife food and drink once every three days to keep her alive
If she tried any tricks they were to execute her on the spot
The gods all secretly accepted their orders
Brother Monkey used the magic fungus to sweep out the thirteen stories of the pagoda one by one then put it in the vase to look after the relic
Then and only then did the pagoda shine anew with coloured light and an auspicious glow that could be seen from all directions and admired by the countries all around
When they came down out of the pagoda the king thanked them with the words If you venerable Buddha and your three Bodhisattvas had not come here this matter would never have been cleared up Your Majesty Monkey said Golden Light is not a good name as it's not something permanent Gold can melt and light is only shining vapor
As we monks have gone to some trouble on your behalf we would like to change the name to Subdued Dragon Monastery
This will ensure that you live for ever The king ordered that the name be changed and a new board hung up that read
NATIONPROTECTING SUBDUED DRAGON MONASTERY FOUNDED BY ROYAL COMMAND He then commanded that a banquet be laid on and sent for painters to paint portraits of the four of them Their names were recorded in the Tower of Five Phoenixes
The king then had his carriage brought out to see the Tang Priest and his disciples on their way He tried to give them gold and jewels but they firmly refused to accept anything Indeed
Evil had been wiped out Now calmness once more reigned Sunshine had been brought back Journey to the West The pagoda's light regained
If you don't know what happened on the journey ahead listen to the explanation in the next installment
Wuneng Works Hard on Thorn Ridge Sanzang Talks of Poetry in the Wood Immortals' Hermitage The story has been told how the king of Jisai thanked Tang Sanzang and his three disciples for capturing the demons and pressed on them gold and jade none of which they would accept
The king therefore told his aides to have made for each of them two suits of clothing like those they were wearing two pairs of socks two pairs of shoes and two belts They were also provided with dry rations and their passport was duly examined and returned They were seen out of the city by a procession of carriages the civil and military officials the common people of the city and the monks of the Subdued Dragon Monastery There was also loud music
After six or seven miles they took their leave of the king to be accompanied for a further six or seven miles by everyone else
Then all the others turned back except the monks of the Subdued Dragon Monastery who were still with them after twenty miles Some of the monks wanted to accompany them to the Western Heaven and the others wanted to cultivate their conduct and wait on them
Seeing that none of them was willing to turn back Monkey decided to use his powers
He pulled out thirty or forty of his hairs blew on them with magic breath shouted Change and turned them into ferocious striped tigers that leapt roaring about on the path ahead
Only then were the monks scared into going back
The Great Sage then led the master as he whipped his horse forward and they were soon far away
At this the monks began to weep aloud shouting Kind and honorable sirs fate must be against us since you won't take us with you Let us tell not of the wailing monks but of how the master and his three disciples headed along the main path West for a while before Monkey took his hairs back
Once again the seasons were changing and it was now the end of winter and the beginning of spring neither hot nor cold As they were making their way along without a care they saw a long ridge in front of them over which the road led
Sanzang reined in his horse to look He saw that the ridge was overgrown with brambles and creepers Although the line of the path could be made out there were brambles and thorns all over it
How are we going to manage that path disciples he asked No problem Monkey replied
But disciple the path is covered with thorns We could only manage it by crawling on our bellies like snakes or insects
Your backs will be bent with walking and I'll never be able to ride the horse There's nothing to worry about Master Pig replied I'll clear the thorns away with my rake It'll be just like gathering up kindling for the fire
Never mind about riding your horseI promise we could even get up there in a carryingchair You are very strong the Tang Priest replied but it is a long way and it will be hard I don't know where you'll find the energy to do that distance goodness only knows how far it is Journey to the West There's no need to guess said Monkey
I'll go and have a look When he jumped up into the air he saw it stretching away endlessly Indeed
Vast was its size It was covered in mist and rain
Soft was the carpet of grass on the path The mountain was covered in brilliant green
New leaves were sprouting in dense abundance Fragrant creepers climbed all around
When seen from afar no end was in sight From close to it seemed a mass of verdant cloud Luxuriant mysterious and green
The winds soughed everywhere As the ridge shone bright in the sunshine
There was pine and cypress and bamboo Many a plum and willow and mulberry too
Climbing figs coiled round ancient trees While creepers entwined the weeping poplars All twisted together like a frame Woven together in a bed
Here the flowers made living brocade Far spread the scent of boundless blossom
Everyone's life has brambles and thorns But none are as tall as those in the West
Having looked for a long time Monkey brought his cloud down and said Master it's a very long way Journey to the West How far Sanzang asked
I can't see any end to it Monkey replied There must be at least three hundred miles of it That's terrible said Sanzang
Don't be miserable Master said Friar Sand with a laugh We know how to burn undergrowth Set fire to it with a torch and all the thorns will be burned away
Then we'll be able to cross Don't talk nonsense Pig replied
You can only clear the ground that way in November or later when the grass has withered and there are dead trees The fire won't take otherwise
It'd never burn now when everything's growing Even if it did burn it would be terrifying said Monkey
Then how are we to get across Sanzang asked
You'll just have to depend on me said Pig with a grin
The splendid idiot made a spell with his hands and said the words of it leaned forward and said Grow He grew two hundred feet tall then waved the rake and shouted
Change It became three hundred feet long
Then he strode forward and wielded the rake twohanded to clear the undergrowth from both sides of the path Come with me Master he said
Sanzang was delighted to whip the horse along and follow close behind while Friar Sand carried the luggage and Monkey used his cudgel to help clear the way
They did not let their hands rest for a moment all day long and they had covered over thirty miles when near nightfall they came to an empty stretch of ground where a stone tablet stood in the middle of the path
On the tablet the words THORN RIDGE were written large and under them two lines of smaller writing read Two hundred and fifty miles of rampant thorns few travelers have ever taken this road When Pig saw this he said with a laugh Let me add a couple more lines to that
'Pig has always been good at removing thorns he's cleared the roads right to the West' Sanzang then dismounted in a very good mood
Disciples he said I've put you to a lot of trouble
Let's stop here for the night and carry on at first light tomorrow Don't stop now Master said Pig with a smile It's a clear sky and we're in the mood
It's all right if we carry on all bloody night The venerable elder had to accept his suggestion
While Pig was working so hard in the lead all four of them pressed ahead without stopping for the night and another day until it was evening once more
In frontof them the trees and undergrowth were densely tangled and the wind could be heard rustling in the bamboos and soughing in the pines
Luckily they came to another patch of empty land where there stood an old temple outside whose gates pine and cypress formed a solid green shade while peach and plum trees rivaled each other in beauty
Sanzang then dismounted and went with his three disciples to examine it
This is what they saw Before the cliff an ancient shrine stood by a cold stream Desolation hung all around the hill
Journey to the West White cranes in the thickets made the moon seem brighter The green moss on the steps had been there for years
The rustle of green bamboo seemed like human speech The remaining calls of the birds seemed expressions of grief
Dogs and hens never came and few human souls Wild flowers and plants grew all over the wall This place strikes me as very sinister said Monkey
Let's not stay here long You're being overcautious brother remarked Friar Sand
As this is deserted and I don't think there are any monsters wild beasts or fiends there's nothing to be afraid of No sooner were the words out of his mouth than there was a gust of sinister wind and an old man emerged from the temple gateway He wore a turban a palecoloured gown and grass sandals and he held a crooked stick
He was accompanied by a devil servant with a blue face terrible fangs red whiskers and a red body who was carrying on his head a tray of cakes
Great Sage said the old man as they both knelt down I am the local god of Thorn Ridge
As I knew you were coming but had nothing better to offer you I have prepared this tray of steamed cakes for your master Do all have some
As there are no other houses for hundreds of miles I hope you will accept a few to stave off the pangs of hunger This was just what Pig wanted to hear
he went up and was just stretching out his hands to take a cake when Monkey who had been taking a long hard look at all this shouted Stop He's evil Behave yourself He was now addressing the local god
You're no local god trying to fool me like that
Take this Seeing the ferocity of his attack the local god turned round and transformed himself into a howling gust of negative wind that carried the venerable elder flying off through the air Nobody knew where he had been taken
The Great Sage was desperate because he did not know where to look for the master while Pig and Friar Sand stared at each other pale with shock Even the white horse was whinnying with fright
The three brother disciples and the horse were in utter confusion They looked all around as far as they could see but without finding him
We will not describe their search but tell how the old man and his devil servant carried Sanzang to a stone house that was wreathed in mist and gently set him down Holding him by the hand and supporting him the old man said Don't be afraid holy monk
We aren't bad people I am the Eighteenth Lord of Thorn Ridge
I have asked you here on this cool clear moonlit night to talk about poetry and pass the time in friendship Only then did Sanzang calm down When he took a careful look around this is what he saw
From where the banks of cloud set out Journey to the West Stood a pure house for immortals a place To purify the self and refine elixir To plant groves of bamboo and grow one's flowers
Cranes often came to the emerald cliff And frogs called in the pool's blue waters
This was a match for the cinnabar furnace on Mount Tiantai And made one think of the sunsets at Mount Huashan
Forget the vain effort of ploughing the clouds and fishing for the moon Here there is admirable privacy and ease
Sit here for long enough and your mind becomes seavast The rising moon can be half seen through the gauzy curtains
As Sanzang was looking around and noticing how brightly the moon and the stars were shining he heard the sound of voices saying The Eighteenth Lord has brought the holy monk here Sanzang looked up and saw three old men
The nearest one was whitehaired and distinguished the second one's temples had a green gloss and he was full of vigor and the third had a pure heart and blueblack hair
Their faces and clothes were all different and they all came to bow to Sanzang who returned their courtesy saying I have done nothing to deserve this great affection you are showing for me To this the Eighteenth Lord replied with a smile We have long heard holy monk of how you have found the Way and we've long been waiting for the good fortune of meeting you that we have enjoyed today
I hope that you will not be grudge the pearls of your wisdom but will make yourself comfortable sit and talk
Then we may learn about the true Dhyana teachings May I ask the titles of the immortals Sanzang asked with a bow
The one with white hair the Eighteenth Lord replied is known as the Lone Upright Lord the one with green temples is Master Emptiness and the one with a pure heart is the Ancient Cloudtoucher
My title is Energy How old are you four venerable gentlemen Sanzang asked
To this the Lone Upright Lord replied I am already a thousand years old I touch the sky and my leaves are always spring
Journey to the West Elegant are my fragrant branches Shaped like dragons and snakes My shadow is broken into many parts My body is covered in snow
Since childhood I have stood firm and endured Now I am happy to cultivate the True
The birds and phoenixes that perch are not mere mortal ones I am free and far from the dust of the normal world Master Emptiness spoke next with a smile
I've borne wind and frost for a thousand years Strong in my tall body and the vigor of my limbs
In the still of the night comes the sound of raindrops And the shade spreads like a cloud in autumn sunlight
My gnarled roots have the secret of eternal life I have been given the art of never aging
Storks stay here and dragons not common creatures
I am green and full of life as in immortals' land Then the Ancient Cloudtoucher said with a smile Over a thousand autumns have I passed in emptiness Lofty is the view that grows ever purer
Here there is no commotion but eternal cool and calm I am full of spirit and have seen much frost and snow
The seven worthies come to talk about the Way I sing and drink with my friends the six men of leisure
Journey to the West Lightly beating the jade and the gold My nature is one with heaven I roam with immortals Then Energy the Eighteenth Lord smiled as he said My age is also over a thousand I am hoary pure and natural
Rain and dew give admirable vigor I borrow the creative power of heaven and earth
Alone I flourish in ravines of wind and mist Relaxed and at my ease through all four seasons
Under my green shade immortals stay For chess and music and books on the Way All four of you immortals have lived to most advanced ages Sanzang said and the old gentleman Energy is over a thousand
You are ancient you have found the Way you are elegant and you are pure Are you not the Four Brilliant Ones of Han times You flatter us too much said the four old men
We're not the Four Brilliant Ones we're the four from deep in the mountains
May we ask worthy monk what your illustrious age is Sanzang put his hands together and replied Forty years ago I left my mother's womb Fated to disaster since before my birth
Escaping with my life I floated in the waves Until I reached Jinshan where I renewed my body
I nourished my nature and studied the sutras Sincere in worship of the Buddha not wasting time
Now that His Majesty has sent me to the West Journey to the West I am deeply honoured by you ancient immortals The four ancients then praised him saying Holy monk you have followed the Buddha's teaching since you left your mother's womb By cultivating your conduct from childhood you have become a lofty monk who has found the Way
We are very happy to see you and would like to ask you to teach us
Could you possibly tell us the rudiments of the Dhyana dharma
It would be a great comfort to us When the venerable elder heard this he was not at all alarmed and this is what he said to them Dhyana is silence the dharma is that which saves
Silent salvation can only come through enlightenment
Enlightenment is washing the mind and cleansing it of care casting off the vulgar and leaving worldly dust
Human life is hard to obtain it is hard to be born in the central lands and the true dharma is hard to find There is no greater good fortune than to have all three
The wonderful Way of perfect virtue is subtle and imperceptible Only with it can the six senseorgans and the six forms of consciousness be swept away
Wisdom is this there is no death and no life no excess and no deficiency emptiness and matter are all included holy and secular both dismissed
It has mastered the tools of the Taoist faith and is aware of the methods of Sakyamuni
It casts the net of phenomena and smashes nirvana
Perception within perception is needed enlightenment within enlightenment then a dot of sacred light will protect everything
Light the raging fire to illuminate the Saha realm it alone is revealed throughout the dharma world Being utterly subtle it is firmer than ever
who crosses the pass of mystery through verbal persuasion
From the beginning I cultivated the Dhyana of great awareness
I was fated and determined to attain enlightenment The four elders listened with cocked ears and were filled with boundless joy
Each of them kowtowed and was converted to the truth saying with bows of gratitude Holy monk you are the very root of the enlightenment to be found through Dhyana meditation The Ancient Cloudtoucher said Dhyana may be silence and the dharma may well save but it is necessary for the nature to be settled and the mind sincere
If one is a true immortal of great awareness one has to sit in the Way of nolife
Our mysteries are very different The Way is not fixed its form and function are one How is yours different Sanzang asked
To this the Ancient Cloudtoucher replied with a smile We have been firm from birth our forms and functions are different from yours
We were born in response to heaven and earth and grew through the rain and the dew
Proudly we laugh at wind and frost we wear out the days and nights
Not one leaf withers and all our branches are full of firm resolve
What I say has no emptiness about it but you cling to your Sanskrit
The Way was China's in the first place and only later looked for more evidence in the West You are wearing out your straw sandals for nothing you don't know what you are looking for
You are like a stone lion cutting out its own heart or a fox salivating so hard it digests the marrow of its own bones
If in your meditation you forget your roots you will pursue the Buddha's reward in vain Your words are as tangled as the brambles on our Thorn Ridge and as confused as the creepers
How can we accept a gentleman such as you
How can one like you be approved and taught
You must reexamine your present state and find a life of freedom in stillness
Only then can you learn to raise water in a bottomless basket and make the rootless irontree flower
On the peak of the Miraculous Treasure Journey to the West my feet stand firm I return to the assembly at Longhua
When Sanzang heard this he kowtowed in thanks and the Eighteenth Lord and the Lone Upright Lord helped him back to his feet Master Emptiness said with a chuckle Cloudtoucher's remarks revealed things a little too clearly
Please get up holy monk you don't have to believe every word of it We didn't intend to use the light of the moon for serious discussions
We should chant poems feel free and let ourselves relax If we're going to recite poems said Cloudtoucher with a smile pointing towards the stone house why don't we go into the hermitage and drink some tea Sanzang answered with a bow and went over to look at the hermitage above which was written in large letters TREE IMMORTALS' HERMITAGE
They all then went inside and decided where to sit whereupon the red devil servant appeared with a tray of Chinaroot cakes and five bowls of fragrant tea
The four old men urged Sanzang to eat some cakes but he was too suspicious to do so and would not take any till the four old men had all eaten some
only then did he eat a couple
After they had drunk some tea it was cleared away
Sanzang then stole a careful look around and saw that everything was of a delicate and intricate beauty in the moonlight Where waters flowed beside the rocks And fragrant scents from the flowers curled The scene was one of cultured peace Free from the dust of a lower world Sanzang took great pleasure in gazing on this sight he felt happy relaxed and exhilarated
He found himself saying a line of poetry The dhyana heart revolves in moonlike purity The couplet was completed by Energy who said with a smile
Poetic inspiration is fresher than the sky To this Lone Upright added By grafting on each line embroidery grows Then Emptiness said
Pearls come when naturally the writing flows Cloudtoucher continued The glory is now over
Six Dynasties disappear
The Songs are redivided to make distinctions clear I shouldn't have let those silly words slip out just now said Sanzang I was only rambling Really I am a beginner trying to show off in front of experts
Having heard you immortals talk in that fresh and freeranging way I now know that you old gentlemen are true poets Don't waste time in idle chat said Energy A monk should take things through to the end
You started the verse so why don't you finish it
Please do so at once Journey to the West I can't Sanzang replied
It would be much better if you completed it for me Eighteenth Lord That's very nice of you I must say commented Energy
You started the verse so you can't refuse to finish it
It's wrong to be so stingy with your pearls Sanzang then had no choice but to add a final couplet
Waiting for the tea lying pillowed in the breeze Spring is in the voice now that the heart's at ease I like 'Spring is in the voice now that the heart's at ease' said the Eighteenth Lord
To this Lone Upright replied Energy you have a deep understanding of poetry and spend all your time savoring its delights
Why don't you compose another poem for us The Eighteenth Lord generously did not refuse Very well then he replied let's make up chain couplets Each person has to start his couplet with the last word of the couplet before I'll lead off
Without spring's glory there would be no winter's death Clouds come and mists depart as if existing not Let me tack another couple more lines on Master Emptiness said
Not any breath of wind to rock the spreading shade Visitors enjoy the Wealth and Long Life picture Cloudtoucher now joined in with his couplet
Picture it like the strong old man of the Western hills Pure as the hermit of the South the heartless man Lone Upright added his two lines
Journey to the West The man is a roofbeam as he has sideleaves To build the office of the censorate When Sanzang heard all this he could only sigh and say Indeed your superb poems have a noble spirit that rises up to the heavens
Despite my lack of talent I would like to add a couplet to that Holy monk said Lone Upright you are one who has found the Way and a man of great cultivation
You need not add another couplet Instead you can give us a whole verse so that we can try as best we can to match the rhyme pattern Sanzang had no choice but to recite the following regulated verse with a smile
Travelling West with my staff to visit the Dharma King I seek the wonderful scriptures to spread them far and wide
The golden magic fungus blesses the poetry circle Under the trees is the scent of a thousand flowers
One must go higher from the top of a hundredfoot pole Leaving one's traces in ten regions' worlds
Cultivate the jade image and majestic body Before the gate of bliss is the monastery When the four old men had heard this they were full of high praise for it
Although I'm stupid and untalented the Eighteenth Lord said I'll take my courage in both hands and try to match your rhymes
Vigorous and proud I smile as king of the trees Not ever the tree of heaven can match my fame
A dragon and snake shadow for a thousand feet in the mountains The spring has flowed for a thousand years with its amber fragrance My spirit is at one with heaven and earth
I gladly cover my traces in the wind and rain
Journey to the West Now I am old I regret having no immortal bones And rely on Chinaroot alone to maintain my years That poem started off heroically and the next couplet had some strength said the Lone Upright Lord But the last line was too modest
Admirable Most admirable Let me try rhyming one too
I happily give a perch in the frost to the king of the birds My talent is displayed before the Hall of Four Perfections
The pearly tassels of heavy dew obscure the green carpet In the light breeze stone teeth crush chilly fragrance
A delicate voice intones in the corridor at night Pale autumn shadows are put away in the ancient hall
I used to be offered for long life at the New Year In old age I stand proudly on the mountain What a fine poem what a fine poem said Master Emptiness Truly the moon was working together with heaven to write it
How could such a clumsy fool as I am hope to match its rhymes
But I must try to patch a few lines together
I don't want to waste this chance The timber of roofbeams is close to kings Its fame is spread in the Palace of Great Purity
The sunlit hall seems filled with azure blue Green fragrance always pervades the dark wall
Strong cold and ancient in my beauty My roots go down to the Underworld's nine springs
My spreading shade gives cover like cold clouds
I don't compete in prettiness with flowers Journey to the West You three gentlemen's poems said Cloudtoucher are elegant and pure like a whole sackful of embroidery and brocades being opened out
Although I have neither strength nor talent you three gentlemen have removed the block for me
If you insist I'll put a few lines of doggerel together I hope they won't make you laugh
In the bamboo grove I delight wise kings A hundred acres of me by the Wei brings fame
My green skin is naturally marked by the tears of the Xiang Goddess My scaly shoots pass on the scent of history
My leaves will never change their color in frost The beauty of my misty twigs can never be concealed
Few have understood me since the death of Wang Huizhi Since ancient times I have been known through brush and ink
You venerable immortals have all composed poems like phoenixes breathing out pearls Sanzang said There is nothing I can add
I am deeply moved by the great favour you have shown me
But it is late now and I do not know where my three disciples are waiting for me
I cannot stay any longer and I must start finding my way back I am profoundly grateful for your boundless love
Could you show me my way back Don't be so worried holy monk replied the four ancients laughing
An encounter like this is rare in a thousand years The sky is fresh and clear and the moon makes the night as bright as day Relax and sit here for a little longer At dawn we shall see you across the ridge
You will certainly meet your distinguished disciples As they were talking in came two serving maids in blue each carrying a lantern of crimson silk
Behind them followed a fairy who was holding a sprig of apricot blossom as she greeted them with a smile
What did the fairy look like
Her hair had the green of jade Her face was pinker than rouge
Her starry eyes were full of light and color Her elegant eyebrows were like moth antennae
Journey to the West She wore a red skirt with plumblossom designs And a light jacket of gray shot with red
Her curved shoes were shaped like phoenix beaks And her silk stockings were marked with mud
This witch was as lovely as the woman on Tiantai No less a beauty than the Zhou king's concubine
To what do we owe the pleasure of your visit Apricot Fairy the old man asked as they bowed to her
Returning their bows she replied I hear that you have a distinguished guest here and are exchanging poems with him
May I meet him Here he is said the Eighteenth Lord pointing him out
You don't need to ask Sanzang bowed to her but dared say nothing
Bring in the tea at once she said
Two more serving girls in yellow carried in a red lacquer tray on which were six fine porcelain teabowls with rare fruits in them and spoons lying across the top as well as a copperinlaid iron teapot in which was hot and fragrant tea
When the tea had been poured the woman showed glimpses of finger as delicate as spring onion shoots as she presented the porcelain bowls of it first to Sanzang and then to the four ancients The last cup she kept for herself
Only when Master Emptiness invited the Apricot Fairy to sit down did she do so
After they had drunk the tea she leant forward and said As you ancient immortals have been having so delightful an evening could you tell me some of the choicest lines you've composed Our stuff was just vulgar rubbish Cloudtoucher replied
But this holy monk's verses were truly superb examples of high Tang poetry Please let me hear them if you will the fairy said whereupon the four ancients recited Sanzang's two poems and his exposition of the Dhyana dharma
The woman whose face was all smiles then said I'm completely untalented and shouldn't really be making a fool of myself like this but hearing this wonderful lines is an opportunity too good to waste
Could I cobble together a verse in the second rhyme pattern She then recited these lines
The Han Emperor Wu first made my name In Zhou times Confucius taught under my shade
Dong Feng loved me so much he planted a wood of me Sun Chu once offered my jelly in sacrifice
Journey to the West Soft is my pink and rainfed beauty The misty green is shown and yet concealed
When overripe I have a touch of sourness Each year I fall beside the fields of wheat When the four ancients heard the poem they were all full of admiration for it How elegant it is they said and how free of worldly dust At the same time the lines have something of the awakening of spring in them
'Soft is my pink and rainfed beauty' That's good
'Soft is my pink and rainfed beauty' You're too kindit quite alarms me she replied
The holy monk's lines that I heard just now were like brocade from the heart or embroidery in words
Could you be generous with your pearls and teach me one of those verses The Tang Priest dared not reply
The woman was evidently falling for him and moving closer and closer pressing herself against him and whispering to him Noble guest let's make the most of this wonderful night for love What are we waiting for
Life is short The Apricot Fairy admires you completely holy monk said the Eighteenth Lord You must feel something for her
If you don't find her adorable you have very poor taste The holy monk is a famous gentleman who has found the Way said the Lone Upright Lord and he wouldn't possibly act in a way that was at all improper
It would be quite wrong of us to do things like that
To ruin his reputation and honour would be a very mean thing to do
If the Apricot Fairy is willing Cloudtoucher and the Eighteenth Lord can act as matchmakers while Master Emptiness and I act as the guarantors of the wedding
It would be excellent if they married Hearing this Sanzang turned pale with horror jumped to his feet and shouted at the top of his voice You're all monsters trying to lead me astray like that
There was nothing wrong with talking about the mysteries of the Way with wellhoned arguments but it's disgraceful of you to try to ruin a monk like me by using a woman as a bait Seeing how angry Sanzang was they all bit their fingers in fear and said nothing more
But the red devil servant exploded with thunderous fury You don't know how honoured you're being monk
What's wrong with my sister
She's beautiful and charming Her needlework aside her gift for poetry alone would make her more than a match for you
What do you mean trying to turn her down
You're making a terrible mistake
The Lone Upright Lord's idea was quite right If you're not prepared to sleep with her on the quiet I'll marry the two of you properly Sanzang went paler still with shock
None of their arguments however outrageous had the slightest impact on him
We've been talking to you very nicely monk the devil servant said but you don't pay the slightest attention
If we lose our tempers and start our rough country way of doing things we'll drag you off and see to it that you can never be a monk any longer or ever marry a wife
After that your life will be pointless The venerable elder's heart remained as hard as metal or stone and he obdurately refused to do as they asked wondering all the time where his disciples were looking for him
At the thought his tears flowed unquenchably
Smiling and sitting down next to him the woman produced a silk handkerchief from her emerald sleeve with which she wiped away his tears Journey to the West Don't be so upset noble guest She said
You and I are going to taste the pleasures of love Sanzang jumped up and shouted at her to go away and would have left at once if they had not held him there by force
The row went on till daybreak
Suddenly Sanzang heard a call of Master Master We can hear you
Where are you Monkey Pig and Friar Sand had been searching everywhere all night leading the white horse and carrying the baggage
They had gone through all the thorns and brambles without a moment's rest and by now had reached the Western side of the milewide cloudcapped Thorn Ridge This was the shout they gave when they heard Sanzang's angry yells
Sanzang broke free rushed outside and called Wukong I'm here
Help The four ancients the devil servant the woman and her maids all disappeared in a flash A moment later Pig and Friar Sand were there too
How ever did you get here Master they asked
Disciples said Sanzang clinging to Monkey I have put you to a lot of trouble
I was carried here by the old man who appeared last night and said he was a local deity bringing us vegetarian foodthe one you shouted at and were going to hit
He held my hand and helped me inside that door there where I saw three old men who had come to meet me They kept calling me 'holy monk' and talked in a very pure and elegant way
They were marvellous poets and I matched some verses with them
Then at about midnight a beautiful woman came with lanterns to see me and made up a poem herself She kept calling me 'noble guest'
She liked the look of me so much she wanted to sleep with me
That brought me to my senses When I refused they offered to be matchmakers and guarantors and to marry us
I swore not to agree and was just shouting at them and trying to get away when to my surprise you turned up
Although they were still dragging at my clothes they suddenly disappeared
It must have been because it was dawn and because they were frightened of you too Did you ask them their names when you were talking about poetry Monkey asked
Yes Sanzang replied I asked them their titles
The oldest was Energy the Eighteenth Lord the next oldest was the Lone Upright Lord the third was Master Emptiness and the fourth the Ancient Cloudtoucher
They called the woman Apricot Fairy Where are they Pig asked where've they gone Where they have gone I don't know Sanzang replied but where we talked about poetry was near here When the three disciples searched with their master they found a rockface on which were carved the words Tree Immortals' Hermitage This is it said Sanzang and on looking carefully Brother Monkey saw a big juniper an old cypress an old pine and an old bamboo
Behind the bamboo was a red maple When he took another look by the rockface he saw an old apricot tree two winterflowering plums and two osmanthuses
Did you see the evil spirits Monkey asked
No said Pig
It's just because you don't realize that those trees have become spirits said Monkey
How can you tell that the spirits were trees Pig asked
Journey to the West The Eighteenth lord is the pine Monkey replied the Lone Upright Lord the cypress Master Emptiness the juniper and the Ancient Cloudtoucher the bamboo
The maple there was the red devil and the Apricot Fairy that apricot tree When Pig heard this he ruthlessly hit with his rake and rooted with his snout to knock the plum osmanthus apricot and maple trees over and as he did blood flowed from their roots
Wuneng said Sanzang going up to him to check him don't harm any more of them
Although they have become spirits they did me no harm
Let's be on our way again Don't be sorry for them Master said Monkey
They'll do people a great deal of harm if we let them develop into big monsters With that the idiot let fly with his rake and knocked pine cypress juniper ad bamboo all to the ground Only then did he invite his master to remount and carry along the main route to the West
If you don't know what happened as they pressed ahead listen to the explanation in the next installment
A Demon Creates a False Thunder Peak All Four Pilgrims Meet with Disaster The cause and effect this time revealed Should make one do what's good and shun the evil Once a thought is born The Intelligence is aware of it
And lets it become action
Why strive to learn stupidity or skill Both are medicines for heartlessness
Do what is right while you are still alive Do not just drift
Recognize the root and the source Escape from the trunk and the husk If seeking long life you must grasp this
Watch clearly at every moment Journey to the West Refine your thoughts
Go through the three passes fill up the black sea The good will surely ride on the phoenix and crane
Then your gloom will change to compassion As you ascend to absolute bliss
Tang Sanzang's thoughts were so pure that not only did the heavenly gods protect him even the vegetable spirits had taken him along a part of his journey for a night of elegant conversation thereby saving him from having to go through the thorns and brambles Nor were there any more creepers to entangle them
As the four of them carried on West for another long period winter ended and spring returned All things begin to flower The handle of the Dipper returns to the East
Everywhere the grass is green As are the leaves of willows on the bank
The ridge covered in peach blossom is red brocade The mist over the stream is a translucent gauze
Frequent wind and rain Unbounded feeling
Flowers open their hearts to the sun Swallows carry off the delicate moss
Wang Wei should have painted the beauty of the mountains The birdsong is as persuasive as Su Qin's golden tongue
Though no one sees these fragrant cushions of flowers The butterflies and singing bees adore them
Master and disciples made their way across the flowers and the grass ambling along with the horse until they made out in the distance a mountain so high that it touched the sky
Pointing at it with his riding crop Sanzang Journey to the West said I wonder how high that mountain is Wukong
It touches the heavens and pierces the firmament Isn't there some ancient poem that says 'Heaven alone is supreme no mountain can equal its height' Monkey replied
However high a mountain is it can't possibly join up with the sky Then why's Mount Kunlun called the pillar of heaven Pig asked
Evidently you don't know that part of the sky has always been missing in the Northwest Brother Monkey replied
As Kunlun's in the Northwest corner it plugs that hole in the sky
That's why it's called the pillar of heaven Brother said Friar Sand with a smile stop telling him all that He'll brag about it to make himself superior
We'll know how high the mountain is when we've climbed it The idiot started chasing Friar Sand and brawling with him in a playful way and the master's horse galloped as if on wings
They were soon at the foot of a precipice up which they made their way painfully slowly
This is what the mountain was like The wind rustling in the woods Water gushing along the beds of ravines
Crows and sparrows cannot fly across it Even gods and immortals find it hard
Scars and gullies endlessly twisting Clouds of dust blowing where no one can go Rocks in strange and fascinating shapes
Clouds like vast expanses of water While elsewhere birds sing in the trees
Deer carry magic fungus in their mouths Apes pick peaches
Foxes and raccoon dogs spring around on the cliffs Large and small deer play on the ridge
Then comes the spinechilling roar of a tiger And the way is blocked by leopards and wolves
Journey to the West Sanzang was terrified by what he saw but Monkey's powers were enormous
With his goldbanded cudgel and a mighty roar he sent the wolves tigers leopards and other wild beasts running then cleared the way for the master to reach the top of the mountain
Once they were over the summit ridge and had started going down the gentle Western slope they saw divine light and coloured clouds over some imposing buildings from which came the muffled sounds of bells and stone chimes
Look and see what that place is disciples said Sanzang
Monkey raised his head shaded his eyes with his hands and on careful examination saw that it was a fine place
Magnificent architecture A famous monastery
The valley of emptiness is full of the earth's vibrations Heavenly fragrance pervades the stillness
Rain in the bluish pines obscures the buildings Mist around the green bamboo protects the preaching hall
Through coloured clouds one can make out the dragon palace The infinite worlds are seen in shimmering light
Red balustrades and doors of marble Painted and carved beams
Incense fills the hall in which the scriptures are taught The moon hangs over the window where the mysteries are passed on
Birds sing in red trees Cranes drink from a spring in the rocks
The flowers as fine as those of the Jetavana All the doors open on the brilliance of Sravasti
Beside the towering buildings the gates face crags Slow is the rhythm of the bell and chime
A light breeze blows into open windows And under the rolledup curtains is a smoky haze
Journey to the West Among the monks emotions are all calm Peace reigns in the absence of worldliness
A land of immortals unsullied by earth's dust This splendid monastery of the pure land
When he had taken a good look at it Monkey went back to report It's a monastery Master but for some reason there's something evil about the auspicious dhyana atmosphere
The place looks like the Thunder Monastery but the distance to here is wrong
Whatever we do we mustn't go rushing inside
If we do we may run into something nasty But if it looks like the Thunder Monastery this must surely be the Vulture Peak said the Tang Priest Don't try to frustrate my sincerest wish and put off what I've come for But it isn't vulture peak said Monkey
I've been there several times and this isn't the way Even if it isn't there must be good people living here said Pig
Don't be so suspicious said Friar Sand
The road goes straight past the gate so we can find out at a glance You're right said Monkey
Whipping on the horse the venerable elder arrived at the monastery gate above which the words THUNDER MONASTERY were written This came as such a surprise to him that he fell to the ground from the horse saying abusively Wretched macaque
You'll be the death of me
Here we are at the Thunder Monastery and you're still trying to trick me Don't be angry Master said Monkey with a forced smile Take another look
There are three words over the gate Why did you only read two of them out then get angry with me Still shaking the master climbed to his feet again for another look and saw that there were in fact three words written there
LESSER THUNDER MONASTERY Even if it is the Lesser Thunder Monastery Sanzang said there must be a Buddha in here
The three thousand Buddhas of whom the scriptures speak can't all live in the same place just as the Bodhisattva Guanyin lives in the Southern Sea Samantabhadra lives on Mount Emei and Manjusri on Mount Wutai
I wonder which Buddha's holy seat this is
As the saying has it Wherever there's a Buddha there are scriptures Everywhere you go you'll find some treasures
Let's go in Journey to the West No we mustn't said Monkey This place looks thoroughly sinister
Don't blame me if this leads to disaster Even if there is not Buddha here there's bound to be a statue of a Buddha and I am under a vow to worship every Buddha statue I pass Sanzang replied
I won't blame you He then told Pig to get out his cassock put on his mitre neatened his clothes up and strode forward
As he did so a voice from inside the gate called out Tang Priest you've come from the East to worship our Buddha so why are you still being so casual about it Sanzang at once started kowtowing as did Pig while Friar Sand knelt
The Great Sage hung back holding the horse and looking after the luggage
Once they were inside the inner gates they reached the Buddha Hall outside of which were drawn up the five hundred arhats the three thousand protectors the four vajrapanis the eight Bodhisattvas nuns lay people and countless holy monks and lay brothers
Everywhere was the scent of flowers and auspicious vapors
The venerable elder Pig and Friar Sand were all so overwhelmed that they kowtowed at every step until they reached the hall
Monkey alone did not bow
Sun Wukong came a shrill shout from the throne why don't you kowtow when you see the Buddha Nobody realized that Monkey had spotted as he took a careful look around that this was all false Letting go of the horse and putting down the luggage he shouted as he brandished his cudgel Evil beasts What a nerve How dare you try to ruin the Buddha's good name by pretending to be him
Stay where you are He raised his cudgel in both hands and was just about to strike when a pair of bronze cymbals came out of the sky to join together with a mighty crash enclosing him completely from head to toe
Pig and Friar Sand grabbed desperately for their rake and staff only to be so closely surrounded by the arhats protectors holy monks and lay brothers that they could not move
They and Sanzang too were all captured and roped up tightly
Now the Buddha on the lotus throne was a demon king and all the arhats and others his little devils
They now put off their Buddha disguises so that they looked once more like the evil creatures they really were and carried the three of them round to the back to be kept under guard while Monkey was sealed inside the cymbals never to be released
The cymbals were then set on a pedestal and here he was to be turned to pus and blood within three days and nights after which the other three were to be steamed in an iron steamer and eaten
Indeed The greeneyed macaque saw that it was false The dhyana monk worshipped the appearance of the Buddha
The yellowwife blindly joined in the prostration While the mother of wood foolishly agreed
The monsters used force to oppress the true nature Evilly the demon king mistreated the holy man
The demon king was greater than the narrow Way Journey to the West By taking the wrong course they threw away their lives
Having locked the Tang Priest and his two disciples away and tied the horse up at the back they put Sanzang's cassock and mitre back into the luggage and stored that away too
They then put everything under a close guard
Inside the cymbals Monkey found it pitch black and so hot that he was soon pouring with sweat
Push and shove though he might there was no way he could get out and when in desperation he hit out wildly all around with his iron cudgel he could not move the cymbals by even a fraction of an inch
Then he made a handspell that made him ten thousand feet tall the cymbals grew with him
There was not a crack anywhere through which a chink of light could get in
He made another handspell to make himself smaller and shrank till he was as tiny as a mustardseed
The cymbals shrank with him and still there was no hole
He blew a magic breath on the iron cudgel said Change and made it into a flagpole with which to prop the cymbals up
Then he pulled two of the longer hairs from the back of his head blew on them said Change and turned them into a fivepart drill with a plumblossom shaped bit which he turned a thousand times or more There was a rasping noise but the drill made no impression
By now he was feeling desperate so he made another handspell and recited the words Om ram peaceful dharma world eternal keen purity of the heavenly unity This compelled the Five Protectors the Six Dings the Six Jias and the Eighteen Guardians of the Faith to gather round the cymbals and say Great Sage we are all protecting your master and keeping the demons from harming him so why do you call us here If he dies it serves him right for ignoring my advice Monkey replied
You lot had better find some magic to get these cymbals open at once and have me out of here so I can decide what to do
It's completely dark in here I'm feeling very hot and it's so stuffy it'll kill me The gods all tried to lift the cymbals but as before it was impossible to move them by even a fraction of an inch
Great Sage said the Goldheaded Protector goodness only knows what kind of treasure this is but they're all of a piece from top to bottom
We gods aren't strong enough to move them And I've lost count of the number of my magic powers I've used here without being able to move them either said Monkey
When the Protector heard this he told the Six Dings to look after Monkey and the Six Jias to watch over the cymbals while the guardians kept their eyes on what was happening all around
He then set off on his beam of auspicious light and a moment later shot in through the Southern Gate of Heaven where he did not wait to be summoned but rushed straight to the steps of the Hall of Miraculous Brightness to prostrate himself before the Jade Emperor and report My sovereign I am one of the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre
The Great Sage Equaling Heaven who is escorting the Tang Priest on the journey to fetch the scriptures has now reached a mountain with a monastery called the Lesser Thunder Monastery on it
The Tang Priest went in to worship under the illusion that he had reached Vulture Peak but it turned out that the whole thing was a decoy to trap them The Great Sage is caught inside a pair of cymbals and can't go anywhere He's gradually dying
That is what I have come to report At once the Jade Emperor ordered that the Twentyeight Constellations be sent to rescue them and defeat the demons
Journey to the West Not daring to delay for a moment the constellations went out through the gate of Heaven with the Protector and were soon inside the monastery
It was now the second of the night's five watches and all the demons senior and junior had gone to sleep after the feast their king had given them to celebrate the Tang priest's capture
Doing nothing to disturb them the constellations went to the cymbals and reported Great Sage we're the Twentyeight Constellations The Jade Emperor has sent us here to rescue you The news made Monkey very happy
Smash them open with your weapons and get me out of here We don't dare to the constellations replied
This is pure gold and if we hit it the noise would wake the devils up and it would be impossible to rescue you
We'll have to try to work it open with our weapons
The moment you see a chink of light in there out you come Yes said Monkey
They used their spears swords sabers and battleaxes to try to lever prise lift and force it open but despite all their efforts the third watch came and still they had failed to make the slightest impression on them It was as if the cymbals had been cast as a single whole
Not a chink of light could Monkey see from inside no matter how hard he looked and crawled and rolled all around
Then the Metal Dragon of the constellation Gullet said Don't get impatient Great Sage
This must be an AsYouWill treasure and I'm sure it can be changed
You feel where the cymbals join from the inside Once I get my horn between them you can turn yourself into something and get out where I've loosened them Monkey followed this suggestion and felt frantically around inside
Meanwhile the constellation made himself so small that his horn was no bigger than the point of a needle
He pushed hard with it where the two cymbals joined and by exerting tremendous pressure he managed to penetrate inside
He then gave himself a magic body by saying Grow Grow The horn became as thick as a ricebowl but the cymbals were more like creatures of skin and flesh than objects cast from metal they kept their close bite on the Metal Dragon of Gullet's horn and not a crack appeared anywhere around
It's no use said Monkey feeling the constellation's horn it's not at all loose anywhere around it There's nothing for it
you'll have to bear the pain and pull me out The splendid Great Sage then changed his goldbanded cudgel into a steel gimlet bored a hole in the tip of the horn made himself the size of a mustard seed crawled into the hole squatted there and shouted Pull it out Only through stupendous efforts did the constellation manage to pull his horn out which left him so weak and exhausted that he collapsed
Monkey then crawled out of the hole in the horn again resumed his own appearance raised his cudgel and smashed the cymbals apart with a tremendous noise like a copper mountain collapsing
The Buddhist instruments now lay shattered into thousands of fragments of gold
This gave the Twentyeight Constellations a terrible fright and made the Protectors' hair stand on end
All the devils woke up and as the demon king was shocked out of his sleep he jumped up pulled on his clothes and had the drums beaten to muster all the demons with their weapons By now it was nearly dawn and they all gathered round the throne
On seeing Monkey and the constellations standing in a ring round the fragments of the golden cymbals the demon king went pale from shock and ordered his underlings to shut the front gates and not let them escape
As soon as Monkey heard this he led the Twentyeight Constellations to spring up on their clouds till they were above the ninth heaven while the demon king had the fragments of gold tidied away and drew his devilish forces up outside the monastery gates
In his anger the king had no choice but to put on his armor take his short and flexible wolf'stooth spiked mace and come out of his camp shouting Sun the Novice A real man doesn't run away from a fight
Come back and fight three rounds with me This was more than Monkey could stand and he landed his cloud at the head of his starry host to see what the evil spirit looked like Journey to the West This is what he saw
Matted hair Held in place by a thin gold band Eyes flashing Under a pair of frowning yellow brows A pearshaped nose With flaring nostrils A squarecut mouth With sharppointed teeth
He wore a coat of chainmail Tied with a tasseled raw silk sash On his feet were a pair of oxhide boots And he carried a wolf'stooth mace
He looked both like a wild beast and at the same time not His face was human and yet not human What kind of monster do you think you are shouted Monkey as he brandished his cudgel
How can you have the effrontery to pose as a Buddha occupy a mountain and create a false Lesser Thunder Monastery The only reason you've got the nerve to come rampaging around my magic mountain must be that you don't know my name the monster said
This is the Lesser Western Heaven and Heaven has given me these fine buildings because I have cultivated my conduct and gained the true achievement
I am called the Yellowbrowed Buddha though in their ignorance the people around here call me King Yellow Brow or Lord Yellow Brow
I've known about your journey to the West for a very long time now and I have some magic powers which was why I could create those illusions to lure your master in so that you and I could have a trial of strength
If you can beat me I'll spare your master and his disciples and allow you to fulfil your true achievement
But if you can't I'll kill the lot of you and go myself to see the Tathagata Buddha fetch the scriptures and take them to China You talk too much evil spirit said Monkey with a laugh
If you want a trial of strength try this from my cudgel With great pleasure the demon king parried it and a fine fight ensued
Journey to the West A pair of cudgels Each quite different To start with what they looked like One was a short and flexible Buddha weapon The other was hard from the stores of the sea
Both of them could be changed at will And today they met in a struggle for mastery
The soft wolf'stooth mace was adorned with brocade The hard goldbanded cudgel had dragon patterns
They could both be admirably big or small Any length you liked and always just right
Monkey and monster were evenly matched This fight between them was the real thing
The monkey tamed by faith was now the mindape The evil monster had offended Heaven with deception
In his anger and loathing neither showed mercy Both had their ways of being savagely vicious
One struck to the head never easing the pressure The other hit at the face and could not be fought off
The sun went dark behind the clouds they made They breathed out mists that hid the towering crags
Cudgel met cudgel as the rivals fought Both forgetting life and death for the Tang priest's sake
The two of them fought fifty rounds without either emerging as victor
By the monastery gate there was much beating of drums and gongs as the evil spirits shouted their warcries and waved their flags
Facing them were the heavenly soldiers of the Twentyeight Constellations and the holy hosts of the Five Protectors who were Journey to the West all armed and shouting as they surrounded the demon king The demons outside the monastery gate were too frightened to beat their drums and their hands were shaking so badly that they could not strike their gongs
The old demon king was not at all afraid He held all the enemy troops at bay with his mace in one hand while with the other he undid an old white cotton pouch that was round his waist as a sash this he threw into the air
With a loud swish it caught the Great Sage Monkey the Twentyeight Constellations and the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre he then slung them over his shoulder and carried them back inside
All the little demons returned in triumph
The demon king told his underlings to fetch forty or fifty hempen ropes opened the bag and took his prisoners out one at a time to be tied up Each of them felt that his bones had turned soft
Their muscles were numb and their skin hung loosely on them
Once tied up they were all carried out to the back and flung on the ground indiscriminately
The demon king then ordered a banquet and the devils drank from dawn till dusk before it broke up and they all went off to sleep
In the middle of the night as the Great Sage Monkey lay there tied up with all the gods he heard the sound of weeping
Listening more carefully he recognized the voice of Sanzang who was saying as he sobbed Wukong I wish I had heeded the warning you gave From this disaster we could have steered clear
While you're being tortured in cymbals of gold Nobody knows I'm a prisoner here Bitter the fate that afflicts us all four All our achievements have now come to naught
How can we be saved from this awful impasse To go to the West and then home as we ought When Monkey heard this he felt sorry for his master
Although ignoring my advice was what caused this disaster he thought at least you're remembering me in your troubles
I'd better save them all and let them get away while it's night the demons are all asleep and nobody's on guard The splendid Great Sage used escaping magic to make himself so small that he slipped out of his bonds went up to the Tang Priest and said Master Why are you here Sanzang asked recognizing his voice Monkey told him very quietly what had happened to his great delight
Please rescue me as soon as you can Sanzang said
From now on I'll do whatever you say and not be so stubborn Journey to the West Only then did Monkey start moving first releasing the master Pig and Friar Sand then the Twentyeight Constellations and the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre all of whom he untied one by one
Next he brought the horse over and told his master to carry on ahead as quickly as possible
Once they were outside Monkey realized that he did not know where the luggage was and went back to look for it
You seem to think that things matter more than people said the Metal Dragon of Gullet
It ought to be enough that we've rescued your master
Why do you want to look for the luggage Of course people are important Monkey said but things are even more important
In the luggage there's our passport the brocade cassock and the golden begging bowl They're all great treasures of the Buddhist faith and we must have them You go back and look for them brother said Pig while we start out
We'll wait for you later Watch how the stars crowd round the Tang Priest and all use their magic powers at once to take him out of the enclosure with a breath of wind as they hurry along the main road down the slope till they reach level ground and rest
At about the third watch the Great Sage Monkey crept slowly and stealthily back inside to find gate inside gate all very tightly closed
When he climbed up to the upper story of a building to take a look he saw that the windows were all fastened too
He was on the point of going down again but dared not move for fear of the windowframes making a noise
He therefore made a handspell shook himself and turned into a mouse immortal or what is more commonly known as a bat
Do you know what he looked like His head was pointed like a rat's His eyes like a rat's did spark
He emerged at twilight on his wings To sleep by day in the dark
He hid away among the tiles The mosquitoes he caught were his food
Bright moonlit nights he liked the best At flying he really was good
He found his way in under the rafters through an openended tile then flew over doors till he got to the middle of the building Here he noticed a faintly glimmering beam of light coming from under a secondfloor window It was not like the light of a lantern or candle the glow of burning incense a beam of evening sunlight or a flash of lightning
He went closer to the window his heart in his mouth with excitement and looked inside to see that the glow was coming from the luggage
The evil spirit had taken the cassock off the Tang Priest but instead of folding it up he had thrust it untidily back into the bundles
The reason why the cassock glowed was because it was a Buddha treasure itself with AsYouWill pearls mani pearls red cornelian purple coral sarira Buddharelics and nightshining pearls on it
He was very pleased when he saw these things and turned back into himself to pick them up put the carrying pole on his shoulder and take them Journey to the West downstairs without stopping to adjust the ropes to balance the loads
Unfortunately the load at one end slipped off and landed with a loud crash on the floorboards
This noise woke up the old demon king sleeping downstairs and he leapt out of bed with a cry of Intruders
Intruders At this all the big and little demons got up too lit lamps and started searching all around all shouting loudly the while The Tang Priest's escaped someone came in to report to be followed by another saying Sun the Novice and all the rest of them have got away The old demon then ordered strict security on all the gates
As soon as Monkey heard this he abandoned the luggage somersaulted out through the windows and fled before they could catch him
No matter how hard they looked the evil spirits could not find the Tang Priest and the rest of them By now the day was beginning to dawn so the demon king seized his mace and led his hosts in hot pursuit They found the camp of the Twentyeight Constellations and the Five Protectors surrounded by mists and cloud at the foot of the mountain
Where do you think you're going the demon king shouted
I'm here Brothers called the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Constellation Horn in alarm the monsters are here The Metal Dragon of the Gullet the Earth Bat of the Woman the Sun Hare of the Chamber the Moon Fox of the Heart the Fire Tiger of the Tail the Water Leopard of the Winnower the Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper the Metal Bull of the Ox the Earth Raccoondog of the Base the Sun Rat of the Barrens the Moon Swallow of the Roof the Fire Pig of the House the Water Beast of the Wall the Wooden Wolf of the Strider the Metal Dog of the Harvester the Earth Boar of the Stomach the Sun Cock of the Pleiades the Moon Crow of the Net the Fire Monkey of the Turtle the Water Ape of Orion the Wooden Hyena of the Well the Metal Goat of the Ghosts the Earth River Deer of the Willow the Sun Horse of the Seven Stars the Moon Deer of the Spread Net the Fire Snakeof the Wing and the Water Worm of the Axletree at the head of the Goldenheaded Protector the Silverheaded Protector the Six Dings the Six Jias the Guardians of the Faith Pig and Friar Sandthey did not take the Tang Priest or the white dragon horseall rushed forward with their weapons
At the sight of them the demon king laughed a contemptuous laugh whistled and called up four or five thousand evil spirits each of whom was powerful and strong A bitter fight then followed on the Western slopes of the mountain and a fine battle it was too The evil demon king had tricked the true nature The gentle true nature was no match for him
With so many plots it was hard to escape from pain When so much cunning was used there could be no peace
All the heavens offered their protection And hosts of sages helped to wage the fight
The mother of wood suffers for showing mercy Determination moves the yellowwife
The bitter fight shook heaven and earth Journey to the West Both sides spread their nets in the struggle
On one side the waving of banners and warcries On the other the beating of drums and gongs
A cold sea of light from massed sabers and spears And a murderous look of the swords and the halberds
The demon troops were cruel and tough The heavenly soldiers were no match for them
Dreary clouds blocked out the sun and moon Spinechilling mists lay over the landscape
Hard and bitter was the fight And all because Sanzang wanted to visit the Buddha
The evil spirit now felt more ferocious than ever as he led his hosts into the attack
Just when the issue was hanging in the balance there could be heard an angry roar from Monkey of I'm here What about the luggage Pig asked as he greeted him
I barely got away with my life Monkey replied so what are you asking about the luggage for Stop talking you two said Friar Sand who was wielding his staff
Hurry up and fight the evil spirits The Constellations Protectors Dings Jias and all the other gods had been surrounded and bunched together by the demons in the wild melee while the demon king attacked the three of them with his mace
Monkey Pig and Friar Sand held the enemy off by striking and swinging with their cudgel staff and rake
The earth and sky were now plunged into darkness and still there was no victor
They fought on till the sun set in the Western hills and the moon rose over the Eastern islands
Seeing how late it now was the demon whistled and told all the fiends to be specially careful while he produced his treasure once more
Monkey could see clearly as he undid the pouch and took it in his hands This is bad said Monkey
Let's get out of here And with that he somersaulted straight up to the ninth heaven not concerning himself with Pig Friar Sand and the heavenly hosts who failed to take his hint and were left behind to be caught in the bag again Monkey alone escaped
The demon king then called off his forces and took them back inside the monastery where once more he sent for ropes and tied them up again
The Tang Priest Pig and Friar Sand were hung up from a high beam and the white horse was tethered at the back The gods who were also bound were carried down into a cellar that was then covered and sealed
We will not go into how the devils then packed everything away once more
Journey to the West When Monkey saved his life by springing up into the clouds and saw the devil soldiers returning not waving their banners he knew that his side must have been made prisoner once more
As he landed his auspicious light on the Eastern summit He ground his teeth in hatred of the demon The tears flowed free as Monkey missed his master Then in despair he turned his face to heaven And groaned aloud at Sanzang's new disaster
Master he called in whatever past world did you lay down so many difficulties for yourself that you meet evil spirits at every turn There's no end to your troubles
What are we to do He sighed alone up there for a long time before calming himself down and working out what to do I wonder what sort of pouch it is the devil has that can hold so many things inside he thought
Now it's got the gods the heavenly generals and a lot of other people too
I'll have to ask Heaven to help me but I fear the Jade Emperor will be angry about what has happened
Now I remember there's a True Martial God of the North the Heavenly Honoured Demon Suppressor who now lives on Mount Wudang in the Southern Continent of Jambu I'll go and ask him to rescue my master Indeed
With the Way still uncompleted ape and horse were scattered When the mind was masterless the Five Elements lacked life
If you don't know what happened on this journey listen to the explanation in the next installment
All the Gods Meet a Vicious Foe Maitreya Binds the Evil Monster The story tells how the Great Sage Sun finding himself at his wit's end somersaulted by auspicious cloud straight to Mount Wudang in the Southern Continent of Jambu to ask the Heavenly Honoured Demon Suppressor to save Sanzang Pig Friar Sand the heavenly soldiers and all the rest of them
He flew nonstop and was soon in sight of the patriarch's immortal domain As he brought his cloud gently down to land and took a good look around this is what he saw Journey to the West The great fortress of the Southeast A divine pillar of the central heaven
Lotus Pinnacle soared in its majesty Purplecovered Ridge rose to a great height
The nine rivers ended here far from Jing and Yang A hundred mountains touch the stars in Wing and Axletree
Above was the precious cave of Emptiness And the spirit tower of Zhu and Lu
In the thirtysix palaces golden chimes rang As thousands of worshippers offered their incense
Here the emperors of antiquity patrolled and worshipped Officials held jade tablets inscribed in gold
Blue birds flew over lofty towers Under the canopies red gowns were worn
The place was set on a mountain that towered over the cosmos An immortal domain suffused with emptiness
Some plum trees were just in blossom And the hillside was covered in a blaze of color from the flowers
Dragons hid at the bottom of ravines While tigers lurked on the precipices
The pheasants seemed to be talking Tame deer came up to people
White cranes perched in cloudtopped junipers Green and red phoenixes sang to the sun
Jadepure it resembles a land of immortals The compassion of the golden gateway rules the age
Journey to the West The True Martial Lord had been born after King Purejoy and his wife Queen Victoria had dreamed one night that she conceived by swallowing the light of the sun After fourteen months of pregnancy she had given birth in the royal palace on the first day of the third month of the year jiachen the first of the reign period of Kaihuang
The prince Was brave from his boyhood Grew into perception
Did not take the throne But practised religion
His parents could not stop him He gave up the palace For mysteries and trance Here in the mountains
When all was completed He could fly by broad daylight
The Jade Emperor named him The True Martial Lord
He responds to dark emptiness Joining with tortoise and snake
In all quarters of the compass Is his excellence proclaimed He penetrates all mysteries Achieves every glory
From beginning to end He exterminates demons
Journey to the West While admiring the splendid view the Great Sage Sun was soon through the first second and third gates to his heaven
When he arrived outside the Palace of Great Peace he saw five hundred spirit officers standing crowded together in the auspicious light and atmosphere
They stepped forward to ask Who is it who has come I am Sun Wukong the Great Sage Equaling Heaven Monkey replied and I would like to see the Teacher The spirit officers reported this at once to the patriarch who came from his throne hall to welcome Monkey into the palace hall
After paying his respects Monkey said I have a request to trouble you with What I am in trouble escorting the Tang priest on his journey to seek scriptures in the Western Heaven Monkey replied
There is an evil monster who lives in the Lesser Thunder Monastery on a mountain called the Lesser Western Heaven in the Western Continent of Cattlegift
When my master went in through the monastery gates and saw all the arhats protectors monks and priests line up there he thought that the Buddha was a real one threw himself to the ground and started kowtowing to him
Then they caught him Because I was too careless I let him trap me inside a pair of golden cymbals that were joined tight together without the slightest crack between them just as if they were clamped together
Very luckily for me the Goldheaded Protector requested the Jade Emperor to send the Twentyeight Constellations to come down to earth that very night
They couldn't prise the cymbals apart but the Metal Dragon of the Gullet managed to push his horn between the cymbals and bring me out thank goodness Then I smashed the cymbals which woke up the monster
When he came after us he caught us allme the Twentyeight Constellations and the Five Protectorsand tied us all up with rope
I got out that night and rescued the constellations the Tang Priest and the rest of them
Later I woke the old demon up again while I was looking for our things and he went after the heavenly soldiers to fight them again
When he took his pouch off to use it this time I recognized it and got away but all the rest of them were caught
As I'm at my wit's end I've come to pay my respects to you Teacher and ask your help In the old days said the patriarch I garrisoned the North My position was that of True Martial God and I wiped out evil spirits all over the world on the orders of the Jade Emperor
Later I rode barefoot and with my hair loose on the leaping snake and the divine tortoise and led the five thunder generals young giant dragons lions ferocious beasts and vicious dragons to put an end to the black demonic atmosphere in the Northeast That was when I was acting under the orders of the Original Heavenly Honoured One
Now I live in tranquility and ease on Mount Wudang in the Hall of Great Peace The mountains and seas have long been at peace and heaven and earth are very calm
In our Southern Continent of Jambu and the Northern Continent of Kuru all evil monsters have been exterminated and wicked demons are seen no more I am very grateful that you've come to see me Great Sage
the only trouble is that in the absence of instructions from Heaven I can't fight on my own authority alone
If I sent all my gods the Jade Emperor might well take offence but if I turned your request down flat Great Sage I'd be showing a lack of finer feeling
I'm sure that even if there are evil creatures on that road West they cannot be really terrible
So I'll send General Tortoise General Snake and five magic dragons to help you
I guarantee that they will capture the evil spirit and rescue your master Monkey then bowed in thanks to the patriarch and went with Tortoise Snake and the magic dragons all carrying the finest and sharpest of weapons back to the West
Before long they were back at the Lesser Thunder Monastery where they landed their clouds and went straight to the gate to challenge them to battle
Meanwhile King Yellow Brow had called all his demonic hosts together before the main hall of the monastery to say to them Sun the Novice hasn't been here for the last couple of days
I wonder where he's gone for reinforcements Journey to the West Before the words were out of his mouth a little devil came from the main gates to report Sun the Novice is here with some dragon snake and tortoise officers
They're demanding battle outside the main gates How ever did that monkey get them the demon king asked
Where are they from With that he put on his armor and went out through the main gate shouting Which dragon gods are you
How dare you invade my immortal domain Looking majestic and summoning up their spirits the five dragons and Generals Tortoise and Snake shouted Damned monster
We're five dragon gods and Generals Tortoise and Snake who stand before the Heavenly Honoured Demon Suppressor the Patriarch of the Indiffirentiated Unity from the Palace of Great Peace on Mount Wudang
We are here at the invitation of the Great Sage Equaling Heaven and on the authority of the Heavenly Honoured One to arrest you
Hand over the Tang Priest the constellations and all the rest of them and your life will be spared you evil spirit
Otherwise we'll hack the bodies of every one of you devils on this mountain into little pieces and burn all your buildings to ashes When the demon heard this he was furious
Animals he retorted How dare you talk like that What sort of powers do you think you have
Stay where you are and take this The five dragons turned their clouds over to make rain while the two generals raised dust and sand as they all charged into the attack with their spears sabers swords and halberds
Monkey followed them into action wielding his iron cudgel It was a fine fight
The evil demon used his might Monkey went for help
When the evil demon used his might He occupied the monastery and created Buddha images
When Monkey went for help He traveled far to a precious land to borrow the dragons
Tortoise and Snake created water and fire The evil spirits took to arms
The five dragons went to the West as instructed While Monkey hung behind for his master's sake
Sword and halberd flashed like coloured lightning The spears and sabers gleamed like rainbows
The wolftoothed mace Was powerful short and flexible Journey to the West The goldbanded cudgel Could change at its owner's will
There were crashes like firecrackers And the rhythmic clang of metal being struck
The monster was attacked by fire and water And weapons crowded close around the spirits
The cries of battle frightened wolves and tigers The din disturbed both gods and devils
Just when the battle was still unresolved The evil spirit fetched out his treasure again
When Monkey had been leading the five dragons and two generals in fight against the demon king for an hour the demon took off his pouch and held it in his hand
Watch out gentlemen exclaimed Monkey in horror
Not realizing what was happening they all stopped attacking with their weapons and surged forward
There was a loud swish as the demon king threw his pouch into the air
Abandoning the five dragons and the two generals to be wrapped up in the pouch the Great Sage Monkey escaped by somersaulting up above the ninth heaven
The evil spirits returned in triumph once more tied them up too took them down into the pit and put the lid on it
Monkey landed his cloud and lay sprawled out under the peak listless and dispirited
That demon is a terror he thought with bitter regret and without realizing what was happening he shut his eyes as if he were going to sleep
Just then there came a call Great Sage don't go to sleep Get up and rescue them as soon as you can
Your master's life is in great danger At once Monkey opened his eyes again and sprang to his feet to see that it was the Duty God of the Day
You wretched little god Monkey shouted you were so greedy for your blood and sacrifices over there that you haven't reported for duty for days Why are you coming to disturb me now Put out your foot
I'm going to hit you a couple of times to cheer myself up
I'm feeling low The Duty God hastily bowed and said Great Sage you are one of the happy immortals in the human world How could you possibly be feeling low
We've been here for a long time on the Bodhisattva's orders to keep secret guard over the Tang Priest We and the local gods have never left him for a moment which is why we can't pay our respects to you often enough
You can't hold that against me If you're guarding him Monkey replied tell me where the evil spirit has imprisoned the constellations the protectors the guardians my master and the rest of them
What are they suffering Journey to the West Your master and your fellowdisciples have been hung up in the cloister outside the main hall the Duty God replied The constellations are all in agony in a pit
For the last couple of days I've had no news of you Great Sage but I've just seen that the evil spirits have captured the divine dragons Tortoise and Snake and put them in the pit too It was only then that we realized you must have fetched some reinforcements Great Sage which is why we came specially to look for you
Whatever you do you must rescue them at once Great Sage no matter how tired you are Hearing this Monkey said to the duty god the tears streaming down his face I'm too ashamed to go up to Heaven and I haven't the nerve to go to the sea
I'm afraid of asking for the Bodhisattva's help and too miserable to look the Buddha in the face
The ones who were captured just now were the True Martial God's Tortoise Snake and five dragons and their forces There's nowhere else I can turn for help
What am I to do The Duty God smiled as he replied Relax Great Sage I've thought of some elite troops who are bound to be able to subdue these demons
You went to Wudang just now that was in the Southern Jambu Continent
The troops I have in mind come from the same continent from Bincheng on Mound Xuyi
It's what's now called Sizhou There's a Great Sage Bodhisattva King Teacher there who has enormous magical powers
He has a disciple called Little Prince Zhang and four divine generals the other year they subdued the Water Mother Goddess You should go there yourself to ask him
If he in his kindness is willing to help you're bound to be able to catch the demon and save the master The news delighted Monkey who said You look after the master and don't let him come to any harm while I go off to ask his help Monkey then set off on his somersault and left that demoninfested place to go straight to Mount Xuyi
He was soon there and when he looked around he saw that it was a fine place The Yangtse was not far to the South To the North it faced the Huai River To the East it led to the islands in the sea To the West it was connected with Fengfou
On the mountaintop was a lofty temple While springs gushed forth from its sides
Grotesquelyshaped rocks towered high Lofty pines were elegantly angular
There was always fresh fruit in season And every kind of flower opened in the sun
People moved around like armies of ants While boats came from far and wide like flights of geese
Journey to the West On it there stood The Auspicious Crag Temple The Palace of the Eastern Peak The Shrine of the Five Illustrious Ones The Tortoise Mountain Monastery Rhythmic bells and incense smoke rose to the heavens
There were also The Crystal Spring The Valley of Five Stupas The Terrace of Eight Immortals The Apricot Orchard The colours of the mountain and trees lit up Bincheng
Boundless were the stretches of cloud While hidden birds still sang when they were tired
Never mind mounts Tai Song Heng or Hua Here was the beauty of an earthly paradise
The Great Sage enjoyed the view enormously as he crossed the Huai River entered the city of Bincheng and arrived at the gates of the Great Sage's Dhyana Monastery
Over the majestic halls and colorful cloisters there towered a pagoda
Indeed It rose ten thousand feet through clouds to the sky The golden vase penetrated the heavens above
The light from it filled the universe No shadows were cast on its windows
Heavenly music was heard when the wind rang the bells The sun shone on roofdragons facing the Buddhahall
Journey to the West Birds constantly came here to sing their complaints Endlessly beautiful was the view of the Huai River
Monkey looked at it all as he went in to the inner gates where the Bodhisattva King Teacher who was expecting him had come out to meet him with Little Prince Zhang
After they had greeted each other and exchanged polite remarks Monkey said I'm escorting the Tang Priest to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven We have come to the Lesser Thunder Monastery where there's a Yellowbrowed Demon who's pretending to be a Buddha
Not realizing he was an impostor my master kowtowed to him and was captured
Then I was caught inside a pair of golden cymbals until thank goodness the constellations who had been sent down from heaven rescued me
I smashed the cymbals but when we fought him again he wrapped the heavenly gods the protectors the guardians my master and my fellowdisciples up in a cloth bag
As I have nowhere else to turn Bodhisattva I've come to call on you and ask you to give play to your great strength Use the magic powers with which you put down the Water Mother and saved the common people to go with me to rescue my master
Then he can take the scriptures back to China to be transmitted forever praise the wisdom of our Buddha and make the prajnaparamita better known What you ask today is indeed for the greater glory of our Buddha said King Teacher and I really ought to go myself
But it's early summer now just the time when the Huai River floods
The Great Sage Water Ape I subdued recently gets active when there's water and I'm worried that he'd take advantage of my absence to make so much trouble that no divine powers could bring him back under control
I'll send my disciple with four generals to help you force the demon into submission Monkey thanked him then headed back by cloud with the four generals and Little Prince Zhang to the Lesser Western Heaven where they went straight to the Lesser Thunder Monastery
Here Little Prince Zhang brandished his paperwhite spear and the four generals swung their superb swords as they shouted abuse to challenge the demons to battle
When the little devils ran inside to report this the demon king led his devils out once more had his drums beaten and replied Who've you persuaded to come this time Before the words were all out of his mouth Little Prince Zhang at the head of the four generals shouted Damned evil spirit
Do you have no eyes in your head
Don't you recognize who we are Whose underlings are you the demon king said How dare you help him I am the disciple of the Great Sage of Sizhou the Bodhisattva King Teacher and I'm here on his orders with four divine generals to capture you the prince replied
What sort of martial arts do you have replied the demon king with a sneer that give you the nerve to be so insulting As you want to know about my martial powers the prince replied let me tell you
My people come from the Flowing Sands River Where my father used to be king of Sandland
Journey to the West I was a weak and sickly child Born under a bad influence and an unlucky star
Long had I admired my master's immortal powers When in a chance meeting he taught me the secret
Half a pill of elixir cured my sickness I abandoned my throne to cultivate my conduct
Once I knew bow to live as long as heaven My face became youthful and will remain so forever
I have been to the assemblies under the dragonflower tree And ridden by cloud to the Buddha's hall
Seizing the fogs and winds I subdued the watery tribe I defended the mountain by subduing dragons and tigers
The dutiful people raised a lofty pagoda To calm the seas through the glow of its relics
My paperwhite spear can capture all demons Evil spirits are caught in the gray sleeve of my coat
Now peace and joy reign in the city of Bincheng And all the world praises Little Zhang's fame When the demon king heard this he replied with a touch of a mocking smile Prince when you abandoned your throne to follow the Bodhisattva King Teacher what sort of arts of immortality did you learn
All you're good for is capturing water monsters in the Huai River You shouldn't have believed all the nonsense Sun the Novice talked and have come across all those mountains and rivers to offer your life
We'll soon find out whether you're immortal or not When Little Zhang heard this he was very angry and thrust straight for the demon's face with his spear
The four generals all rushed into the attack together and so did the Great Sage Monkey wielding his iron cudgel
The splendid evil spirit was not afraid in the least as he blocked parried and struck back with his short and flexible wolftooth mace It was a fine battle
Journey to the West The little prince with his paperwhite spear Made stronger by the four generals' swords Wukong using his goldbanded cudgel With one heart they surrounded the demon king
Truly his magical powers were great As without a trace of fear he resisted their attacks
The wolftooth mace was a Buddha weapon Preserving him from wounds by swords or spear
Wile howled the wind Through the turbid swirl of evil vapors
One used his skill for love of mortal things The other's heart was set on the Buddha and the scriptures
They charged and they raged Shrouding sun moon and stars in cloud Each of them evil and vicious in anger
For long the Three Vehicles could not assert dominance Bitter and wellmatched was the battle of rival skills
After the fight had been going on for a long time and was still inconclusive the evil spirit undid his pouch and Monkey once more shouted Look out gentlemen The prince and his followers did not realize what he was telling them to look out for so with a swish the demon king had them caught in his pouch
Only Monkey escaped in time
We will not describe how once more the demon king returned in triumph sent for ropes and had them tied up and put into the pit under lock and lid
When Monkey leapt up into the sky and saw the demon leading his troops back and fastening the gates he brought his auspicious light down to land and stood on the Western slope of the mountain Master he wept aloud in his misery Since being converted and becoming a monk Journey to the West I've been grateful to Guanyin for ending my woes
In escorting you West to seek the great Way I have helped you towards the Buddha's own temple
Who would have thought when the going looked easy That we'd be attacked by so mighty a monster
None of my tricks or devices succeed All the help I have looked for has just been in vain As Monkey was in the very depths of misery a brightlycoloured cloud suddenly landed to the Southwest and the whole mountain peak was lashed with a torrential rainstorm
Wukong a voice called do you know who I am Monkey hurried forward to look and this is what he saw Big ears a broad jaw and a square face Wide shoulders a deep chest and a fat body
A jolly voice that was full of fun A pair of bright and sparkling eyes His clothes hung open luck was all about him
His straw sandals were comfortable and his spirits high
He was the lord of the land of bliss The laughing monk Maitreya
As soon as Monkey saw him he kowtowed immediately and said Where are you going Lord Buddha from the East
I beg you to forgive me for failing to keep out of your way I'm here because of the demon in the Lesser Thunder Monastery the Buddha replied
I am very grateful for your great kindness my lord Monkey replied
May I ask where the demon is from and where he became an evil spirit
What sort of treasure is that pouch of his
Please tell me my lord He was a yellowbrowed page who used to strike my stone chime the Buddha Maitreya replied
On the third day of the third month this year I left him looking after my palace when I went to an assembly of the Primal One That was when he stole some of my treasures and became a spirit as an imitation Buddha
That Journey to the West pouch is my future heaven bag or what's generally called a human seed bag
The wolftooth cudgel was originally the stick for striking the chime When Monkey heard this he shouted You're a splendid laughing monk I must say
By letting that boy escape you let him masquerade as a Buddha and ruin things for me
You ought to be charged with slack management of your household I was careless Maitreya replied
Besides your master and you disciples have not yet come to the end of the demons you will have to deal with That is why every kind of spiritual creature has been coming down to earth It's right that you should suffer
Now I'm here to capture him for you That evil spirit has very great magic powers Monkey replied and you haven't got any weapons
How can you possibly subdue him I'll make a little hut under the mountain said Maitreya where I grow fruit and melons
You challenge him to battle lose in the fight that follows and lure him into my melon patch
All my melons are still unripe so you're to change into a big ripe melon
When he gets there he's bound to want a melon and I'll give you to him
Once you're in his stomach you can do what you like to him
Then I'll get his pouch and we can put him inside it It's a very good plan Monkey replied but how will you know which is the ripe melon I'll have turned into
And why should he be willing to go there after me I'm the ruler of the world laughed Maitreya and I have miraculous vision
Of course I'll know which one is you I'd recognize you whatever you turned into
The only worry is that the demon won't come after you
I'll have to teach you some new magic But he's bound to catch me in his pouch Monkey replied not come after me
What magic power could I use Stretch your hand out Maitreya said
Monkey stretched out his left hand
Maitreya moistened the forefinger of his own right hand with some magic saliva wrote stop on it and told Monkey to make a fist If he opened that hand again in the demon's face the demon would certainly come after him
Monkey cheerfully made the fist as he had been instructed and went back to the monastery gates brandishing his cudgel with one hand as he shouted Evil spirit your lord and master Monkey's here
Come out at once and we'll see who's the champion When the little devils rushed inside to report the demon king asked how many soldiers Monkey had brought with him this time None they replied
He's here by himself That Monkey's at his wit's end and exhausted the demon king laughed and he can't get anyone else to help
He's just throwing his life away now Once he was in his armor again he took his treasure and his flexible wolftooth mace and went out through the monastery gates shouting You won't be able to hold out this time Sun Wukong Damned demon Monkey replied abusively
What do you mean I won't be able to hold out Look at you the demon replied You're at your wit's end and exhausted There's nobody else you can turn to for help
Now you're here again to try to resist me there won't be any more divine soldiers or anything like that to help you
That's why I said you wouldn't be able to hold out Journey to the West Fiend said Monkey you don't even know whether you want to live or to die
Stop all that talk and take this Seeing that Monkey was wielding his cudgel singlehanded the demon burst out laughing What a clever little ape
Do you think you'll be able to hold me off by using your cudgel onehanded My dear boy said Monkey if I used both hands it would be too much for you
Even with four or five hands you wouldn't be able to beat me even if I had one hand tied behind my back
That is as long as you didn't use that pouch of yours Very well then the demon king replied I won't use my treasure
I'll give you a straight fight and we'll see who's the best man With that he raised his wolftooth mace and attacked Monkey who opened his clenched fist in the demon's face before wielding the cudgel in both hands
Once the demon was under the spell he put all thought of retreat out of his mind and indeed did not use his pouch but went for Monkey with his mace
Monkey feinted then turned and fled in defeat pursued by the evil spirit down the Western slopes of the mountain
As soon as he saw the melon field Monkey rolled himself into a ball to go into it and turn himself into a big ripe sweet watermelon
The evil spirit stopped to look all around not knowing where Monkey had gone
He rushed over to the hut and asked Who's growing these melons Maitreya who had turned himself into an old melon grower came out of the thatched hut and said I am Your Majesty Have you got any ripe ones the demon king asked
Yes Maitreya replied
Pick me a ripe one then said the demon
I'm thirsty Maitreya then picked the melon that was Monkey transformed and handed it to the demon king respectfully with both hands
The demon king did not stop to examine it but took it and bit into it
This was Monkey's chance to go straight down the demon's throat Without any more ado he started hitting out and kicking grabbing and clawing at the monster's entrails and stomach turning somersaults standing on his head and doing just as he liked
The evil spirit ground his teeth and grimaced in agony the tears flowing down his face as he rolled around the melon field till it looked like a threshing floor Stop stop he shouted
Save me save me Maitreya then reverted to his true form and said with a jolly smile Evil beast do you recognize me When the evil spirit looked up he fell to his knees on the ground rubbing his stomach with both hands and kowtowing as he said Spare me master spare me
I'll never do it again Maitreya then stepped forward seized him with one hand undid the future heaven pouch took back the stick for beating the stone chime and said Sun Wukong spare his life for my sake Monkey who was still beside himself with loathing and hatred went on punching kicking and making havoc in the demon's insides until the demon collapsed in unbearable agony
Journey to the West He's had all he can take Wukong Maitreya said
Spare him now Open your mouth wide Sun Wukong finally said and let me out Although the demon's insides had been tied up into agonizing knots his heart had not yet been damaged and as the saying goes Until the heart is damaged nobody dies Leaves only fall when the trunk's sap dries
As soon as he was told to open his mouth wide he did so in spite of the pain
Only then did Monkey jump out and turn back into himself He at once seized his cudgel and was about to strike again but the Buddha Maitreya had already put the evil spirit into the pouch and slung it at his waist
Holding the chimestick in his hand Maitreya said Evil beast where are the golden cymbals you stole The monster who was desperate to live could be heard mumbling inside the future heaven bag Sun Wukong smashed them If they're broken give me my gold back said Maitreya
It's piled up on the lotus throne in the main hall the monster replied
Holding the bag in one hand and the stick in the other the Buddha laughed as he said Wukong you and I are going to get my gold back After the display of such dharma power Sun Wukong dared not be at all remiss but took the master back up the mountain and into the monastery where they gathered all the pieces of gold
Although the monastery gates were firmly shut one push with the stick was enough to open them wide and when they looked inside they saw that all the little devils had taken the monastery's wealth and were now fleeing in all directions
When Monkey found one he killed one when he found two he killed two and so on until he had killed all the six or seven hundred little devils who resumed their real forms as mountain spirits tree monsters evil beasts and animal demons
The Buddha gathered all the pieces of gold together blew on them with magic breath and said the words of a spell At once they were the two golden cymbals again
He then took his leave of Monkey and headed straight back to his paradise by auspicious cloud
The Great Sage then released the Tang Priest Pig and Friar Sand
After being hung up there for several days the idiot was desperately hungry Without waiting to thank Monkey he ran straight to the kitchen his back bent to find some food
As it happened the demon had sent for his lunch but not had time to eat it when Monkey challenged him to battle
The moment he saw it Pig ate half a saucepan of rice before fetching a pair of bowls for the master and Friar Sand each to eat two bowlfuls
Only then did he thank Monkey and ask about the evil spirit
Monkey told him all about how he had asked the help of King Teacher Tortoise and Snake then borrowed the prince from the True Lord and about how Maitreya had subdued the demon
When Sanzang heard this he expressed his gratitude at great length and kowtowed to all the heavens
Disciple he asked where are all the gods imprisoned Journey to the West The Duty God of the Day told me yesterday that they were all in the pit Monkey replied
Pig he continued you and I are going to rescue them Now that he had eaten the idiot was full of strength and energy again as he found his rake and went with Monkey to open up the pit untie the prisoners and ask them to come out to under the tower
Sanzang who had now put his cassock back on bowed to each of them in thanks after which the Great Sage saw the five dragons and two generals off on their way back to Wudang Little Prince Zhang and the four generals on their way to Bincheng and the Twentyeight Constellations on their way back to the palaces of Heaven He also released the Protectors and Guardians so that each could return to his own territory
Master and disciples stayed on in the monastery to rest for a few hours
Then after the horse had eaten its fill and the luggage all been packed they set out again the next morning
Before leaving they burnt the towers thrones halls and preaching chambers to ashes
Thus it was that Without any cares from their troubles they flee From disasters and obstacles finally free
If you don't know when they reached the Great Thunder Monastery listen to the explanation in the next installment
The DhyanaNature Is Stable and Tuoluo Village Is Saved The Mind of the Way Is Purified As Corruption Is Removed The story tells how Sanzang and his three disciples happily continued along their way after leaving the Lesser Western Heaven
They had been going for over a month and it was now late spring The flowers were in bloom and all the woods they could see were full of green shade After a spell of wind and rain dusk was falling once more
Disciple said Sanzang reining in his horse it's getting late
Which way shall we go to look for somewhere to spend the night Don't worry Master said Monkey with a smile
Even if we can't find anywhere to stay we three all have our skills Tell Pig to cut some grass and Friar Sand to fell some pines I know a bit of carpentry We can make ourselves a hut by the road here good enough to stay in for a year
Why the rush But this is no place to stay brother said Pig
The mountain's crawling with wild beasts like tigers leopards and wolves Mountain ogres and hobgoblins are all over the place It's hard enough travelling by daylight I wouldn't dare spend the night here Idiot said Monkey You're getting more and more hopeless I'm not just shooting my mouth off
With this cudgel in my hands I could hold up the sky itself if it collapsed Journey to the West Master and disciples were in the middle of their conversation when they noticed a hill farm not far away
Good said Monkey a place for the night Where the venerable elder asked
Isn't that a house in the trees over there asked Monkey pointing
Let's ask if we can put up for the night there
We can be on our way first thing in the morning Sanzang was so delighted he urged his horse forward Dismounting outside the wicker gates he found them firmly fastened
Open up open up he called knocking on the gates They were opened from the inside by an old man with a stick who was wearing rush sandals a black turban and a plain gown Who's that shouting he asked
Putting his hands together in front of his chest Sanzang bowed in polite greeting and said Venerable patron I am a monk sent from the East to fetch scriptures from the Western Heaven
As I have reached this distinguished place so late in the day I have come to your residence to ask for a night's lodging
I beg you to be charitable to us Monk the elder said you may want to go to the West but you'll never get there
This is the Lesser Western Heaven and it's a very long way from here to the Great Western Heaven
This place alone is hard enough to get out of to say nothing of the difficulties of the rest of the journey Why is it hard to get out of Sanzang asked
The old man put his hands together and replied About a dozen miles West of our village is a Runny Persimmon Lane and a mountain called Seven Perfections Why 'Seven Perfections' Sanzang asked
It's  miles across the old man replied and covered with persimmons
There's an old saying that persimmon trees have seven perfections They prolong life
They are very shady
No birds nest in them
They are free of insects
Their leaves are very beautiful after frost The fruit is excellent
The branches and leaves are big and fat
Journey to the West That's why it's called Mount Seven Perfections
This is a big thinly populated area and nobody has ever been deep into the mountain
Every year overripe rotten persimmons fall on the path and they fill the rocky lane right up The rain dew snow and frost attack them and they rot all through the summer until the whole path is a mass of putrefaction The people round here call it Runny Shit or Runny Persimmon Lane
When there's a West wind it smells even worse than a cesspit being emptied
As it's now high spring and there's strong Southeasterly blowing you can't smell it yet Sanzang felt too depressed to speak Monkey could not contain himself Silly old fool he shouted at the top of his voice
We're here late at night to find somewhere to stay and you're trying to scare us with all that talk
If your house really is so poky that there's no room for us to sleep indoors we'll spend the night squatting under this tree
So cut the cackle At the sight of Monkey's hideous face the old man shut his mouth petrified with fear Then he plucked up his courage pointed his stick at Monkey and shouted Damn you you bonyfaced pointybrowed flatnosed sunkencheeked hairyeyed sicklylooking devil
You've got no sense of respect sticking your mouth out like that and insulting an old gentleman You're not very perceptive old chap Monkey replied putting on a smile You don't realize who this sicklylooking devil is
As the manual of physiognomy says 'A freakish face is like a rock in which fine jade is hidden' You're completely wrong to judge people on their looks
Ugly I certainly am but I know a trick or two Where are you from the old man asked
What's your name
What powers do you have To this Monkey replied with a smile My home is in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body My conduct I cultivated on the Mount of Flowers and Fruit
After studying with the Patriarch of the Spirittower Heart Mountain I learned complete and perfect skill in the martial arts I can stir up the oceans subdue mother dragons Carry mountains on my shoulders and drive the sun along
At capturing monsters and demons I'm champion Ghosts and gods are terrified when I shift the stars
Great is my fame as skythief and earthturner I'm the Handsome Stone Monkey of infinite transformations
Journey to the West This turned the old man's anger to delight Bowing to them he said Please come into my humble abode and make yourselves comfortable The four of them then went in together leading the horse and carrying the load
All that could be seen to either side of the gates were prickly thorns
The inner gates were set in a wall of brick and stone that had more thorns on top of it and only when they had gone through them did they see a threeroomed tiled house
The old man pulled up chairs for them to sit on while they waited for tea to be brought and gave orders for a meal
Soon a table was brought in and set with wheat gluten beancurd sweet potatoes radishes mustard greens turnips rice and sourmallow soup Master and disciples all ate their fill
After the meal Pig pulled Monkey aside and whispered Brother the old bloke wasn't going to let us stay at first Now he's given us this slapup meal Why It wasn't worth very much was it Brother Monkey replied
Tomorrow we'll make him give us ten kinds of fruit and ten dishes of food You've got a nerve Pig replied
You talked him into giving us a meal all right with all that boasting But we'll be on our way tomorrow
How can he give you things Don't be so impatient said Monkey I've got a way to cope Dusk soon started to draw in
The old man brought a lamp and Monkey asked with a bow What is your surname sir Li the old man replied
I suppose this must be Li Village Monkey continued
No said the old man this is Tuoluo Village Over five hundred families live here Most of them have other surnames
I am the only one called Li Benefactor Li Monkey replied with what kind intentions did you give us that ample meal Just now you said that you could capture evil monsters said the old man
We have a monster here that we'd like you to capture for us and we will of course reward you generously Monkey then chanted a naaaw of respect and said I accept your commission Just look at him said Pig asking for trouble
The moment he hears there's a demon to catch he's nicer to him than he would be to his own grandfather He even chanted a 'naaaw' first You don't understand brother said Monkey My 'naaaw' clinched the deal
Now he won't hire anyone else When Sanzang heard this he said You monkey you always want to grab things for yourself
If that evil spirit's powers are too great for you to capture him then we monks will be shown up as liars Don't be cross with me Master Monkey said with a smile
Let me ask some more questions What else the old man asked
This fine village is on an open plain and a lot of people live here said Monkey It's not remote and isolated What evil spirit would dare come to your door Journey to the West I will be frank with you the old man replied
We had long lived in peace and prosperity here till a sudden strong wind blew three and a half years ago
Everyone was busy at the time threshing the wheat on the threshing floor or transplanting rice in the paddy fields We thought it was just a change in the weather
We never imagined that when the wind had blown by an evil spirit would eat the horses and cattle that people had put out to pasture as well as the pigs and the sheep He swallowed hens and geese whole and any men or women he found he devoured alive
Since then he's come again each of the last two years to murder us
Venerable sir if you really do have magic powers to capture the evil spirit and cleanse the place of him we will most certainly reward you generously and with great respect But the monster will be hard to catch Monkey replied
Yes said Pig very hard
We're pilgrim monks only here for the night We'll be on our way tomorrow
We can't catch any monsters So you monks just tricked that meal out of me the old man said
When we first met you talked very big You said you could move the stars and capture evil monsters
But now I've told you about this you pretend he can't be caught Old man said Monkey it would be easy to catch the evil spirit except that you people here don't work together
That's why it's hard How can you be so sure that we don't work together the old man asked
If the monster has been harassing you for three years goodness only knows how many lives he's taken Monkey replied
I reckon that if every family put up one ounce of silver the five hundred households could raise five hundred ounces and with that you could find a priest somewhere who'd exorcise the monster Why did you cheerfully put up with three years of such cruelty from him You talk of spending money the old man said You're trying to shame us to death Every family here has spent four or five ounces of silver
The year before last we went to invite a Buddhist monk South of the mountains here to catch the monster but he failed How did the monk try to do it Brother Monkey asked
To this the old man replied
The monk wore a cassock And recited the scriptures First the Peacock Sutra And then the Lotus
He burned incense in a burner Held a bell between his hands
His reading of the scriptures Alarmed the evil spirit Journey to the West Who came straight to the farm Amid his wind and clouds
The monk fought with the spirit And it was a splendid sight One of them landed a punch The other grabbed at his foe
The monk had the advantage of Having a hairless head
But soon the demon had won And gone straight back to his clouds
When the wound had dried in the sun We went up close for a look The monk's bald head was smashed open Just like a ripe watermelon
In other words laughed Monkey he lost He just paid with his life the old man replied We were the ones who lost
We had to buy his coffin pay for his funeral and give compensation to his disciple
That silver wasn't enough for the disciple He's still trying to sue us
He won't call it a day Did you hire anyone else to catch the demon Monkey asked
Last year we invited a Taoist priest to do it the old man answered
How did he try Monkey asked
The Taoist the old man replied Wore a golden crown on his head And magic robes on his body He sounded his magic wand Journey to the West Used charms and water too
He made gods and generals do his will Captured demons and goblins
A wild wind howled and roared While black fog blotted all out
Demon and Taoist Were evenly matched They fought till nightfall When the fiend went back to the clouds
Heaven and earth were clear And all of us people were there
We went out to search for the priest Found him drowned in the mountain stream
When we fished him out to look He was like a drenched chicken In other words said Monkey with a smile he lost too He only paid with his life but we had to spend a lot of money that wasn't really necessary the old man replied It doesn't matter Monkey said It doesn't matter
Wait till I catch the demon for you If you've got the power to catch him I'll ask some of the village elders to write an undertaking to give you as much silver as you want when you've defeated him You'll not be a penny short
But if you lose don't try to extort money out of us We must each accept the will of heaven Old man said Monkey they've got you terrified of extortion We're not like that
Send for the elders The old man was delighted
He sent his slaves to invite seven or eight old men from among his nextdoor neighbors his cousins his wife's family and his friends They all came to meet the strangers and when they had greeted the Tang Priest they cheerfully discussed the capture of the demon
Which of your distinguished disciples will do it they asked
Journey to the West I will said Monkey putting his hands together in front of his chest
You'll never do never said the old man with horror
The evil spirit's magic powers are enormous and it's huge too
Venerable sir you're so tiny and skinny you'd slip through one of the gaps between its teeth Old man said Monkey with a smile You're no judge of people
Small I may be but I'm solid
There's a lot more to me than meets the eye When the elders heard this they had to take him at his word Venerable sir they said how big a reward will you want for capturing the demon Why do you have to talk about a reward Monkey asked
As the saying goes 'Gold dazzles silver is white and stupid and copper coins stink' We're virtuous monks and we definitely won't take money In that case you must all be lofty monks who obey your vows the elders said
But even if you won't accept money we can't let you work for nothing
We all live by agriculture If you subdue the demon and clean the place up every family here will give you a third of an acre of good farmland which will make over  acres altogether Your master and you disciples can build a monastery there and sit in meditation
That would be much better than going on your long journey It would be even worse replied brother Monkey with a smile
If we asked for land we'd have to raise horses do labor service pay grain taxes and hand over hay We'll never be able to go to bed at dusk or lie in after the fifth watch
It'd be the death of us If you won't accept anything how are we to express our thanks the elders asked We're men of religion said Monkey
Some tea and a meal will be thanks enough for us That's easy said the elders
But how are you going to catch the demon Once it comes I'll get it said Monkey
But it's enormous the elders said It stretches from the earth to the sky
It comes in wind and goes in mist
How are you ever going to get close to it When it comes to evil spirits who can summon winds and ride on clouds Monkey replied I treat them as mere kids
It makes no difference how big it isI have ways of beating it As they were talking the howl of a great wind made the eight or nine elders start shaking with fear Monk you've asked for trouble and you've got it they said You talked about the monster and here he is Old Mr
Li opened the door and said to his relations and the Tang Priest Come in come in the demon's here This so alarmed Pig and Friar Sand that they wanted to go inside too but Monkey grabbed each of them with one of his hands and said You're a disgrace You're monks and you ought to know better
Stay where you are and don't try to run away Come into the courtyard with me
We're going to see what kind of evil spirit this is But brother said Pig they've been through this before The noise of the wind means that the demon's coming
They've all gone to hide We're not friends or relations of the demon We've had no business dealings with him
What do we want to see him for Monkey was so strong that with no further argument he hauled Journey to the West them into the courtyard and made them stand there while the wind blew louder and louder
It was a splendid wind that Uprooted trees and flattened woods alarming wolves and tigers Stirred up the rivers and oceans to the horror of ghosts and gods Blowing the triple peaks of the great Mount Hua all upside down Shaking the earth and sky through the world's four continents
Every village family shut fast its gates While boys and girls all fled for cover
Black clouds blotted out the Milky Way Lamps lost their brightness and the world went dark Pig was shaking with terror
He lay on the ground rooted into the earth with his snout and buried his head He looked as if he had been nailed there
Friar Sand covered his face and could not keep his eyes open Monkey knew from the sound of the wind that the demon was in it
A moment later when the wind had passed all that could be vaguely made out in the sky were two lamps Brothers he said looking down the wind's finished Get up and look The idiot tugged his snout out brushed the dirt off himself and looked up into the sky where he saw the two lamps What a laugh Pig said laughing aloud What a laugh It's an evil spirit with good manners
Let's make friends with it It's a very dark night said Friar Sand and you haven't even seen it so how can you tell whether it's good or bad As they used to say in the old days Pig replied 'Take a candle when you're out at night and stay where you are if you haven't one' You can see that it's got a pair of lanterns to light its way It must be a good spirit You're wrong Friar Sand said
That's not a pair of lanterns
they're the demon's eyes This gave the idiot such a fright that he shrank three inches Heavens he said
If its eyes are that size goodness knows how big its mouth is Don't be scared brother said Monkey
You two guard the master while I go up and see what sort of mood it's in and what kind of evil spirit it is Brother said Pig don't tell the monster about us Journey to the West Splendid Monkey sprang up into midair with a whistle
Not so fast he yelled at the top of his voice brandishing his cudgel not so fast
I'm here When the monster saw him it took a firm stance and began to wield a long spear furiously
Parrying with his cudgel Monkey asked What part do you come from monster
Where are you an evil spirit The monster ignored the questions and continued with its spearplay
Monkey asked again and again there was no answer as the wild spearplay continued
So it's deaf and dumb Monkey smiled to himself
Don't run away
Take this Unperturbed the monster parried the cudgel with more wild spearplay
The midair battle ebbed and flowed until the middle of the night as first one then the other was on top but still there was no victor
Pig and Friar Sand had a very clear view from the Li family courtyard and they could see that the demon was only using its spear to defend itself and not making any attacks while Monkey's cudgel was never far from the demon's head
Friar Sand said Pig with a grin you keep guard here I'm going up to join in the fight I'm not going to let Monkey keep all the credit for beating the monster to himself
He won't be the first to be given a drink The splendid idiot leapt up on his cloud and joined in the fight taking a swing with his rake
The monster fended this off with another spear
The two spears were like flying snakes or flashes of lightning Pig was full of admiration
This evil spirit is a real expert with the spears
This isn't 'behind the mountain' spearplay it's 'tangled thread' spearplay It's not Ma Family style
It's what's called softshaft style Don't talk such nonsense idiot said Monkey
There's no such thing as softshaft style Just look Pig replied He's parrying us with the blades You can't see the shafts I don't know where he's hiding them All right then said Monkey perhaps there is a softshaft style
But this monster can't talk I suppose it's not yet humanized it's still got a lot of the negative about it
Tomorrow morning when the positive is dominant it's bound to run away
When it does we've got to catch up with it and not let it go Yes yes said Pig
When the fight had gone on for a long time the East grew light
The monster didn't dare fight any longer so it turned and fled with Monkey and Pig both after it
Suddenly they smelled the putrid and overwhelming stench of Runny Persimmon Lane on Mount Seven Perfections
Some family must be emptying its cesspit said Pig
What a horrible stink Holding his nose Brother Monkey said After the demon after the demon The monster went over the mountain and turned back into himself
a giant redscaled python Just look at it
Eyes shooting stars Nostrils gushing clouds Teeth like closeset blades of steel Journey to the West Curving claws like golden hooks
On its head a horn of flesh Like a thousand pieces of agate Its body clad in scales of red Like countless patches of rouge
When coiled on the ground it might seem a brocade quilt When flying it could be mistaken for a rainbow
From where it sleeps a stench rises to the heavens And in movement its body is wreathed in red clouds
Is it big A man could not be seen from one side to the other
Is it long It can span a mountain from North to South
So it's a long snake Pig said
If it's a maneater it could gobble up five hundred for a meal and still not be full Its softshafted spears are its forked tongue said Monkey It's exhausted by the chase
Attack it from behind Pig leapt up and went for it hitting it with his rake
The monster dived into a cave but still left seven or eight feet of tail sticking outside
Pig threw down his rake grabbed it and shouted Hold on hold on He pulled with all his strength but could not move it an inch
Idiot laughed Monkey let it go in We'll find a way of dealing with it
Don't pull so wildly at the snake When Pig let go the monster contracted itself and burrowed inside
But we had half of it before I let go he grumbled
Now it's shrunk and gone inside we're never going to get it out
We've lost the snake haven't we The wretched creature is enormous and the cave is very narrow Monkey replied It won't possibly be able to turn round in there It definitely went straight inside so the cave must have an exit at the other end for it to get out through
Hurry round and block the back door while I attack at the front The idiot shot round to the other side of the mountain where there was indeed another hole that he blocked with his foot
But he had not steadied himself when Monkey thrust his cudgel in at the front of the cave hurting the monster so much that it wriggled out through the back
Pig was not ready and when a flick of the Journey to the West snake's tail knocked him over he could not get back up he lay on the ground in agony
Seeing that the cave was now empty Monkey rushed round to the other side cudgel in hand to catch the monster
Monkey's shouts made Pig feel so ashamed that he pulled himself to his feet despite the pain and started lashing out wildly with his rake
At the sight of this Monkey said with a laugh What do you think you're hitting
The monster's got away I'm 'beating the grass to flush out the snake' Cretin said Monkey After it The two of them crossed a ravine where they saw the monster coiled up its head held high and its enormous mouth gaping wide
It was about to devour Pig who fled in terror
Monkey however went straight on towards it and was swallowed in a single gulp
Brother wailed Pig stamping his feet and beating his chest you've been destroyed Don't fret Pig called Monkey from inside the monster's belly which he was poking around with his cudgel
I'll make it into a bridge
Watch As he spoke the monster arched its back just like a rainbowshaped bridge
It looks like a bridge all right Pig shouted but nobody would ever dare cross it Then I'll make it turn into a boat said Monkey
Watch He pushed out the skin of the monster's belly with his cudgel and with the skin against the ground and its head uplifted it did look like a river boat
It may look like a boat said Pig but without a mast or sail it wouldn't sail very well in the wind Get out of the way then said Monkey and I'll make it sail for you He then jabbed his cudgel out as hard as he could through the monster's spine from the inside and made it stand some sixty or seventy feet high just like a mast
Struggling for its life and in great pain the monster shot forward faster than the wind going down the mountain and back the way it had come for over seven miles until it collapsed motionless in the dust It was dead
When Pig caught up with the monster he raised his rake and struck wildly at it
Monkey made a big hole in the monster's side crawled out and said Idiot It's dead and that's that
Why go on hitting it Brother Pig replied don't you realize that all my life I've loved killing dead snakes Only then did he put his rake away grab the snake's tail and start pulling it backwards
Meanwhile back at Tuoluo Village old Mr Li and the others were saying to the Tang Priest Your two disciples have been gone all night and they're not back yet They must be dead I'm sure that there can be no problem Sanzang replied
Let's go and look A moment later Monkey and Pig appeared chanting as they dragged an enormous python behind them
Only then did everyone feel happy
All the people in the village young and old male and female knelt down and bowed to Sanzang saying Good sirs this is the evil spirit that has been doing so much damage
Now that you have used your powers to behead the demon and rid us of this evil we will be able to live in peace again Everyone was very grateful and all the families invited them to meals as expressions of their gratitude keeping master and disciples there for six or seven days and only letting them go when they implored to be allowed to leave
As they would not accept money or any other gifts the villagers loaded parched grain and fruit on horses and mules hung with Journey to the West red rosettes and caparisoned with flags of many colours to see them on their way
From the five hundred households in the village some seven or eight hundred people set out with them
On the journey they were all very cheerful but before they reached Runny Persimmon Lane on Mount Seven Perfections Sanzang smelled the terrible stench and could see that their way was blocked
Wukong he said to Monkey how are we going to get through It's going to be hard replied Monkey covering his nose
When even Monkey said that it was going to be hard Sanzang began to weep
Don't upset yourself so my lord said old Mr Li and the other elders as they came up to him
We have all come here with you because we're already decided what to do As your illustrious disciples have defeated the evil spirit and rid the village of this evil we have all made up our minds to clear a better path for you over the mountain That's nonsense old man said Monkey with a grin
You told us before that the mountain is some  miles across You aren't Yu the Great's heavenly soldiers so how could you possibly make a path across it
If my master is to get across it'll have to be through our efforts
You'll never do it But how can we do it through our efforts Sanzang asked after dismounting
It'd certainly be hard to cross the mountain as it is now Monkey said still smiling and it would be even harder to cut a new path
We'll have to go by the old lane The only thing that worries me is that there may be nobody to provide the food What a thing to say venerable sir old Mr Li said We can support you gentlemen for as long as you care to stay here
You can't say that nobody will provide the food In that case go and prepare two hundredweight of parched grain as well as some steamed cakes and buns said Monkey
When our longsnouted monk has eaten his fill he'll turn into a giant boar and clear the old lane with his snout Then my master will be able to ride his horse over the mountain while we support him
He'll certainly get across Brother said Pig you want to keep all the rest of you clean
Why should I be the only one to stink Wuneng said Sanzang if you can clear the lane with your snout and get me across the mountain that will be a very great good deed to your credit Master benefactors please don't tease me said Pig with a smile
I can do thirtysix transformations If you ask me to become something that's light or delicate or beautiful or that flies I just can't
But ask me to turn into a mountain a tree a rock a mound of earth an elephant a hog a water buffalo or a camel and I can manage any of them
The only thing is that the bigger I make myself the bigger my belly gets
I can't do things properly unless it's full We've got plenty the people said We've got plenty We've brought parched grain fruit griddle cakes and ravioli We were going to give them to you when we'd made a path across the mountain They can all be brought out for you to eat now
When you've transformed yourself and started work we'll send some people back to prepare more food to send you on your way with Pig was beside himself with delight
Journey to the West Taking off his tunic and putting down his ninepronged rake he said to them all Don't laugh at me
Just watch while I win merit doing this filthy job The splendid idiot made a spell with his hands shook himself and turned himself into a giant hog
Indeed His snout was long his bristles short and half of him was fat As a piglet in the mountains he had fed on herbs and simples
Black was his face and his eyes as round as sun or moon The great ears on his head were just like plantain leaves
His bones he'd made so strong he would live as long as heaven His thick skin had been tempered till it was hard as iron
He grunted with a noise that came from a blockedup nose His gasping breath rasped harshly in his throat
Each of his four white trotters was a thousand feet high Every swordlike bristle was hundreds of yards in length
Since pigs were first kept and fattened by mankind Never had such a monster porker been seen as this today
The Tang Priest and the rest were full of admiration For Marshal Tian Peng and his magic powers
Seeing what Pig had turned into Brother Monkey asked the people who had come to see them off to pile up all the parched grain at once and told Pig to eat it
Not caring whether it was cooked or raw the idiot downed it all at one gulp then went forward to clear the way
Monkey told Friar Sand to take his sandals off and carry the luggage carefully and advised his master to sit firm in the carved saddle
Then he took off his own tall boots and told everyone else to go back
Could you be very kind and send some more food as soon as possible to keep my brother's strength up Of the seven or eight hundred who were seeing the pilgrims off most had come on mules or horse and they rushed back to the village like shooting stars
The three hundred who were on foot stood at the bottom of the mountain to watch the travelers as they went away
Now it was ten miles or more from the village to the mountain and another journey of over ten miles each way to fetch the food making over thirty in all so by the time they were back master and disciples were already far ahead of them
Not wanting to miss the pilgrims the villagers drove their mules and horses into the lane and carried on after them through the night only catching them up the next morning
Journey to the West Pilgrims they shouted wait a moment wait a moment sirs
We've brought food for you When Sanzang heard this he thanked them profusely said that they were good and faithful people and told Pig to rest and eat something to build up his strength
The idiot who was on the second day of clearing the way with his snout was by now ravenously hungry The villagers had brought much more than seven or eight hundredweight of food which he scooped up and devoured all at once not caring whether it was rice or wheat
When he had eaten his fill he went back to clearing the way while Sanzang Monkey and Friar Sand thanked the villagers and took leave of them
Indeed The peasants all went back to Tuoluo Village Across the mountain Pig had cleared the way
Sanzang's faith was backed up by great power Sun's demonquelling arts were on display
A thousand years of filth went in a single morning The Seven Perfections Lane was opened up today The dirt of six desires all now removed Towards the Lotus Throne they go to pray
If you don't know how much longer their journey was going to be or what evil monsters they would meet listen to the explanation in the next installment
In the Land of Purpuria the Tang Priest Discusses History Sun the Pilgrim in His Charity Offers to Be a Doctor When good is right all causes disappear Its fame is spread through all four continents
In the light of wisdom they climb the other shore Soughing dark clouds are blown from the edge of the sky
All the Buddhas give them help Sitting for ever on their thrones of jade
Journey to the West Smash the illusions of the human world Cease Cleanse the dirt provoke no misery
The story tells how Sanzang and his disciples cleaned the lane of its filth and pressed far ahead along the road Time passed quickly and the weather was scorching again
Indeed The begonias spread their globes of brocade Lotus leaves split their own green dishes
Fledgling swallows hide in the roadside willows Travelers wave their silken fans for relief from the heat
As they carried on their way a walled and moated city appeared before them
Reining in his horse Sanzang said Disciples can you see where this is You can't read Master Monkey exclaimed
How ever did you get the Tang Emperor to send you on this mission I have been a monk since I was a boy and read classics and scriptures by the thousand Sanzang replied
How could you say I can't read Well Monkey replied if you can why ask where we are instead of reading the big clear writing on the apricotyellow flag over the city wall Wretched ape Sanzang shouted you're talking nonsense
The flag is flapping much too hard in the wind for anyone to read what if anything is on it Then how could I read it Monkey asked
Don't rise to his bait Master Pig and Friar Sand said
From this distance we can't even see the walls and moat clearly never mind words in a banner But doesn't it say Purpuria Monkey asked
Purpuria must be a Western kingdom Sanzang said We shall have to present our passport Goes without saying Monkey observed
They were soon outside the city gates where the master dismounted crossed the bridge and went in through the triple gates It was indeed a splendid metropolis This is what could be seen
Journey to the West Lofty gatetowers Regular battlements Living waters flowing around Mountains facing to North and South
Many are the goods in the streets and markets And all the citizens do thriving business
This is a city fit for a monarch A capital endowed by heaven
To this distant realm come travelers by land and water Jade and silk abound in this remoteness
It is more beautiful than the distant ranges The palace rises to the purity of space
Closely barred are the passes leading here When peace and prosperity have lasted for ever
As master and disciples walked along the highways and through the markets they saw that the people were tall neatly dressed and well spoken Indeed they were not inferior to those of the Great Tang
When the traders who stood on either side of the road saw how ugly Pig was how tall and darkfeatured Friar Sand was and how hairy and widebrowed Monkey was they all dropped their business and came over to see them
Don't provoke trouble Sanzang called to them
Hold your heads down Pig obediently tucked his snout into his chest and Friar Sand did not dare look up
Monkey however stared all around him as he kept close to the Tang Priest
The more sensible people went away again after taking a look but the idlers the curious and the naughty children among the spectators jeered threw bricks and tiles at the strangers and mocked Pig
Whatever you do don't get into a row Sanzang said again in great anxiety
The idiot kept his head down
Before long they turned a corner and saw a gate in a wall over which was written HOSTEL OF MEETING in large letters
We are going into this government office Sanzang said Why Monkey asked
The Hostel of Meeting is a place where people from all over the world are received so we can go and disturb them said Sanzang Let's rest there
When I have seen the king and presented our passport we can leave the Journey to the West city and be on our way again When Pig heard this he brought his snout out so terrifying the people following behind that dozens of them collapsed
The master's right said Pig stepping forward Let's shelter inside there and get away from these damned mockers They went inside after which the people began to disperse
There were two commissioners in the hostel a senior one and his assistant and they were in the hall checking over their personnel before going to receive an official when to their great consternation the Tang Priest suddenly appeared Who are you they asked together
Who are you
Where are you going I have been sent by His Majesty the Tang Emperor to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven the Tang Priest replied putting his hands together in front of his chest
Having reached your illustrious country I did not dare to try to sneak through I would like to submit my passport for inspection so that we may be allowed to continue our way
Meanwhile we would like to rest in your splendid hostel When the two commissioners heard this they dismissed their subordinates put on their full official dress and went down from the main hall to greet the visitors
They instructed that the guest rooms be tidied up for them to sleep in and ordered vegetarian provisions for them
Sanzang thanked them and the two officials led their staff out of the hall
Some of their attendants invited the visitors to sleep in the guest rooms
Sanzang went with them but Monkey complained bitterly Damned cheek
Why won't they let me stay in the main hall The people here don't come under the jurisdiction of our Great Tang and they have no connections with our country either Besides their superiors often come to stay
It is difficult for them to entertain us In that case Monkey replied I insist on them entertaining us properly As they were talking the manager brought their provisions a dish each of white rice and wheat flour two cabbages four pieces of beancurd two pieces of wheat gluten a dish of dried bamboo shoots and a dish of treeear fungus
Sanzang told his disciples to receive the provisions and thanked the manager
There's a clean cookingstove in the Western room the manager said and it's easy to light the firewood in it
Would you please cook your own food May I ask you if the king is in the palace Sanzang asked
His Majesty has not attended court for a long time the manager replied But today is an auspicious one and he is discussing the issue of a notice with his civil and military officials
You'd better hurry if you want to get there in time to submit your passport to him
Tomorrow will be too late to do it and goodness knows how long you'll have to wait Wukong said Sanzang you three prepare the meal while I hurry there to have our passport inspected
After we have eaten we can be on our way Pig quickly unpacked the cassock and passport for Sanzang who dressed himself and set out for the palace instructing his disciples not to leave the hostel or make trouble
Before long the Tang Priest was outside the Tower of Five Phoenixes at the outer palace gate
The towering majesty of the halls and the splendor of the tall buildings and terraces beggared description
When he reached the main Southern gate he requested the reporting officer to announce to the court his wish to have his Journey to the West passport inspected
The eunuch officer at the gate went to the steps of the throne where he submitted the following memorial There is a monk at the palace gate sent by the Great Tang in the East to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures at the Thunder Monastery in the Western Heaven He wishes to submit his passport for approval
I await Your Majesty's command When the king heard this he replied happily For a long time we have been too ill to sit on our throne
Today we are in the throne room to issue a notice sending for doctors and now a distinguished monk has arrived in our country He ordered that the monk be summoned to the steps of the throne
Sanzang abased himself in reverence
The king then summoned him into the throne room invited him to sit down and ordered the department of foreign relations to arrange a vegetarian meal
Sanzang thanked the king for his kindness and presented his passport When he had read it through the king said with great delight Master of the Law how many dynasties have ruled in your land of Great Tang
How many generations of wise ministers have there been
After what illness did the Tang emperor come back to life so that he sent you on this long and difficult journey to fetch the scriptures On being asked all these questions the venerable elder bowed put his hands together and said In my country The Three Emperors ruled The Five Rulers established morality
Yao and Shun took the throne Yu and Tang gave the people peace
Many were the offspring of Chengzhou Who each established their own states Bullying the weak with their own strength Dividing the realm and proclaiming themselves rulers
Eighteen such lords of local states Divided the territory up to the borders
Later they became a dozen Bringing peace to the cosmic order
But those who had no chariots of war Were swallowed up by others
Journey to the West When the seven great states contended Six of them had to surrender to Qin
Heaven gave birth to Liu Bang and Xiang Yu Each of whom cherished wicked ideas
The empire then belonged to Han According to the stipulations agreed between the two
Power passed from Han to the Sima clan Till Jin in its turn fell into chaos
Twelve states ruled in North and South Among them Song Qi Liang and Chen
Emperors ruled in succession to each other Till the Great Sui restored the true unity Then it indulged in evil and wickedness
Inflicting misery on the common people
Our present rulers the House of Li Have given the name of Tang to the state Since the High Ancestor passed on the throne The reigning monarch has been Li Shimin
The rivers have run clear and the seas been calm Thanks to his great virtue and his benevolence
North of the city of Chang'an Lived a wicked river dragon Who gave the timely rain in short measure For which he deserved to pay with his death
One night he came in a dream to the emperor Asking the monarch to spare his life
Journey to the West The emperor promised to grant a pardon And sent for his wise minister early next day
He kept him there inside the palace Filling his time with a long game of chess
But at high noon the minister Slept and in a dream cut off the dragon's head On hearing this the king groaned and asked Master of the Law which country did that wise minister come from He was our emperor's prime minister Wei Zheng astrologer geographer master of the Yin and Yang and one of the great founders and stabilizers of our state Sanzang explained
Because he beheaded the Dragon King of the Jing River in his dream the dragon brought a case in the Underworld against our emperor for having him decapitated after granting a pardon The emperor became very ill and his condition was critical
Wei Zhang wrote him a letter to take to the Underworld and give to Cui Jue the judge of Fengdu
Soon after that the emperor died only to come back to life on the third day
It was thanks to Wei Zheng that Judge Cui was persuaded to alter a document and give His Majesty an extra twenty years of life
He held a great Land and Water Mass and dispatched me on this long journey to visit many lands worship the Buddha and fetch the Three Stores of Mahayana scriptures that will raise all the sufferers from evil up to Heaven At this the king groaned and sighed again
Yours is indeed a heavenly dynasty and a great nation he said with a just ruler and wise ministers
We have long been ill but not one minister do we have who will save us On hearing this the venerable elder stole a glance at the king and saw that his face was sallow and emaciated his appearance was going to pieces and his spirits were very low
The venerable elder was going to ask him some questions when an official of the department of Foreign relations came to invite the Tang Priest to eat
The king ordered that his food should be set out with Sanzang's in the Hall of Fragrance so that he could eat with the Master of the Law
Thanking the king for his kindness Sanzang took his meal with him
Meanwhile back in the Hostel of Meeting Brother Monkey told Friar Sand to prepare the tea the grain and the vegetarian dishes
There's no problem about the tea and the rice Friar Sand said but the vegetable dishes will be difficult Why Monkey asked
There's no oil salt soya sauce or vinegar Friar Sand replied
I've got a few coins here Monkey said so we can send Pig out to buy them I wouldn't dare said the idiot who was feeling too lazy to go
My ugly mug could cause trouble and then the master would blame me Journey to the West If you buy the stuff at a fair price and don't try to get it by asking for alms or theft there couldn't possibly by any trouble said Brother Monkey
Didn't you see the commotion just now asked Pig
I only showed my snout outside the gate and about a dozen of them collapsed with fright
Goodness only knows how many I'd scare to death in a busy shopping street Well said Monkey as you know so much about the busy shopping streets did you notice what was being sold in them No said Pig
The master told me to keep my head down and cause no trouble Honest I didn't see anything I won't need to tell you about the bars grain merchants mills silk shops and grocers said Monkey
But there are marvellous teahouses and noodle shops selling big sesame buns and steamed bread You can buy terrific soup rice spices and vegetables in the restaurants Then there are all the exotic cakes yogurts snacks rolls fries and honey sweets Any number of goodies
Shall I go out and buy you some This description had the idiot drooling the saliva gurgled in his throat
Brother he said jumping to his feet I'll let you pay this time
Next time I'm in the money I'll treat you Friar Sand said Monkey hiding his amusement cook the rice while I go out to buy some other ingredients Realizing that Monkey was only fooling the idiot Friar Sand agreed Off you go he said
Buy plenty and have a good feed Grabbing a bowl and a dish the idiot went out with Monkey
Where are you reverend gentlemen going two officials asked him
To buy some groceries Monkey replied
Go West along this street turn at the drum tower and you'll be at Zheng's grocery they said You can buy as much oil salt soya sauce vinegar ginger pepper and tea as you like there they've got them all The two of them headed West along the road hand in hand
Monkey went past several teahouses and restaurants but did not buy any of the things on sale or eat any of the food
Brother called Pig why don't we make do with what we can buy here This was the last thing that Monkey who had only been fooling him intended to do
My dear brother he said you don't know how to get a good bargain
If we go a little further you can choose bigger ones As the two of them were talking a lot of people followed jostling behind them
Before long they reached the drum tower where a huge and noisy crowd was pushing and shoving and filling the whole road
I'm not going any further brother said Pig when he saw this
From the way they're shouting they sound as though they're out to catch monks And we're suspiciouslooking strangers What'll we do if they arrest us Stop talking such nonsense said Monkey
We monks haven't broken the law so monkcatchers would have no reason to arrest us
Let's carry on and buy the ingredients we need at Zheng's Journey to the West No said Pig never I'm not going to ask for trouble
If I try to squeeze through that crowd and my ears get pulled out to their full length they'll collapse with fright Several of them might get trampled to death and it would cost me my life Very well then said Monkey
You stand at the foot of this wall while I go and buy the things
I'll bring you back some wheaten cakes The idiot handed the bowl and dish to Monkey then stood with his back to the crowd and his snout against the foot of the wall He would not have moved for anything in the world
When Monkey reached the drum tower he found that the crowds really were very dense
As he squeezed his way through them he heard people saying that a royal proclamation had been posted at the tower this was what all the people were struggling to see
Monkey pushed forward till he was close to it then opened wide his fiery eyes with golden pupils to read it carefully This is what was written We the King of Purpuria in the Western Continent of Cattlegift from the beginning of our reign gave peace to the four quarters and tranquillity to the people
Recently the state's misfortunes have confined us to our bed with a chronic illness that has continued for a very long time
Recovery has proved impossible and the many excellent prescriptions of our country's Royal College of Medicine have not yet effected a cure
We hereby issue an invitation to all experts in medicine and pharmacy among the wise men of the world whether from the North or the East from China or from foreign countries to ascend to the throne hall and heal our sickness in the event of a recovery we will give half our kingdom
This is no empty promise All those who can offer cures should come to this notice
When Monkey had read this he exclaimed with delight As they used to say in the old days 'Make a move and your fortune's one third made' I was wrong to stay put in the hostel
There's no need to buy groceries and fetching the scriptures can wait for a day while I go and have a bit of fun as a doctor The splendid Great Sage bent low got rid of the bowl and dish took a pinch of dust threw it into the air said the words of a spell and made himself invisible
He then went up to the notice quietly took it down and blew towards the Southeast with a magic breath Immediately a whirlwind arose that scattered all the people there
Monkey then went straight back to where Pig was standing his nose propped against the foot of the wall as if he were fast asleep
Brother Monkey folded the notice up slipped it inside the lapel of Pig's tunic without disturbing him turned and went back to the hostel
As soon as the whirlwind started blowing all the people in the crowd at the foot of the drum tower covered their heads and shut their eyes never imagining that when the wind fell the royal proclamation would have disappeared They were horrorstruck
That morning twelve palace eunuchs and twelve guards officers had come out to post it and now it had been blown away after less than six hours In fear and trembling the people searched all around for it until a piece of paper was spotted sticking out of Pig's lapel
So you took the proclamation down did you they asked going up to him
Looking up with a start the idiot thrust his nose up at them making the guards officers stagger about and collapse with terror He turned to flee only to be grabbed by several bold spirits who blocked his way
You've taken down the royal proclamation inviting doctors so you're coming to the palace to cure His Majesty they said Where else d'you think you're going I'm your son if I tore the poster down said Pig in panic
I'd be your grandson if I could cure disease Journey to the West What's that sticking out of your tunic one of the officers asked
Only then did the idiot look down and see that there really was a piece of paper there
Opening it he ground his teeth and swore That macaque is trying to get me killed He gave an angry roar and was just about to tear it up when they all stopped him
You're a dead man they said
That's a proclamation His Majesty issued today How dare you tear it up
As you've put it in your tunic you're no doubt a brilliant doctor
Come with us at once You don't understand shouted Pig
It wasn't me that took it down It was my fellow disciple Sun Wukong
He sneaked it into my tunic then abandoned me
We'll all have to go and find him to get to the bottom of this Nonsense they said
We've got a bell herewe're not going off to play one that's still being cast You can say what you like
Drag him off to see His Majesty Not bothering to get to the truth of the matter they pushed and pulled the idiot who stood his ground as firmly as if he had taken root there
Over ten of them tried to move him without any success You've got no respect said Pig
If you go on pulling at me and make me lose my temper I'll go berserk and don't blame me then It had not taken long for this commotion to stir up the whole neighbourhood and Pig was now surrounded
Two elderly palace eunuchs in the crowd said You look very odd and you sound wrong too
Where are you from you ruffian We're pilgrims sent from the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven Pig replied
My master is the younger brother of the Tang emperor and a Master of the Law He's just gone to the palace to hand his passport over for inspection
I came here with my brother disciple to buy some groceries but there were so many people by the tower that I was scared to go any further He told me to wait here
When he saw the proclamation he made a whirlwind took it down sneaked it into my tunic and went away We did see a monk with a plump white face going in through the palace gates one of the eunuchs said
Perhaps that was your master Yes yes said Pig
Where did your fellow disciple go the eunuch asked
There are four of us altogether said Pig When the master went to present his passport the other three of us stayed with our luggage and our horse in the Hostel of Meeting
My brother's played a trick on me and gone back there ahead of me Let go of him officers the eunuch said
We'll all go to the hostel together and find out what's really happening You two ladies are very sensible said Pig
Monk you don't know about anything said the officers
How can you address gentlemen as ladies You're shameless laughed Pig You've made them change sex
Fancy calling these two old females gentlemen instead of women or ladies That's enough of your insolence they all said
Find your fellow disciple at once Journey to the West The noisy crowd in the street which was not to be numbered in mere hundreds carried him to the hostel gates
Don't come any further gentlemen Pig said
My brother won't let you make a fool of him the way I do
He's a ferocious and serious character
When you meet him you'll have to bow deeply to him and call him 'Lord Sun' then he'll look after you
If you don't he'll turn nasty and this business will fail To this the eunuchs and officers replied If your brother really has the power to cure our king he'll be given half the country and we will all bow to him The idlers were still making a commotion outside the hostel gates as Pig led the eunuchs and officers straight inside where Monkey could be heard laughing with pleasure as he told Friar Sand about how he had taken the proclamation down
Pig went up to him grabbed him and yelled Why won't you act like a man
You said you'd buy me noodles buns and steamed bread to lure me out but it was only an empty promise
Then you made a whirlwind took down the royal proclamation and sneakily put it in my tunic You made a real idiot of me
What kind of brother are you Idiot laughed Monkey you must have got lost and gone the wrong way
I couldn't find you when I rushed back from buying the groceries the other side of the drum tower so I came back ahead
Where did I tear any royal proclamations down The officials who were guarding it are here said Pig
Before he had finished speaking the eunuchs and officers came up bowed low and said Lord Sun His Majesty is very fortunate today as Heaven has sent you down to us
We are sure that you will display your great skill and give him the benefit of your outstanding medical knowledge
If you cure our king you will receive half the country and half the state On hearing this Monkey composed his face took the proclamation from Pig and said I suppose you are the officials who were guarding the notice We slaves are eunuchs in the Bureau of Ritual said the eunuchs kowtowing and these gentlemen are officers in the royal guard I did take the royal proclamation down Monkey said and I used my younger brother to bring you here
So your lord is ill As the saying goes 'Don't sell medicine carelessly and don't send for any old doctor when you're ill' Tell your king to come here and ask me himself to help him I can get rid of his illness at a touch This shocked all the eunuchs
That is very big talk so you must be a man of great breadth of spirit the officers said
Half of us will remain here to press the invitation in silence while the other half go back to the palace to report Four of the eunuchs and six of the guards officers went straight into the palace without waiting to be summoned and said at the steps of the throne room Congratulations Your Majesty When the king who was in the middle of a cultivated conversation with Sanzang after their meal together heard this he asked What on When we your slaves took out Your Majesty's proclamation sending for doctors this morning and posted it at the foot of the drum tower a holy monk from Great Tang in the East took it down they replied
He is now in the Hostel of Meeting and wants Your Majesty to go in person to ask his help He can get rid of illness at a touch
That is why we have come to submit this report Journey to the West This news delighted the king
How many distinguished disciples do you have Master of the Law he asked
Putting his hands together in front of his chest Sanzang replied I have three stupid followers Which of them is a medical expert the king asked
To be frank with Your Majesty Sanzang replied they are all country bumpkins fit only for carrying baggage leading the horse finding their way along streams or leading me over mountains and rivers In dangerous places they can defeat monsters capture demons and subdue tigers and dragons
None of them knows anything about medicines Aren't you being too hard on them the king asked
It was very fortunate that you came to court when we entered the throne hall this morning this was surely destined by Heaven
If your disciple knows nothing about medicine why would he have taken down our proclamation and demanded that we go to greet him in person
He must surely be a great physician He then called Civilian and military officers we are much too weak to ride in our carriage
You must all leave the palace and go on our behalf to invite the Venerable Sun to treat our disease
When you meet him you must on no account show him any disrespect
You must address him as 'Holy monk Venerable Sun' and treat him with the deference due to your own sovereign Having received these orders the officials went straight to the Hostel of Meeting with the eunuchs and guards officers responsible for the proclamation There they arranged themselves in their companies to kowtow to Monkey
Pig was so frightened that he hid in the wing while Friar Sand slipped behind the wall
Just look at the Great Sage sitting solemnly and unmoving in the middle of the room
That macaque is really asking to have his head cut off Pig thought resentfully
All those officials bowing to him and he's not bowing back or standing up either Soon afterwards when the rituals had been performed the officials addressed Monkey as if he were their monarch
We report to the holy monk the Venerable Sun that we officials of the Kingdom of Purpuria have come at the command of our king to do respectful homage to the holy monk and invite him to the palace to treat our sick king Only then did Brother Monkey stand up and reply Why hasn't your king come His Majesty is too weak to ride in his carriage the officials all replied which is why he ordered us to pay homage to you holy monk as if you were our sovereign kowtow to you and invite you to come In that case said Monkey will you gentlemen please lead the way
I'll follow you The officials then formed themselves into a column in accordance with their ranks and set out
Monkey tidied his clothes and got to his feet
Brother said Pig whatever you do don't drag us in I won't Monkey replied provided you two accept the medicine for me What medicine Friar Sand asked
You must accept all the medicine people send me Monkey replied
I'll collect it when I come back The two of them undertook this commission
Journey to the West Monkey was soon at the palace with the officials who went in first to inform the king He raised high the curtains of pearls flashed his dragon and phoenix eyes opened his golden mouth and spoke majestically Which gentleman is the holy monk the Venerable Sun Taking a step forward Monkey shouted at the top of his voice I am The voice was so ugly and the face so hideous that the king fell back on his dragon throne
In their alarm the female officials and the palace eunuchs helped him to the inner quarters
He's terrified His Majesty to death they said
Monk all the officials said angrily to Monkey how could you be so rough and crude
Why did you dare take the proclamation down When Brother Monkey heard this he replied with a smile You shouldn't be angry with me
If you're going to be so rude to me your king won't get better in a thousand years But how long does human life last the officials asked How is it that he won't get better even in a thousand years He's a sick ruler now said Monkey
When he dies he'll be a sick ghost and whenever he's reincarnated he'll be a sick man again That's why he won't get better even in a thousand years You've got no sense of respect at all the infuriated officials replied
How dare you talk such nonsense It's not nonsense Monkey laughed Listen and I'll explain Mysterious indeed are the principles of medicine Flexibility of mind is a quality required Use eyes and ears ask questions take the pulses Omit but one and the examination's incomplete
First look for outward signs of the patient's vital energy Smooth Active Does he sleep well
Secondly listen to whether the voice is clear or harsh Determine if the words he speaks are true or crazed
Third you must ask how long the disease has lasted And how the patient eats drinks and relieves himself
Journey to the West Fourth feel the pulses and be clear about the veins Are they deep shallow external or inside
Should I not look and listen ask questions and take the pulses Never in all his days will the king be well again In the ranks of the civil and military officials there were some fellows of the Royal College of Medicine who when they heard these words praised Monkey publicly The monk is right
Even a god or an immortal would have to look listen ask questions and take the pulses before treating a patient successfully with his divine gifts All the officials agreed with these remarks then went up to the king and submitted
The reverend gentleman wishes to look listen ask questions and take the pulses before he can prescribe properly Send him away the king said over and over again as he lay on his dragon bed
We cannot bear to see any strangers His attendants then came out from the inner quarters and announced Monk His Majesty commands that you go away
He cannot bear to see a stranger If he won't see a stranger Monkey replied I know the art of taking the pulses with hanging threads That is something of which we have only heard exclaimed all the officials concealing their delight but that we have never seen with our own eyes
Please go back in and submit another report The personal attendants then went back into the inner quarters and reported Your Majesty the Venerable Sun can take your pulses with hanging threads
he does not need to see Your Majesty's face At this the king reflected In the three years we have been ill we have never tried this technique
Send him in At once the courtiers in attendance announced His Majesty has consented to pulsetaking by the hanging threads Send the Venerable Sun to the inner quarters at once to make his diagnosis Monkey then entered the throne hall where the Tang Priest met him with abuse Wretched ape
You will be the death of me My good master Monkey replied with a smile I'm bringing you credit
How can you say I'll be the death of you In all the years you've been with me Sanzang shouted I have never seen you cure a single person
You know nothing about the nature of drugs and you have never studied medical books
How can you be so reckless and bring this disaster on us You don't realize Master said Monkey with a smile that I do know the odd herbal remedy and can treat serious illnesses
I guarantee I can cure him Even if the treatment kills him I'll only be guilty of manslaughter through medical incompetence That's not a capital offence What are you afraid of There's nothing to worry Journey to the West about nothing
You sit here and see what my pulse diagnosis is like How can you talk all this rubbish Sanzang asked when you have never read the Plain Questions the Classic of Difficulties the Pharmacopoeia and the Mysteries of the Pulses or studied the commentaries to them
How could you possibly diagnose his pulses by hanging threads I've got golden threads on me that you've never seen Monkey replied putting out his hand to pull three hairs from his tail hold them in a bunch call Change and turn them into three golden threads each twentyfour feet long to match the twentyfour periods of the solar year
Holding these in his hand he said to the Tang Priest These are golden threads aren't they Stop talking reverend gentleman said the eunuchs in attendance on the king
Please come inside and make your diagnosis Taking his leave of the Tang Priest Monkey followed the attendants into the inner quarters to see his patient
Indeed The heart has a secret prescription that will save a country The hidden and wonderful spell gives eternal life
If you do not know what illness was diagnosed or what medicines were used and wish to learn the truth listen to the explanation in the next installment
The Heart's Master Prepares Medicine in the Night The Monarch Discusses a Demon at the Banquet The story tells how the Great Sage Sun went with the eunuchs in attendance on the king to the inner quarters of the palace and stood outside the doors of the royal bedchamber Handing the three golden threads to the eunuchs to take inside he gave them these instructions
Tell the queens and consorts of the inner palace or the eunuchs in personal attendance to fasten these threads to His Majesty's left wrist at the inch the bar and the cubit then pass them out of the window to me The eunuchs did as he said asking the king to sit on his dragon bed while they fastened one end of the golden threads to the inch the bar and the cubit and passed the other ends outside
Monkey took these ends and first held the end of one between the thumb and the forefinger of his right hand and felt the pulse at the inch point
He held the next against his middle finger and felt the pulse at the bar and then pressed his thumb against his third finger and felt the cubit pulse
Next he regulated his own breathing to examine the four functions the five depressions the seven exterior and eight interior symptoms the nine tempers the deep pulses within the floating ones and the floating ones within the deep ones
He thus determined the insufficiencies and excesses of the functioning of organs then told the eunuchs to take the threads off the king's left wrist and fasten them to the same points on the right wrist
He felt the threads one by one with the fingers of his left hand
Journey to the West With a shake he put the golden threads back on his body and shouted at the top of his voice Your Majesty the inch pulse on your left wrist is strong and tense the bar pulse is sluggish and tardy and the cubit is hollow and deep
On your right wrist the inch is floating and slippery the bar is slow and knotted and the cubit is frequent and firm
The left inch being strong and tense means that you have an internal emptiness and pains in the heart
The left bar being sluggish and tardy shows that you sweat and that your muscles feel numb
The hollowness and depth of the cubit suggest red urine and bloody stools
The floating slippery inch pulse on the right wrist shows internal accumulations and blocked channels
The bar being slow and knotted is from indigestion and retained drinking
The frequency and wiriness of the cubit shows a chronic opposition of irritable fullness and empty coldness
My diagnosis of Your Majesty's ailment is that you are suffering from alarm and worry
The condition is the one known as the 'pair of birds parted' When the king heard this inside his chamber he was so delighted that his spirits revived and he shouted in reply You have understood my illness through your fingers That is indeed my trouble
Please go out and fetch some medicine Monkey walked slowly out of the inner palace by when the eunuchs watching him had already given the news to everyone
When Monkey emerged a moment later the Tang Priest asked him how it had gone
I made a diagnosis from his pulses Monkey said
I now have to prepare the medicine for his condition All the officials then came forward to ask Holy monk reverend sir what is the 'pair of birds parted' condition of which you spoke just now It's when a cock bird and a hen who were flying together are suddenly separated by a violent storm replied Monkey with a smile The hen misses the cock and the cock misses the hen
Isn't that 'a pair of birds parted' At this the officials all cried out over and over again in admiration
He really is a holy monk
He really is a divine doctor You have diagnosed the condition said one of the fellows of the Royal College of Medicine but what drugs will you use to treat it There's no need to stick to prescriptions said Monkey
I'll choose the drugs when I see them According to the medical classic There are  varieties of medicine and  varieties of sickness' said the fellows of the Royal College of Medicine
How can it be right to use all the medicines when one person does not have all the ailments
You can't just choose your drugs on sight To this Monkey replied The ancients said 'In preparing medicines do not stick rigidly to the formulae use them as appropriate' That's why I've asked for the full range of pharmaceutical materials so that I can make adjustments as I need to The fellows of the Royal College could say no more to this but went out through the palace gates and sent those of the college's staff who were on duty to tell all the pharmacies in the city whether selling raw materials or prepared drugs to send three pounds of each to Monkey
This is no place for preparing medicine said Monkey All the medicines and a set of pharmacist's utensils must be sent to the Hostel of Meeting and handed over to my two fellow disciples The fellows did as they were told
Three pounds of each of the  ingredients of medicine together with pharmacist's rollers handmills sieves mortars bowls pestles and the like were all sent to the hostel handed over and received
Monkey went back into the throne hall and asked his master to return to the hostel with him while he prepared the medicine
Sanzang was just getting up to go when the king sent a command from the inner quarters that Journey to the West the Master of the Law was to stay behind and spend the night in the Hall of Literary Splendor the next morning after taking the medicine and recovering from his illness the king would reward them inspect the passport and send them on their way Sanzang was horrified
Disciple he said he means to keep me here as a hostage
If he is cured he will be happy to send us on our way but if the treatment fails my life is over
You must be very careful and pay full attention when preparing the medicine Don't worry Master Monkey said with a smile Enjoy yourself here
I'm a superb doctor Taking his leave of Sanzang and of all the officials the splendid Great Sage went straight back to the hostel where Pig welcomed him with a grin
Brother he said I know what you're up to What Monkey asked If fetching the scriptures doesn't come off you'll be left without any capital to start up a business Pig replied
Now you've seen how prosperous this place is you're planning to open a chemist's shop here Don't talk nonsense shouted Monkey
When I've cured the king I'll use my success to leave the court and be on our way I'm not going to be running a chemist's Well said Pig if you're not opening a shop why get three pounds of each of  different ingredients to treat one man How much of it will you need
How many years will it take for him to finish the lot He'll never finish that much Monkey replied
The fellows of their Royal College of Medicine are a load of idiots The only reason why I sent for so many ingredients was to baffle them and stop them knowing which ones I'm going to use
Then they won't be able to find out what my miraculous prescription is As they were talking two of the hostel staff came in and fell to their knees before them to say We beg the holy monks and reverend gentlemen to partake of their evening repast This morning you treated us rather differently said Monkey so why go on your knees to invite us now When you first came my lords the hostel orderlies replied we were too blind to recognize your illustrious faces
Now we have heard how you are using your outstanding medical powers to treat our king If His Majesty recovers his health he will share the kingdom with you so we'll all be your subjects
So it's only proper for us to kowtow to you and to invite you politely to eat On hearing this Monkey cheerfully took the place of honour while Pig and Friar Sand sat to his left and right
As the vegetarian meal was served Friar Sand asked Where's our master brother The king's kept him as a hostage Monkey replied When the king's cured he'll regard us and send us on our way Is he being well looked after Friar Sand continued
His host's a king Monkey replied so of course he's in luxury
When I went there he had three senior ministers looking after him and he was invited into the Hall of Literary Splendor In that case said Pig the master's still doing much better than us
He's got ministers looking after him and we've only got a couple of hostel orderlies to serve us
So I'm going to forget about him and eat a good meal Journey to the West Thus the three of them enjoyed their meal at ease
It was now late
Tidy the dishes away Monkey said to the hostel orderlies and fetch me plenty of oil and candles
The best time for us to make up the medicine will be in the quiet of the night The orderlies brought oil and candles as instructed and were then dismissed
In the still silence of the middle of the night Pig asked Brother what medicines are we going to make Let's get on with it
I need my shuteye Get an ounce of rhubarb and grind it to a fine powder with a roller said Brother Monkey
Rhubarb has a bitter taste and a cold nature and isn't noxious said Friar Sand
Its nature is deep not superficial it's an active medicine not a defensive one
It removes stagnations and clears obstructions settles disorder and brings about peace and they call it 'the general' It's a cathartic drug
But perhaps it's wrong for someone in an empty weakened state after a long illness There's something you don't know brother Monkey said
This drug helps phlegm makes the vital forces travel smoothly and calms the heat and cold that become congested in the stomach Just leave me alone and fetch me an ounce of croton seeds
Shell them peel them hammer the poisonous oil out of them then grind them to a fine powder with a roller Croton seed is acrid hot by nature and poisonous said Pig
It cuts away hard accumulations deals with submerged cold in the lungs and bowels and clears obstructions
It smooths the way for water and grain
It's a warrior for storming passes and gates
You must be very careful how you use it Brother Monkey replied what you don't understand is that this is a drug that destroys knots opens the intestine and can cure swelling of the heart and dropsy
Hurry up and get it ready
And I'll want an adjuvant to back it up The two of them started work on grinding the two drugs to a fine powder You'll need dozens more brother they said so which'll they be That's all Monkey replied
But you've got three pounds of each of  different medicinal ingredients Pig said
If all you're going to use is two ounces you've been making a fool of these people Monkey then produced a patterned porcelain dish and said Stop talking brothers Take this dish and fill it half full with soot scraped from a cooking pot Whatever for Pig asked
I need it for the medicine Monkey replied
I never heard of soot from a cooking pot being used in medicine said Friar Sand
It's called 'frost on the flowers' said Monkey and it helps treat all kinds of illness
Didn't you know that The idiot then scraped off half a dishful and ground it up to a fine powder
Monkey then handed him another dish and said Now fetch me half a dishful of our horse's piss What for Pig asked
Journey to the West To make the medicine up into pills with Monkey replied
Brother said Friar Sand with a smile this is no joking matter
Horse piss stinks You can't use it in medicine
I've only seen vinegar paste old rice paste refined honey and clean water used for making pills Who ever heard of horse piss used to make pills It's got a terrible stink
Anyone with a weak spleen would throw up at the first sniff
If he goes on and takes the rhubarb and croton seeds he'll be vomiting at one end and having the runs at the other
That'll be no joke You don't know the inside story said Monkey
That horse of ours is no ordinary horse He used to be a dragon in the Western Ocean
If he'll give us some of his piss it'll cure any illness you could have
My only worry is that he might refuse When Pig heard this he went and stood beside the horse who was lying down asleep
The idiot kicked the horse till he got to his feet then pressed himself against the horse's stomach for a very long time but without seeing any sign of piss
He ran back to Monkey to say Brother never mind about treating the king Hurry up and cure the horse He's done for he's dried right up
There's no way we're going to get a drop of piss out of him I'll go with you smiled Monkey
I'll come and have a look too said Friar Sand
When the three of them reached the horse he started to jump about and shout in human language at the top of his voice How can you be so ignorant brother
I used to be a flying dragon in the Western Ocean The Bodhisattva Guanyin saved me after I'd offended against the Heavenly Code She sawed off my horns removed my scales and turned me into a horse to carry the master to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures This way I'll be able to redeem my crimes
If I pissed into any river I was crossing the fish in the water would drink it and turn into dragons
The grass on any mountain we were going over that got a taste of it would become magic fungus for immortal boys to gather and give themselves eternal life
So of course I can't casually drop it in a vulgar worldly place like this Watch your words brother said Monkey
This is the city of a Western king not some vulgar worldly place You wouldn't be casually dropping it here
As the saying goes many hands make light work
We've got to cure the king
When we do we'll all be covered in glory
If we fail I'm afraid we won't be able to leave this country with any credit Wait a moment the horse finally said
Look at him as he springs forward then squats back on his haunches grinds his teeth noisily and only with the greatest strain manages to squeeze out a few drops before standing up again What a deadbeat said Pig
You could give us a few more even if they were drops of gold Seeing that the dish was now about a third full Monkey said That'll do that'll do
Take it away Only then did Friar Sand feel cheerful
The three of them then returned to the main hall mixed the piss with the ingredients that had already been prepared and rolled the mixture into three large round balls
They're too big brothers said Monkey
They're only walnutsized Pig replied
That wouldn't be enough for a single mouthful if I were taking them The three disciples then put the pills into a large box and went to bed fully dressed
It was soon dawn and despite his sickness the king held court asking the Tang Priest to come to see him and sending all his officials straight to the Hostel of Meeting to pay their respects to the holy monk the Venerable Journey to the West Sun and fetch the medicine
When the officials reached the hostel they prostrated themselves before Brother Monkey with the words His Majesty has sent us to pay our respects and fetch the miraculous medicine Monkey told Pig to fetch the box which he opened and handed to the officials
What is this medicine called they asked
We would like to be able to inform His Majesty when we see him It's called Black Gold Elixir Monkey replied at which Pig and Friar Sand had to hide their grins as they thought of course they're black goldthey were made with soot scraped off cooking pots What should be taken with the pills to guide them on their way the officials asked
There are two kinds of guide that can be taken with them Monkey replied
One's easily got hold of That is a decoction of six ingredients to be taken as a hot potion What six ingredients the officials asked
A fart from a flying crow Monkey replied piss from a carp in a fastflowing stream some of the facepowder used by the Queen Mother of the West soot from elixir refined in Lord Lao's furnace three pieces of a wornout head cloth of the Jade Emperor's and five whiskers from a trapped dragon's beard
A decoction of those six ingredients taken with the pills would clear up your king's illness straight away When the officials heard this they replied Those are things that are not to be found in this world so please tell us what the other guide is The pills should be taken with rootless water said Monkey
That's very easily got hold of smiled the officials
How can you be so sure Monkey asked
We have a saying here the officials replied that if you need rootless water you take a bowl or a dish to a well or a stream fill it with water and hurry back with it
Don't spill a drop don't look behind you and give it to the patient to take with the medicine But well water and stream water both have roots Monkey said
The rootless water I'm talking about has to fall from the sky and be drunk before it touches the ground Only then can it be called rootless That's easily got too the officials said
The medicine shouldn't be taken till the next cloudy wet day The officials then kowtowed to thank Monkey and took the medicine back with them to present to the king who delightedly ordered his attendants to bring it to him What are these pills he asked when he saw them
The holy monk says they are Black Gold Elixir and have to be taken with rootless water the officials replied
The king then sent some of his palace women to fetch rootless water
Journey to the West The holy monk says that rootless water can't be got from wells or streams the officials said
It has to be water that has come down from the sky and not yet touched the ground The king then ordered his aides to issue a decree inviting magicians to summon rain
The officials then issued a proclamation as the king had ordered
Back in the hall of the Hostel of Meeting Brother Monkey said to Pig He must be given some rain now so he can take his medicine This is very urgent How are we going to get some
I reckon he's a very virtuous and worthy king so why don't we help him get a little rainwater to take his medicine with But how are we going to help him get some rootless water Pig asked
Stand on my left and be my Sustainer Star Monkey said to him then told Friar Sand stand on my right as my Straightener Star while I help him to get some rootless water The splendid Great Sage then paced out a magic pattern and said the words of a spell
Soon a dark cloud appeared to their East that came closer till it was over their heads
Great Sage called a voice from it Ao Guang the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea is here to call on you I wouldn't have troubled you if it hadn't been important Monkey said
Could I ask you to help by giving the king here some rootless water to take his medicine with When you summoned me Great Sage the dragon king replied you said nothing about water I have only come by myself I haven't brought any rainmaking equipment to say nothing of wind clouds thunder and lightning
So how can I make it rain There'll be no call for wind clouds thunder or lightning this time Monkey said and we don't need much rain either
We just need enough water for someone to take his medicine with In that case I'll do a couple of sneezes and spit out some saliva the dragon king said That ought to be enough for him to take his medicine Terrific said Monkey delighted
Don't waste a moment
Do it as soon as you can The ancient old dragon gradually brought his dark cloud down till it was just over the palace though he kept himself entirely concealed
He spat out a mouthful of saliva that turned into timely rain whereupon all the officials at court exclaimed Ten million congratulations Your Majesty
Heaven is sending down timely rain The king then ordered Take vessels out to hold the rain All officials whether inside or outside the palace and irrespective of their rank must gather this sacred water to save our life Just watch as all the civil and military officials as well as the consorts concubines three thousand beauties and eight hundred charming ladiesinwaiting of the three harems and the six compounds of the inner palace all stood there holding cups dishes bowls and plates to catch the timely rain
Up in the sky the ancient dragon so controlled his saliva that all of it fell within the palace
After about two hours the dragon king took his leave of the Great Sage and went back to the sea
When the officials gathered all the cups dishes bowls and plates together they found that some had caught one or two drops of water some three to five and some none at all When it was all put together there were a little over three dishes full of it and this was all presented to the king
Indeed The throne hall was filled with exquisite fragrance Journey to the West Fine scents were wafting round the Son of Heaven's court
The king then dismissed the Master of the Law and had the Black Gold Elixir and the timely rain carried into the inner quarters where he took the first pill with the first dish of timely rain then the second pill with the second dish
In three efforts he finished all three pills and all three dishfuls
Soon afterwards there was a noise from his stomach like the endless turning of a windlass
He sent for his chamber pot and evacuated four or five times before taking some rice porridge and collapsing on his dragon bed
When two of his consorts inspected the chamber pot they saw it contained huge amounts of feces and mucus and amid it all a ball of glutinous rice
The root of the disorder has come out the consorts reported going over to the royal bed
The king was very pleased to hear this and ate some rice
A little later his chest felt eased and his natural forces and blood were in harmonious balance once more
He was full of vigor and the strength came back to his legs so he rose from his bed dressed in his court clothes and went into the throne hall where he greeted the Tang Priest by prostrating himself
The venerable elder returned this courtesy as quickly as he could
When this had been done the king helped Sanzang to his feet with his own hands and told his courtiers Write a note at once sending our personal and respectful greetings and have an official go to invite the three illustrious disciples of the Master of the Law to come here
Meanwhile the Eastern hall of the palace is to be opened up and the department of foreign relations is to arrange a banquet of thanksgiving Having been given these commands the officials carried them out The scribes wrote out the note and the caterers prepared the meal
A state is indeed strong enough to overturn a mountain and everything was done in an instant
When Pig saw the officials come to deliver the note he was beside himself with delight Brother he said it really must be miracle medicine
From the way they're coming to thank you you must have pulled it off You've got it all wrong brother said Friar Sand
As the saying goes 'One man's good fortune affects his whole household' We two made up the pills so we take a share of the credit
So just enjoy yourself and stop talking Hey
Just look at the three brothers as they all happily go straight to the palace where all the officials received them and led them to the Eastern hall
Here they saw the Tang Priest with the king and his ministers and the banquet all set out ready
Brother Monkey Pig and Friar Sand all chanted a naaaw of respect to their master after which the officials all came in
In the best place there were set out four tables of vegetarian food It was the sort of banquet at which there are ten times as many dishes as you can eat
In front of these tables was one of meat dishes and on this too you could see ten dishes of rare delicacies while you ate one
To either side four or five hundred more single tables were most neatly set out As the ancients had it
A hundred rare delicacies A thousand goblets of fine wine Rich cream and yogurt Journey to the West Fat red meat like brocade Precious and manycoloured decorations Heavy fragrances of fruit
Huge sugar dragons coil round sweet lions and immortals Ingots of cake draw furnaces escorted by phoenixes
For meat there was pork and mutton goose chicken duck and fish For vegetables bamboo shoots beansprouts fungus and button mushrooms
Delicious noodles in soup Translucent creamy sweets Succulent millet Fresh wild rice congee Pungent tasty soup with rice noodles Dishes in which sweetness vied with beauty
Monarch and subjects raised their cups as the diners took their seats Officials seated by rank slowly passed the jugs
Holding a cup in his hand the king first seated the Tang Priest who said As a monk I may not drink liquor This is alcoholfree wine the king said
Could you not drink one cup of this Master of the Law But wine is the first prohibition for us monks said Sanzang
The king felt awkward If you may not drink Master of the Law how can I congratulate you My three badlybehaved disciples will drink on my behalf Sanzang replied
The king then happily passed the golden goblet to Monkey who took it made a courteous gesture to the assembly and downed a cupful
Seeing how cheerfully he downed it the king offered him another cup
Monkey did not decline it but drank again
Have a third goblet said the king with a smile and Monkey accepted and drank for a third time
The king then ordered that the cup be refilled and said Have another to make it four for the four seasons Pig who was standing beside Monkey had to put up with the saliva gurgling inside him as the wine would not come his way and now that the king was pressing Monkey so hard to drink he started to shout Your Majesty that medicine you took owes something to me
Those pills include horse When Monkey heard Journey to the West this he was terrified that the idiot was going to give the game away so he handed Pig the cup
Pig took the cup drank and stopped talking
Holy monk said the king just now you said there was horse in the pills
What sort of horse This brother of mine has a very loose tongue said Monkey cutting in We've got a really good formula that has been tried and tested and he wants to give it away
The pills Your Majesty took this morning included not horse but Aristolochia What class of medicine is Aristolochia the king asked
What conditions can it cure One of the fellows of the Royal College of Medicine who was standing beside the king said Your Majesty Aristolochia is bitter cold and free of poison Ends shortness of breath and cures phlegm well Circulates the energy removes blood infections Fills emptiness soothes coughs and eases the heart
It was the right thing to use the right thing to use the king said
The Venerable Pig must have another cup The idiot said nothing more but downed three goblets
The king then gave three cupfuls to Friar Sand who drank them Everyone then sat down
When they all had been feasting and drinking for a long time the king raised a large goblet once more and handed it to Monkey
Please sit down Your Majesty Monkey said
I've been drinking hard in every round
I'd never refuse Holy monk the king said we are under a profound debt of gratitude to you that we will never be able to repay
Please drain this great goblet
we have something to say to you Say what you will first Monkey replied I'll drink after We suffered from that melancholia for years on end the king said and one dose of your miraculous pills cured it When I saw Your Majesty yesterday I realized you were suffering from melancholia Monkey said but I don't know what's getting you down There's an old saying that a family doesn't talk about its dirt to strangers the king replied
As you are our benefactor holy monk we shall tell you but please don't laugh I'd never dare Monkey said
Please speak freely How many countries did you holy monks come through on your way here from the East the king asked
Journey to the West Five or six Monkey replied
What titles do the queens of the other kings have the king went on to ask
They're called the queens of the Main Palace East Palace and West Palace Monkey replied
We don't use titles like that the king said We call the principal queen the Queen of the Sacred Golden Palace the Eastern queen the Queen of the Sacred Jade Palace and the Western queen the Queen of the Sacred Silver Palace
But now only the Jade and Silver Queen are here Why isn't the Golden Queen in the palace Monkey asked
She has been gone for three whole years the king replied in tears Where did she go Monkey asked
At the Dragonboat Festival three years ago the king said we were in the Pomegranate Pavilion of the palace gardens with our queens and consorts unwrapping rice dumplings putting artemisia out drinking calamus and realgar wine and watching the dragon boats race when all of a sudden there was a gust of wind An evil spirit appeared in midair He said he was the Evil Star Matcher who lives in the Horndog Cave on Mount Unicorn and was short of a wife Seeing how beautiful and charming our Golden Queen is he wanted her for his wife and insisted we should hand her over at once
If we did not do so by the time he had asked three times he was going to eat us up first then our officials and all the commoners living in the city
We were so concerned over the fate of our country and our people that there was no alternative the Golden Queen had to be pushed outside the pavilion to be carried noisily off by the evil spirit
All this gave us such a fright that the rice dumpling we were eating turned solid inside us
On top of that we have been unable to sleep for worrying which is why we were ill for three years
Since taking you holy monks' miraculous pills we have evacuated our bowels three times and the accumulations from three years ago have all been passed That is why our body now feels light and strong and our spirit is restored to what it was
Our life has today been given to us by you holy monks this is a gift more weighty than Mount Tai When Brother Monkey heard this he was very happy indeed and he downed the huge goblet of wine in two gulps
Your Majesty he said with a smile to the king so that's what caused your shock and your depression
Today you've been lucky you met me and you were cured
But I don't know whether you want the Golden Queen back in the palace To this the king answered with tears We have been longing for her night and day but nobody has ever been able to catch the evil spirit
Of course we want her back in our country What if I go to deal with that evil creature for you said Monkey
The king fell to his knees and replied If you can rescue our queen we will gladly take our three queens and nine consorts away from the capital and go to live as commoners leaving the whole kingdom to be yours to reign over holy monk When Pig who was sitting beside them heard all this being said and such great honors being done he could not help bursting into noisy laughter This king's got no sense of what's proper he chortled
Fancy giving up his kingdom and going on his knees to a monk for the sake of his old woman Journey to the West Monkey hurried forward to help the king back on his feet and ask Your Majesty has the evil spirit been back since he got the Golden Queen In the fifth month of the year before last the king said he carried off the Golden Queen
In the tenth month he came back to demand a couple of ladies in waiting to serve her and we presented him with a couple
In the third month of last year he came to demand another couple and two more in the seventh month
Then in the second month of this year it was a fourth pair
We do not know when he will be back again If he comes that often you must be terrified of him Monkey replied
Because he has come so frequently we are afraid of him and of his murderous intentions said the king
In the fourth month last year we ordered the building of a demon shelter so that whenever we hear the wind and know that he's coming we can shelter there with our two queens and nine consorts Would Your Majesty mind taking me to see the shelter Monkey asked and the king led Monkey by his left hand from the table
All the officials rose to their feet
Brother protested Pig you're very unreasonable
Why leave this royal wine and break up the banquet to go looking at something Hearing this and realizing that Pig was worried for his stomach the king told his attendants to have two tables of vegetarian food brought along so that Pig could go on being wined outside the demon shelter
Only then did the idiot stop making a fuss and join in with his master and Friar Sand saying Let's break up the banquet As a column of civil and military officials led the way the king and Monkey went arminarm through the living quarters of the palace to the back of the royal gardens but there were no great buildings to be seen
Where's the demon shelter Monkey asked and before the words were out of his mouth two eunuchs levered open a square flagstone with red lacquered crowbars
Here it is said the king
Twenty feet or more below us a large underground palace hall has been excavated
In it there are four great vats of purified oil in which lights burn night and day
When we hear the wind we take shelter here and the flagstone is put on again from outside So the evil spirit doesn't want to kill you said Monkey with a smile
If he did this would give you no protection Just as he was speaking there came the roaring of a wind from due South that made the dust fly
In their alarm all the officials complained That monk has the mouth of an oracle
The moment he mentions the evil spirit it turns up The panicstricken monarch abandoned Monkey and scuttled into his underground shelter
The Tang Priest went with him and all the officials fled for cover
Pig and Friar Sand wanted to hide too but Monkey grabbed one of them with each hand and said Don't be afraid brothers You and I are going to identify him and see what sort of evil spirit he is Nonsense said Pig What do we want to identify him for
The officials have all hidden and the king's shut himself away Why don't we clear off
What kind of hero are you trying to be But struggle though he might the idiot could not break free
When Monkey had been holding on to him for some time an evil spirit suddenly appeared in midair
Just see what it looked like Journey to the West A loathsome great body nine feet tall Round eyes flashing like lamps of gold
Two huge ears sticking out as if they were round fans Four steel fangs like very long nails
Red hair curled at his temples his brows were as flames His nose was a hanging trough his nostrils flared
His whiskers were strands of cinnabar thread And jutting cheekbones shaped his green face
On redmuscled arms were hands of indigo blue And ten sharp claws grasped a spear
A leopardskin kilt was tied round his waist Bare feet and tangled hair completed his fiendish looks
Friar Sand asked Monkey when he saw the evil spirit can you recognize him I don't know who he is Friar Sand replied
I've never seen him before Pig Monkey next asked do you know I've never had a cup or a drink with him Pig replied He's no friend or neighbour of mine
How could I know He reminds me of the sallowfaced goldeneyed gate keeper ghost under the Equal of Heaven of the Eastern Peak No he isn't no he isn't said Pig
How do you know he isn't Monkey asked
Because ghosts are spirits of the dark and the underworld Pig replied They only come out at night between five and midnight
It's only ten in the morning and no ghost would ever dare come out now
And even if it was a devil it'd never ride a cloud
Ghosts that stir up winds make whirlwinds not gales
Perhaps he's the Evil Star Matcher You're not such an idiot after all said Monkey
That sounds sensible so you two look after the master while I go to ask him his name That'll help me rescue the Golden Queen and bring her back to the palace for the king Journey to the West Go if you must Pig replied but don't tell him anything about us Monkey did not deign to answer but leapt straight up on his magic light Goodness
To settle the nation he started by curing the king To preserve the Way love and hatred had to go
If you don't know who won the battle that followed when Monkey rose up into the sky or how the evil monster was captured and the Golden Queen rescued listen to the explanation in the next chapter
The Evil Monster's Treasures Emit Smoke Sand and Fire Wukong Steals the Golden Bells by Trickery The story tells how Brother Monkey summoned up his divine prestige and rose up into the air on his magic light wielding his iron cudgel Where are you from evil monster he asked shouting in the evil spirit's face
And where are you going to wreak havoc I'm the vanguard warrior under the Great King Evil Star Matcher from Horndog Cave on Mount Unicorn shouted the demon at the top of his voice that's who I am His Majesty has ordered me to fetch two ladiesinwaiting to serve Her Majesty the Golden Queen
Who are you and how dare you question me I'm Sun Wukong the Great Sage Equaling Heaven Monkey replied I was passing through this country while escorting the Tang Priest to worship the Buddha in the Western Heaven Now I know that your gang of monsters was oppressing the king I'm going to use my heroic powers to bring the country back to order and wipe out this evil
And now you've come along to throw your life away just when I didn't know where to find you When the monster heard this he foolishly thrust his spear at Monkey who struck back at his face with the iron cudgel
They fought a splendid battle up in midair The cudgel was the seasettler from the dragon's palace The spear was of iron tempered by mankind
An ordinary weapon was no match for that of an immortal In a few clashes its magic powers all drained away
The Great Sage was an immortal of the Supreme Ultimate The spirit was only an evil monster
How could a demon approach a True One Journey to the West In the face of truth the evil would be destroyed
One stirred up wind and dust to terrify a king The other trod on mist and cloud to blot out sun and moon
When they dropped their guard to try for victory Neither of them dared to show off
The Heavenequaling Great Sage was the abler fighter With a loud clash of his cudgel the spear was broken
When his spear was quickly broken in two by Monkey's iron cudgel the evil spirit was in fear for his life so he turned the wind right round and fled Westwards
Instead of chasing him Monkey brought his cloud down to the entrance of the underground demon shelter Master he called you and His Majesty can come out now
The monster's run away Only then did the Tang Priest come out of the underground shelter supporting the king
The sky was clear and all traces of the evil spirit had disappeared
The king went over to the table filled a golden goblet from the wine bottle with his own hands and presented it to Monkey with the words Holy monk allow us to offer our provisional thanks Monkey took the cup but before he could reply an official came in from outside the Western gate of the palace to report The Western gate is on fire As soon as he heard this Monkey threw the wine cup and all up into the air The cup fell with a clang
This so alarmed the king that he bowed to Monkey with the words Forgive us holy monk forgive us We have treated you shabbily
The proper thing would have been to ask you into the throne hall to bow to you in thanks We only offered you the wine here because it was to hand
Did you not throw the goblet aside because you were offended holy monk Nothing of the sort laughed Monkey nothing of the sort A moment later another official came in to report There's been a miraculous fall of rain
No sooner had the Western gate caught fire than a heavy rainstorm put it out
The streets are running with water and it all smells of wine Your Majesty said Monkey with another smile you thought I'd taken offence when I tossed the cup aside but you were wrong
When the evil spirit fled Westwards I didn't go after him so he started that fire
I just used the goblet to put out the demon's fire and save the people outside the Western gate
It didn't mean anything else The king even more delighted than before treated Monkey with still greater respect
He invited Sanzang and his three disciples to enter the throne hall with him clearly intending to abdicate in their favour
Journey to the West Your Majesty said Brother Monkey with a smile the demon who was here just now said he was a vanguard warrior under the Evil Star Matcher who'd come here to fetch palace girls
Now he's gone back beaten he's bound to report that damned monster who's certain to come here to fight me
I'm worried that if he comes here at the head of his hordes he'll alarm the common people and terrify Your Majesty I'd like to go out to meet him capture him in midair and bring back your queen
But I don't know the way
How far is it to his cave from here We once sent some of the horsemen and infantry of our night scouts to find out what was happening the king replied The return journey took them over fifty days
It's over a thousand miles away to the South Pig Friar Sand said Monkey on learning this stay on guard here
I'm off Wait another day holy monk said the king grabbing hold of him Don't go till we have had some dried provisions prepared for you We'll give you silver for the journey and a fast horse too You're talking as if I'd have to go slogging up mountains and over ridges Your Majesty Monkey replied
I tell you truthfully that I can do the return journey of a thousand miles each way before a cup of wine you've poured out has had time to get cold Holy monk the king replied I hope you won't take offence at our saying this but your distinguished features are very much like those of an ape
How can you have such magical powers of travel To this Monkey replied
Although my body is the body of an ape When young I mastered the paths of life and death
 visited all the great teachers who taught me their Way And trained myself by night and day beside the mountain
I took heaven as my roof and the earth as my furnace And used both kinds of drug to complete the sun and moon Taking from positive and negative joining fire and water Until suddenly Iwas aware of the Mystic Pass
 relied entirely on the Dipper for success in my movements Shifting my steps by relying on the handle of that constellation
When the time is right I lower or increase the heat Taking out lead and adding mercury watching them both
By grouping the Five Elements transformations are made Journey to the West Through combining the Four Forms the seasons can be distinguished
The two vital forces returned to the zodiac The three teachings met on the golden elixir road
When understanding of the laws came to the four limbs The original somersault was given divine assistance
With a single bound I could cross the Taihang mountains At one go I could fly across the Cloudtouching Ford
A thousand steep ridges are no bother to me Nor hundreds of rivers as great as the Yangtse
Because my transformations are impossible to stop I can cover sixty thousand miles in a single leap
The king was both alarmed and delighted to hear this He presented a cup of royal wine to Monkey with a chuckle and the words Holy monk you have a long and tiring journey ahead of you
Won't you drink this wine to help you on your way All the Great Sage had on his mind was going off to defeat the demon he was not at all interested in drinking Put it down he said
I'll drink it when I come back No sooner had the splendid Monkey said this than he disappeared with a whoosh
We will not describe the amazement of the king and his subjects
Instead we tell how with a single leap Monkey was soon in sight of a tall mountain locked in mists
He brought his cloud down till he was standing on the summit When he looked around he saw that it was a fine mountain Soaring to the heavens occupying the earth Blocking out the sun and making clouds
Where it soared to the heavens The towering peak rose high In the earth it occupied Its ranges spread afar
Journey to the West What blocked the sun Was the ridge dark with pines Where clouds were made Was among the boulders glistening underneath the scar
The dark pines Were green throughout all seasons The glistening boulders Would never change in many a thousand years
Apes could often be heard howling in the night And evil pythons would often cross the deep ravines
On the mountains birds sang sweetly While the wild beasts roared
Mountain roebuck and deer Moved around in many a pair
Mountain magpies and crows Flew in dense flocks
There was no end of mountain flowers in sight While mountain peaches and other fruit gleamed in season
Steep it was and the going impossible But this was still a place where evil immortals could live in retirement
The Great Sage gazed with unbounded delight and was just about to look for the entrance to the cave when flames leapt out from a mountain hollow In an instant the red fire blazed to the heavens and from the flames there poured out evil smoke that was even more terrible than the fire What splendid smoke This is what could be seen
The fire glared with a myriad golden lamps Journey to the West The flames leapt in a thousand crimson rainbows
The smoke was not a stove chimney's smoke Nor the smoke of grass or wood But smoke of many colours Blue red white black and yellow
It blackened the columns outside the Southern Gate of Heaven Scorched the roofbeams in the Hall of Miraculous Mist
It burned so hard that Wild beasts in their dens were cooked through skins and all And the forest birds lost all their plumage
At the mere sight of this appalling smoke he wondered How the demon king could be captured in the mountain
Just as the Great Sage was transfixed with terror a sandstorm burst out of the mountain
What magnificent sand It blotted out the sun and the sky
Swirling masses of it filled the sky Dark and turbid as it covered the earth
The fine grains blinded the people everywhere While bigger cinders filled the valleys like rolling sesame seeds
Immortal boys collecting herbs lost their companions Woodmen gathering firewood could not find their way home
Even if you were holding a brightshining pearl It still would have blown too hard for you to see
Monkey had been so absorbed in enjoying the view that he did not notice the sand and cinders flying into his nose till it started tickling
Giving two great sneezes he stretched his hand out behind him felt for two pebbles Journey to the West at the foot of a cliff and blocked his nostrils with them then shook himself and turned into a firegrabbing sparrowhawk that flew straight in among the flames and smoke made a few swoops and at once stopped the sand and cinders and put out the fires
He quickly turned back into himself landed and looked around again This time he heard a banging and a clanging like a copper gong I've come the wrong way he said to himself
This is no den of demons
The gong sounds like an official messenger's gong This must be the main road to some country and that I must be an official messenger on his way to deliver some document
I'll go and question him As Monkey went along what looked like a young demon appeared He was holding a yellow flag carrying a document on his back and beating a gong as he hurried along so fast he was almost flying
So this is the soandso who was beating that gong Monkey said
I wonder what document he's delivering
I'll ask him The splendid Great Sage shook himself and turned into a grasshopper that lightly flew over and alighted on his document bag
Here Monkey could hear the evil spirit talking garrulously to himself as he beat the gong Our king is thoroughly vicious
Three years ago he took the Golden Queen from the Kingdom of Purpuria but fate's been against him and he hasn't been able to get his hands on her The poor palace ladies he took had to suffer on her behalf
He killed two of them who came then the next four
He demanded them the year before last last year and earlier this year When he sent for two more this time he found his match
The vanguard warrior who went to demand the palace ladies was beaten by someone called Sun the Novice or whatever He didn't get his palace girls
It made our king so angry he wants to wage a war on Purpuria He's sent me with this declaration of war
Their king will be all right if he doesn't fight but if he does fight it'll be a disaster for him
When our king uses his fire smoke and sandstorms their king ministers and common people will all die
Then we'll take over their city Our king will be its monarch and we'll be his subjects
But even though we'll get official posts it goes against Heaven Monkey was very pleased to hear this
So there are even some decent evil spirits he thought
That last remark'it goes against Heaven'was very good
I wonder what he meant when he said that fate has been against their king and he hasn't been able to get his hands on the Golden Queen
Let me ask him some questions With a whining buzz he flew away from the evil spirit to a point some miles ahead of him on the road shook himself and turned into a Taoist boy He wore his hair in two bunches And a robe of a hundred patches
He beat on a fisherman's drum As he sang some Taoist snatches
As Monkey came round the slope towards the little devil he raised his hands in greeting and said Where are you going sir
What official document is that you're delivering The devil seemed to recognize him as he stopped beating his gong returned his greeting and said with a titter Our king's sent me to Purpuria with a declaration of war Has that woman from Purpuria slept with the king yet Monkey asked pressing on with his questioning
Journey to the West When he brought her here the other year the little devil replied an immortal gave the Golden Queen a magic robe as her wedding dress
As soon as she put it on she was covered from head to foot with spike Our king didn't dare so much as caress her
Even the slightest touch makes his hand hurt I don't know why it happened
So from that year till this he hasn't had her
When his vanguard fighter was sent this morning to demand two more palace ladies to serve her he was beaten
Our king was so angry he sent me with this declaration of war He's going to fight him tomorrow So is the king in a bad mood Monkey asked
Yes he's in a bad mood back there said the little devil
You ought to go and sing him some Taoist songs to cheer himup The splendid Monkey put his arms in his sleeves ready to go while the evil spirit went on his way beating his gong as before
Monkey then turned murderous He brought out his cudgel turned round and hit the little devil on the back of his head The unfortunate demon's head was smashed to a pulp The blood gushed out as his skin split open and his neck was broken
He was dead Monkey then put his cudgel away and said to himself with regret I was in too much of a hurry I never asked him his name
Too bad He took the declaration of war from the body and put it in his sleeve
Then he hid the yellow flag and the gong in the undergrowth by the path and was dragging the body by its ankles to throw it down the ravine when he heard something clinking An ivory tablet inlaid with gold could be seen at the demon's waist The writing on it read This is our trusted subordinate Gocome
He is of short stature and has a spotty and unbearded face
This tablet is to be kept permanently at his waist Anyone without this tablet is an impostor So the wretch was called Gocome
But after being hit by this cudgel of mine he's gone and won't be coming back He then undid the ivory tablet fastened it at his own waist and was just about to throw the body down when he remembered the terrible fire and smoke and decided he could not bring himself to look for the cave palace He raised the cudgel rammed it into the demon's chest lifted him up into the air and went straight back to Purpuria to announce his first success
Watch him as he goes whistling back to that country
Pig was in front of the throne room guarding the king and his master when suddenly he turned round to see Monkey carrying the demon through the air Hey he complained that was an easy piece of work
If I'd known you were going to get him I'd have done it and got the credit Before he had finished speaking Monkey brought the cloud down and threw the demon at the foot of the steps
Pig ran over and struck the body with his rake I'll take the credit for that he said
The credit Monkey replied Don't try to rob me of it Pig said I've got proof
Can't you see the nine holes I made in him with my rake See if he's got a head said Monkey
So he doesn't have a head Pig replied
Now I know why he never moved when I hit him Where's the master Monkey asked
Journey to the West Talking to the king in the throne hall said Pig
Go and ask him to come out said Monkey and Pig hurried up into the hall
At Pig's nod Sanzang rose to his feet and came out at once to see Monkey who thrust the declaration of war into his sleeve with the words Look after this Master and don't let the king see it Before the words were all out of his mouth the king too came out of the hall to greet Monkey and say You're back holy monk venerable sir
How did the capture of the demon go Isn't that a demon at the foot of the steps Monkey asked pointing
I killed him True said the king it is the body of an evil spirit but it isn't the Evil Star Matcher
We have twice seen the Evil Star Matcher with our own eyes He is eighteen feet tall and nine feet across the shoulders
His face shines like gold and his voice is like thunder
He's not a miserable little wretch like that You Majesty is right Monkey replied this isn't him
It's just a little messenger devil I happened to meet I killed him and brought him back as a trophy Splendid said the king who was very pleased indeed splendid This is the first success
We have often sent people out to find out what is happening but they never discover anything
Then you just have to go out holy monk to bring one straight back
You really do have divine powers Fetch some warm wine he ordered and give it to the reverend gentlemen Never mind about the wine said Monkey
I want to ask Your Majesty whether the Golden Queen left any keepsakes when she went If so give me some The word keepsakes cut the king to the heart He could not help sobbing aloud with tears pouring down as he replied
When we were enjoying the festival that year The Evil Star Matcher gave a mighty shout He took our wife to be his bandit queen To save the land we had to send her out
We had no time for talk or parting words Nor could I see her off along her way
She left no keepsake and no perfume bag We would be lonely here until today Your Majesty is here Monkey said so why upset yourself If the queen didn't leave any keepsake there must be some things in the palace that she's specially fond of
Give me one of them Journey to the West What do you want it for the king asked
That demon king's magic powers are quite something said Monkey and from what I've seen of his fire smoke and sand he'll be really hard to capture
Even if I do capture him the queen might refuse to come back here with a stranger like me
I must have some favorite thing of hers so that she'll trust me and let me bring her back
That's why I want it There is a pair of gold bracelets in her dressing room in the Sunlight Palace that she used to wear the king replied
She only took them off that day as it was the Dragonboat Festival and she was going to wear multicolored threads instead She was very fond of those bracelets
They have been put away in her dressing table
We have not been able to bear the sight of them since she left us
seeing them is like seeing her lovely face and it makes us feel even more ill than ever Say no more Monkey replied and have the bracelets brought here
If you can bring yourself to part with them give me both
If you can't I'll take just one The king ordered the Jade Queen to fetch them which she did handing them to the king
At the sight of them he called out My beloved and tenderhearted queen several times then handed them to Monkey who took them and put them on his arm
The splendid Great Sage could not stay to drink the celebratory wine but whistled back to Mount Unicorn on his somersault cloud
Now he had no interest in the view as he headed straight for the cave palace
While he was walking along he heard noisy shouts so he stopped to take a careful look around
About five hundred of the soldiers of all ranks guarding the entrance to Horndog Cave were Drawn up in massed array In close order
Drawn up in massed array they held their weapons Gleaming in the sun
In close order they unfurled their banners That fluttered in the breeze
Tiger and bear generals did transformations Leopard and tigercat marshals were full of spirit
Fiercely savage were the wolves The elephants were mighty and imposing
Crafty hares and waterdeer swung sword and halberd Great snakes and pythons carried cutlass and bow
Journey to the West Orangutans that understood human speech Controlled the formations and gathered intelligence
When Monkey saw this he ventured no closer but went straight back the way he had come Do you know why
Not because he was afraid of them
He went back to where he had killed the little devil recovered the yellow flag and the gong made a hand spell thought of what he wanted to become faced the wind shook himself and turned into the likeness of Gocome Then he started hitting the gong as he strode straight back towards Horndog Cave
He was going to look at the layout of the cave when he heard an orangutan say You're back Gocome Yes Monkey had to reply
Hurry up the orangutan said Our king is waiting in the Flaying Pavilion to hear what you have to report As soon as he heard this Monkey hurried straight in through the main gate beating his gong and looking around He saw that rooms and halls had been carved out of the beetling crag On either side bloomed rare and precious flowers while all around stood ancient cypresses and tall pines
Before he realized it he was through the inner gate and suddenly looking up he saw a pavilion made light by the eight windows in it In the pavilion was a splendid chair inlaid with gold on which a demon king was sitting upright He was a truly terrifying sight This is what he looked like
A shimmering red glow rose from the top of his head A mighty and murderous air burst from his chest
Sharp were the fangs that protruded from his mouth Red smoke rose from the scorched hair at his temples
The bristles of his moustache were like embedded arrows His body was covered with hair like brushedup felt
Eyes bulged like bells to rival the Evil Star Hands held an iron mace like Mahadeva
When Monkey saw the evil spirit he acted towards him in an offhand way showing no trace of respect but looking away and keeping on hitting his gong
So you're back are you said the demon king
Monkey did not reply
Gocome the demon king asked again you're back are you Still Monkey did not reply
The demon king then went over to him grabbed him and said Why are you still beating your gong now you're back home And why don't you answer when I ask you a question Journey to the West What do you mean by your 'Why Why' Monkey replied
I told you I didn't want to go but you insisted
When I got there I saw huge numbers of foot soldiers and cavalry drawn up in order of battle As soon as I was spotted they shouted 'Seize the demon
Seize the demon' They pushed and shoved and dragged and carried me into the city where I saw their king
He told them to cut my head off but luckily his two groups of advisers said that in international conflicts envoys should not be executed so I was spared
They took the declaration of war marched me out of the city gave me thirty strokes in front of their army and let me come back here to report
Before long they'll be here to fight you In other words the monster said you had a bad time
I don't blame you for refusing to answer when I asked you those questions It wasn't that said Monkey
The reason I didn't answer was because of the pain How strong are their forces the demon king asked
I was reeling from shock and too badly frightened by the beating to be able to count them Monkey replied
All I could see were masses of weapons drawn up there Bows and arrows spears and sabers suits of armor Daggeraxes halberds swords and tasseled banners
Pikes partisans helmets Axes round shields and iron caltrops Long staves Short cudgels Steel forks cannons and casques
They were wearing tall boots hats and quilted jackets And carrying cudgels small pelletbows and maces of bronze That's neither here nor there laughed the demon king when he heard this
Weapons like that can be finished off in a single blaze
Go and tell the Golden Queen all about it and ask her not to upset herself
Ever since she heard me lose my temper this morning and decide to go to war she's been crying her eyes out
Tell her that their army is so fierce and brave that they're bound to beat us
That'll calm her down for a while This delighted Monkey who thought Just what I want Watch him as he goes the way he knows through the side door and across the hall
Inside there were tall buildings it was not like outside
He went straight to the women's quarters at the back where he saw from a distance a handsome and decorated doorway That was where the Golden Queen lived
When he went to see her there were two groups of fox and deer spirits dressed Journey to the West like beautiful women to wait on her
The queen sat in the middle with her fragrant cheeks in her hands and tears pouring from both of her eyes
Indeed she had A beautiful face so soft and charming A bewitching countenance so fair
But her ravenblack hair was uncombed And piled untidily on her head She did not want to dress up And wore no hair ornaments or rings
Her face was unpowdered And she wore no rouge
Her hair was not oiled But all in a tangle
She pouted her cherry lips Ground her silver teeth Frowned with her brows like moth antennae And let her eyes sparkle with tears
All her heart Was filled with memories of Purpuria's king All the time She longed to escape from the net that held her
Truly Illfated have been many lovely ladies Left in their wordless grief to face the Eastern wind
Monkey went up to her and greeted her with a Hello Journey to the West You impudent boorish freak said the queen
I remember how when I was living in splendor with my king in Purpuria even the king's tutor and the prime minister had to prostrate themselves in the dust when they met me they would never have dared look me in the face
How dare you say 'Hello' to me you lout
Where are you from you coarse beast Please don't be angry ma'am the serving women said
He's one of His Majesty's most trusted lieutenants His name is Gocome
He was the one who was sent with the declaration of war this morning At this the queen controlled her temper and asked Did you go inside Purpuria when you delivered the declaration I took it straight to the capital and right into the throne hall said Monkey
I saw the king himself and got an answer from him What did the king say when you saw him the queen asked
I have already told His Majesty here what he said about war and about the dispositions of their forces Monkey replied
But there was also a private message from the king who misses you ma'am
There's something private I have come to report to you but with all these attendants around this is no place to talk When the queen heard this she dismissed her foxes and deer
Brother Monkey shut the door of the palace rubbed his face and turned back into himself Don't be afraid of me he said to her
I'm a monk sent by the Great Tang in the East to see the Buddha and fetch the scriptures at the Thunder Monastery in India
My master is Tang Sanzang the younger brother of the Tang Emperor
I'm Sun Wukong his senior disciple
When we were in your capital to present our passport for approval I saw a notice calling for doctors that your king and his ministers had posted Then I used my medical skills to cure the illness he had contracted from missing you
When we were drinking at the banquet he gave to thank me he told me that you had been carried off by the evil spirit
As I can subdue dragons and tigers I was specially invited to capture the demon rescue you and take you back to your country
I was the one who defeated the vanguard and killed the little devil
When I saw from outside the gates how ferocious the demon king was I turned myself into Gocome's double and came here to bring you a message The queen said nothing when she heard this
Then Monkey produced the bracelets and presented them to her with both hands If you don't believe me just look where did these come from he asked
As soon as she saw them the queen burst into tears came down from where she was sitting bowed to him in thanks and said Reverend sir if you really can save me and get me back to court I will remember my deep debt of gratitude to you even when I'm old and toothless Let me ask you something said Monkey
What treasure does he use to produce that fire smoke and sand It's no treasure the queen said just three golden bells
As soon as he shakes the first one three thousand feet of burning flames shoot out
When he shakes the second one a threethousandfoot column of smoke gushes out to kipper people
And when he shakes it the third time a blinding threethousandfoot sandstorm blows up
The fire and smoke are nothing much but the sand is lethal If it gets up your nostrils it can kill you It's terrible Monkey said terrible
I've experienced it and I had to sneeze a couple of times I wonder where he keeps the bells Journey to the West He never puts them down the queen replied
He keeps them at his waist whether he's going somewhere staying at home sitting down or sleeping
They are always with him If you still care for Purpuria and want to see your king again you must forget about your distress and grief for the moment said Monkey Make yourself look attractive and happy Talk to him like a loving wife and get him to give you the bells to look after
When I've stolen them and defeated the monster I'll take you back to be reunited with your royal husband so that you can live in peace together The queen did as Monkey said while he turned himself back into the demon king's trusted lieutenant opened the doors again and called the serving women back in
Go to the pavilion at the front Gocome the queen said and ask His Majesty to come here as I've something to say to him The splendid Monkey assented and went to the Flaying Pavilion where he said to the evil spirit Your Majesty Her Majesty would like to see you All she usually does is curse me so why is she sending for me now the demon king happily asked
When she asked me about the king of Purpuria I told her 'He doesn't want you any more he's got a new queen now' When she heard that Her Majesty stopped missing him
That's why she sent me out with this invitation You're very able the demon king said and when we've destroyed Purpuria I'll make you my high chancellor in personal attendance Monkey thanked the demon king for his kindness and hurried to the door of the living quarters at the back where the queen greeted him with happy smiles and her hands on his arms
The king stepped back with an awkward noise Don't he said don't
I'm very grateful for this sign of your affection ma'am but I don't dare stand next to you in case it hurts my hand Sit down Your Majesty the queen said
I have something to say to you There's no objection to you speaking the demon king replied
I'm very much obliged to Your Majesty for condescending to love me she said For three years now you have not shared my pillow although we were fated from our earlier lives to be married
I never expected that Your Majesty would treat me as a stranger instead of your wife
I remember that when I was queen of Purpuria the king gave all the valuable tribute from foreign countries to the queen to look after when he had seen it
But you have no treasures here The servants wear marten hides and feed on blood I have seen no fine silks brocades gold or pearls here
All the covers and blankets are of skins and felt
Or perhaps you do have some treasures that you won't let me see or look after because you regard me as a stranger
They say you have three bells I think they must be treasures Why do you always keep them with you even when you're travelling or sitting down
There's no reason why you shouldn't give them to me to look after I can give them to you when you need them
That would be one way of being a wife to you and it would show that we trust each other in our hearts
The only reason why you don't do this must because you regard me as an outsider At this the demon king burst into loud laughter then bowed to her and said Ma'am you're justified in your complaint
Here are the treasures and today I'm giving them to you to look after He undid his clothing to bring them out
Monkey watched with unwavering eyes as the monster pulled two or three layers of clothing aside to bring out the three bells that he carried next to his skin
Putting cottonwool in to muffle them he wrapped them up in a piece of leopard skin and handed them to the queen with the words They're nothing but please look after them very carefully Whatever you do don't Journey to the West shake them I understand the queen replied as she accepted them
I shall keep them on my dressing table and nobody will move them at all Then she gave these orders My little ones lay on a banquet
His Majesty and I are going to have a few drinks to celebrate our happy union At once the serving women brought in fruit vegetables and the flesh of water deer raccoondogs deer and hare and poured out coconut toddy that they offered them
The queen made herself so bewitchingly attractive that she swept the evil spirit off his feet
Monkey meanwhile went to fetch the bells Feeling and groping he found his way to the dressingtable gently took the three bells crept out through the doors of the inner quarters and left the cave palace
When he reached the Flaying Pavilion there was nobody about so he opened the leopardskin wrapper to have a look One of the bells was as big as a teacup and the other two the size of fists
With reckless folly he tore the cottonwool apart
There was a loud clang and smoke fire and sand came gushing out Desperately Monkey tried to stop them but could do nothing
The pavilion was by now ablaze sending the evil spirits on the gates all crowding in alarm inside the inner quarters Put the fire out said the demon king who was badly rattled
As he rushed out to look he saw that Gocome had taken the golden bells went up to him and shouted Dirty slave
Why did you steal my precious golden bells What sort of nonsense are you up to
Arrest him The tiger and bear generals the leopard and tigercat marshals the elephants gray wolves cunning water deer crafty hares long snakes great pythons orangutans and all the other troops on the gates rushed him in a crowd Monkey was thrown into panic
Dropping the golden bells he turned back into himself pulled out his goldbanded AsYouWill cudgel went and charged at them going through his cudgel routines and lashing out wildly
The demon king took his treasures back and ordered Shut the main gates At this some of the demons shut the gates and others went into battle
Unable to get away Monkey put his cudgel away shook himself and turned into a silly fly that attached itself to a spot on the stone wall which was not burning None of the demons could find him
Your Majesty they reported the thief's got away the thief's got away Did he get out through the gates the demon king asked
The front gates are firmly locked and bolted the demons replied
He can't have got out through them Make a careful search said the demon king and while some of them fetched water to douse the fire the others made a close search but found no trace of him
What sort of thief is he the demon king asked with fury
He's got a hell of a nerve turning himself into Gocome's double coming in here to report back to me then staying with me till he found a chance to steal my treasures
It's luck he didn't take them out if he'd taken them over the mountain top and there had been a heavenly wind it would have been a disaster Your Majesty's good fortune is divine said the tiger general stepping forward
It was because our luck has not yet run out that he was discovered Then the bear marshal came forward to say Your Majesty the thief was none other than the Sun Wukong who beat our vanguard warrior
I think he must have run into Gocome when he was on his way killed him taken his yellow flag gong and ivory tablet and turned into his double to come here and deceive Your Majesty Yes yes the demon king replied you're clearly right
Little ones he ordered make another careful search and be on your guard
Whatever you do don't open the gates and let him out It is rightly said that Journey to the West By being too clever one becomes a fool What was once a joke can turn out to be real
If you don't know how Brother Monkey got out through the demons' gates listen to the explanation in the next installment
Under a False Name Monkey Beats the Demon Hound Guanyin Appears to Subdue the Demon King Matter has always been empty Emptiness said to be matter is only natural
When one penetrates the dhyana of matter's emptiness There is no need for cinnabar to be refined into elixir
Rest not when pursuing perfection of virtue and conduct Endure suffering to achieve hardwon skills
Sometimes one only turns to heaven when one's actions are complete To win an unchanging and immortal face
The story tells how the Evil Star Matcher had the front and back gates tightly closed while Monkey was hunted for The din went on till dusk but no sign of him did they find
The demon king sat in the Flaying Pavilion where he called his demons together and issued orders to the guards on all the gates to carry bells shout passwords beat drums and strike clappers
Everyone was to have an arrow on his bowstring or a sword unsheathed as he took his turn to keep watch during the night
Sun Wukong who had turned into a fly was sitting by the gates
Seeing how strict the security was at the front gates he spread his wings and flew to the gateway of the living quarters to take a look He saw the Golden Queen slumped across a low table the tears flowing down as she wept quietly in her sorrow so he flew inside and landed lightly on the loose black clouds of her hair to listen to what she was crying about
A moment later she said tearfully My lord you and I Burnt in an earlier life the incense of separation And now I have encountered an evil demon king
Journey to the West For three years I have been gone when will we two be reunited
Great is the grief of mandarin ducks that are parted
Just when the priest had brought me your message Our union has been severed once more and the monkey is dead
Because he was too curious about the golden bells I long for you now more desperately than ever When he heard this Monkey went behind her ear where he whispered Don't be afraid Your Majesty
I'm the holy monk the venerable Sun Wukong who was sent from your country I'm still alive
It was all because I was too impatient I went to your dressing table and stole the golden bells While you were drinking with the demon king I sneaked out to the pavilion in the front but I couldn't restrain myself from opening them up to take a look at them
I didn't mean to but I tore the cotton wool muffling the bells and the moment they rang flame smoke and sand came gushing out
I panicked threw the bells down turned back into myself and tried hard to fight my way out with my iron cudgel When I failed and was scared they'd kill me I turned into a fly and hid on the door pivot till just now
The demon king has made the security precautions even stricter and he won't open the doors
Will you act like a wife to him and lure him in here to sleep so that I can escape and find some other way of rescuing you When the queen heard this she shivered and shook and her hair stood on end as if a spirit were pulling it she was terrified as if her heart was being pounded by a pestle
Are you a man or a ghost she asked the tears streaming down
Neither man nor ghost he replied At the moment I've turned into a fly and I'm here
Don't be afraid Hurry up and ask the demon king here The queen still refused to believe him Stop appearing in this nightmare she said in a low voice through her tears
I'm not in a nightmare said Monkey
If you don't believe me put your hand out and open it
I'll jump down into it for you to see The queen then put out her open hand Monkey flew down and landed lightly on her jade palm
He was just like A black bean on a lotus flower A bee resting on a peony blossom A raisin fallen into a hydrangea A black spot on a wild lily stalk
The queen raised her hand and said Holy monk Journey to the West I'm the holy monk transformed Monkey replied
Only then did the queen believe him
When I invite the demon king here what are you going to do she asked
There's an old saying that there's nothing like liquor for ending a life Monkey replied and another that there's nothing like liquor for solving any problem
Liquor's very useful stuff The best thing is to give him plenty to drink
Call one of your personal slavegirls in and let me have a look at her so I can make myself look like her and wait on you
Then I'll be able to make my move The queen did as he told her
Spring Beauty where are you she called and a fox with a beautiful face came in round the screen knelt down and said What orders did Your Majesty call me in to receive Tell them to come in and light the silk lanterns burn some musk and help me into the front room the queen said
Then I shall ask His Majesty to bed Spring Beauty went to the front and called seven or eight deer and fox spirits who lined up on either side of her They carried two pairs of lanterns and one pair of portable incenseburners
By the time the queen bowed to them with her hands together the Great Sage had already flown off
Spreading his wings the splendid Monkey flew straight to the top of Spring Beauty's head where he pulled out one of his hairs blew a magic breath on it and called Change It turned into a sleep insect that landed lightly on Spring Beauty's face
Now when sleep insects reach a human face they crawl into the nostrils and once they are inside the person goes to sleep
Spring Beauty did indeed start feeling sleepy She could not keep on her feet but swayed about and felt dozy as she hurried to where she had been resting before collapsed head first and fell into a deep sleep
Brother Monkey then jumped down shook himself turned into Spring Beauty's exact likeness and went back round the screen to line up with the others
As the Golden Queen walked into the front part of the palace a little devil saw her and reported to the Evil Star Matcher The queen's here Your Majesty The demon king hurried out of the Flaying Pavilion to greet her
Your Majesty the queen said the smoke and fire have been put out and there's no sign of the thief
As it's late now I've come to urge you to come to bed How considerate you are my queen the monster replied utterly delighted to see her
The thief was Sun Wukong who defeated my vanguard warrior then killed my lieutenant and came here disguised as him to fool us
We've searched but can't find a trace of him It makes me feel uneasy The wretch must have got away the queen replied
Relax Your Majesty stop worrying and come to bed Seeing the queen standing there and inviting him so earnestly the demon king could not refuse too insistently so he told the other demons to be careful with the fires and lamps and be on their guard against robbers before he went to the living quarters at the back with the queen
Monkey disguised as Spring Beauty led their way with the other slave girls
Bring wine for His Majesty the queen said
He's exhausted Indeed I am said the demon king with a smile indeed I am Fetch some at once
It'll calm our nerves The imitation Spring Beauty and the other servants then laid out fruit and high meat and set a table and chairs
The queen raised a cup and the demon king did likewise each gave the other a drink from their own
Journey to the West The imitation Spring Beauty who was standing beside them said as she held the jug As tonight is the first time Your Majesties have given each other a drink from your own cups I hope that you will each drain them dry for double happiness They did indeed both refill their cups and drain them again
As this is so happy an occasion for Your Majesties why don't we slave girls sing and dance for you the imitation Spring Beauty suggested
Before the words were all out of her mouth melodious voices could be heard as the singing and dancing began
The two of them drank a lot more before the queen called for the singing and dancing to end
The slave girls divided themselves into their groups and went to line up outside the screen leaving only the imitation Spring Beauty to hold the jug and serve them wine
The queen and the demon king spoke to each other like husband and wife and the queen was so full of sensuality that the demon king's bones turned soft and his sinews went numb
The only trouble was that the poor demon was not lucky enough to enjoy her favours
Indeed it was a case of happiness over nothing like a cat biting a piss bubble After talking and laughing for a while the queen asked Were the treasures damaged Your Majesty Those are treasures that were cast long long ago the demon king said so they couldn't possibly be damaged
All that happened was that the thief tore the cotton wool that was muffling the bells and the leopard skin wrapper was burnt Where have they been put away the queen asked
No need for that the demon king replied
I carry them at my waist Hearing this the imitation Spring Beauty pulled out a handful of his hairs chewed them up into little bits crept closer to the demon king put the pieces of hair on the demon's body blew three magic breaths said Change very quietly and turned the pieces of hair into three revolting pests lice fleas and bedbugs They all made for the demon king's body and started biting his skin wildly
Itching unbearably the demon king put his hands inside his clothing to rub the irritation He caught a few of the lice between his fingers and took them to a lamp for a closer look
When the queen saw them she said mockingly Your Majesty your shirt must be filthy It can't have been washed for ages I expect that's why they're there I've never had insects like these before he said in embarrassment
I would have to make a fool of myself tonight What do you mean making a fool of yourself Your Majesty the queen said with a smile
As the saying goes even the emperor has three imperial lice
Undress and I'll catch them for you The demon king really did undo his belt and take his clothes off
The imitation Spring Beauty was standing beside the demon king looking closely at the fleas leaping around between each layer of clothing on which were rows of enormous bedbugs
Lice and nits were crowded as closely together as ants coming out of their nest
When the demon king took off the third layer of clothing and revealed his flesh the golden bells were also swarming with countless insects
Your Majesty said the imitation Spring Beauty hand me the bells so that I can catch the lice on them for you The demon king was so overcome with shame and alarm that he handed the three bells to Spring Beauty not noticing that she was an impostor
The imitation Spring Beauty took the bells and made a long show of catching lice When she saw the demon king looking down to shake his clothes she hid the golden bells pulled out a hair and turned it into three more bells just like the originals that she carried to the lamp to examine Journey to the West She then wriggled braced herself put the lice bedbugs and fleas back on her body and returned the imitation bells to the monster He took them but was still too befuddled to see that they were copies
Passing them with both his hands to the queen he said Put them away now but be very careful with them not like before The queen took the bells quietly opened the chest put them inside and locked them in with a golden lock
Then she drank several more cups of wine with the demon king Dust and clean the ivory bed she ordered the serving women and spread the brocade quilt
His Majesty and I are going to bed The demon king expressed his thanks but said I have no such luck
I don't dare go with you I'll take one of the palace women with me and go to bed in the Western part of the palace
I wish you a good night by yourself ma'am With that each of them went to bed and we will say no more of that
Meanwhile the successful imitation Spring Beauty tucked the treasures into her belt and turned back into Monkey
He shook himself took back the sleep insect and headed for the front of the palace where nightsticks and bells sounded together to mark the third watch Splendid Monkey made himself invisible by making a spell with his hands and saying the words of it
Going straight to the gates he saw that they were very firmly locked and bolted so he brought out his goldbanded cudgel pointed it at the door and made unlocking magic The gates swung easily open
Hurrying outside he stood by the gates and shouted two or three times at the top of his voice Evil Star Matcher give us back our Golden Queen This startled all the devils who hurried to look and saw that the gates were open
Quickly they fetched lamps to find the locks and fasten the gates once more
Several of them were sent running back inside to report Your Majesty there's someone outside the main gates shouting your title and demanding the Golden Queen The slave girls hurried out to say very quietly Stop yelling
His Majesty's only just gone to sleep Monkey gave another loud shout at the front gates but the little devils still dared not disturb their master
This happened three or four times over but they never went in to report
The Great Sage kept up his din till daybreak by when his patience was exhausted and he swung his iron cudgel to hit the gates
This so alarmed the demons big and small that while some of them barricaded the gates the others went in to report
As soon as the demon king woke up and heard the cacophonous din he got up dressed and emerged from his bedcurtains to ask What's all the shouting about Sir said the kneeling slave girls someone's been shouting and cursing outside the cave half the night
We don't know who it is Now he's attacking the gates As the demon king went out through the gates of the palace several panicstricken little devils appeared to kowtow to him and say There's someone shouting and cursing outside
He's demanding the Golden Queen and if we say so much as half a 'no' he goes on and on at us swearing in a thoroughly horrible way
When Your Majesty still hadn't come out at daybreak he got so desperate he started attacking the gates Don't open them the demon king said
Go and ask him where he's from and what he's called
Report back as quickly as you can The little devils hurried off to ask through the gates Who are you knocking at our gates Journey to the West I'm your grandpa sent by Purpuria to take the Golden Queen back to her own country Monkey replied
When the little devils heard this they reported it to the demon king who went back to the living quarters at the back to question the queen about why the attacker had come
The queen had only just arisen and had not yet done her hair or washed when slave girls came in to report His Majesty's here The queen hastily tidied up her clothes and let her black tresses hang loose as she went outside to greet him
He had just sat down and had not yet asked her any questions when little demons were heard again asking The Grand Par from over there has smashed the gates down How many officers are there in your country ma'am The demon king asked with a smile
Inside the palace there are fortyeight brigades of horse and foot and a thousand good officers and there are ever so many marshals and commanders on the frontiers the queen replied
Are any called Grand Par the demon king asked
When I was in the palace all I knew about was helping His Majesty in the inner quarters and instructing the consorts and concubines every morning and evening the queen said There were no end of things happening outside How could I possibly remember the names This one calls himself Grand Par the demon king replied
There's no such name I can think of in the book The Hundred Surnames
You're a very intelligent and wellborn lady ma'am and you've lived in a royal palace You must have read a lot of books
Can you remember coming across that name in any of them There's a passage in the Thousand Word Classic that goes 'received grand instruction' the queen replied
I think that must refer to him I'm sure you're right the demon king said with pleasure I'm sure you're right He then got up took his leave of the queen went to the Flaying Pavilion fastened his armor on neatly mustered his devil soldiers had the gates opened and went straight outside with his flowerscattering battleaxe in his hand Who's the Grand Par from Purpuria he yelled stridently at the top of his voice
Grasping his goldbanded cudgel in his right hand and pointing with his left Monkey replied What are you shouting at me for nephew The sight of him drove the demon king into a fury Damn you he shouted
You've a face just like a monkey's You resemble a macaque
A ghost is what you look like Don't try to knock me back Journey to the West Impudent devil laughed Monkey trying to bully your superiors and push your master around
You're blind I remember how when I made havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago all the nine heavenly generals only dared speak to me with the greatest respect
If I make you call me Grandpa I'm letting you off lightly Tell me your name immediately the demon king shouted
What fighting skills have you got that give you the nerve to come rampaging here You'd have done better not to ask me what I'm called Monkey replied
But as you insist on me telling you I'm afraid you'll be in a hopeless mess
Come here and stand still while I tell you Heaven and earth were the parents that bore me My foetus was formed from the sun and moon's essence
The magic rock was pregnant for years beyond number Strange indeed was the miraculous root's gestation
When I was born the Three Positives were at their height Now I have been converted all is in harmony
Once I was declared the chief of all the demons Who bowed to me by the red cliff as subduer of monsters
The Jade Emperor issued a decree of summons And the Great White Planet came with the edict Inviting me to Heaven to take up my office But as Protector of the Horses I had no joy
When I first planned rebellion in my mountain cave Boldly I led my armies against the Jade Emperor The Pagodacarrying Heavenly King and Prince Nezha Were utterly helpless when they fought against me
Then the White Planes made a new suggestion And brought another edict urging me to make peace I was made Great Sage Equaling Heaven And proclaimed as one of the pillars of the state
Journey to the West Because I disrupted the banquet of peaches And stole elixir when drunk I met with disaster
Lord Lao Zi submitted a memorial in person And the Queen Mother of the West did homage to the throne
Knowing that I was running riot with the law They mustered heavenly forces and issued movement orders
A hundred thousand vicious stars and evil planets Were packed in close array with their swords and their halberds
Heavenandearth nets were spread across the mountain As all of the soldiers raised their weapons together
A bout of bitter fighting left neither side the victor So Guanyin recommended the warrior Erlang
The two of us fought together for mastery He was helped by the Seven Brothers who come from Plum Hill
Each of us played the hero and did our transformations The three sages at the gates of Heaven opened the clouds
Then Lord Lao Zi dropped his diamond noose And the gods led me as a prisoner to the steps of the thronehall
They did not bother with a detailed indictment The sentence was death by a thousand cuts
Axe and hammer could not till me And I was unharmed by sword or saber
Fire and thunderbolts were neither here nor there They had no way to destroy my immortal body
I was taken under escort to the Tushita Heaven And all was arranged to refine me in the furnace
Journey to the West Only when full time was up did they open up the vessel And I came bounding out from the middle of the crucible
In my hands I was wielding this AsYouWill cudgel As I somersaulted up to the Jade Emperor's throne
All the stars and constellations went into hiding And I could play the vandal in the palaces of Heaven
The Miraculous Investigator rushed to invite the Buddha Then Sakyamuni and I both displayed our powers
Turning my somersaults in the palm of his hand I roamed all over the heavens before my return
The Buddha then using both foresight and deception Crushed and held me at the ends of the heavens
After a period of over five hundred years My body was delivered and I could once more play up
Guarding the Tang Priest on his journey to the West Brother Sun Wukong is very intelligent
I subdue the demons on the Westward road
Every evil spirit is struck with terror When the demon king heard him tell that he was Sun Wukong he said So you're the soandso who made havoc in Heaven
If you were released to guard the Tang Priest on his journey West then you should be an your way there Why are you being such a busybody and making trouble for me You're acting as if you were the slave of Purpuria By coming here you've thrown your life away Thieving damned monster Monkey shouted back
You don't know what you're talking about I was politely invited to help by the king of Purpuria
He addressed me very respectfully and treated me well I'm a thousand times higher than that king He treated me as if I were his father and mother or a god How can you say I'm acting like a slave
I'll get you you monster for bullying your superiors and trying to push your master around
Stay there and take this from your grandpa The monster then moved his hands and feet as fast as he could dodged the blow from the cudgel and struck back at Brother Monkey's face with his flowerscattering axe
It was a fine battle
Just watch Journey to the West The goldbanded AsYouWill cudgel The flowerscattering axe and its windkeen blade
One ground his teeth with terrible ferocity The other gnashed his molars and displayed his might
One was the Great Sage Equaling Heaven descended to earth The other an evil demon king come down to the lower world
Both snorted out clouds and shining mists that lit up the heavenly palace Sent stones and sand flying that blotted out the Dipper
They came and went through many a movement Twisting and turning and giving off golden light
Each used all of his talents to the full Both staked the whole of their magical powers
One wanted to take the queen back to the capital The other would happily have stayed with her in the cave
There was no deep reason for the struggle He was ready to give his life for the sake of the king
When the two of them had fought fifty rounds without result the demon king realized that Monkey was too strong a fighter for him to be able to beat Blocking the iron cudgel with his axe the demon said Stop Sun the Novice
I haven't had my breakfast yet today
Let me eat then I'll have it out with you Monkey was well aware that he wanted to fetch the bells so he put his cudgel away and said A hero doesn't chase an exhausted hare Off you go
Have a good meal and get ready to come back and die The demon quickly turned and rushed inside where he said to the queen Get me my treasures at once What for she asked
The man challenging me to battle this morning was a disciple of the monk who's going to fetch the scriptures he said He's called Sun Wukong or Sun the Novice and Grand Par was just a nickname
I've been battling it out with him all this time but still there's no outcome
Just wait while I take my treasures out and set off smoke and flames to burn that ape These words made the queen feel very uneasy
If she didn't Journey to the West fetch the bells she was worried that he might be suspicious but if she did she feared that Sun the Novice would be killed
As she was hesitating the demon king pressed her again
Hurry up and fetch them She had no choice but to undo the lock bring out the three bells and hand them to the demon king who took them and went outside the cave again
The queen sat in the inner quarters her tears pouring down like rain as she thought that Monkey would not possibly be able to escape with his life
Neither of them realized that the bells were only copies
Once outside the cave the demon stood upwind and shouted Stay where you are Sun the Novice
Watch while I ring these bells You have your bells but why shouldn't I have mine Monkey replied
You can ring yours so why shouldn't I ring mine What bells have you got the demon king asked
Show me Monkey pinched his iron cudgel to make it into an embroidery needle that he tucked into his ear then brought out the three real treasures from at his waist
Here are my purple gold bells he said to the demon king
The sight of them came as a shock to the demon That's funny he thought very funny
Why are his bells exactly the same as mine
Even if they'd been cast from the same mould they'd not have been properly smoothed you'd expect some extra marks or missing knobs
How can they be identical with this Where did you get your bells from he went on to ask again
Where are yours from dear nephew Monkey replied
Being honest the demon king replied These bells of mine Come from deep in the Way of the Immortal of Great Purity Are made of gold long refined in the Eight Trigrams Furnace Formed into bells renowned as ultimate treasures Left by Lord Lao Zi till the present day That's where my bells come from too Monkey replied with a smile
How were they made the demon king asked
These bells of mine said Monkey Were made of gold refined in the furnace Journey to the West When Lord Lao Zi made elixir in the Tushita Palace
They are cyclical treasures The two threes make six
Mine are the female and yours are the male The bells are golden elixir treasures the demon king said not birds or beasts They can't be male or female
As long as they yield what's precious when they're rung they're good ones Words prove nothing said Monkey Show it by actions
Shake yours first The demon king then rang his first bell three times No fire came out
He rang his second three times No smoke came out
He rang his third three times and no sand came out either Very odd he said making wild gestures very odd
The world's changed These bells must be henpecked When the males see the females they don't dare to do their stuff Stop nephew said Monkey
Now I'm going to shake mine to show you what happens The splendid ape then grasped all three bells in one hand and rang them together
Watch as clouds of red flames black smoke and yellow sand all come gushing out setting the trees and the mountain ablaze
Monkey then said the words of another spell and shouted Wind towards the Southeast and a wind did indeed spring up that fanned the flames
With the power of the wind behind them the flames and smoke filled the heavens blazing red and deepest black and the earth was covered by the yellow sandstorm
The Evil Star Matcher's souls fled from his body in his terror but he had nowhere to turn amid that fire there was no way of escaping with his life
Then a penetrating shout was heard from midair
Sun Wukong I am here Monkey quickly looked up and saw that it was the Bodhisattva Guanyin holding her vase of pure water in her left hand and a sprig of willow in her right with which to sprinkle sweet dew and put out the flames
In his alarm Monkey hid the bells at his waist put the palms of his hands together and prostrated himself in a kowtow
The Bodhisattva flicked a few drops of sweet dew from her willow sprig and in an instant both flames and smoke disappeared while no sign of the yellow sand remained to be seen
I did not realize Most Merciful One that you were coming down to the mortal world said Brother Monkey as he kowtowed and it was wrong of me to fail to keep out of your way
May I venture to ask where you are going Bodhisattva I am here especially to find and take this evil monster the Bodhisattva replied
What is the monster's background and how can he put you to the trouble of capturing him in your illustrious person Monkey asked
He is a goldenhaired giant hound on which I used to ride the Bodhisattva replied
The boy in charge of it fell asleep and failed to keep proper guard over it so that the wicked beast bit through its iron chains and escaped to save the king of Purpuria from disaster When Monkey heard this he hastily bowed and said You have it the wrong way round Bodhisattva He's been mistreating the king and his queen and thus damaging public morality
So how can you say that he has saved the king from disaster when in fact he has brought him disaster Journey to the West You would not know the Bodhisattva replied that when the previous king of Purpuria was reigning and the present king was the crown prince and had not yet taken the throne he was a superb archer and huntsman
Once he led his men and horses hunting with falcon and hound They came to the Fallen Phoenix Slope where a young peacock and peahen two children of the Buddha's mother in the West the Bodhisattva Maurya Vidya Rani were resting When the king shot with his bow he wounded the cock while the hen died with an arrow still in her
After the Buddha's mother realized to her regret what had happened she ordered that the prince should be separated from his wife for three years and suffer himself the way birds do when they are parted from their mates
At the time I was riding that hound and we both heard her say that
I never imagined that the beast would remember it and come back to mistreat the queen and thus save the king from disaster
That was three years ago and now that the misdeed has been paid for it was fortunate that you came along to cure the king
I am here to recover the wicked and evil creature Bodhisattva said Monkey this may well be so but he did sully the queen damage public morality offend ethics and break the law You can't let him off a noncapital punishment
Let me give him twenty blows before handing him over for you to take back Wukong said the Bodhisattva as you know I am here you really ought to show me the respect I deserve and spare him completely This still counts as one of your successes in subduing a demon
If you hit him with your cudgel it'll kill him Monkey dared not disobey but bowed and said If you're taking him back to the ocean with you Bodhisattva you mustn't let him escape and come down to the human world again
That would be quite a catastrophe Only then did the Bodhisattva shout Wicked beast Turn back into your own form
What are you waiting for The monster could be seen doing a roll and turning back into himself Then he shook his fur for the Bodhisattva to mount on his back
The Bodhisattva looked down at his neck to see that the three golden bells were missing
Wukong she said give me my bells back I don't know where they are Monkey said
Thieving ape the Bodhisattva shouted
If you hadn't stolen those bells then ten Sun Wukongs never mind one would have dared go nowhere near him
Hand them over at once I really haven't seen them Monkey replied with a smile
In that case I'll have to recite the Bandtightening Spell said the Bodhisattva
This scared Monkey who could only plead Don't say it don't say it
The bells are here This was indeed a case of Who could untie the bells from neck of the giant hound
To find that out ask the one who first fastened them on
The Bodhisattva then placed the bells round the giant hound's neck and flew up to her high throne
Watch as the Journey to the West Fourstalked lotus flowers blazed with fire Her whole body was thickly clad in cloth of gold
We will say no more of how the Great Merciful One returned to the Southern Ocean
The Great Sage Sun Wukong then tidied up his clothing and charged into the Horndog Gave swinging his iron cudgel and killing to his heart's content
He wiped all the demons out till he reached the inner quarters of the palace and asked the Golden Queen to go back to her country
She prostrated herself to him for a long time Monkey told her all about how the Bodhisattva had subdued the demon and why she had been separated from her husband
Then he gathered some soft grasses that he twisted together into a long straw dragon Sit on this ma'am he said and shut your eyes Don't be afraid
I'm taking you back to court to see your master The queen followed his instructions carefully while he used his magic power There was a sound of the wind whistling in her ears
An hour later he brought her into the city
Bringing his cloud down he said Open your eyes ma'am When the queen opened her eyes and looked she recognized the phoenix buildings and dragon towers She was very happy and getting off the straw dragon she climbed the steps of the throne hall
When the king saw her he came straight down from his dragon throne to take the queen by her jade hand He was just going to tell her how much he had missed her when he suddenly collapsed shouting My hand hurts my hand hurts Look at that mug Pig said roaring with laughter he's out of luck No joy for him
The moment he meets her again he gets stung Idiot said Monkey would you dare grab her What if I did Pig asked
The queen's covered with poisonous spikes Monkey replied and she has poison on her hands
In the three years she was with the Evil Star Matcher in Mount Unicorn the monster never had her If he had his whole body would have been in agony
Even touching her with his hand made his hand ache Then what is to be done about it the officials asked
While all the officials were wondering what to do in the outer palace and the consorts and concubines in the inner palace were full of terror the Jade and the Silver Queen helped their king to his feet
Amidthe general alarm a voice was heard in the sky shouting Great Sage I'm here Brother Monkey looked up and this is what was to be seen The cry of a crane soaring through the heavens Then flying straight down to the palace of the king
Journey to the West Beams of auspicious light shone about Clouds of holy vapors drifted all around
Mists came from the cloak of coconut that covered his body Rare were the straw sandals on which he trod
The flywhisk in his hand was made of dragon whiskers And silken tassels hung around his waist
He joined human destinies together throughout heaven and earth As he roamed free and easy all over the world
He was the Purple Clouds Immortal of the Daluo Heaven Come down to earth today to lift an enchantment
Monkey went over to him to greet him with Where are you going Zhang Boduan of the Ziyang sect The True Man of Ziyang came to the front of the hall bowed and replied Great Sage the humble immortal Zhang Boduan greets you Where have you come from Monkey replied
Three years ago I passed this way when going to a Buddha assembly the True Man said When I saw that the King of Purpuria was suffering the agony of being parted from his wife I was worried that the demon would defile the queen That would have been an affront to morality and made it hard for the queen to be reunited with the king later on So I turned an old coconut cloak into a new dress of many colours and gave it to the demon king
He made the queen wear it as her wedding dress As soon as she put it on poisonous barbs grew all over her body
They were the coconut cloak
Now that you have been successful Great Sage I've come to lift the spell In that case said Monkey thank you for coming so far
Please remove the barbs at once The True Man stepped forward pointed at the queen and removed the coconut cloak
The queen's body was once more as it had originally been
The True Man shook the cloak put it over his shoulders and said to Monkey Please forgive me if I leave now Great Sage Don't go yet said Monkey
Wait till the king has thanked you I won't trouble him said the True Man with a smile then raised his hands together in salute rose up into the sky and went
The king queen and the officials high and low were so astonished that they all bowed to the sky
Journey to the West When the bowing was over the king ordered that the Eastern hall of the palace be thrown open so that they could give thanks to the four monks
The king led all his officials to go down on their knees and kowtow to them and husband and wife were reunited
In the middle of the celebratory banquet Monkey said Master bring out that declaration of war The venerable elder produced it from his sleeve and handed it to Monkey who passed it in turn to the king
This was a letter that the demons sent his lieutenant to deliver Monkey said
He was the officer I killed and brought here as a trophy
Then I turned myself into the officer and went back to the cave to report That was how I saw Her Majesty and stole the golden bells
He almost caught me but I did another change stole them again got them out and fought him
It was lucky for him that the Bodhisattva Guanyin came to collect him and tell me why you and Her Majesty were parted He told the whole story from beginning to end in great detail
Everyone in the countrywhether ruler or ministers whether within the palace or outsideexpressed admiration and gratitude
In the first place said the Tang Priest it was because of Your Majesty's own good fortune and in the second place it was thanks to my disciple's efforts
We are deeply obliged to you for this sumptuous banquet today and now we must take our leave of you
Please do not delay us poor monks on our pilgrimage to the West When the king realized that his efforts to keep them there would be of no avail he inspected and returned the passport and arranged a great procession of royal coaches
The Tang Priest was invited to sit in his own dragon carriage while the king his queens and his consorts themselves all pushed it along as they saw them on their way then bade them farewell
Indeed He was fated to have his melancholy washed clean away The mind finds peace of itself when thought and worrying cease
If you do not know what of good or ill lay in store for them on the way ahead listen to the explanation in the next installment
The Seven Emotions Confuse the Basic in Gossamer Cave At FilthCleansing Spring Pig Forgets Himself The story tells how Sanzang took his leave of the king of Purpuria got everything ready saddled the horse and headed Westwards
They crossed many a mountain and river Before they realized it autumn and winter were over and spring's brightness and charm were back
Master and disciples were enjoying the scenery as their way led them across the greenery when they suddenly noticed a building amid trees
Sanzang dismounted and stood beside the main track
Master Brother Monkey asked the road is easy and there is no evil about so why have you stopped Journey to the West You aren't at all understanding brother Pig said
The master is feeling sleepy after being in the saddle for so long
You ought to let him come down and have a rest It's not that Sanzang said I can see a house over there
I was thinking of going there myself to beg for some food What a thing for the master to say said Monkey with a smile If you want some food I'll go and beg some for you
As the saying goes 'Your teacher for a day is your father for the rest of your life' It would be outrageous for me your disciple to sit here idly and let my master go begging There's no need to say that Sanzang replied
Usually you three have to cross enormous distances as far as the eye can see to beg for our food
Today there's a house so close it's in shouting distance so let me beg this time But Master you wouldn't know what to do said Pig
As the saying goes when three people go travelling it's the youngest who does the rough jobs
You're the senior one and we're all only disciples
As the old book says 'When there is a job to be done the disciple does it' Let me go Disciples said Sanzang the weather is good today
It's not at all like the times when you all have to go far away in wind and rain
Let me go to this house
Whether I get any food or not I shall soon be back and we shall be on our way Friar Sand who was standing beside them smiled and said Stop arguing so much brother As the master has made his mind up you shouldn't disobey him
If you upset him he won't eat any of the food you are able to beg Pig accepted this suggestion and brought out the begging bowl and a change of hat and cassock for the master who went straight to the farm building to look at it It really was a fine place
He could see A highrising stone bridge Ancient trees growing close together
Where the stone bridge rose high A babbling brook joined a long stream Amid closegrowing ancient trees Hidden birds sang sweetly on the distant hill
Across the bridge were several thatched houses As pure and elegant as an immortal's hermitage
There was also a thatched hut So pure and white it would put a Taoist temple to shame
Journey to the West Before the hut could be seen four beauties All busily embroidering phoenix designs
As there were no males but only these four girls to be seen the reverend gentleman did not dare go inside but slipped back under the tall trees and stood stock still
He could see that each of the girls Were rockhard in their ladylike propriety And happy as the spring in their orchid natures
Red glows set off their tender cheeks Crimson makeup was spread on their lips
Their moth brows were as fine as a crescent moon While their clouds of hair were piled up like cicada wings
Had any of them stood among the flowers Wandering bees would have taken them for blossoms
He stood there for an hour The silence was complete unbroken by dog or cock
If I'm not even capable of begging us a meal my disciples will laugh at me he thought If the master can't beg a meal what hope do his disciples have of ever getting to see the Buddha He did not know what to do but it seemed wrong to stay there any longer so he went back towards the bridge only to notice a pavilion inside the compound of thatched cottages
In the pavilion three more girls were juggling a ball with their feet Look at them
They were different from the other four
Their turquoise sleeves are waving And their embroidered skirts are swaying
The waving turquoise sleeves Cover their delicate jade bambooshoots of fingers The swaying embroidered skirts Half show their tiny golden lotus feet
Journey to the West Perfect are their faces and bodies Endless the movements of their slippered heels
As they grab for the head they vary in height They pass the ball around most smoothly
One turns around and kicks an overthewall flower Then does a backward somersault called crossing the sea After lightly taking a pass like a lump of clay A single spear is hard pressed by a pair of sticks
A shining pearl is put on the Buddha's head And held between the tips of their fingers
Skillfully they hold the ball as a narrow brick Twisting their feet in the sleeping fish position
Their backs held level they squat with bended knee Turning their necks they kick their heels in the air
They can make benches fly around Very stylish are the capes upon their shoulders
Their trouserlegs are bound with tapes to let them move While their necklaces swing as they sway
They kick the ball like the Yellow River flowing backwards Or goldfish purchased on the beach
When you mistake one of them for the leader Another one turns to carry the ball away
They all hold their calves so trimly in the air Pointing their toes to catch the ball
They raise their heels to spin straw sandals Planting them upsidedown and picking them up in a turn
Journey to the West As they step back their shouldercapes spread out Fastened only with a hook
The peddler's basket comes down long and low Then they grab for the goal
At the really magnificent footwork All the beauties shout with admiration
The silken clothes of all are soaked in sweat Feeling tired and relaxed they ended their game
The description could go on and on
There is another poem that tells more Kicking the ball in the April weather Beauties blown along by the magical wind
Sweat stained their powdered faces like dew on a flower The dust on their moth eyebrows was mist hiding willows
Their turquoise sleeves hanging low covered jade fingers Trailing embroidered skirts showed golden lotus feet
After kicking the ball many times they were charmingly tired Their hair was disheveled and their topknots askew
After watching for a long time Sanzang could only go to the bridge and call loudly Bodhisattvas fate brings me here as a poor monk to beg for the gift of some food As soon as the women heard him they cheerfully put aside their needlework and balls to come out smiling and giggling through the gates to greet him Reverend sir they said we're sorry we didn't welcome you sooner
As you have come to our poor farm we couldn't possibly feed you on the path
Please come inside and sit down When Sanzang heard this he thought Splendid this is splendid
The West really is Buddha's land If even these womenfolk are so diligent about feeding monks the men are bound to be pious followers of the Buddha Journey to the West Sanzang stepped forward to greet the women and followed them into the thatched cottages
As he passed the pavilion and looked he saw that on the other side of it there were no buildings
All that could be seen were Towering mountaintops Distant ranges of the earth
The towering mountaintops touch the clouds The distant ranges of the earth lead to peaks in the ocean
From the stone bridge by the gates One looks on a stream that bends nine times The peach and plum trees in the orchard Vie in abundance of blossom
Creepers and vines hang from three or four trees The fragrance of orchids is spread by thousands of flowers
From afar this retreat rivals Penglai's fairyland Seen from close to the mountain beats Tai and Hua
This is truly a retreat for demon immortals An isolated house with no neighbors around
One woman came forward to push the stone gates open and invite the Tang Priest to come in and sit down
All he could do was go inside
When he looked up he saw that the tables and seats were all of stone and the atmosphere was oppressively cold
This alarmed the venerable elder who thought This is a thoroughly sinister place
I'm sure it's evil Please sit down venerable elder the women all said with simpering smiles
He had no choice but to sit down
A little later he found himself shuddering
What monastery are you from reverend sir the women asked
For what purpose are you collecting alms
Are you repairing roads and bridges founding monasteries worshipping at pagodas or having Buddha statues made and sutras printed
Won't you show us your donation book I am not a monk collecting donations the venerable elder replied
If you're not here to ask for charity then why are you here the women asked
We have been sent by Great Tang in the East to the Thunder Monastery in the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures Sanzang replied
Journey to the West As our stomachs were empty when we happened to be passing this distinguished place I have come to beg a vegetarian meal from you in your kindness After that we poor monks will be on our way again Splendid splendid the women all said
As the saying goes monks from afar most love to read the scriptures
Sisters We must treat them well
Let's give them some vegetarian food as quickly as we can While three of the women kept him company talking about such matters as primary and secondary causation the other four went into the kitchen where they tucked up their clothes rolled up their sleeves fanned the fire and scrubbed the cooking pots
Do you know what it was they prepared
They were frying in human fat and what they cooked was human flesh stewed into black paste as if it were wheat gluten and human brain cut out to fry like pieces of beancurd
Then they placed the two dishes on a stone table and said to Sanzang Do eat
We were too rushed to prepare anything good so please make do with this It'll stave off the pangs of hunger
There will be some more dishes to follow As soon as Sanzang used his nose and smelled the stench of flesh he would not eat but bowed with his hands together be re his chest and said Bodhisattvas I have been a vegetarian since birth But this is vegetarian food reverend sir the women all replied with smiles
Amitabha Buddha exclaimed Sanzang
If as a monk I ate vegetarian food like that I would never have any hope of seeing the Buddha or fetching the surras Reverend sir the women said as a monk you shouldn't be so choosy about what you're given I never could be Sanzang said I never could be
I am under the orders of the Great Tang emperor to harm not even the tiniest life to save all I see suffering to put all the foodgrain I am given into my mouth with my fingers and to cover my body with the threads of silk that come my way
I would never dare pick and choose among my benefactors' gifts Even if you're not picking and choosing the women replied with smiles you do seem to have come here to complain
Please eat some of the food and don't mind if it's a little coarse and flavorless It's not that I don't want to eat it Sanzang said it's that I'm afraid I'd be breaking my vows
I hope that you Bodhisattvas will remember that setting living beings free is better than keeping them with you and let me go on my way As Sanzang struggled to get out the women blocked the gateway and refused to let him go Business bringing itself to our door they all said
You've no more chance of getting away from here than of covering up a fart with your hands
Where do you think you're going They were all quite skilled in the martial arts and quick movers too and after they had grabbed Sanzang they dragged him like a sheep and threw him to the ground
Then they all held him down tied him up and suspended him from the rafters
There is a special name for the way they hung him up there The Immortal Shows the Way
One hand was strung up by a rope so that it pointed forward
The other hand was fastened to his waist by another rope that was also holding him aloft and his legs were both held up by a third rope behind him
The three ropes had him suspended from a beam with his back on top and his belly pointing down
Journey to the West As Sanzang endured the agony and held back his tears he thought with bitter regret How evil my destiny is I thought I was coming to beg for a vegetarian meal from good people I never imagined I'd be falling into the fiery pit
Disciples Rescue me as soon as you can if I am ever to see you again If you don't get here within four hours I shall be dead Despite his misery Sanzang kept a careful eye on the women
When they had him tied up securely and hanging there they started to remove their clothes
This alarmed the venerable elder who thought They must be taking their clothes off because they are going to beat me
Perhaps they are going to eat me too The women only unbuttoned their gauze blouses exposing their stomachs Then each of them produced a silken rope about as thick as a duck egg from her navel These they made move like bursting jade or flying silver as they fastened the gates of the farm
We leave them and go back to Monkey Pig and Friar Sand who were all still waiting by the main road While the other two were pasturing the horse and looking after the baggage Monkey was amusing himself by leaping from tree to tree and climbing around the branches as he picked leaves and looked for fruit
Suddenly he turned round and saw a sheet of light This so alarmed him that he jumped out of the tree with a shout of This is terrible Terrible
The master's luck is out He pointed as he continued Look at the farm
What do you think When Pig and Friar Sand both looked they saw a sheet of something like snow but brighter and like silver but shinier That's done it said Pig that's done it
The master's run into evil spirits We'd better go and rescue him straight away Stop yelling brother said Monkey Neither of you can see just what's there
Wait while I go and take a look Do be careful brother said Friar Sand
I can cope Monkey replied
The splendid Great Sage tightened his tigerskin kilt pulled out his goldbanded cudgel and took a few strides forward to see that the silken ropes had formed something like a web with thousands of strands
When he felt it with his hands it was somewhat soft and sticky
Not knowing what it was Monkey raised his cudgel and said Never mind thousands of strands
This cudgel could break through tens of thousands of them He was just about to strike when he stopped to think If they were hard I could certainly smash them but then soft ones would only be knocked flat and if I alarm the demons and get caught myself that would be a disaster
I'd better make some enquiries before I do any hitting Who do you think he asked
He made a spell with his hands said the words of it and sent for an old local god who ran round and round in his shrine just as if turning a mill
Old man his wife asked what are you rushing round and round for
You must be having a fit You don't understand the local god replied
There's a Great Sage Equaling Heaven here I didn't go to meet him
But he's sending for me Go and see him then his wife replied and that'll be that
Why charge round and round in here Journey to the West But if I go and see him that cudgel of his hits very hard the local deity said
He doesn't care what you're likehe just hits you He won't possibly hit you when he sees how old you are his wife replied
He's been cadging free drinks all his life the local god said and he really loves hitting old people After talking for a while with his wife the local god had no choice but to go outside and kneel shivering and shaking by the roadside calling out Great Sage the local deity kowtows to you Get up Brother Monkey replied and stop pretending to be so keen
I'm not going to hit you I'm just passing through
Tell me where this is Which way have you come Great Sage the local deity asked
I've come from the East and I'm heading West said Monkey
Which mountain have you reached on your journey from the East the local deity asked
That ridge there Monkey replied
Our baggage and the horse are there aren't they That is Gossamer Ridge the local deity replied
Under the ridge there's a cave called Gossamer Cave where seven evil spirits live Male or female ones Monkey asked
Shedevils the local deity replied
How powerful is their magic Monkey asked
I'm much too weak and insignificant to know that the local god replied
All I can tell you is that a mile due South of here there is a natural hot spring called the Filthcleansing Spring the local god said where the Seven Fairies from on high used to bathe
When the seven evil spirits settled here and took over the Filthcleansing Spring the good spirits didn't try to fight them for it They let the spirits have it for nothing
I reckon that if even good spirits from Heaven don't dare offend them the evil spirits must have tremendous powers What have they taken the spring over for Monkey asked
Ever since taking the bathing pool over the monsters have been coming to bathe there three times a day the local god replied It's already after eleven
They'll be along at noon Go back now local god Monkey said when he heard all this and wait while I capture them The old local god kowtowed to him and went back to his shrine all of a tremble
The Great Sage then gave a solo display of his magical powers shaking himself turning into a fly and landing on the tip of a blade of grass to wait beside the path
A little later he heard a rustling hissing sound like that of silkworms eating leaves or an ocean tide coming in
In the time it takes to drink half a cup of tea the silken ropes had all gone and the farm looked just the same as it had before
Then there was a creaking noise as the wicker gate opened and the seven women came out laughing and talking noisily
Monkey watched carefully from where he was hiding and saw them talking and laughing as they held each other by the Journey to the West hand and walked shoulder to shoulder across the bridge They were real beauties
Compare them with jade and they were more fragrant They were like flowers but able to talk
Their willowy brows were like distant hills Sandalwoodscented mouths were bursting cherries
Hair ornaments were of jade Golden lotus feet darted out under crimson skirts
They were like the moon goddess come down to earth Immortal girls descending to the world
No wonder the master wanted to come begging for food thought Monkey with a laugh with all these lovelies here
If these seven beauties have captured him he won't be enough for a single meal for them They couldn't make him last a couple of days
And if they take it in turns to have their way with him they'll kill him straight off
I'd better go and listen to what they're plotting The splendid Great Sage flew over with a highpitched buzz and landed on the topknot of the woman who was walking in front
When she was over the bridge the women behind her caught up with her and called out Sister let's have a bath before we steam the fat monk and eat him up These monsters aren't at all economical Monkey smiled to himself They'd save a lot of firewood if they boiled him
Why steam him instead The women walked South picking flowers and throwing grass at each other and were soon at the bathing pool where a very magnificent wall and gateway appeared with fragrant flowers among them a bed of orchids growing all around
One of the women behind him stepped forward and with a whistling sound pushed the double gates open revealing the pond of naturally hot water inside
As for this water When heaven and earth were first separated There were ten suns in the sky Till Yi the fine archer Shot nine of the suncrows down to the earth Leaving only one golden crow star The true fire of the sun
Journey to the West The nine hot springs in heaven and earth Are the other nine crows transformed
These nine hot springs are Cool Fragrance Spring Mountaincompanions Spring Warm Spring Donghe Spring Mount Huang Spring Xiao'an Spring Guangfen Spring Hot Water Spring And this Filthcleansing Spring
There is a poem about it that goes
The same vital force runs in all four seasons Spring continues throughout the autumn
The scalding water bubbles like a cauldron The snowwhite waves are boiling hot
If the waters are spread they help the crops to grow Left where they are they wash worldly dust away
Little bubbles spread out like pearls Rolling ones rise like pieces of jade
It is rich and smooth although not wine Clear calm and naturally warm The whole place thrives on its air of good omen
It brings good fortune and the natural truth
When the beauties wash their flesh is smooth as ice Journey to the West As dirt is soaked away their jadelike bodies are made new
The bathing pool was about fifty feet across a hundred feet long and four feet deep The water was pure and translucent and from the bottom of it came up bubbles like rolling pearls or floating jade
In the four sides of the pool there were six or seven pipes through which the water flowed out keeping warm even when it reached fields up to a mile away
Beside the pool was a threeroomed pavilion next to the back wall of which stood an eightlegged bench
At each end of the pavilion was a clothes stand painted in coloured lacquers
All this secretly delighted Monkey who flew straight to one of the stands and landed on it
When the women saw how clear and warm the water was they wanted to bathe in it so they all took their clothes off and hung them on the stands before going into the pool together This is what Monkey saw They undid the buttons on their clothes Loosened the knots in their gauzy sashes
Silvery white were their creamy breasts Snowy their bodies that looked like jade
Their arms and elbows were cool as ice And scented shoulders more lovely than if powdered
Soft and supple the skin on their stomachs Glistening and clean their backs
Their knees and wrists were rounded and soft Only three inches long were their golden lotus feet
And as for what lay in between They showed a glimpse of the cave of pleasure
The women all jumped into the water and enjoyed themselves as they frolicked in the waves
If I wanted to hit them Monkey thought I'd only need to stir the water with my cudgel It would be like pouring boiling water on a nest of mice I could kill the lot of them
What a pity
If I hit them I'd kill them but it wouldn't do my reputation any good
As they say a real man doesn't fight women
It'd be hopeless if a man like me killed these girls
If I'm not going to hit them I'll have to make things difficult for them so that they can't move The splendid Great Sage made a spell with his hands said the words of it shook himself and turned into a hungry eagle
Journey to the West His feathers were like frost or snow His eyes like bright stars
When evil foxes saw him their souls were scared out of them And crafty hares were struck with terror
His steely claws were sharp as spearpoints His air was both majestic and ferocious
He used his talons to seize his food And was ready to catch his flying prey himself
He could fly high and low across the chilly sky Swooping through clouds and on his quarry at will
With a whoosh of his wings he flew towards them stretched his sharp talons to seize all seven sets of clothes that were hung on the stands and flew straight back to the ridge with them Here he reverted to his own form to see Pig and Friar Sand
Just look at the idiot as he comes up to Brother Monkey and says with a grin The master must have been taken to a pawnbroker's How can you tell asked Friar Sand
Can't you see all those clothes our brother's grabbed Pig replied
These are the evil spirits' clothes said Monkey putting them down
How on earth did you get so many Pig asked
There are seven outfits said Monkey
How did you strip them so easily and strip them naked at that Pig asked
I didn't have to strip them said Monkey
This place is called Gossamer Ridge and the farm is called Gossamer Gave
The seven shedevils who live there captured the master hung him up in their cave and all went off to bathe in the Filthcleansing Spring
It's a natural hot spring
Their plan was to have a bath then steam the master and eat him
I went there with them and watched them undress and get into the water I wanted to hit them but I was worried it would contaminate my cudgel and ruin my reputation so I didn't I just turned myself into a hungry eagle and grabbed their clothes in my talons
Now they're all squatting in the water too embarrassed to come out
Let's rescue the master and be on our way as quickly as we can Brother grinned Pig you always leave something undone
You could see that they were evil spirits so why didn't you kill them first then rescue the master
Even if they're too embarrassed to come out now they'll Journey to the West certainly come out after nightfall
They're bound to have enough old clothes at home to be able to put on an outfit each and come after us
Even if they don't come after us they live here permanently and we'll have to come this way back after we've fetched the scriptures
As the saying goes it's better to get into debt on a journey than to get into a fight
When they stop us and make a row they'll really have it in for us So what do you suggest Monkey asked
If you ask me we should kill the demons then rescue the master said Pig
That's what's called cutting down weeds and digging them out by the roots I'm not going to hit them Monkey replied
If you want them hit go and do it yourself Pig then summoned up his spirits and in high delight rushed straight there his rake held aloft
As he suddenly pushed the gates open and looked inside he saw the seven women squatting in the water and wildly cursing the eagle Feathery beast they were saying catheaded monster What the hell can we do now you've carried our clothes off Pig could not help laughing as he said to them Bodhisattvas carry on with your bath
Do you mind if I join you You monk you're disgrace the devils retorted angrily as they saw him
We're laywomen and you're a man of religion
As the ancient book has it 'From the age of seven boys and girls do not share the same mat' You mustn't possibly bathe in the same pool as us But the weather's so scorching hot I've got no choice said Pig You'll have to make the best of it and let me take a wash
What do you have to show off all that booklearning about sharing mats for With further argument the idiot dropped his rake stripped off his cotton tunic and jumped in with a splash to the fury of the demons who all rushed at him to hit him
Little did they realize how expert Pig was in the water Once in the pool he shook himself and turned into a catfish spirit
The demons then tried to grab him but even when they caught him they could not get a firm grip
If they grabbed to the East he suddenly shot Westwards and if they tried to grab him to the West he went East
The funny thing was that he kept wriggling around their crotches
The water was about chesthigh and after swimming around at the surface and then at the bottom of the pool for a while he had covered all of it and was panting and exhausted
Only then did Pig jump out turn back into himself put his tunic back on pick up his rake and shout Who am I then
You thought I was a catfish spirit At the sight of him the demons all trembled with fright and said to Pig When you came here first you were a monk then you turned into a catfish in the water and we couldn't catch you Now you've dressed like that Where have you come from
You must tell us your name Bloody demons you really don't know who I am said Pig
I'm a disciple of the Venerable Tang Priest who has been sent from Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures My title is Marshal Tian Peng and I'm called Zhu Wuneng or Pig
You've hung my master up in your cave and you're planning to steam him and eat him
Is my master just a meal for you to cook
Stretch your heads out at once I'm going to smash you all with my rake and wipe the lot of you out Journey to the West At this the demons were scared out of their wits
They fell to their knees in the water kowtowed to him and said Please be kind reverend sir
We were blind and we captured your master by mistake Although we did hang him up we haven't tortured him
We beg you in your compassion to spare our lives We'll gladly give you some money for the journey and send your master on his way to the Western Heaven Cut that talk out said Pig waving his hands It's quite right what they say
'Once you've been tricked by a confectioner you won't believe sweettalkers again' I'm going to hit you with my rake then we can all go our separate ways The idiot was thoroughly rough and crude and wanted to show off his powers
He was unmoved by their fragrant feminine beauty Raising his rake he charged them lashing out wildly without caring what he was doing
The demons acted desperately Forgetting about their modesty they cared only about saving their lives as covering their private parts with their hands they jumped out of the water and ran into the pavilion Standing there they used magic to make thick silken ropes come out of their navels filling the sky with a huge silken canopy under which Pig was caught
When the idiot looked up he could not see the sun in the heavens He tried to run outside but he could not lift his feet which were tangled in silken ropes that covered the ground
When he tried to move his feet he tripped and staggered
He tried going left but his head crashed to the ground then tried going right and came a cropper
So he turned round as quickly as he could and kissed the dirt got himself back on his feet and collapsed head first once more
Goodness only knows how many times he stumbled and fell till his whole body was numb his feet sore his head aching and his eyes blurred He could no longer even crawl but lay groaning on the floor
Then the demons tied him up They neither beat him up nor wounded him but sprang outside to rush back to their cave leaving the silken canopy to blot out the daylight
When they reached the stone bridge they stopped and said the words of a spell In an instant the silk canopy had been put away and they all rushed stark naked into the cave covering their private parts with their hands as they ran giggling past the Tang Priest
Once inside their bedrooms carved out of the rock they put on old clothes and went straight to the back door of the cave where they stood and called Where are you children Now each shedevil had a child not one that she had borne but an adopted child who had taken her as a mother
They were called Bee Hornet Cockroach Spanishfly Grasshopper Waxinsect and Dragonfly for such they were
The evil spirits had spread their nets across the sky caught these seven insects and been on the point of eating them
But as the old saying goes Birds have bird language and beasts have beast language The insects had pleaded for their lives and volunteered to take the spirits as their own mothers
Ever since then they had gathered blossoms in the spring and summer flowers for the evil spirits and as soon as they heard the shouts they appeared and asked What orders do you have for us mothers Sons the demons replied this morning we made a mistake and provoked the monk from Tang
His disciples trapped us in the pool and disgraced us We were almost killed
You must do your utmost Go outside and drive them away
When you've beaten them come to your uncle's to meet us The shedevils then fled for their lives and went to the home of their teacher's senior disciple where their wicked tongues were to give rise to more disasters but of that we shall not now speak
Watch while the insects rub their fists in their hands and go out to confront their enemies
Journey to the West Pig meanwhile whose head was spinning after falling over so often looked up and suddenly saw that the silken canopy and ropes had all disappeared Groping around he picked himself up and despite his pain he made his way back the way he had come
As soon as he saw Monkey he grabbed him and said Brother is my head bulging Is my face all blue What happened to you Monkey asked
Those damned creatures caught me under a silken net and tripped me up goodness knows how many times with silk ropes Pig replied My waist was twisted my back felt broken and I couldn't move an inch
Then the silk canopy and the ropes all disappeared so I could escape and come back Forget about it said Friar Sand when he saw him forget about it You asked for trouble
I'm sure the demons have all gone back to the cave to harm the master
We must go and rescue him straight away When Monkey heard this he set out at once as fast as he could and rushed back to the farm while Pig led the horse
Here the seven little devils could be seen standing on the bridge blocking their way and saying Not so fast not so fast
We're here What a joke said Pig when he saw them They're just a bunch of kids
They're only two foot five or six well under three foot and they can only weigh eight or nine pounds not even ten Who are you he shouted
We're the sons of the seven immortal ladies the little devils replied
You've insulted our mothers and now you've got the effrontery to attack us you ignorant fools Stay where you are and watch out The splendid monsters then launched a wild onslaught on Pig who was in a flaming temper after falling over so often
Seeing how tiny the insects were he lifted his rake to strike furious blows at them
When the little devils saw how ferocious the idiot was they all reverted to their original forms flew into the air and shouted Change In an instant each of them became ten each ten became a hundred each hundred became a thousand and each thousand became ten thousand Every one became a countless number
This is what could be seen The sky was full of waxflies Dragonflies danced all over the land
Bees and hornets went for the head Cockroaches jobbed at the eyes
Spanishflies bit before and behind While grasshoppers stung above and below
His face was black and crawling with insects Even devils or deities would have been scared by their speed
Journey to the West Brother said Pig in alarm you can say what you like about it being easy to fetch the scriptures but on this road to the West even the insects give you a bad time Don't be afraid brother said Monkey
Go for them But they're flying into my head and my face and all over my body replied Pig They're at least ten layers deep and all stinging me
How can I go for them No problem said Monkey no problem
I know a trick Whatever it is brother said Friar Sand use it right now
His shaven head has swollen up with those bites in no time at all The splendid Great Sage pulled out a handful of hairs chewed them into little bits and blew them out telling them to turn to golden eagles falcons hawks white eagles vultures ospreys and sparrowhawks
Brother said Pig what's that jargon about goldens and all that Something you don't know about Monkey replied
Golden eagles falcons hawks white eagles vultures ospreys and sparrowhawks are the seven birds of prey that my hairs turned into
That's because the shedevils' children are insects Because the birds were so good at catching insects they got one every time they opened their beaks grabbed at them with their claws or struck them with their wings They wiped all the insects out in an instant leaving no trace of them in the sky The ground was piled over a foot deep with their bodies
Only then could the three brothers charge across the bridge and into the cave where they found their master hanging groaning and sobbing in midair
Master said Pig going up to him are you hanging around here for fun I don't know how many times I've had to fall over on your account Untie the master before we take this conversation any further said Friar Sand
Brother Monkey then snapped the ropes and set the master free asking Where did the evil spirits go All seven of them ran stark naked through to the back the Tang Priest replied
They were calling for their sons After them brothers said Monkey
Follow me The three of them each holding his weapon went searching in the back garden but no sign of them could be found
They looked for them without success under all the peach and plum trees
They've gone said Pig they've gone We can stop looking for them said Friar Sand
I'm going to help the master away from here The three brothers then went back to the front where they asked the Tang Priest to mount up
You two help the master along the way said Pig I'm going to smash these buildings to the ground with my rake
Then they'll have nowhere to live when they come back Smashing the place would be too much effort said Monkey
The best way to cut off their roots would be to find some firewood The splendid idiot then gathered some dead pine brokenoff bamboo driedout willow and withered creepers that he set alight The roaring blaze destroyed everything
Only then did master and disciples feel easy enough to be on their way
If you don't know what of good or evil the demons were to do to them listen to the explanation in the next installment
Journey to the West The Emotions Bear a Grudge and Inflict Disaster The Heart's Master Smashes the Light When He Meets the Demons The story tells how the Great Sage Sun supported the Tang Priest as they hurried along the main road to the West together with Pig and Friar Sand
Within a few hours they were in sight of a compound with many tall towers and imposing buildings
Disciple said Sanzang reining in his horse what's that place Monkey looked up to gaze at it and this is what he saw
Tall towers girdled by hills Streams winding round pavilions
Dense grew the wood in front of the gates And outside the buildings the scent of flowers hung heavy
White egrets perched among the willows Like flawless jades half hidden in a mist Golden orioles sang in the peachtrees Flashes of gold in the fiery blossom
Wild deer in couples Trod lost to the world across cushions of greenery Pairs of mountain birds Sang as they flew among the red treetops
It was like the Tiantai Cave of Liu and Ruan And rivaled the home of the immortals in fairyland
Master Brother Monkey reported that's no princely palace or rich man's mansion It looks like a Taoist temple or Buddhist monastery
We'll know for sure when we get there On hearing this Sanzang whipped on his horse and when master and disciples reached the gates to look there was a stone tablet set over the gateway on which was written YELLOW FLOWER TEMPLE
Sanzang dismounted
Yellow Flower Temple means it's a Taoist place said Pig so it's all right for us to go in and see them Although we wear different clothes we cultivate our conduct the same way Journey to the West You're right said Friar Sand
We can go in and have a look round and at the same time the horse can have a feed
If it looks suitable we can arrange a meal for the master The master accepted their suggestions and the four of them went inside
A couplet was pasted up on either side of the inner gates Palace of immortals yellow shoots and white snow
Home of men who can fly rare and wonderful flowers
So the Taoist here refines drugs plays with a furnace and totes a crucible said Monkey with a grin
Watch your words said Sanzang giving him a pinch watch your words
We don't know them and they are no relations of ours This is only a passing encounter
Never mind what they are like Before he had finished saying these words he went in through the inner gate where he found the doors of the main hall shut tight and a Taoist master sitting under a covered walkway making elixir pills
Just look at how he was dressed On his head a bright red hat all set with gold On his body a jetblack Taoist robe On his feet a pair of deep green cloudtreading shoes Round his waist a brilliant yellow Lu Dongbin sash
His face was round like a golden melon His eyes like bright stars
His nose was as big and as high as a Muslim's And his lips turned back like a Tartar's
His heart set on the Way was hidden thunder He was a true immortal subduer of tigers and dragons
As soon as he saw him Sanzang shouted at the top of his voice My respectful greetings venerable Taoist master The Taoist looked up with a start and was so alarmed by what he saw that he dropped the elixir on which he was working Then he neatened his hairpins and clothes came down the steps and greeted Sanzang Venerable sir excuse me for failing to meet you
Please come inside and sit down The venerable elder happily went up into the Journey to the West main hall
On pushing the doors open he saw the statues of the Three Pure Ones and an altar on which stood incense burners and incense so he planted some josssticks in the burner and performed a triple set of obeisances to the Pure Ones before bowing to the Taoist master
He then went to the guest seats where he sat down with his disciples
Immortal boys were told to bring tea at once whereupon two boys went inside to fetch the teatray wash the teacups wipe the teaspoons and prepare some refreshments to eat with it Their rushing about soon disturbed the pilgrims' enemies
Now the seven devils from Gossamer Cave had been fellowstudents of the Taoist master here and it was here that they had hurried after putting on their old clothes and calling for their sons
They were making themselves new clothes at the back of the temple when they noticed the boys preparing the tea and asked What visitors have arrived boys
What are you in such a rush for Four Buddhist monks have just turned up the boys replied and the master has told us to prepare tea for them Is one of the monks pale and fat the shedevils asked
Yes Does one of them have a long snout and big ears they asked again
Yes Then take the tea in as quickly as you can the shedevils said and tip your master a wink to come in here
We've got something urgent to say to him The boys took five cups of tea out to the Taoist master who tucked back his sleeves and passed a cup with both hands first to Sanzang and then to Pig Friar Sand and Brother Monkey
After the tea had been drunk the cups were collected and the boys gave their master a look at which he bowed and said Please sit down gentlemen
Boys put the tray down and keep them company
I have to go out
I'll be back Sanzang and his disciples went out of the hall to look around guided by one boy
When the Taoist master went back to the abbot's lodgings the seven women all fell to their knees and said Brother brother please listen to what we have to say The Taoist master helped them to their feet and said When you came here this morning you wanted to tell me something but because of the elixir pills I was making I couldn't see any women That's why I had to refuse
I have visitors out there now so you can tell me later We have to report elder brother the shedevils said that it's because the strangers are here that we're talking to you
If the strangers go away there'll be no point in telling you What are you talking about sisters the Taoist master said
Why do you have to talk to me just now when the strangers are here
Have you gone off your heads
I'm a man who lives in peace and quiet cultivating immortality but even if I were a layman with wife and children and family responsibilities I'd wait till my visitor had left before attending to them
How can you be so illbehaved and disgrace me
Now let me go All the shedevils grabbed him and said Please don't lose your temper elder brother Tell us where the visitors come from The Taoist master pulled a long face and ignored them
When the boys came in for the Journey to the West tea just now they told us the visitors are four Buddhist monks the shedevils said
They're monks said the Taoist master angrily what of it Does one of the four monks have a pale fat face the shedevils asked and one of them a long snout and big ears Did you ask them where they're from Yes the Taoist said there are two like that among them How did you know
I suppose you've seen them somewhere You don't know the terrible things that have happened brother the devils said
That monk was sent by the Tang court to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven
He came to our cave this morning begging for food We captured him because we'd heard of this Tang Priest Why did you capture him the Taoist asked
We've long known that the Tang Priest has a pure body because he has cultivated his conduct for ten successive incarnations the devils replied Anyone who eats a piece of his flesh will live for ever
That's why we captured him Later the monk with a long snout and big ears kept us in the Filthcleansing Spring First he stole our clothes and then he used his magical powers to insist on bathing with us
He jumped into the water and turned himself into a catfish From the way he kept swimming around between our thighs he obviously had very improper ideas He was thoroughly disgraceful
Then he jumped out of the water and turned back into himself
As we weren't going to let him have his way he tried to kill us all with his ninepronged rake
If we hadn't known a thing or two he'd have murdered the lot of us
We fled in fear and trembling and sent your nephews into battle We don't know whether they are alive or dead
We have come here to fling ourselves on your mercy and beg you to avenge your fellowstudents from long ago On hearing this the Taoist was furious as could be seen from his changed expression What outrageous monks he exclaimed What hooligans Don't you worry
I'm going to sort them out If you're going to fight them said the shedevils in gratitude you must let us help you There'll be no need to fight said the Taoist no need
As the saying goes you have to lower yourself to fight someone
Come with me The women went with him into his room where he carried a ladder behind the bed climbed up to the rafters and brought down a little leather box
It was eight inches high a foot long four inches wide and locked with a tiny brass lock
From his sleeve he produced a square handkerchief of gooseyellow silk to the fringes of which a tiny key was tied
Unlocking the box he brought out a packet containing a drug This drug was
A thousand pounds of droppings From all kinds of mountain birds Boiled in a copper cauldron Reduced on an even fire Till the thousand pounds were only a spoonful Journey to the West That was then reduced to a third
This was fried even longer Refined and smoked once again
To make the poisonous drug More precious than treasures or jewels
Were you to try out its flavor One taste would send yon to Hell
Sisters said the Taoist master any mortal who eats one grain of this treasure of mine will be dead when it reaches his stomach
Only three grains would be enough to kill a god or an immortal
As these monks may have mastered something of the Way they'll need three grains
Fetch my balance One of the women brought a balance at once
Weigh out twelve grains he said and divide that into four portions Then he took twelve red jujubes pinched holes in them stuffed a grain of the drug in each and put them into four teacups
These were then placed with a fifth cup containing two black jujubes on a tray Let me question them he said
If they aren't from Tang that'll be the end of it but if they are I'll ask for fresh tea and you can give this tea to the boys to bring in
Once they drink it they'll all die and you'll be avenged
That'll cheer you up The seven women were beside themselves with gratitude
The Taoist changed into another robe and walked out again with a great show of feigned courtesy He urged the Tang Priest and the others to sit down in the guest seats again Please excuse me venerable sir the Taoist said
The reason why I neglected you just now was because I was at the back telling my disciples to choose some greens and radishes to cook as a vegetarian meal for you We Buddhist monks came emptyhanded said Sanzang
We could not possibly trouble you for a meal We are all men of religion replied the Taoist master with a smile Whenever we go to a monastery or temple we are entitled to three pints of rice so why talk of being emptyhanded
May I ask you reverend sir what monastery you are from and why you are here I have been sent by His Majesty the Great Tang emperor to fetch the scriptures from the Great Thunder Monastery in the Western Heaven Sanzang replied
As we were passing your Taoist temple we came in to pay our respects At this news the Taoist's face was full of animation as he said It was only because I did not realize you were so faithful to the most virtuous Buddha that I failed to come out a long way to meet you Please forgive me
Please forgive me Then he told the boys to bring fresh tea at once and get a meal ready as soon as possible at which the boys went straight inside to fetch the tea
Here's some good tea that's all ready the women called to them
Take this in The boys did indeed take the five cups in and the Taoist master hurriedly passed a cup of red jujube tea to the Tang Priest
As Pig was Journey to the West so big the Taoist took him for the senior disciple and he thought Friar Sand was the next senior
Thinking that Monkey was the junior one the Taoist only handed him his cup fourth
By the time the sharpeyed Brother Monkey took his cup he had already noticed that there were two black jujubes in the cup left on the tray Let's change cups sir he said
To be honest with you the Taoist replied with a smile as a poor Taoist living out here in the wilds I am rather short of tea and food at the moment I was looking for fruit out at the back just now and I could only find these twelve red jujubes to put into four cups of tea to offer you
As I had to take something with you I made another cup with these inferior jujubes to keep you company
This is just a gesture of respect What nonsense said Monkey with a smile
As the ancients said 'You are never poor if you are at home but poverty on a journey is killing' You're at home here so why all this talk about being poor
It's wandering monks like us who are really poor
I'll swap with you
I insist Wukong said Sanzang when he heard this this immortal gentleman is being very hospitable You have yours There is no need for a swap Monkey had no choice
Taking the cup with his left hand he covered it with his right and watched them
Pig however who apart from feeling hungry and thirsty had an enormous appetite at the best of times picked the three red jujubes out of the cup as soon as he saw them and swallowed them noisily
The master ate his too as did Friar Sand
In that very instant Pig's face changed color tears started pouring from Friar Sand's eyes and the Tang Priest began to foam at the mouth
Unable to sit upright all three of them fainted and fell to the floor
Realizing that they had been poisoned the Great Sage raised his teacup in his hands and threw it at the Taoist master's face
The Taoist stopped it with his sleeve and it shattered noisily as it fell to the floor
You lout monk said the Taoist in fury how dare you smash my cup Animal said Monkey abusively just look what you've done to those three
What have I ever done to you for you to give my people poisoned tea Beast said the Taoist master you asked for it
Don't you realize that We've only just come here and talked about things like where we should sit and where we're from said Monkey We didn't talk big How can you say we asked for this trouble Did you beg for food in Gossamer Cave the Taoist master asked
Did you bathe in the Filthcleansing Spring There were seven shedevils in the Filthcleansing Spring Monkey replied From what you're saying you must be in cahoots with them I'm sure you're an evil spirit yourself
Stay where you are and take this The splendid Great Sage felt in his ear for his goldbanded cudgel waved it to make it as thick as a ricebowl and struck at the Taoist master's face
The Taoist rapidly turned and dodged the blow then produced a fine sword with which he fought back
Their cursing and fighting had by now disturbed the seven shedevils inside who all rushed out shouting Spare yourself the trouble elder brother
Let us catch him At the sight of them Monkey became angrier than ever Whirling his iron cudgel around with both hands he dropped his guard and tumbled in among them lashing out wildly
The seven women then undid their clothes revealing their white stomachs and from their navels they produced by magic thick silken ropes that came reeling out in such abundance that they formed a canopy under which Brother Monkey was confined
Journey to the West Seeing that things were going badly Monkey got up said the words of a spell did a somersault smashed through the canopy and escaped
Then he stood gloomily in midair controlling his temper and watching as the flashing silken ropes crisscrossed like the warp and weft of cloth on the loom Within a moment the Yellow Flower Temple's towers and halls were all completely concealed
Terrible said Monkey they're terrible
I've never been up against anything like that before
No wonder Pig fell over so often
What am I to do now
The master and my brothers have been poisoned
This gang of devils are all hand in glove and I know nothing about their background
I'll go back and question that local god The splendid Great Sage brought his cloud down to land made a spell with his fingers said the sacred syllable Om and forced the old local god to come to him again
The old deity knelt beside the path trembling with fear and kowtowing as he said Great Sage you went to rescue your master
Why are you back again I rescued him this morning Monkey replied and a little way ahead from there we reached a Yellow Flower Temple
When I went in with the master to look around the head Taoist of the temple greeted us and in the middle of our conversation he knocked out my master and the other two with poisoned tea
Luckily I didn't drink any but when I was going to hit him with my cudgel he started talking about begging for food at Gossamer Cave and bathing at the Filthcleansing Spring so I knew he was a monster
No sooner had he raised his hand to fight back than the seven women came out and set off their silken ropes It was a good thing I had the knowhow to get away
I reckon that as you're a god who lives round here you're bound to know their background What sort of evil spirit are they
Tell me the truth if you don't want to be hit It's less than ten years since those evil spirits came here said the local deity kowtowing
When I was making an inspection three years ago I saw what they really are seven spider spirits
The silken ropes that come out of them are spiders' webs The news thoroughly delighted Monkey who said From what you tell me they're no problem Very well then
You can go back while I use magic to subdue him The local god kowtowed and went
Monkey then went to the outside of the Yellow Flower Temple pulled seventy hairs out of his tail blew on them with magic breath and shouted Change The hairs turned into seventy little Monkeys
He then blew a magic breath on his goldbanded cudgel called Change and turned it into seventy twopronged forks one of which he gave to each of the little Monkeys
Monkey himself used one of the forks to twist the silken ropes as he stood outside then they all attacked together to the rhythm of a tune tearing the ropes to pieces each of them tearing off over ten pounds of rope
They dragged seven spiders out from inside Each was about the size of a wicker basket
All of them held their hands and feet together and had ropes round their necks Spare us spare us they said
The seventy little Monkeys then pressed the seven spiders to the ground refusing to let them go Don't hit them said Monkey
All we want is to make them give my master and my brothers back Elder Brother shrieked the demons at the tops of their voices give the Tang Priest back and save our lives The Taoist master rushed outside saying Sisters I'm going to eat the Tang Priest I can't save you This infuriated Brother Monkey
If you won't give my master back just watch what happens to your sisters The splendid Great Sage waved his fork turned it back into an iron cudgel that he lifted with both hands and smashed the seven spider spirits to pulp
Then he shook his tail a couple of times put the hairs back on it and charged inside alone swinging his cudgel to fight the Taoist master
Journey to the West When the Taoist master saw Monkey kill his seven fellowstudents it was more than he could bear Goaded to fury he raised his sword to fight back
In this battle each of them was seething with anger and giving full play to his divine powers
It was a fine battle The evil spirit swung a fine sword The Great Sage raised his goldbanded cudgel
Both were fighting for Sanzang of the Tang On whose account the seven women had been killed
Now they were fighting with allround skill Showing their mighty powers with their weapons
Powerful was the Great Sage's aura And rough the courage of the evil immortal
Their vigorous moves were as rich as brocade And both hands moved as fast as a windlass
Noisily clanged the sword and cudgel And ominously pale were the floating clouds
Few were the words they spoke As they used their cunning Moving to and fro like brushstrokes in a painting
The wind and dust they raised scared wolves and tigers The stars disappeared as heaven and earth went dark
When the Taoist master had fought fifty or sixty rounds with the Great Sage he felt his hand weakening and his sinews getting slack so he undid his belt and with a loud flapping noise took off his black robe
Well my lad said the Great Sage with a laugh if you can't beat me you still won't be able to when you strip off Once the Taoist master had stripped off his clothes he raised both hands to reveal under his ribs a thousand eyes flashing golden light It was terrible Dense yellow smoke Journey to the West Brilliant golden light
The dense yellow smoke Gushed out as clouds from under his ribs The brilliant golden light Came from a thousand eyes like fire
To left and right they seemed like golden pails To East and West they resembled bells of bronze
Thus an evil immortal used his magic power A Taoist master showed divine ability Dazzling the eyes blotting out sun moon and sky Blanketing people with acrid vapors
The Great Sage Equaling Heaven Was caught in the golden light and yellow smoke
Monkey started lashing out desperately with his hands and feet but could only spin around inside the golden light unable to take a step either forwards or backwards It was as if he were turning round and round in a bucket It was hopeless He was unbearably hot
In his anxiety he leapt into the air smashing against the golden light and crashing head first to the ground
His head ached where he had hit it and felt anxiously to find that the top of his scalp was tender
What lousy luck he though what lousy luck This head's useless today Usually swords and axes can't hurt it so why has golden light bruised it now
After a while it's bound to go septic and even if it does get better I might have tetanus He was still feeling unbearably hot
I can't move forward or back he thought working out a plan or to left or right and I can't smash my way through by going up Whatever shall I do
I'll damn well have to get out by going down The splendid Great Sage said the words of a spell shook himself and turned into one of those scaly diggers called pangolins
Indeed Four sets of iron claws Dug through the mountain smashing rocks like powder
The scales covering his body Journey to the West Carved through ridges and crags like slicing scallions
His eyes were as bright As two gleaming stars His mouth was sharper Than a steel drill or brazen auger
He was the scaly mountainborer used in medicine The creature known as the pangolin
Watch him as he burrows into the ground with his head not coming out again till he has covered over six miles
The golden light could only enclose about three miles
When he emerged and turned back into himself he was exhausted His muscles ached his whole body was in pain and he could not help weeping
Suddenly he burst out with Master Since leaving the mountain and joining the faith I've worked very hard on our way to the West
The waves of the ocean are nothing to fear But in this dry gulch I've come out second best Just as the Handsome Monkey King was feeling miserable the sound of sobs could suddenly be heard from the other side of the mountain
Leaning forward and drying his tears he turned to look A woman appeared dressed in deep mourning and sobbing at every step as she came from the other side of the mountain She was holding a dish of cold rice gruel in her left hand and several pieces of yellow paper money for burning to the dead in her right
Monkey sighed and nodded as he said to himself This is a case of Weeping eyes meeting weeping eyes One broken heart coming across another
I wonder what this woman is crying about
I'll ask her Before long the woman was coming along the path towards him
Lady Bodhisattva asked Brother Monkey with a bow who are you weeping for Journey to the West Through her tears the woman replied My husband was murdered by the master of the Yellow Flower Temple with poisoned tea because he got into a quarrel with him over the purchase of some bamboo poles I'm going to burn this paper money as a mark of my love for him This made Monkey's tears flow
The sight made the woman say angrily You ignorant fool I'm grieving over my husband but what business do you have to be weeping and looking so miserable
Are you mocking me Please don't be angry Bodhisattva said Monkey with a bow
I'm Sun Wukong the Novice the senior disciple of Tang Sanzang the younger brother of the Great Tang Emperor in the East
When we passed the Yellow Flower Temple on our way to the Western Heaven we stopped to rest but the Taoist master there is some kind of evil spirit who's the sworn brother of seven spider spirits
When the spider spirits wanted to kill my master in Gossamer Cave I and my brother disciples Pig and Friar Sand managed to save him
The spider spirits fled to the Taoist's place and told him a pack of lies about us bullying them so the Taoist knocked out my master and brothers The three of them and the horse are now prisoners in his temple
I was the only one who didn't drink the tea I smashed the cup and he attacked me
Because of the noise the seven spider spirits rushed outside to give out their silken ropes and catch me in the web they wove I only got away by magic
After I'd found out who they really were I used my power of giving myself extra bodies to tear the silken ropes to pieces drag the demons out and beat them to death
The Taoist master wanted revenge so he went for me with his sword
When we'd gone sixty rounds he fled beaten took off his clothes and used the thousand eyes he has under his ribs to give off countless beams of golden light
I was caught under them unable to move forwards or backwards so I turned into a pangolin and burrowed my way out underground
It was when I was feeling thoroughly depressed that I heard you weeping which was why I asked you those questions
When I saw that you had paper money to give your husband I felt wretched and miserable because I've got nothing for my master when he dies
Making fun of you was the last thing on my mind Putting down the gruel and the paper money the woman returned Brother Monkey's bow and said Please forgive me I didn't realize that you were a sufferer too
From what you've just said you don't know who that Taoist is
He's really the Demon King Hundredeye who's also known as the Manyeyed Monster
You must have tremendous magical powers to have escaped from the golden light and fought so long but you couldn't get near him
I'll tell you about a sage you can send for who would be able to smash the golden light and defeat the Taoist Monkey's immediate response was to chant a naaaw of respect and say If you know the sage's background lady Bodhisattva may I trouble you to tell me about it
If there is such a sage I'll fetch him to rescue my master and avenge your husband I'll tell you the woman said and you can fetch the sage who will subdue the Taoist but that will only bring revenge
I'm afraid the sage won't be able to rescue your master Why not Monkey asked
His poison is truly lethal the woman replied When people are laid low by it the very marrow of their bones rots within three days
I'm afraid that by the time you've been to see the sage and come back again you'll be too late to save him I know how to travel Monkey replied
However far it is I'll only take half a day If you can travel then listen to this the woman said
About three hundred miles from here there's a mountain called Mount Purple Clouds and in the mountain there's a Thousand Flower Cave where there lives a sage called Vairambha who will be able to defeat that demon Where's the mountain Monkey asked
Which direction should I take Journey to the West It's due South of here the woman replied pointing and by the time Brother Monkey looked back at her she had disappeared
Monkey quickly did a kowtow and said Which Bodhisattva was that
After all that burrowing you disciple was feeling too stupid to recognize you
I beg you to tell me your name so that I can thank you At this there came a shout from midair Great Sage it's me Monkey quickly looked up to see that it was the Old Lady of Mount Li
Catching up with her in the sky he thanked her with the words Where have you come from to give me these instructions On my way back from Dragon Flower Assembly I noticed that your master was in trouble the Old Lady replied It was to save his life that I pretended to be a woman in mourning for her husband
Hurry up and fetch the sage But don't tell her I sent you
she is rather difficult Thanking her Monkey took his leave and set off straight away on his somersault cloud
Once at Mount Purple Clouds he brought his cloud down and saw the Thousand Flower Cave
Outside the cave Blue pines masked the splendid view Turquoise cypresses surrounded the immortal's home
Green willows were packed close along the mountain paths Rare flowers filled the watercourses
Orchids grew all around stone buildings And scented blooms gave color to the crags
Flowing water linked ravines with green While clouds enclosed the emptiness of trees
Noisily sang wild birds Slowly strolled the deer Elegant grew the bamboo And all the red plums were open
Rooks perched in ancient woods While spring birds chirped in the tree of heaven
Summer wheat filled spreading acres And autumn millet grew all over the land
No leaf fell in all four seasons Journey to the West And flowers bloomed throughout the year
Auspicious rosy glows joined with the Milky Way And clouds of good omen were linked with the Great Emptiness
The Great Sage was delighted as he went inside seeing boundless beauty at every stage
He went straight on but found it deserted and completely silent Not even a chicken or a dog could be heard
I think that this sage must be out Monkey thought
When he had gone a mile or two further on he saw a Taoist nun sitting on a couch
This is what she looked like She wore a fiveflowered hat of brocade And a robe of golden silk
Her cloudtreading shoes were patterned with phoenixes And round her waist was a sash with double tassels
Her face looked as old as autumn after a frost But her voice was as charming as swallows in the spring
Long had she mastered the Dharma of Three Vehicles And she was ever mindful of the Four Truths
She knew true achievement that emptiness is empty And through her training had acquired great freedom
She was the Buddha of the Thousand Flower Cave The illustrious Vairambha of great fame
Monkey went straight up to her without stopping and said Greetings Bodhisattva Vairambha The Bodhisattva then came down from her couch put her hands together to return his greeting and said Great Sage it was remiss of me not to come out to greet you
Where have you come from How do you know that I'm the Great Sage Monkey asked
When you made havoc in Heaven the other year Vairambha replied your picture was circulated everywhere
That's why everyone can recognize you Journey to the West How true it is Monkey said that While good deeds stay at home Bad deeds are known far and wide
Take my conversion to Buddhism for example You didn't know about that Congratulations said Vairambha
When did that happen Not long ago my life was spared to escort my master the Tang Priest on his journey to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures Monkey replied My master has been laid low with poisoned tea by the Taoist of the Yellow Flower Temple
When I was fighting with him he caught me in his golden light and I had to use magic to escape
I have come here to pay you my respects Bodhisattva and ask your help because I've heard that you are able to destroy his golden light Who told you that the Bodhisattva asked
I have not left here since the Ullambana assembly over three hundred years ago
I've lived in complete secrecy and nobody has heard of me so how is it that you know of me I'm an underground devil Monkey replied and I can make my own enquiries anywhere at all Never mind Vairambha said never mind
I shouldn't really go but as you have honoured me with a visit Great Sage and as the great cause of fetching the scriptures must not be allowed to fail I'll go with you Monkey thanked her and said It's very ignorant of me to hurry you along in this way
I wonder what weapon you use I have an embroidery needle that will put an end to that damned creature said the Bodhisattva This was too much for Monkey
Old Lady you've been wasting my time he said Had I known it was an embroidery needle I wouldn't have had to trouble you
I could have provided a hundredweight of them Your embroidery needles are all made of iron steel or gold the Bodhisattva replied They're no use
My treasure isn't iron and isn't steel and isn't gold It was tempered by my son in the sun Who is he asked Monkey
He is the Star Lord of the Mane Vairambha replied
This came as a shock to Monkey who gazed at the golden light then turned to Vairambha and said The Yellow Flower Temple is where that golden light is coming from Vairambha then took from the lapel of her gown an embroidery needle about the thickness of an eyebrow hair and half an inch long Holding it between her fingers she threw it into the air
A few moments later there was a loud noise and the golden light was shattered
That's wonderful Bodhisattva wonderful exclaimed a delighted Monkey Let's find your needle now Journey to the West Isn't this it here asked Vairambha who was holding it in her hand
Brother Monkey brought his cloud down to land with hers and went into the temple where he found the Taoist with his eyes shut unable to move
Stop playing blind damned demon he said abusively taking his cudgel from his ear ready to hit the Taoist with
Don't hit him Great Sage said Vairambha
Go and see your master On going straight to the reception room at the back Monkey found the three of them bringing up mucus and spittle where they lay on the floor
What am I to do wept Monkey
What am I to do Don't grieve Great Sage said Vairambha
As I've come out today I think I might as well accumulate some merit by giving you three of these pills that are an antidote to the poison Monkey turned round to bow down and beg her for them whereupon she produced a torn paper packet from her sleeve containing three red pills that she handed to Monkey telling him to put one in each of their mouths
This he did forcing their teeth apart
A few moments later they all started vomiting as the drug reached their stomachs bringing up the poison and coming back to life Pig was the first to scramble to his feet I feel suffocated he said
Sanzang and Friar Sand both came round too saying that they felt very dizzy
Your tea was poisoned Brother Monkey explained
It was the Bodhisattva Vairambha who saved you
Hurry up and bow to her in thanks Sanzang bowed to her to show his gratitude as he straightened up his clothes
Brother said Pig where's that Taoist
I've got some questions to ask him about why he tried to murder me Monkey then told him all about the spider spirits
If spider spirits are his sisters that damned creature must be an evil spirit too said Pig with fury
He's standing outside the main hall pretending to be blind said Monkey pointing
Pig grabbed his rake and was about to hit the Taoist with it when Vairambha stopped him and said Control your temper Marshal Tian Peng
As the Great Sage knows I have no servants in my cave
I am going to take him as my doorkeeper We are deeply indebted to your great power Monkey replied and we will of course obey
But we would like you to turn him back into his real self so that we can have a look at him Easily done said Vairambha stepping forward and pointing at the Taoist who collapsed into the dust and reverted to his real form of a giant centipede spirit seven feet long
Picking him up with her little finger Vairambha rode her auspicious cloud straight back to the Thousand Flower Cave
That old lady's a real terror said Pig looking up
How did she manage to subdue that evil creature When I asked her what weapon she had to smash the golden light with Monkey replied she told me about a golden embroidery needle of hers that her son had tempered in the sun
When I asked her who her son was she told me he was the Star Lord of the Mane
As I remember the Mane Star is a cock so his mother must be a hen
Hens are very good at dealing with centipedes which is why she could subdue him On hearing this Sanzang performed no end of kowtows
Disciples he ordered go and get things ready Friar Sand then went inside to find some rice and prepare a vegetarian meal so that they could all eat their fill
Then they led the horse up shouldered the carryingpole and asked the master to set out
Monkey started a blaze in the kitchen that in an instant burnt the whole temple to ashes He then set out on his way Indeed
Journey to the West The Tang Priest thanked Vairambha for saving his life The emotions were eliminated and the Manyeyed Monster removed
As for what happened on the way ahead listen to the explanations in the next installment
Li Changgeng Reports the Demons' Vicious Nature The Novice Displays His Powers of Transformation Emotions and desires are in origin all the same Both emotions and desires are completely natural
Many a gentleman refines himself in the Buddhist faith When desire and emotions are forgotten dhyana conies
Don't be impatient be firm of heart Be free of dust like the moon in the sky
Make no mistake in your labors and your progress When your efforts are completed you will be an enlightened immortal
The story tells how Sanzang and his disciples having broken through the net of desires and escaped from the prisonhouse of the emotions let the horse travel West
Before they had been going for very long the summer was over and the new coolness of early autumn was refreshing their bodies
What they saw was Driving rains sweeping away the last of the heat Alarming the leaf of the parasol tree
At evening glowworms flew by the sedge path While crickets sang beneath the moon
Journey to the West The golden mallows opened in the dew Red knotweed covered the sandbanks
Rushes and willows were the first to lose their leaves As cold cicadas sang in tune
As Sanzang was travelling along a high mountain appeared in front of him Its peak thrust up into the azure void touching the stars and blocking out the sun
In his alarm the venerable elder said to Monkey Look at that mountain in front of us It's very high I don't know whether the path will take us across What a thing to say Master said Monkey with a smile
As the old saying goes However high the mountain there will be a way across However deep the river there's always a ferryman
There's no reason why we shouldn't get over it
Stop worrying and carry on When Sanzang heard this his face broke out in smiles and he whipped his horse forward to climb straight up the high crag
After a mile or two an old man appeared His white hair was tangled and flying in the wind while his sparse whiskers were being blown about like silver threads
He wore a string of prayerbeads round his neck and held a dragonheaded walkingstick as he stood far away at the top of the slope shouting Venerable gentleman travelling West stop your worthy steed
Rein in There is a band of demons on this mountain who have eaten all the people in the continent of Jambu
Go no further At this Sanzang turned pale with terror and because the horse was not standing steadily and he himself was not well seated in the carved saddle he crashed to the ground and lay in the grass moaning but unable to move
Monkey went over to help him to his feet with the words Don't be afraid don't be afraid
I'm here Did you hear the old man up on the crag telling us that there's a band of demons on this mountain who have eaten everyone in the continent of Jambu said Sanzang
Who'll dare go to ask him what this is really all about Sit there while I go and ask him Monkey replied
With your ugly face and coarse language I'm afraid you may shock him said Sanzang so you won't get the truth from him I'll make myself a bit better looking before questioning him laughed Brother Monkey
Journey to the West Do a change to show me said Sanzang and the splendid Great Sage made a spell with his fingers shook himself and turned into a very neat little monk cleareyed finebrowed roundheaded and regular of features
He moved in a most refined way and said nothing vulgar when he opened his mouth
Brushing his brocade tunic he stepped forward and said to the Tang Priest Master have I changed for the better Yes said the delighted Sanzang Marvellous said Pig but the rest of us look shabby by comparison
Even if I rolled around for two or three years on end I couldn't make myself look as elegant as that The splendid Great Sage left them behind as he went straight up to the old man bowed to him and said Greetings venerable sir Seeing how young and cultivated he looked the old man returned his greeting and stroked his head in an offhand way
Little monk the old man said with a smile where have you come from We are from the Great Tang in the East Monkey replied going to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures
When we came here and heard you tell us that there are demons here my master was terrified He sent me to ask you about them What sort of evil spirits would dare go in for that sort of crime
I would trouble you venerable sir to tell me all the details so that I can put them in their place and send them on their way You're much too young little monk said the old man with a smile to know what's good for you Your remarks aren't helpful
Those evil spirits have tremendous magical powers How can you have the nerve to talk of putting them in their place and sending them on their way From what you are saying Monkey replied with a smile you seem to be trying to protect them
You must be a relation of theirs or else a neighbour or a friend
Why else would you be promoting their prestige and boosting their morale and refusing to pour out everything you know about their background You certainly know how to talk monk said the old man nodding and smiling
I suppose you must have learned some magic arts while travelling with your master Perhaps you know how to drive away and capture goblins or have exorcised people's houses for them
But you've never come up against a really vicious monster What sort of vicious Monkey said
If those evil spirits send a letter to Vulture Mountain the five hundred arhats all come out to meet them the old man said
If they send a note to the Heavenly Palace the Ten Bright Shiners all turn out to pay their respects
The dragons of the Four Oceans were their friends and they often meet the immortals of the Eight Caves
The Ten Kings of the Underworld call them brothers the local gods and city gods are good friends of theirs
When the Great Sage heard this he could not help bursting into loud guffaws Stop talking he said grabbing hold of the old man stop talking
Even if that demon is friends with all those young whippersnappers my juniors that's nothing really remarkable
If he knew I was coming he'd clear off the same night You're talking nonsense little monk the old man said
How can any of those sages be juniors and young whippersnappers to you Journey to the West To be truthful with you Monkey replied with a grin my people have lived for many generations in the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the land of Aolai My name is Sun Wukong
In the old days I used to be an evil spirit too and did some great things
Once I fell asleep after drinking too much at a feast with the other demons and dreamed that two men came to drag me off to the World of Darkness
I got so angry that I wounded the demon judges with my goldbanded cudgel The kings of the Underworld were terrified and I practically turned the Senluo Palace upsidedown
The judges in charge of the case were so scared that they fetched some paper for the Ten Kings to sign
They promised to treat me as their senior if I let them off a beating Amitabha Buddha exclaimed the old man when he heard this
If you talk big like that you won't be able to grow any older I'm old enough fellow said Monkey
How old are you then the old man asked
Guess Monkey replied
Six or seven the old man said
I'm ten thousand times as old as that laughed Monkey I'll show you my old face then you'll believe me How can you have another face the old man asked
This little monk has seventytwo faces Monkey replied
Not realizing that Monkey really had these powers the old man went on questioning him till Monkey rubbed his face and turned back into himself with his protruding teeth big mouth red thighs and tigerskin kilt round his waist As he stood there at the foot of the rocky scar holding his goldbanded cudgel he was the living image of a thunder god
The sight of him made the old man turn pale with terror and go so weak at the knees that he could not keep himself upright but collapsed to the ground
When he got to his feet again he lost his balance once more
Old man said the Great Sage going up to him don't get yourself so frightened over nothing I may look evil but I'm good inside Don't be afraid
You were kind enough just now to tell us that there are demons here
Could I trouble you to let me know how many of them there are
I'll thank you very much if you do The old man trembled unable to speak and acting as if deaf He replied not a word
Getting no answer from him Monkey went back down the slope
So you are back Wukong Sanzang said
What did you find out It's nothing said Monkey with a smile nothing
Even if there are one or two evil spirits on the way to the Western Heaven the people here only worry so much about them because they're such cowards
No problem
I'm here Did you ask him what mountain this was and what cave said Sanzang how many monsters there are and which is the way to Thunder Monastery Please excuse me if I speak frankly Master put in Pig
When it comes to transformations trickery and deception then four or five of us would be no match for Brother Monkey
But a whole parade of Monkeys couldn't touch me for honesty That's right said the Tang Priest that's right
You're honest Journey to the West Goodness knows why said Pig but he just rushed in without a second thought asked a couple of questions and came running back in an awful mess
I'm going to find out the truth Do be careful Wuneng said the Tang Priest
The splendid idiot put his rake in his belt straightened up his tunic and swaggered straight up the slope to call to the old man Respectful greetings sir The old man had finally managed to get back on his feet with the help of his stick after seeing that Monkey had gone and was still shaking and about to depart when Pig suddenly appeared
Sir he said more shocked than ever whatever kind of nightmare am I in the middle of
The first monk was ugly enough but at least he looked a little bit human
But this one's got a snout like a pestle ears like rush fans a face like iron plates and a neck covered in bristles
It doesn't look at all human You must be in a very bad mood to run me down like that old man laughed Pig
Is that how you see me
Ugly I may be but if you can bear to look at me for a while you'll find I get quite handsome Only when the old man heard Pig using human speech did he address him by asking Where are you from I'm the Tang Priest's second disciple Pig replied and my Buddhist names are Wuneng or Bajie
The one who came and asked you questions just now was Sun Wukong the Novice the senior disciple
My master has sent me to pay my respects to you because he's angry with Sun Wukong for offending you and not finding out the truth
Could you please tell me sir what mountain this is what caves there are on it what demons live in them and which is the main route West Are you honest the old man asked
I've never been false in all my life Pig replied
You mustn't talk a whole lot of fancy nonsense like the other monk just now said the old man
I'm not like him Pig replied
Leaning on his stick the old man said to Pig This is Lion Ridge and it is  miles around
In it there is a Lion Cave where there are three demon chieftains You're worrying over nothing old man said Pig spitting
Why go to all that trouble just to tell us about three demons Aren't you afraid the old man said
To tell you the truth Pig replied my elder brother'll kill one with one swing of his cudgel I'll kill another with one bash from my rake and the other disciple will kill the third one with his demonquelling staff And with the three of them dead our master will be able to cross the ridge
No problem You don't know the whole story monk said the old man with a smile
Those three demon chiefs have the most tremendous magic powers
As for the little demons under their command there are five thousand on the Southern end of the ridge five thousand on the Northern end ten thousand on the road East ten thousand on the road West four or five thousand patrollers and another ten thousand on the gates Then there are any number who work in the kitchen and gather firewood There must be  or  altogether
They all have names and carry passes and all they do is eat people Journey to the West On learning this the idiot ran back shivering and shaking
As soon as he was near the Tang Priest he put down his rake and started shitting instead of reporting back
What are you squatting there for instead of making your report shouted Monkey when he saw the idiot
Because I'm shit scared Pig replied
No time to talk now The sooner we all run for our lives the better Stupid fool said Monkey
I wasn't frightened when I questioned him so why should you be in such a witless panic What is the situation Sanzang asked
The old man says that this is Lion Mountain Pig replied and that there's Lion Cave in it
There are three chief demons there and they have  little devils under them All they do is eat people
So if we step on their mountain we'll just be serving ourselves up as a meal to them
Let's forget about it On hearing this Sanzang shivered his hairs standing on end What are we to do Wukong he asked
Don't worry Master said Monkey
It can't be anything much There are bound to be a few evil spirits here It's just that the people here are such cowards that they exaggerate about how many demons there are and how powerful they are They get themselves into a funk
I can cope You're talking nonsense brother said Pig
I'm not like you What I found out was the truth I wasn't making any of it up
The hills and valleys are all crawling with demons
How are we going to move ahead You're talking like an idiot said Monkey with a grin Don't scare yourself over nothing
Even if the hills and valleys were crawling with demons I'd only need half a night to wipe them all out with my cudgel You're shameless said Pig quite shameless Stop talking so big
It would take seven or eight days just to call the roll How could you wipe them all out Tell me how you'd do it laughed Monkey
However you grabbed them tied them up or fixed them where they are with fixing magic you'd never be able to do it so fast said Pig
I wouldn't need to grab them or tie them up said Monkey
I'll give my cudgel a tug at both ends say 'Grow' and make it over four hundred feet long
Then I'll wave it say 'Thicken' and make it eighty feet around
I'll roll it down the Southern slope and that'll kill five thousand of them
I'll roll it down the Northern slope and kill another five thousand
Then I'll roll it along the ridge from East to West and even if there are forty or fifty thousand of them I'll squash them all to a bloody pulp Brother said Pig if you kill them that way like rolling out dough for noodles you could do it in four hours Master said Friar Sand with a laugh as my elder brother has such divine powers we've got nothing to fear
Please mount up so that we can be on our way Having heard them discussing Monkey's powers Sanzang could not but mount with an easy heart and be on his way
As they traveled along the old man disappeared
He must have been an evil spirit himself said Friar Sand deliberately coming to frighten us with cunning and intimidation Journey to the West Take it easy said Monkey
I'm going to take a look The splendid Great Sage leapt up to a high peak but saw no trace of the old man when he looked around Then he suddenly turned back to see a shimmering coloured glow in the sky shot up on his cloud to look and saw that it was the Great White Planet Walking over and grabbing hold of him Monkey kept addressing him by his personal name Li Changgeng Li Changgeng You rascal If you had something to say you should have said it to my face
Why did you pretend to be an old man of the woods and make a fool of me The planet hastened to pay him his respects and said Great Sage I beg you to forgive me for being late in reporting to you
Those demon chiefs really have tremendous magical abilities and their powers are colossal
With your skill in transformations and your cunning you may just be able to get over but if you slight them it will be very hard I'm very grateful Monkey thanked him very grateful
If I really can't get across this ridge I hope that you'll go up to Heaven and put in a word with the Jade Emperor so he'll lend me some heavenly soldiers to help me Yes yes yes said the Great White Planet
Just give the word and you can have a hundred thousand heavenly troops if you want them The Great Sage then took his leave of the planet and brought his cloud down to see Sanzang and say The old man we saw just now was actually the Great White Planet come to bring us a message Disciple said Sanzang putting his hands together in front of his chest catch up with him quick and ask him where there's another path we could make a detour by There's no other way round Monkey replied
This mountain is  miles across and goodness knows how much longer it would be to go all the way around it How ever could we At this Sanzang could not restrain himself from weeping
Disciple he said if it's going to be as hard as this how are we going to worship the Buddha Don't cry Monkey said don't cry
If you cry you're a louse
I'm sure he's exaggerating All we have to do is be careful As they say forewarned is forearmed
Dismount and sit here for now What do you want to talk about now Pig asked
Nothing replied Monkey
You stay here and look after the master carefully while Friar Sand keeps a close eye on the baggage and the horse I'm going up the ridge to scout around
I'll find out how many demons there are in the area capture one ask him all the details and get him to write out a list with all of their names I'll check out every single one of them old or young and tell them to shut the gates of the cave and not block our way Then I can ask the master to cross the mountain peacefully and quietly
That'll show people my powers Be careful said Friar Sand do be careful No need to tell me Brother Monkey replied with a smile
On this trip I'd force the Eastern Ocean to make way for me and I'd smash my way in even if it were a mountain of silver cased in iron The splendid Great Sage went whistling straight up to the peak by his somersault cloud
Holding on to the vines and creepers he surveyed the mountain only to find it silent and deserted I was wrong he said Journey to the West involuntarily I was wrong
I shouldn't have let that old Great White Planet go He was just trying to scare me
There aren't any evil spirits here
If there were they'd be out leaping around in the wind thrusting with their spears and staves or practicing their fighting skills Why isn't there a single one As he was wondering about this there was a ringing of a bell and a banging of clappers
He turned round at once to see a little devil boy with a banner on which was written BY ORDER over his shoulder a bell at his waist and clappers in his hands that he was sounding He was coming from the North and heading South
A close look revealed that he was about twelve feet tall
He must be a runner thought Monkey grinning to himself delivering messages and reports
I'll take a listen to what he's talking about The splendid Great Sage made a spell with his hands said the magic words shook himself and turned into a fly who landed lightly on the devil's hat and tilted his head for a good listen
This is what the little devil was saying to himself as he headed along the main road sounding his clappers and ringing his bell All we mountain patrollers must be careful and be on our guard against Sun the Novice He can even turn into a fly Monkey was quietly amazed to hear this That soandso must have seen me before
How else could he know my name and know that I can turn into a fly Now the little devil had not in fact seen him before
The demon chief had for some reason given him these instructions that he was reciting blindly Monkey who did not know this thought that the devil must have seen him and was on the point of bringing the cudgel out to hit him with when he stopped
I remember Pig being told he thought when he questioned the planet that there were three demon chieftains and  or  junior devils like this one
Even if there were tens of thousands more juniors like this it would be no problem
But I wonder how great the three leaders' powers are
I'll question him first There'll be time to deal with them later Splendid Great Sage
Do you know how he questioned the demon
He jumped off the devil's hat and landed on a tree top letting the junior devil go several paces ahead
Then Monkey turned round and did a quick transformation into another junior devil sounding clappers ringing a bell and carrying a flag over his shoulder just like the real one He was also dressed identically The only difference was that he was a few inches taller
He was muttering the same things as the other as he caught him up shouting Hey you walking ahead wait for me Turning round the junior devil asked Where have you come from You're a nice bloke Monkey said with a smile not even recognizing one of your own people You're not one of ours said the demon
What do you mean Monkey asked
Take a look and see if you can recognize me I've never seen you before the demon said
I don't know you It's not surprising you don't know me said Monkey I work in the kitchens
We've rarely met You don't said the demon shaking his head you don't
None of the brothers who do the cooking has got a pointy face like yours Journey to the West I must have made my face too pointy when I did the transformation thought Monkey so he rubbed it with his hands and said It isn't pointy Indeed it was not
But it was pointy just now the little devil said How did you stop it being pointy just by rubbing it You're a very shady character
I don't have the faintest idea who you are You're not one of us I've never met you
Very suspicious
Our kings run the household very strictly The kitchen staff only work in the kitchen and the mountain patrols keep to patrolling the mountain
How could you possibly be a cook and a patroller There's something you don't know said Monkey improvising a clever answer
I was promoted to patrolling because the kings saw how well I'd worked in the kitchens Very well then said the little devil
We patrollers are divided into ten companies of forty each which makes four hundred in all We're all known by our ages appearances names and descriptions
Because Their Majesties want to keep the organization neat and rollcalls convenient they've given us all passes
Have you got one Monkey who had seen what the devil looked like and heard what he had said had been able to turn himself into the devil's double
But not having seen the devil's pass he was not carrying one himself
Instead of saying that he did not have one the splendid Great Sage claimed that he had Of course I've got one he said
But it's a new one that's only just been issued to me
Show me yours Not realizing what Monkey was up to the little devil lifted his clothes to reveal a goldlacquered pass with a silken cord through it fastened next to his skin that he lifted out to show Monkey
Monkey saw that on the back of it were the words Demonsuppresser while on the front was handwritten Junior Windpiercer Goes without saying Brother Monkey thought all the ones in mountain patrols have 'Wind' at the end of their names
Put your clothes down now he said and come over here while I show you my pass With that he turned away put a hand down to pull a little hair from the tip of his tail rubbed it between his fingers called Change and turned it into another goldlacquered pass on a green silken cord on which were handwritten the words Senior Windpiercer With his liking for taking things to extremes and his gift of finding the right thing to say Monkey remarked There's something you don't know
When Their Majesties promoted me to patrolling for doing so well in the kitchen they gave me a new pass as a Senior Patroller and put me in charge of you forty lads in this company At this the demon at once gave a naaaw of respect and said Sir I didn't recognize you as you've only just been appointed Please forgive me if anything I said offended you I'm not angry with you said Monkey returning his courtesy There's just one thing I want some money from you all to mark our first meeting
five ounces of silver each Please be patient sir the little devil replied
When I get back to the Southern end of the ridge to meet the rest of our company we'll all give it to your together In that case I'm coming with you said Monkey and he followed behind as the demon led the way
After a mile or two a writingbrush peak was seen
Why was it called a writingbrush peak
Because on the top of the mountain there was a pinnacle about forty or fifty feet high that looked just like a writing brush standing upright on a brush stand
Journey to the West Going up to it Monkey lifted his tail jumped to the top of the pinnacle sat down and called Come here all of you The young Windpiercers all bowed low beneath him and said We're at your service sir Do you know why Their Majesties appointed me Monkey asked
No they replied
Their Majesties want to eat the Tang Priest said Monkey but they're worried about Sun the Novice's tremendous magic powers They've heard that he can do transformations and are worried that he might turn himself into a young Windpiercer and come along the path here to find out what's going on
That's why they're made me Senior Windpiercer to check up on you and find out if there are any impostors among you We're all genuine sir the junior Windpiercers all replied at once
If you're all genuine do you know what powers His Senior Majesty has Monkey asked
Yes one of the young Windpiercers said
In that case said Monkey tell me about them at once
If what you say matches what I know you're genuine
If it's at all wrong you're impostors and I'll take you to Their Majesties for punishment Seeing him sitting up on high playing wise and cunning as he shouted at them the young devils had nothing for it but to tell him the truth
His Majesty has vast magical abilities and enormous powers one of the young devils replied He once devoured a hundred thousand heavenly warriors in a single mouthful You're an impostor Monkey spat out when he heard this
Sir Your Honour said the young devil in panic I'm real
How can you call me an impostor If you're genuine why did you talk such nonsense Monkey replied
No matter how big he is His Majesty couldn't have swallowed a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers in a single mouthful This is something you don't know about sir the young devil replied
His Majesty can do transformations He can make himself tall enough to hold up the sky or as small as a cabbage seed
Some years ago when the Queen Mother invited all the immortals to a peach banquet she didn't send him an invitation so His Majesty wanted to fight Heaven
The Jade Emperor sent a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers to subdue His Majesty gave himself a magical body and opened his mouth that was as big as a city gate
He made as if to swallow hard which frightened the heavenly soldiers so much that they dared not give battle and the Southern Gate of Heaven was shut
That's how he could have swallowed a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers at a single mouthful Monkey grinned to himself and thought Frankly I've done that too
What powers does His Second Majesty have he asked
His Second Majesty is thirty feet tall with brows like sleeping silkworms phoenix eyes a voice like a beautiful woman tusks like carryingpoles and a nose like a dragon
If he's in a fight he only needs to wrinkle his nose for his enemy to be scared witless even if he's covered in bronze and iron Journey to the West Evil spirits who get people with their noses are easy enough to catch said Monkey who then asked and what powers does His Third Majesty have He's no monster from the mortal world the young devil replied His name is Ten Thousand Miles of Cloud Roc
When he moves he rolls up the wind and shifts the waves shaking the North as he heads for the South
He carries a treasure about with him called the Male and Female Vital Principles Jar
Anyone who's put in that jar is turned liquid in a few moments That news gave Monkey something to worry about
I'm not scared of the monsters he thought but I'll have to watch out for his jar Then he said aloud Your account of Their Majesties' powers isn't badit fits exactly with what I know
But which of them wants to eat the Tang Priest Don't you know sir said the young Windpiercer As if I didn't know better than you shouted Monkey
I was told to come and question you because they're worried that you don't know all the details Our Senior King and Second King have long lived in Lion Cave on Lion Mountain the young devil replied but the Third King doesn't live here
He used to live over a hundred miles to the West of here in the capital of a country called Leonia
Five hundred years ago he ate the king of the country his civil and military officials and everybody else in the city young and old male and female So he seized their country and now all the people there are evil monsters
I don't know which year it was in which he heard that the Tang court has sent a priest to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures They say this priest is a good man who has cultivated his conduct for ten incarnations and anyone who eats a piece of his flesh will live for ever and never grow old
But the Third King is worried about the priest's disciple Sun the Novice who's a real terror so he's come to swear brotherhood with our two kings all three are now working together to catch the Tang Priest Damn this thoroughly illbehaved monster thought Brother Monkey with great fury
I'm protecting the Tang Priest while he works for the true achievement
How dare they plot to eat my man With a snort of fury he ground his steel teeth and brandished his iron cudgel as he leapt down from the high pinnacle and smashed the poor young devil's head into a lump of meat When he saw what he had done Monkey felt sorry
Oh dear he thought he meant well telling me all about the house Why did I finish him off all of a sudden like that Oh well
Oh well That's that The splendid Great Sage had been forced to do this because his master's way ahead had been blocked
He took the little devil's pass off him tied it round his own waist put the By order flag over his shoulder hung the bell from his waist and sounded the clappers with his hand
Then he made a handspell into the wind said a spell shook himself turned into the exact likeness of the junior Windpiercer and went straight back the way he had come looking for the cave to find out about the three demon chieftains
Indeed The Handsome Monkey King had a thousand transformations And the true power of magic to make ten thousand changes
Monkey was rushing deep into the mountains along the way he had come when suddenly he heard shouts and whinnies
As he looked up he saw tens of thousands of little devils drawn up outside the entrance to the Lion Cave with their spears sabers swords halberds flags and banners Monkey was delighted Journey to the West Li Changgeng the planet was telling the truth he thought
He wasn't lying at all The devils were drawn up in a systematic way each  forming a company so that from the forty standards in many colours that were dancing in the wind he could tell that there were ten thousand infantry and cavalry there
If I go into the cave disguised as a junior Windpiercer and one of the demon chiefs questions me about my mountain patrol Monkey thought I'll have to make up answers on the spur of the moment
The moment I say anything at all wrong he'll realize who I am and I won't be able to get away
That army on the gates would stop me and I'd never get out
If I'm going to catch the demon kings I'll have to get rid of the devils on the gates first Do you know how he was going to do that
The old demons have never seen me he thought they've only heard of my reputation I'll talk big and scare them with my fame and prestige
If it's true that all living beings in the middle land are destined to have the scriptures brought to them then all I need do is talk like a hero and scare those monsters on the gate away
But if they're not destined to have the scriptures brought to them I'll never get rid of the spirits from the gates of this cave in the West even if I talk till lotus flowers appear Thus he thought about his plans his mind questioning his mouth and his mouth questioning his mind as he sounded the clappers and rang the bell
Before he could rush in through the entrance to Lion Cave he was stopped by the junior devils of the forward camp who said You're back young Windpiercer Monkey said nothing but kept going with his head down
When he reached the second encampment more young devils grabbed hold of him and said You're back young Windpiercer Yes Monkey replied
On your patrol this morning did you meet a Sun the Novice they asked I did Monkey replied
He was polishing his pole What's he like the terrified devils asked
What sort of pole was he polishing He was squatting beside a stream Monkey replied He looked like one of those gods that clear the way
If he'd stood up I'm sure he'd have been hundreds of feet tall and the iron cudgel he was holding was a huge bar as thick as a ricebowl
He'd put a handful of water on a rocky scar and was polishing the cudgel on it muttering 'Pole it's ages since I got you out to show your magic powers This time you can kill all the demons for me even if there are a hundred thousand of them Then I'll kill the three demon chiefs as a sacrificial offering to you' He's going to polish it till it shines then start by killing the ten thousand of you on the gates On hearing this the little devils were all terrorstruck and their souls all scattered in panic
Gentlemen Monkey continued that Tang Priest has only got a few pounds of flesh on him We won't get a share So why should we have to carry the can for them
We'd do much better to scatter You're right the demons said
Let's all run for our lives If they had been civilized soldiers they would have stayed and fought to the death but as they were all really wolves tigers and leopards running beasts and flying birds they all disappeared with a great whoosh
Indeed it wasn't as if the Great Sage Sun had merely talked big it was like the time when Xiang Yu's army of eight thousand soldiers disappeared surrounded by foes who were former comrades
Splendid said monkey to himself with selfcongratulation the old devils are as good as dead now
If this lot run away at the sound of me they'll never dare look me in the face I'll use the same story when I go in Journey to the West there
If I said anything different and one or two of the young devils had got inside and heard me that would give the game away Watch him as he carefully approaches the ancient cave and boldly goes deep inside
If you don't know what of good or ill was to come from the demon chieftains listen to the explanation in the next installment
The MindApe Bores a Hole in the Male and Female Jar The Demon King Returns and the Way Is Preserved The story tells how the Great Sage Sun went in through the entrance of the cave and looked to either side
This is what he saw Hills of skeletons Forests of bones Human heads and hair trampled into felt Human skin and flesh rotted into mud Sinews twisted round trees Dried and shining like silver
Truly there was a mountain of corpses a sea of blood An unbearable stench of corruption
The little devils to the East Sliced the living flesh off human victims The evil demons to the West Boiled and fried fresh human meat
Apart from the heroic Handsome Monkey King No common mortal would have dared go in
He was soon inside the second gates and when he looked around here he saw that things were different from outside
Here was purity quiet elegance beauty and calm
To left and right were rare and wonderful plants all around were tall pines and jadegreen bamboo
After another two or three miles he reached the third gates Journey to the West slipped inside for a peep and saw the three old demons sitting on high They looked thoroughly evil
The one in the middle Had teeth like chisels and saws A round head and a square face
His voice roared like thunder His eyes flashed like lightning
Upturned nostrils faced the sky Red eyebrows blazed with fire
Wherever he walked The animals were terrified If he sat down The demons all trembled
He was the king among the beasts The Bluehaired Lion Monster
The one sitting on his left was like this Phoenix eyes with golden pupils Yellow tusks and powerful thighs
Silver hair sprouting from a long nose Making his head look like a tail His brow was rounded and wrinkled His body massively heavy
His voice as delicate as a beautiful woman's But his face was as fiendish as an oxheaded demon's
Journey to the West He treasured his tusks and cultivated his person for many years The Ancient Yellowtusked Elephant
The one on the right had Golden wings and a leviathan's head Leopard eyes with starry pupils
He shook the North when he headed South Fierce strong and brave
When he turned to soaring Quails laughed but dragons were terrified
When he beat his phoenix wings the birds all hid their heads And the beasts all lost their nerve when he spread his talons
He could fly thirty thousand miles through the clouds The Mighty Roc
Beneath these two were ranged a hundred and ten commanders high and low all in full armor and looking most imposing and murderous
The sight delighted Brother Monkey who strode inside quite unafraid put down his clappers and bell and called Your Majesties The three old demons chuckled and replied So you're back young Windpiercer Yes Monkey replied
When you were patrolling what did you find out about where Sun the Novice is Your Majesties Monkey replied I don't dare tell you Why not the senior demon chief asked
I was walking along sounding my clappers and ringing my bell following Your Majesties' orders Monkey said when all of a sudden I looked up and saw someone squatting and polishing a pole there He looked like one of the gods that clear the way If he'd stood up he'd have been well over a hundred feet tall
He'd scooped up some water in his hand and was polishing his iron bar on the rocky scar He was saying to himself that his cudgel still hadn't the chance to show its magical powers here and that when he'd shined it up he was coming to attack Your Majesties
That's how I realized he was Sun the Novice and came here to report Journey to the West On hearing this the senior demon chief broke into a sweat all over and shivered so that his teeth chattered as he said Brothers I don't think we should start any trouble with the Tang Priest
His disciple has tremendous magical powers and he's polishing his cudgel to attack us
Whatever are we to do Little ones he shouted call everybody high and low who's outside the cave to come inside and shut the gates
Let them pass Your Majesty said one of the subordinate officers who knew what had happened the little devils outside have all scattered Why the senior demon asked
They must have heard about his terrible reputation
Shut the gates at once
At once The hosts of demons noisily bolted all the front and back gates firmly
Now they've shut the gates they might ask me all sorts of questions about things in here Monkey thought with alarm If I don't know the right answers I'll give the game away and they'll catch me
I'd better give them another scare and get them to open the gates to let me out Your Majesty he said stepping forward there were some other wicked things he said What else the senior demon chief asked
He said he was going to skin Your Senior Majesty replied Brother Monkey slice up the bones of His Second Majesty and rip out His Third Majesty's sinews
If you shut the gates and refuse to go out he can do transformations He might turn himself into a fly get in through a crack between the gates and catch us all
Then we'll be done for Be very careful brothers said the senior demon
We haven't had a fly here for years so any fly that gets in will be Sun the Novice So I'll change into a fly and frighten them into opening the gates thought Monkey smiling to himself
The splendid Great Sage then slipped aside reached up to pull a hair from the back of his head blew on it with a magic breath called Change and turned it into a golden fly that flew straight into the old demon's face
Brothers said the old demon in a panic this is terrible
He's inside All the demons great and small were so alarmed that they rushed forward to swat the fly with their rakes and brooms
The Great Sage could not help giggling aloud which was just what he should not have done as it revealed his true face
The third demon chief leapt forward grabbed him and said Brothers he almost had us fooled Who had who fooled the senior demon asked
The young devil who reported just now was no junior Windpiercer the third chief replied but Sun the Novice himself
He must have run into a junior Windpiercer and somehow or other murdered him and done this transformation to trick us He's rumbled me thought Monkey with alarm rubbing his face
What do you mean I'm Sun the Novice Monkey said to the senior demon chief
I'm a junior Windpiercer
His Majesty's mistaken Journey to the West Brother said the senior demon he really is a junior Windpiercer
He's in the rollcall out front three times a day I know him
Do you have a pass he went on to ask Monkey
Yes Monkey replied pulling his clothes apart to produce it
Seeing that it looked genuine the senior demon said Brother don't mistreat him Elder brother the third demon chief replied didn't you see him slip aside just now and giggle I saw him show his face it's like a thunder god's
When I grabbed hold of him he turned back into what he looks like now
Little ones he called fetch ropes The officers then fetched ropes
The third demon chief knocked Monkey over and tied his hands and feet together
When his clothes were stripped off he was most evidently the Protector of the Horses
Now of the seventytwo transformations that Monkey could perform when he turned himself into a bird a beast a plant a tree a vessel or an insect he changed his whole body
When he turned into another person however he could only change his head and face but not his body and indeed he was still covered with brown hair and had red thighs and a tail
That's Sun the Novice's body the senior demon chief said when he saw this and a junior Windpiercer's face
It's him
Little ones he ordered bring wine and give His Third Majesty a cup of it to congratulate him
Now that we've captured Sun the Novice the Tang Priest is as good as a meal in our mouths We mustn't drink now said the third demon chief
Sun the Novice is a slippery customer and is good at escaping by magic I'm worried he might get away
Tell the juniors to bring the jar out and put him inside
Then we can drink Yes yes said the senior demon chief with a smile who then chose thirtysix little demons to go inside open the storerooms and carry the jar out
Do you know how big the jar was
It was only two feet four inches high
So why were thirtysix people needed to carry it
It was because the jar was a treasure of the two vital forces male and female and contained the seven precious things the eight trigrams and the twentyfour periods of the year that thirtysix carriers were required to match the number of the stars of the Dipper
Before long the precious jar had been carried out set down outside the third pair of gates cleaned up and opened
Monkey was untied stripped bare and sucked inside the jar with a hiss by magical vapor that came out of it
The lid was then put back on and sealed on with a label after which the demons went off to drink saying Now that he's in our jar that monkey can forget all about his journey West
The only way he'll be able to pay his respects to the Buddha and fetch the scriptures now will be by pushing the wheel of destiny backwards and being reborn Watch how all the demons great and small go laughing off to celebrate
But of that no more Once inside the jar the Great Sage who was very cramped decided to transform himself and squat down in the middle where he found it very cool
Those evil spirits don't live up to their reputation he said to himself laughing aloud
Why ever do they tell people that anyone put in this jar will be turned to pus and blood in a few moments
It's so cool that spending seven or eight years here would be no problem Alas
The Great Sage did not know about this treasure Anyone put inside it who said nothing for a year would stay cool for a year but the moment a voice was heard fires began to turn
Before Monkey had finished speaking the whole jar was full of flame
Luckily he could use the knack of making fireaverting magic with his hands as he sat in the middle of the jar completely unafraid
When he had endured the flames for an hour forty snakes emerged from all around to bite him
Swinging his arms about him Monkey grabbed hold of all of them twisted with all his strength and broke them into eighty pieces
A little later three fire dragons Journey to the West appeared to circle above and below Monkey which was really unbearable
It drove Monkey into a helpless desperation of which he was only too conscious The other things were no trouble he said but these three fire dragons are a real problem
If I don't get out soon the fire will attack my heart and what then
I'll make myself grow he went on to think and push my way out The splendid Great Sage made a spell with his hands said the words of a spell and called out Grow He made himself over a dozen feet tall but as he grew the jar grew with him enclosing him tightly
When he made himself smaller the jar shrank too
This is terrible Brother Monkey thought with alarm terrible
It grows when I grow and shrinks when I get smaller
What am I to do Before he had finished speaking his ankle began to hurt
Putting his hand down at once to feel it he found that it had been burnt so badly it had gone soft
I don't know what to do he said with anxiety My ankle's been cooked tender
I'm a cripple now He could not stop the tears from flowing
Indeed When suffering at the demons' hands he thought of his master In facing deadly peril he worried about the Tang Priest
Master he exclaimed since I was converted by the Bodhisattva Guanyin and delivered from my heavenly punishment you and I have toiled over many a mountain
I've beaten and wiped out a lot of monsters subdued Pig and Friar Sand and gone through no end of suffering All this was done in the hope of reaching the West and completing the true achievement together Never did I expect to meet these vicious demons today
Now I've been stupid enough to get myself killed in here I've left you stuck in the middle of the mountains
What a mess to be in for someone who used to be as famous as I was Just when he was feeling thoroughly miserable he suddenly remembered Years ago the Bodhisattva gave me three lifesaving hairs on the Coiled Snake Mountain I wonder if I've still got them
I'd better look for them He felt all over his body and found three very rigid hairs on the back of his head
All the other hair on my body is soft except for these three that are as hard as spears he said with delight
They must be my lifesavers Gritting his teeth against the pain he pulled the three hairs out blew on them with magic breath and called Change One of them turned into a steel drill one into a strip of bamboo and one into a silken cord
He made the bamboo strip into a bow to which he fixed the drill
After a noisy spell of drilling at the bottom of the jar he made a hole through which the light came in
I'm in luck he said with glee I'm in luck
Now I can get out No sooner had he transformed himself ready to escape than the jar became cool again
Why was that
It cooled because the hole he had bored in it let the male and female vital forces escape
The splendid Great Sage put his hairs back made himself small by turning into the tiniest of insects a very delicate creature as thin as a whisker and as long as an eyebrow hair and slipped out through the hole Instead of making his escape Monkey flew straight to the senior demon chief's head and landed on it
The senior demon who was drinking slammed his goblet down and asked Third brother has Sun the Novice been liquefied yet Is the time up the third demon chief asked
The senior demon told his messengers to carry the jar in
When the thirtysix young devils picked the jar up they found that it was far lighter
Journey to the West Your Majesty they reported with alarm the jar's lighter Nonsense the senior demon shouted It has the full powers of the male and female vital forces
It couldn't possibly get lighter One of the junior demons who liked showing off picked the jar up and said Look
It is lighter isn't it When the senior demon took the lid off to look in he saw that it was bright inside It's empty he could not help shouting aloud it's leaked And Monkey sitting on his head could not help shouting Search my lads
He's escaped He's escaped all the monsters shouted he's escaped The order was then given to shut the gates
With that Monkey shook himself took back the clothes that had been taken off him turned back into himself and leapt out of the cave Behave yourselves evil spirits he flung back insultingly
I've bored through the jar and you can't keep anyone in it any more
You'll have to take it outside and shit in it Shouting and yelling with glee he went straight back on his cloud to where the Tang Priest was
Here he found the venerable gentleman making symbolic incense with a pinch of earth and praying to the sky
Monkey stopped his cloud to listen to what he was saying
Sanzang had his hands together in front of his chest and was saying to Heaven All you immortals up there in the clouds The Dings and the Jias and each god and goddess Protect my disciple whose powers are enormous And magic is boundless the good Sun the Novice When the Great Sage heard this he decided to redouble his efforts
Putting his cloud away he went up to Sanzang and called Master I'm back Sanzang held him as he said Wukong you have been to great trouble
I was very concerned because you had gone so far into these high mountains and not come back for so long a time
How dangerous is the mountain in fact Master Monkey replied with a smile that trip just now depended in the first place on the good destiny of all the living beings in the East secondly on your boundless achievement and great virtue and thirdly on your disciple's magical powers Then he told the whole story of how he had pretended to be a Windpiercer been drawn into the jar and escaped
Now I've seen your face again Master It's like having a second life Sanzang expressed endless thanks then asked Did you not fight the evil spirits this time No I didn't replied Brother Monkey
Journey to the West Then you won't be able to escort me safely across this mountain Sanzang said at which Monkey who hated to admit he was beaten shouted What do you mean I won't be able to escort you If you and they have not yet had it out and you can only give me evasive answers I will never dare press ahead the venerable elder replied
Master laughed the Great Sage you really don't understand
As the saying goes you can't spin a thread from a single strand of silk and you can't clap onehanded
There are three demon chiefs and thousands of the little devils How could I fight them all singlehanded If you are that outnumbered you would indeed find it hard by yourself Sanzang replied
Pig and Friar Sand also have their talents I shall tell them to go with you to help you clean up the path across the mountain and escort me over it What you say is completely right Master replied Monkey with a smile
Tell Friar Sand to protect you while Pig comes with me Brother said Pig in alarm you're a poor judge
I'm rough and I can't do anything much I'd just get in the way as I walked along
What use would I be to you You may not be up to much brother Monkey replied but you're someone
As the saying goes even a fart can swell the wind
You'd make me feel a bit braver All right Pig said all right You can take me with you
But don't play any of your tricks on me when the going gets tough Don't forget that Friar Sand and I will be waiting here said Sanzang
The idiot braced himself and set off a gale with Monkey that carried them by cloud up to the top of the mountain where the entrance to the cave was
They saw at once that the gates were shut tight There was nobody in sight anywhere around
Monkey went forward his iron cudgel in his hands to shout at the top of his voice Open up evil monsters
Come out right now and fight Monkey When the young devils in the cave went inside to report the senior demon shook with terror as he commented I've heard tell for years of that monkey's ferocity Now I can vouch for the story's veracity What do you mean elder brother the second demon chief asked
When that Sun the Novice first turned himself into a fly to sneak in here none of us realized who he was except our Third Brother who put him in the jar He used his skills to drill a hole in the jar pick up his clothes and get out
Now he's outside challenging us to battle Who's brave enough to be the first to take him on Nobody replied
The senior demon asked again again there was no response Everyone was pretending to be deaf and dumb
Journey to the West We've got ourselves a lousy reputation in the West already the senior demon chief said in fury Now that Sun the Novice has treated us with such contempt today our reputation will stand even lower if we don't fight him
I'm going out there to chance my old life on three rounds with him
If I can hold out for those three rounds the Tang Priest will still be a meal in our mouths
If I can't then shut the gates and let them pass He then kitted himself out in his armor had the gates opened and went out
As Monkey and Pig watched from beside the gates they saw that he was a fine monster On iron brow and brazen head a precious helmet With tassels dancing brightly in the wind
His eyes both flashed as if with lightning And ruddy glowed the hair at his temples
Pointed and sharp were his silvery claws And his sawlike teeth were set close and neat
His armor was golden without any seam Bound with a dragon sash that could foresee the future
In his hand flashed a cutlass of steel Such martial might is rare in the world
With a voice that roared like thunder he asked Who is that knocking at my gates Your grandfather Lord Sun the Great Sage Equaling Heaven said Monkey turning to face the gate
Are you Sun the Novice asked the demon with a laugh You've got a cheek ape
I never gave you any trouble so why are you here challenging me to battle 'No waves come without a wind without the tide the waters are still' Monkey replied
Would I have come looking for you if you hadn't given me trouble
The reason why I'm here to fight is because your gang of foxes and dogs is plotting to eat my master From the way you're acting so fierce and shouting at our gates you must want a fight the old demon replied
Yes Monkey said
Stop all that ranting and raving then said the demon
It would be most unfair if I brought out my devil soldiers and drew them up in battle order with flags flying and drums beating to fight you as I'm on my own territory
I'll fight you singlehanded with no helpers for either side Journey to the West When Monkey heard this he shouted Keep out of the way Pig and let's see how he copes with me The idiot did indeed get out of the way
Come over here the senior demon shouted and be a chopping block for me Let me hack you three times as hard as I can with sword on your bare head After that I'll let your Tang Priest pass
If you can't take it then hand your Tang Priest over at once
He'll be a tasty morsel to help our rice down Bring out a brush and some paper if you have them in your cave and I'll give you a bond
You can hack at me from today till next year but it'll be nothing to me The old demon then summoned up all his might took up a stance with his feet apart lifted his sword with both hands and hacked at the top of the Great Sage's head
The Great Sage raised his head and though there was a mighty crash his scalp did not even go red
That monkey really does have a hard head exclaimed the old demon with shock
You wouldn't know about it said Monkey with a laugh
I was Born with a skull of bronze and iron Like nobody else's in all the world
Hammer and axe will never smash me I went in Lord Lao Zi's furnace when I was a boy
The Star Lords of the Four Dippers helped mould me The twentyeight constellations all used their skill
I've often been soaked in water but never come to harm And all over my body the sinews are knotty
The Tang Priest fearing I would not stand firm Placed a golden band around my head Cut out that insolence ape the senior demon said and take these two blows from my sword
I'm most certainly not going to spare your life It's nothing Monkey replied
Have another cut like that if you like You monkey the old demon said you don't know about this sword Journey to the West Created in furnaces of metal and fire A hundred times tempered by divine craftsmanship
Its sharp blade follows the Three Strategies And it is as strong as described in the Six Plans
The point is as fine as a housefly's tail And supple as the body of a white dragon
When it goes to the mountains dense clouds arise If it plunges into the sea the great waves roll
It has been burnished times beyond number Heated and tempered many hundred times over
Deep in the mountains it is kept in the caves Great is the glory it has won when in battle
If I use it to strike at your monkish pate I'll cut it into a pair of gourd ladles You're blind evil spirit laughed the Great Sage if you think my head is just gourd ladles
I'll let you hack at me if you're silly enough to want to
Have another go and see what happens The senior demon raised his sword for another hack which the Great Sage moved his head forward to meet
With a loud band his head was split into two whereupon the Great Sage rolled on the ground and gave himself a second body
The sight so alarmed the demon that he lowered his sword
Watching all this from a distance Pig said with a laugh Give him a couple more hacks old devil then there'll be four of him Pointing at Brother Monkey the senior demon said I'd heard that you can use selfdividing magic
Why are you showing it off to me now What selfdividing magic Monkey asked
Why was it that the first time I hacked you it made no impact but this time I cut you in two the senior demon asked
Don't worry evil spirit said the Great Sage with a smile
If you cut me ten thousand times there'll be twenty thousand of me You ape the demon said you may be able to divide yourself but you can't put yourself together again
If you can hit me with your cudgel Journey to the West Don't talk nonsense said the Great Sage
You asked to take three cuts at me but only took two Now you've invited me to hit you once
I'm not Monkey if I hit you one and a half times Very well said the senior demon
The splendid Great Sage hugged his two bodies together rolled became one body again and struck with his cudgel at the demon's head
The old demon raised his sword to parry the blow Damned ape he said you've got a cheek How dare you come here attacking me with a mourner's staff like that If you ask about this cudgel of mine shouted the Great Sage everybody in heaven and earth has heard of it What's it famous for the senior demon asked
To this Monkey replied The cudgel is made of ninecycled wrought iron Tempered by Lord Lao Zi himself in his furnace
King Yu called it a divine treasure when he obtained it To hold the eight rivers and four oceans in place
In its middle the constellations are secretly set out And each end is banded with yellow gold
Ghosts and gods are amazed at its intricate decorations Dragon patterns and phoenix signs
Known as the Divine Male Cudgel It was inaccessibly deep in the bed of the sea
Its shape can change and it knows how to fly Sending clouds of many colours drifting through the air
Once it was mine I took it back to my mountain Where I discovered how its infinite changes
When I want size it's as thick as a vat Or it can be as thin as an iron wire Huge as a mountain or small as a needle Adapting its length to the wishes of my heart
Journey to the West Lightly I lift it and coloured clouds spring up Or it flies through the sky and flashes like lightning
The cold air it gives off chills all who feel it And ominous mists appear in the sky
I have carried it with me to beat dragons and tigers Travelling to all of the ends of the earth
Once with this cudgel I made havoc in heaven And used its great might to wreck the peach banquet
The heavenly kings were unable to beat me And Nezha was hard pressed to match me in combat
With this cudgel against them the gods had no safe refuge A hundred thousand heavenly troops all scattered and fled
The gods of thunder guarded the Hall of Miraculous Mist When the cudgel attacked the Palace of Universal Brightness All of the angels at court were flustered And the Jade Emperor's ministers were thrown into panic
I raised my cudgel to overturn the Palace of the Dipper Then turned back to shake up the South Pole Compound
Seeing my dread cudgel at his golden gates The Jade Emperor invited the Buddha to see me
The soldier takes defeat and victory in his stride There is nothing to choose between suffering and disaster
I stuck it out for full five hundred years Until I was converted by the Bodhisattva Guanyin
Then a holy monk appeared in Tang Who swore a mighty oath to heaven Journey to the West To save the souls in the City of the Unjustly Slain And fetch the sutras at an assembly on Vulture Mountain
On the journey to the West are many evil monsters Whose actions would be a great obstacle to him
So knowing that my cudgel is matchless in the world He begged me to be his companion on the journey
When it struck down evil spirits they were sent to the Underworld Their flesh turned to red dust and their bones all to powder
Evil spirits everywhere were killed by the cudgel In thousands upon thousands too numerous to count
Up above it wrecked the Dipper and Bull Palace And below it ruined the Senluo Court in Hell
Of the heavenly generals it routed the Nine Bright Shiners And it wounded all of the Underworld's judges
Dropped from midair it shakes mountains and rivers It is stronger than the sword of an evil star
With this cudgel alone I protect the Tang Priest And kill all the evil monsters in the world When the monster heard this he trembled lifted his sword and struck with all his strength
Chuckling Monkey blocked the blow with his iron cudgel
At first the two of them struggled in front of the cave but then they both sprang up and fought in midair It was a splendid battle
The divine rod had once secured the bed of Heaven's River
The AsYouWill cudgel is the finest in the world Praise of its powers enraged the demon chief Whose mighty cutlass was full of great magic
Journey to the West When they fought outside the gates they were still open to reason But no mercy was shown in their battle in the sky
One could change his appearance at will The other could make himself grow on the spot
The fight was so intense that the sky filled with clouds And all of the plains were enveloped in mist
One had often determined to devour the monk Sanzang The other used his magic to protect the Tang Priest
All because the Lord Buddha transmitted the scriptures Evil and good were opposed in harsh conflict
The senior demon and the Great Sage fought over twenty rounds without either emerging the victor while Pig admired their magnificent battle from down below until unable to restrain himself he grabbed his rake and leapt up into the air riding on the wind to strike at the evil monster's face
The demon panicked not realizing that Pig had no staying power but could only rush recklessly in and give people a fright
All the demon could see was that Pig had a long snout big ears and a vicious way with his rake so he abandoned the struggle threw his sword away turned and fled
After him the Great Sage shouted after him The idiot raised his rake and went down in all his ferocious might straight after the monster
Seeing how close Pig was to him the old demon stood still in front of the mountainside faced the wind shook himself resumed his real appearance and opened his mouth to devour Pig
This so terrified Pig that he fled as fast as he could into the undergrowth not caring that brambles and thorns were tearing his head He sat there trembling and listening out for the sound of the cudgel When Monkey caught up with him the monster opened his jaws to eat Monkey up too This was just what Monkey intended
Putting his cudgel away he went straight towards the demon who swallowed him in a single gulp
This gave the idiot such a fright as he was hiding in the undergrowth that he grumbled to himself You've got no common sense Protector of the Horses
Why did you go towards the monster when he wanted to eat you up instead of running away Now he's swallowed you
Today you're still a monk but tomorrow you'll be a turd Only when the monster had departed in triumph did Pig emerge from the undergrowth and slip back by the way he had come
Sanzang and Friar Sand were still waiting for Pig at the foot of the mountain when they saw him come running breathless towards them
Pig said Sanzang with horror why are you in this terrible state
Why is Wukong not here My brother was swallowed up by the evil spirit in a single gulp Pig replied amid sobs at which Sanzang collapsed in terror
A little later he stamped and beat his chest saying Disciple I thought you were good at subduing demons and were going to take me to see the Buddha in the Western Heaven Who would have thought that you would die at this demon's hand today
All the efforts of my disciples have now Journey to the West turned to dust The master was thoroughly miserable Just look at the idiot
Instead of coming over to comfort his master he calls Friar Sand fetch the luggage
Let's split it between us Why brother Friar Sand asked
Divide it up Pig replied and all of us can go our separate ways You can go back to the River of Flowing Sand and carry on eating people
I'll go back to Gao Village and see my wife
We can sell the white horse to buy the master a coffin to be buried in The master was so upset when he heard this that he wept aloud to Heaven
We shall leave them and return to the senior demon chief When he had swallowed Monkey he thought he had won so he went straight back to his cave where all the other demons came out to ask him how the fight had gone
I've got one of them the senior demon said
Which one is that asked the second demon with delight
Sun the Novice the senior demon replied
Where have you got him the second demon chief said
In my stomach said the senior demon I swallowed him Elder brother said the third demon chief with horror I forgot to tell you that Sun the Novice wasn't worth eating I'm delicious said the Great Sage from inside the demon's stomach and I'll stop you from ever feeling hungry again This caused the junior devils such a shock that they reported This is terrible Your Senior Majesty
Sun the Novice is talking inside your stomach That doesn't frighten me said the senior demon
If I'm clever enough to catch him do you think I'm not clever enough to deal with him Make me some hot salty water at once
I'll pour it into my stomach vomit him out and have him fried at my leisure to eat as a snack with some drinks The junior devils soon had ready half a bowl of hot salty water that the old demon drained in one filling his mouth
He then really did vomit but the Great Sage who had taken root in his stomach did not even move
The monster then pressed his throat and vomited again till his head was spinning his eyes in a daze and his gallbladder split but still Monkey would not be shifted
By now the senior demon was gasping for breath Sun the Novice he called won't you come out Not yet Monkey replied
I don't want to come out now Why not the old demon asked
Journey to the West You really don't understand evil spirit said Monkey
Ever since I've been a monk I've had scant food and clothing Although it's autumn now and getting cool I'm still only wearing a thin tunic
But it's warm in your stomach and there are no drafts down here
I think I'll spend the winter here before coming out When the evil spirits heard this they all said Your Majesty Sun the Novice wants to spend the winter in your stomach If he wants to spend the winter there I'll take to meditation and use magic to shift him the senior demon said I won't eat anything all winter
The Protector of the Horses will starve to death You just don't understand my boy the Great Sage said
I came via Guangzhou when I started escorting the Tang Priest and I've got a folding cooking pan with me that I brought in here to cook myself a mixed grill
I'll take my time enjoying your liver bowels stomach and lungs
They'll be enough to keep me going till spring Brother said the second demon chief with shock that ape would do it too Brother said the third demon perhaps he can eat up some bits and pieces but I don't know where is he going to set up his pan The collar bone is an ideal stand replied Monkey
This is terrible said the third demon If he sets up his pan and lights a fire won't the smoke get into your nose and make you sneeze That'll be no problem said Monkey with a laugh I'll use my goldbanded cudgel to push a hole through his skull
That'll be a skylight for me and serve as a chimney too The old demon heard this and was most alarmed despite saying that he was not afraid All he could do was to summon up his courage and call Don't be scared brothers
Bring me some of that drugged wine
When I down a few goblets of that the drugs will kill the monkey At this Monkey smiled to himself and thought When I made havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago I drank the Jade Emperor's wine and ate Lord Lao Zi's elixir the Queen Mother's peaches the marrow of phoenix bones and dragon livers I've eaten everything
What kind of drugged wine could do me any harm By then the junior devils had strained two jugfuls of drugged wine a goblet of which they handed to the senior demon chief who took it in his hands
Monkey who could smell it from inside the demon's belly called out Don't give it to him The splendid Great Sage then tipped his head back and turned it into the bell of a trumpet that he placed wide open below the demon's throat
The demon gulped the wine down noisily and Monkey noisily received it
The demon swallowed the second cupful and Monkey noisily drank that too
This went on till Monkey had drunk all of the seven or eight cupfuls that the demon downed
That's enough the demon said putting the goblet down
Normally my stomach feels as if it's on fire after a couple of cups of this wine he said but this time my face hasn't even gone red after seven or eight Now the Great Sage was not a heavy drinker so after taking these seven or eight cupfuls he started to act drunk in the demon's stomach propping himself up falling flat on his face kicking about him swinging on the demon's liver doing headstands and somersaults and dancing wildly
This caused the monster such unbearable pain that he collapsed
Journey to the West If you don't know whether he lived or died listen to the explanation in the next installment
When the Heart Spirit Stays in the Home the Demons Submit The Mother of Wood Helps Bring Monsters to the Truth The story tells how after the Great Sage had struggled in his stomach for a while the senior demon collapsed in the dust He made no sound and was not breathing either As he said nothing Monkey thought the demon was dead so he stopped hitting him
When the demon chief recovered his breath he called out Most merciful and most compassionate Bodhisattva Great Sage Equaling Heaven My boy said Monkey when he heard this don't waste your effort
You could save yourself a few words by simply calling me Grandpa Sun Desperate to save his skin the evil monster really did call out Grandpa Grandpa
I was wrong I shouldn't have eaten you and now you're destroying me
I beg you Great Sage in your mercy and compassion take pity on my antlike greed for life and spare me
If you do I'll escort your master across the mountain Although the Great Sage was a tough hero he was most eager to help the Tang Priest in his journey so on hearing the evil monster's pathetic pleas and flattery he decided once more to be kind Evil monster he shouted I'll spare your life
How are you going to escort my master We don't have any gold silver pearls jade agate coral crystal amber tortoiseshell or other such treasures here to give him but my two brothers and I will carry him in a rattan chair across the mountain If you could carry him in a chair that would be better than treasure said Monkey with a smile
Open your mouth
I'm coming out The demon then opened his mouth whereupon the third chief went over to him and whispered in his ear Bite him as he comes out brother Chew the monkey to bits and swallow him
Then he won't be able to hurt you Now Monkey could hear all this from inside so instead of coming straight out he thrust his goldbanded cudgel out first as a test
The demon did indeed take a bite at it noisily smashing one of his front teeth in the process
You're a nice monster aren't you exclaimed Monkey pulling his cudgel back I spare your life and agree to come out but you try to murder me by biting me
I'm not coming out now I'm going to kill you
I won't come out
I won't Brother the senior demon chief complained to the third one what you've done is destroy one of your own kind
I'd persuaded him to come out but you would have to tell me to bite him
Now I'm in agony from my broken tooth What are we to do In the face of the senior demon chief's complaints the third demon chief tried the method of making the enemy lose his temper
Sun the Novice he yelled at the top of his voice you have a thundering reputation They tell of how Journey to the West mighty you were outside the Southern Gate of Heaven and at the Hall of Miraculous Mist I'd heard that you've been capturing demons along your way to the Western Heaven But now I see that you're only a very smalltime ape What makes me smalltime Monkey asked
A hero who only roams three hundred miles around will go three thousand miles to make his fame resound the third chief replied
Come out and fight me if you're a real tough guy
What do you mean by messing about in someone else's stomach
If you're not smalltime what are you Yes yes yes thought Monkey when he heard this
It wouldn't be at all difficult for me to tear this demon's bowels to bits rip up his liver and kill him the Great Sage shouted
But I'd destroy my own reputation in the process
I'll have to forget about it Open your mouth and I'll come out and fight you
The only problem is that this cave of yours is much too cramped for me to use my weapons
We'll have to go somewhere where there's more room On hearing this the third demon chief mustered all the demons young and old from all around There were over thirty thousand of them armed with the finest and sharpest weapons who came out of the cave to form a line of battle symbolizing heaven earth and mankind They were all waiting for Monkey to come out of the senior demon's mouth before rushing him
The second demon chief then helped the senior demon out through the entrance of the cave where he shouted Sun the Novice If you're such a tough guy come out
There's good battlefield here for us to fight on The Great Sage could tell that this was an open area from the calls of crows magpies and cranes that he could hear in the monster's belly
If I don't come out I'll be breaking faith with them he thought
But if I do these demons are beasts at heart behind their human faces They tried to lure me out and bite me when they promised to carry the master across the ridge Now they've got their army here Oh well I'll let them have it both ways
I'll go out but I'll leave a root in his stomach too With that he put his hand behind him to pluck a tiny hair from his tail blew on it with magic breath called Change and made it into a string as fine as a hair but some four hundred feet long
As the string came outside it grew thicker in the wind
One end Monkey fastened round the evil monster's heart in a slipknot that he did not tightenif he had it would have caused great pain
The other end he held in his hand as he said to himself If they agree to escort my master across the ridge when I come out this time I'll leave it at that
But if they refuse and go for me with their weapons so hard that I can't cope with them I'll just need to pull this rope
I'll get the same results as if I were still inside He then made himself tiny and crawled up as far as the throat from where he could see that the evil spirit had opened his mouth wide Rows of steel teeth were set above and below like sharp knives This is no good he thought at once no good at all
If I take this rope out through his mouth and he can't stand the pain he'll be able to cut through it with a single bite
I'll have to go out where there aren't any teeth The splendid Great Sage paid out the string as he crawled up the demon's upper palate and into his nostril which made his nose itch
The demon sneezed with a loud atchoo blowing Monkey out
As he felt the wind blowing him Monkey bowed and grew over thirty feet long keeping the string in one hand and holding the iron cudgel in the other
The wicked monster raised his steel sword as soon as he saw Monkey appear and hacked at his face
The Great Sage met the blow onehanded with his cudgel
Then the second demon chief with his spear and the third chief with his halberd went for him furiously
The Great Sage relaxed his pull on the rope put his iron cudgel away and made off at speed by cloud afraid that he would be unable to fight properly when surrounded by so many young devils
Once he had leapt out of the demons' camp he brought his cloud down on a spacious and empty mountain top and pulled with both hands on the rope as hard Journey to the West as he could This gave the senior demon a pain in the heart
The demon struggled upwards in agony whereupon the Great Sage pulled him down again
As they all watched from afar the junior demons all shouted Don't provoke him Your Majesty Let him go
That ape has no sense of when things ought to be done
He's flying a kite before the beginning of April When the Great Sage heard this he gave a mighty stamp at which the senior demon came whistling down out of the sky like a spinningwheel to crash into the dust making a crater some two feet deep in the hard earth at the foot of the mountain
This gave the second and third demon chiefs such a fright that they landed their clouds together and rushed forward to grab hold of the rope and kneel at the foot of the mountain Great Sage they pleaded we thought you were an immortal of vast and boundless generosity We'd never dreamed that you would be as smallminded as a rat or a snail
It's true that we lured you out to give battle but we never expected that you would tie a rope round our eldest brother's heart You're a thorough disgrace you damned gang of demons said Monkey with a laugh
Last time you tried to trick me into coming out so you could bite me and this time you've lured me out to face an army ready for battle
It's obvious that you've got tens of thousands of soldiers here to tackle me when I'm alone Most unreasonable I'll pull him away
I'm going to drag him off to see my master If in your mercy and compassion you spare our lives Great Sage the demons said all kowtowing together we vow to escort your master across this mountain If you want to live all you have to do is cut the rope with your sword said Monkey with a laugh
My lord the senior monster said I can cut the rope outside but it's no good having the length inside that's tied round my heart
It sticks in my throat so uncomfortably that it makes me feel sick In that case said Monkey open your mouth and I'll go back inside to undo the rope This alarmed the senior demon who said If you don't come out when you go in this time I'll be in a mess a real mess I know how to undo the end of the rope that's in you from the outside Monkey replied
But when I've undone it will you really escort my master across We will as soon as you've undone it the senior demon chief replied
I wouldn't dare lie about this Now that he had satisfied himself the demon was telling the truth Monkey shook himself and put the hair back on his body whereupon the monster's heart pains stopped
It was the Great Sage Sun's transforming magic that had tied the hair round his heart in the first place which was why the pain ended as soon as the hair was put back on Monkey
The three demon chiefs then rose up into the air to thank him with the words Please go back now Great Sage and pack your luggage
We will carry a chair down to fetch him The demon horde then all put their weapons down and went back into the cave
Having put his rope away the Great Sage went straight back to the Eastern side of the ridge and when he was still a long way away he saw the Tang Priest lying on the ground rolling around and howling Pig and Friar Sand had opened the bundles of luggage and were dividing it up Don't tell me thought Monkey with a quiet sigh
No doubt Pig has told the master that I've been eaten up by evil spirits The master's sobbing his heart out because he can't bear to be without me and the idiot's dividing the things ready for us all to split up
Oh dear
I can't be sure so I'd better go down and give the Journey to the West master a shout Bringing his cloud down Monkey shouted Master As soon as Friar Sand heard this he started complaining to Pig
All you want is to see people dead just like a coffin stand he said Our elder brother wasn't killed but you said he was and started this business here
Of course he's bound to kick up a row But I saw him with my own eyes being eaten up by the evil spirit in one mouthful Pig replied
I'm sure we're just seeing that ape's spirit because it's an unlucky day Monkey then went up to Pig and hit him in the face with a slap that sent him staggering Cretin he said
Is this my spirit you can see Rubbing his face the idiot replied But the monster really did eat you up brother How can youhow can you have come back to life Useless gumboil said Monkey
After he ate me I grabbed his bowels twisted his lungs tied a rope round his heart and tore at him till he was in horrible agony Then they all kowtowed and pleaded with me so I spared his life
Now they're bringing a carryingchair here to take the master over the mountain As soon as Sanzang heard this he scrambled to his feet bowed to Monkey and said Disciple I've put you to enormous trouble
If I had believed what Wuneng said we would have been finished Chaffguzzling idiot Monkey said abusively taking a swing at Pig with his fist you're thoroughly lazy and barely human
But don't get upset Master
The monsters are coming to take you across the mountain Friar Sand too felt deeply ashamed and quickly trying to cover it up he packed up the luggage and loaded the horse to wait on the road
The story returns to the three demon chiefs who led their devilish hosts back into the cave Elder brother said the second demon I'd imagined that Sun the Novice had nine heads and eight tails but he turns out to be nothing but that pipsqueak of a monkey
You shouldn't have swallowed him You should have fought him He'd have been no match for us
With our tens of thousands of goblins we could have drowned him in our spit
But by swallowing him you let him use his magic and cause you agony so that you didn't dare have it out with him
When I said we'd take the Tang Priest across the mountains just now I didn't mean it It was only a way of luring him out because your life was in danger
I most certainly won't escort the Tang Priest Why not good brother the senior demon chief asked
If you and I draw up three thousand junior devils ready for battle I can capture that ape the second demon replied
Never mind about three thousand the senior demon chief said You can have our whole force
If we capture him it'll be a credit to us all The second demon chief then mustered three thousand junior demons whom he led to a place beside the main road where they were put into battle formation He sent a herald with a blue flag to carry a message
Sun the Novice the herald said come out at once and fight His Second Majesty Journey to the West When Pig heard this he said with a laugh As the saying goes brother liars don't fool the people at home
You lied to us when you came back you trickster You said you'd beaten the evil spirits and that they'd be bringing a carryingchair to take the master across But here they are challenging you to battle Why The senior demon did surrender to me Monkey replied and he wouldn't dare show his face The sound of my name alone is enough to give him a headache
The second demon chief must be challenging me to battle because he can't bring himself to escort us across
I tell you brother those three evil spirits are brothers and they have a sense of honour
We're three brothers but we don't
I've beaten the senior demon so the second demon's come out
There's no reason why you shouldn't fight him I'm not scared of him Pig said
I'll go and give him a fight If you want to go ahead Monkey replied
Brother said Pig with a laugh I'll go but lend me that rope What do you want it for Monkey asked
You don't know how to get into his belly or tie it to his heart so what use would it be to you I want it tied round my waist as a lifeline replied Pig
You and Friar Sand are to hold on to it and let it out for me to fight him
If you think I'm beating him pay more rope out and I'll capture him but if he's beating me pull me back
Don't let him drag me off At this Monkey smiled to himself and thought Another chance to make a fool of the idiot Monkey then tied the rope round Pig's waist and sent him off into battle
The idiot lifted his rake and rushed up the steep slope shouting Come out evil spirit
Come and fight your ancestor Pig The herald with the blue flag rushed back to report Your Majesty there's a monk with a long snout and big ears here The second demon chief came out of the encampment saw Pig and without a word thrust his spear straight at Pig's face
The idiot raised his rake and went forward to parry the blow
The two of them joined battle in front of the mountainside and before they had fought seven or eight rounds the idiot began to weaken He was no longer able to hold the evil spirit off
Brother he shouted turning back in a hurry pull in the lifeline pull in the lifeline When the Great Sage heard this from where he stood he loosened his hold on the rope and dropped it
The idiot started to run back now that he was defeated
At first he had not noticed the rope trailing behind him but after he turned back relaxing the tension on it it started to get tangled round his legs
He tripped himself over climbed to his feet and tripped over again
At first he only staggered but then he fell facedown into the dust
The evil spirit caught up with him unwound his trunk that was like a python wrapped it round Pig and carried him back in triumph to the cave
The devilish host chorused a paean of victory as they swarmed back When Sanzang saw all this from the foot of the slope he became angry with Monkey
Wukong he said no wonder Wuneng wishes you were dead You brotherdisciples don't love each other at all All you feel is jealousy
He told you to pull in his lifeline so why didn't you Why did you drop the rope instead
What are we to do now you have got him killed You're covering up for him again Master said Monkey and showing favoritism too I'm fed up
When I was captured it didn't bother you at all
I was dispensable But when that idiot gets himself caught you blame me for it
Let him suffer It'll teach him how hard it is to fetch the scriptures Journey to the West Disciple said Sanzang was I not worried when you went
I remembered that you could change into other things so I was sure you would come to no harm
But the idiot was born clumsy and can't transform himself which makes this a very dangerous business
You must go and rescue him Stop complaining Master said Brother Monkey
I'll go and save him Monkey rushed up the mountain thinking resentfully I'm not going to make life easy for that idiot if he wishes me dead
I'll go and see what the evil spirits are doing with him
Before I rescue him I'll let him suffer a bit He then made magic with his hands said the words of a spell shook himself turned into the tiniest of insects and flew into the cave where he landed at the bottom of one of Pig's ears to be taken inside with the evil spirit
The second demon chief had led his three thousand junior devils trumpeting and drumming loudly to the cave where they stopped
He now took Pig inside and said I've got one elder brother Show me the senior demon replied
Unwinding his trunk the second demon chief flung Pig to the ground and said There he is That one's useless said the senior demon
Your Majesty put in Pig when he heard this if I'm no use let me go and find a more useful one to capture He may not be any use said the third demon chief but he is the Tang Priest's disciple Zhu Bajie
Tie him up and put him to soak in the pool at the back
When his bristles have been soaked off we can open his belly up salt him and dry him in the sun
He'll go down well with some wine on a rainy day That's that then exclaimed Pig in horror
I've fallen into the clutches of a demon who's a saltpork peddler The demon hordes fell on him tied his hands and feet together carried him to the pool at the back pushed him in and went back
When the Great Sage flew there to have a look he saw the idiot with his four limbs pointing upwards and his snout downwards as he half floated and was half sinking grunting through his snout He really was a ridiculous sight like a big blackened frostbitten lotus pod that has shed its seeds in September or October
Seeing his face the Great Sage felt both loathing and pity for him What shall I do he wondered
After all he is another member of the Dragon Flower Assembly
I just wish he wouldn't keep trying to divide up the luggage split our band and incite the master to say the Bandtightening Spell
The other day I heard Friar Sand say that he'd stashed some money away for himself I wonder if it's true
I'll give him a scare and find out The splendid Great Sage flew down to his ear and called in a disguised voice Zhu Wuneng Zhu Wuneng This is terrible thought Pig in alarm Wuneng is the name the Bodhisattva Guanyin gave me I've been called Zhu Bajie all the time I've been with the Tang Priest
How can there be anyone here who knows my name is Wuneng So he could not restrain himself from asking Who's that calling my Buddhist name Me said Monkey
Who are you the idiot asked
Journey to the West I'm a catcher Monkey replied
Where from sir asked Pig in terror
From the Fifth King of the Underworld and he's sent me to fetch you said Monkey
Then please go back and ask the Fifth King as he's such a good friend of my senior fellowdisciple Sun Wukong to give me a day's grace You can come for me tomorrow You're talking nonsense Monkey replied
If King Yama of Hell decides you're to die in the third watch nobody will keep you till the fourth
Come with me at once if you don't want me to put a rope round your neck and drag you off Do me a favour said the idiot
Even with a face like mine still want to go on living
I'll certainly die if I have to but give me a day till these evil spirits have captured my master and the rest of us so I can see them again before we're all done for Very well then said Monkey grinning to himself
I've got about thirty people to capture around here in this batch When I've caught them I'll come back for you That'll give you a day's grace
Give me some money I'm sure you've got some Oh dear said Pig we monks don't have money If you haven't then I'm dragging you off said Brother Monkey
Come with me Don't be so impatient sir said the idiot panicking
I know that rope of yours is what they call the lifetaking rope Once It's round you you're dead Yes I have got some money
I've got a bit but not much Where is it Monkey demanded Give it me at once Oh dear what a pity said Pig
From when I became a monk right up till now the kind people who feed monks have given me a bit more alms than the others because my belly's so big I saved all the little bits of silver till I had about half an ounce
They were awkward to keep so when we were in a city some time ago I asked a silversmith to melt them all together The wicked man stole a few grains of it so the ingot he made only weighed fortysix hundredths of an ounce
Take it The idiot hasn't even got his trousers on grinned Monkey to himself so where can he have hidden it
Hey where's your silver It's stuffed inside my left ear Pig replied
I can't get it myself because I'm tied up so take it out yourself When Monkey heard this he put his hand out and took the silver from inside Pig's ear It was indeed an ingot shaped like a saddle that weighed only fortyfive or fortysix hundredths of an ounce
As he held it in his hands Monkey could not help roaring with laughter
Recognizing Monkey's voice the idiot started cursing him wildly from the water Damn and blast you Protector of the Horses for coming to extort money from me when I'm in such misery I've got you now you dregguzzler said Monkey
Goodness only knows what I've had to suffer for the sake of protecting the master while you've been making your fortune Journey to the West Nonsense Pig retorted
Call this a fortune
It's just what I've scraped off my teeth I resisted spending it on my stomach so I saved it to buy myself some cloth to get a tunic made You've got it out of me by intimidation
You ought to share it with me You won't get a cent of it Monkey replied
I've paid you to spare my life said Pig so now you damn well ought to rescue me Don't be so impatient said Monkey
I'll rescue you all in good time Putting the silver away he turned back into himself and used his cudgel to bring Pig close enough to grab him by his feet drag him ashore and untie him
Pig then sprang up took off his clothes wrung them out shook them and draped them still dripping wet over his shoulders Brother he said open the back gates Let's go There's no glory in sneaking out the back way replied Monkey
We'll leave by the front gates My feet are still numb after being tied up said Pig
I can't run Buck up and come with me said Monkey
The splendid Great Sage charged out clearing his way by swinging his cudgel
The idiot had no choice but to endure the pain and keep close to him
When he saw the rake propped up by the second pair of gates he went over to it pushed the junior devils aside retrieved it and rushed forward lashing out wildly He and Brother Monkey charged through three or four pairs of gates and goodness only knows how many junior devils they killed
When the senior demon chief heard all this he said to the second chief You captured a fine one A fine one indeed
Sun the Novice has rescued Pig and they've wounded or killed the juniors on the gates The second demon at once sprang to his feet and rushed out through the gates brandishing his spear Damned macaque he shouted at the top of his voice What a nerve
How dare you treat us with such contempt As soon as the Great Sage heard this he stopped still
The monster thrust his spear straight at him without allowing any argument
With the unhurried skill of the expert Monkey raised his iron cudgel to hit back at the demon's face
The two of them fought a splendid battle outside the entrance to the cave The yellowtusked elephant in human form Had sworn brotherhood with the Lion King
Persuaded by the senior monster They plotted together to eat the Tang Priest
Huge were the powers of the Great Sage Heaven's equal Who helped the good against the bad and killed off demons The incompetent Pig had met with disaster Journey to the West So Monkey saved him and led him outside
When the demon king pursued them with great ferocity The spear and the cudgel each showed off its powers
The spear moved like a snake in the woods The cudgel arose like a dragon from the sea
Where the dragon emerged the clouds were thick Dense hung the mist where the snake went through the woods
It was all for the sake of the Tang Priest That they fought each other with ferocity and hatred
When he saw the Great Sage start fighting the evil spirit Pig stood on the spur his rake upright Instead of joining in to help he watched with stupefied amazement
Monkey's cudgel was so powerful and his martial skills so faultless the evil spirit used his spear to parry Monkey's blows while unrolling his trunk to wrap round him
As Monkey knew about this trick he held his goldbanded cudgel out horizontally in both hands and raised them
The evil spirit's trunk caught Monkey round the waist but missed his hands
Just watch how Monkey belabors the evil spirit's trunk with his cudgel
When Pig saw this he beat his chest and said Oh dear
That monster's got lousy luck
When he caught me he got my arms too because I'm so clumsy but he didn't when he caught that slippery character
He's got his cudgel in both hands and all he needs to do is shove it up the monster's trunk to give him such a pain in the nostrils that it'll make the snot run
The monster'll never be able to hold him Monkey had not thought of this before Pig gave him the idea but now he waved his cudgel to make it as thick as a hen's egg and over ten feet long and actually did shove it hard up the monster's trunk
This gave the evil spirit such a shock that he unraveled his trunk with a swishing noise
Monkey brought his hand round to grab the trunk and drag it forcefully towards him
To spare himself any more agony the monster stepped out and moved with Monkey's hand
Only then did Pig dare approach raising his rake to hit wildly at the monster's flanks
No said Brother Monkey that's no good
The prongs of your rake are so sharp they might break his skin If he starts bleeding heavily and the master sees it he'll say we've been killing again
You'd better turn it round and hit him with the handle The idiot then raised the handle of his rake and struck the monster at every step while Monkey dragged him by the trunk
They looked like a pair of elephant boys as they led him down to the foot of the mountain where Sanzang could be seen gazing with concentration at the two of them coming noisily towards him
Wujing he said to Friar Sand what is it Wukong is leading Master replied Friar Sand when he saw them big brother is dragging an evil spirit here by the nose He really enjoys slaughter Journey to the West Splendid splendid said Sanzang
What a big evil spirit and what a long nose
Go and ask him if he's happy and willing to escort us over themountain
If he is he must be spared and not be killed Friar Sand at once rushed straight towards them shouting The master says you mustn't kill the monster if he's really willing to escort him across the mountain As soon as he heard this the demon fell to his knees and promised to do so in a very nasal voice
His voice was like this because Monkey was pinching his nostrils shut making it sound as though he had a heavy cold
Lord Tang he said I'll carry you across by chair if you spare my life My master and we disciples are good people Monkey replied As you've said this we'll spare your life
Fetch the chair at once If you break your word again we most certainly won't spare your life when we catch you next time The freed monster kowtowed and left
Monkey and Pig went to report to the Tang Priest on everything that had happened to them
Pig was overcome with shame as he spread his clothes out to dry in the sun while they waited
The second demon chief returned trembling and shaking to the cave
Even before his return some junior devils had reported to the senior and the third demon chiefs that Monkey had dragged him off by the trunk
In his anxiety the senior demon had led his hosts out with the third demon when they saw the second chief coming back alone
As they brought him inside and asked him why he had been released the second chief told them all about Sanzang's words of mercy and goodness
They looked at each other at a loss for words
Elder brother said the second demon chief shall we take Sanzang across What a thing to say brother replied the senior chief
Sun the Novice is a monkey who shows the greatest benevolence and sense of justice If he had wanted to kill me when he was in my stomach he could most certainly have done so He only grabbed your trunk He might have dragged you off and not let you go
All he did was to pinch your trunk and break its skin and that's given you a scare
Get ready at once to take them across The third demon chief smiled and said Yes yes yes From the way you're talking my good brother said the senior demon it sounds as though you're reluctant to let the Tang Priest go
If you don't we'll take him across The third demon chief smiled again and said Elder brothers it would have been luckier for those monks if they hadn't asked us to escort them but had slipped quietly across instead
By asking us to escort them they've fallen in with our plan to lure the tiger down from the mountain What do you mean by 'luring the tiger from the mountain' the senior demon asked
Summon all the demons in our cave the third demon chief continued Choose one thousand from the ten thousand of them then a hundred from the thousand then sixteen and thirty from the hundred Why do you want sixteen and thirty the senior demon asked
The thirty must be good cooks the third demon chief replied Give them the best rice and flour bamboo shoots tea gill fungus button mushrooms beancurd and wheat gluten
Send them to put up a shelter seven to ten miles along the way and lay on a meal for the Tang Priest Journey to the West And what do you want the sixteen for the senior demon asked
Eight to carry the chair and eight to shout and clear the way the third demon replied
We brothers will accompany them for a stage of their journey
About  miles West of here is my city and I've plenty of troops there to greet them
When they get to the city we'll do such and such and so on The Tang Priest and his disciples won't be able to see what's happening to them
Whether we catch the Tang Priest or not depends completely on those sixteen demons The senior demon was beside himself with delight on hearing this
It was as if he had recovered from a drunken stupor or woken up from a dream
Excellent excellent he said whereupon he mustered the demons chose thirty to whom he gave the food and another sixteen to carry a rattan chair
As they set out the senior demon gave the following instructions to the rest of the demons None of you are to go out on the mountain
Sun the Novice is a very cautious ape and if he sees any of you around he'll be suspicious and see through our plan The senior demon then led his underlings to a place beside the main road where he called aloud Lord Tang today's not an unlucky one so please come across the mountain straight away Who is that calling me Wukong Sanzang asked when he heard this
It's the demons I beat Monkey replied
They're bringing a chair to carry you Putting his hands together in front of his chest Sanzang looked up to the sky and said Splendid splendid
But for my worthy disciple's great abilities I could not proceed on my journey He then walked forward to greet the demons with the words I am most grateful for the consideration you gentlemen are showing
When my disciples and I return to Chang'an we will praise your admirable achievements Please get into the carryingchair my lord the demons said kowtowing
Having mortal eyes and body Sanzang did not realize that this was a trick
The Great Sage Sun a golden immortal of the Supreme Monad with a loyal nature thought that because he had captured and released the demons they were now won over
He never imagined that they had other plots in mind so he did not investigate closely but went along with his master's ideas
He told Pig to tie the luggage on the horse and keep close to the master with Friar Sand while he cleared the way with his iron cudgel watching out to see if all was well
While eight devils carried the chair and eight shouted in turn to clear the way the three demon chiefs steadied the poles of the chair
The master was delighted to sit upright in it and go up the high mountain by the main track little realizing that Great grief would return in the midst of rejoicing Extremes says the classic create their negation Fated they were to meet with disaster A star of illomen to mark desolation
The band of demons worked with one mind to escort them and serve them diligently at all times
After ten miles there was a vegetarian meal and after fifteen more miles another one They were invited to rest before it grew late and everything along their way was neat and tidy
Each day they had three most satisfactory and Journey to the West delightful meals and spent a comfortable night where they were able to sleep well
When they had traveled about  miles West they found themselves near a walled city
Raising his iron cudgel the Great Sage who was only a third of a mile ahead of the carryingchair was so alarmed by the sight of the city that he fell over and was unable to rise to his feet
Do you know why someone of his great courage was so frightened by what he saw
It was because he saw a very evil atmosphere hanging over the town
Crowds of evil demons and monsters Wolf spirits at all four gates
Striped tigers are the commanders Whitefaced tigercats are senior officers
Antlered stags carry documents around Cunning foxes walk along the streets
Thousandfoot pythons slither round the walls Twentymile serpents occupy the roads
At the base of high towers gray wolves shout commands Leopards speak in human voices by pavilions
Standardbearers and drummersall are monsters Mountain spirits patrol and stand sentry Crafty hares open shops to trade Wild boars carry their loads to do business
What used to be the capital of a heavenly dynasty Has now become a city of wolves and tigers
Just as he was being overcome by terror the Great Sage heard a wind from behind him and turned quickly to see the third demon chief raising a heavensquare halberd with a patterned handle to strike at his head
Springing to his feet the Great Sage struck back at the monster's face with his goldbanded cudgel
Both of them were snorting with rage and fury as they ground their teeth and fought a wordless struggle
Monkey then saw the senior demon chief giving out orders as he lifted his steel saber to hack at Pig
Pig was in such a rush that he had to let the horse go as he swung his rake around to hit wildly back
Meanwhile the second demon chief was thrusting with his spear at Friar Sand who parried with his demonquelling staff
Journey to the West The three demon chiefs and the three monks were now all fighting in single combat ready to throw away their lives
The sixteen junior devils obeyed their orders each giving play to his talents as they grabbed hold of the white horse and the luggage and crowded round Sanzang lifting up his chair and carrying him straight to the city Your Senior Majesty please decide what to do now we've captured the Tang Priest they shouted
All the demons of every rank on the city walls came rushing down to throw the city gates wide open
Every battalion was ordered to furl its flag silence its drums and on no account shout warcries or strike gongs
His Senior Majesty has given orders that the Tang Priest is not to be frightened He can't endure being scared
If he is his flesh will turn sour and be inedible The demons were all delighted to welcome Sanzang bowing and carrying him into the throne hall of the palace where he was invited to sit in the place of honour
They offered him tea and food as they bustled around him in attendance
The venerable elder felt dizzy and confused as he looked about and saw no familiar faces
If you don't know whether he was to escape with his life listen to the explanation in the next installment
The Demon Host Mistreats the Fundamental Nature The One Body Pays His Respects to the Buddha We will tell now not of the sufferings of the venerable Tang Elder but of the three demon chiefs in strenuous combat with the Great Sage and his two brother disciples in the low hills to the East outside the city
It was indeed a good hard battle like an iron brush against a copper pan
Six types of body six types of weapon Six physical forms six feelings
The six evils arise from the six sense organs and the six desires The six gates to nirvana and the six ways of rebirth are struggling for victory
In the thirtysix divine palaces spring comes of itself The six times six forms do not want to be named
This one holding a goldbanded cudgel Performs a thousand movements That one wielding a heavensquare halberd Is exceptional in every way
Pig is even more ferocious with his rake Journey to the West The second demon's spearplay is superb and effective
There is nothing commonplace about young Friar Sand's staff As he tries to inflict a blow that is fatal Sharp is the senior demon's saber Which he raises without mercy
These three are the true priest's invincible escorts The other three are evil and rebellious spirits
At first the fight is not so bad But later it becomes more murderous
All six weapons rise up by magic To twist and turn in the clouds above
They belch out in an instant clouds that darken the sky And the only sounds to be heard are roars and bellows
After the six of them had been fighting for a long time evening was drawing in and as the wind was also bringing clouds it became dark very quickly
Pig was finding it harder and harder to see as his big ears were covering his eyelids
His hands and feet were besides too slow for him to be able to hold off his opponent so he fled from the fight dragging his rake behind him
The senior demon chief took a swing at him with his sword that almost killed him
Luckily Pig moved his head out of the way so that the blade only cut off a few of his bristles The monster then caught up with Pig opened his jaws picked Pig up by the collar carried him into the city and threw him to the junior demons to tie up and take to the throne hall
The senior demon chief then rose back into the air by cloud to help the other two
Seeing that things were going badly Friar Sand feinted with his staff and turned to flee only to be caught hands and all when the second demon unraveled his trunk and noisily wrapped it round him
The demon took him too into the city ordering the junior demons to tie him up in the palace before rising up into the sky again to tell the others how to catch Monkey
Seeing that both his brother disciples had been captured Monkey realized that it was going to be impossible for him to hold out singlehanded Indeed A couple of fists can defeat a good hand But cannot a competent foursome withstand
Journey to the West With a shout Brother Monkey pushed the three demons' weapons aside set off his somersault cloud and fled
When the third demon chief saw Monkey ride off by somersault he shook himself resumed his real form spread his wings and caught up with the Great Sage
You may well ask how the demon could possibly catch up with him When Monkey made havoc in heaven all that time ago a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers had failed to capture him Because he could cover  miles in a single somersault of his cloud none of the gods had been able to catch up with him
But this evil spirit could cover  miles with one beat of his wings so that with two beats he caught up with Monkey and seized him Monkey could not get out of the demon's talons no matter how hard he struggled or how desperately he longed to escape
Even when he used his transformation magic he still could not move
If he made himself grow the demon opened his grip but still held firmly to him and if he shrank the demon tightened his clutch
The demon took him back inside the city released his talons dropped him into the dust and told the fiendish hordes to tie him up and put him with Pig and Friar Sand
The senior and the second demon chiefs both came out to greet the third chief who went back up into the throne hall with them
This time they were not tying Monkey up but sending him on his way
It was now the second watch of the night and after all the demons had exchanged greetings the Tang Priest was pushed out of the throne hall
When he suddenly caught sight in the lamplight of his three disciples all lying tied up on the ground the venerable master leaned down beside Brother Monkey and said through his tears Disciple when we meet with trouble you normally go off and use your magic powers to subdue the monsters causing it
Now that you too have been captured can I survive poor monk that I am As soon as Pig and Friar Sand heard their master's distress they too began to howl together
Don't worry Master said Monkey with a hint of a smile and don't cry brothers No matter what they do they won't be able to hurt us
When the demon chiefs have settled and are asleep we can be on our way You're just making trouble again brother replied Pig
We're trussed up with hempen ropes If we do manage to work them a bit loose they spurt water on them to shrink them again You might be too skinny to notice but fat old me's having a terrible time
If you don't believe me take a look at my arms The rope's cut two inches deep into them
I'd never get away Never mind hempen ropes said Monkey with a laugh even if they were coconut cables as thick as a ricebowl they'd be no more than an autumn breeze to me
What's there to make a fuss about As master and disciples were talking the senior demon could be heard saying Third brother you really are strong and wise
Your plan to capture the Tang Priest was brilliant and it worked Little ones he called Five of you carry water seven scrub the pans ten get the fire burning and twenty fetch the iron steamer When we've steamed the four monks tender for my brothers and me to enjoy we'll give you juniors a piece so that you can all live for ever Brother said Pig trembling when he this listen
That evil spirit's planning to steam and eat us Don't be afraid said Monkey
I'm going to find out whether he's an evil spirit still wet behind the ears or an old hand Brother said Friar Sand sobbing don't talk so big
We're next door to the king of Hell
How can you talk about whether he's wet behind the ears or an old hand at a time like this The words were not all out of his mouth before the second demon chief was heard to say Pig won't steam well Amitabha Buddha said Pig with delight
I wonder who's building up good karma by saying I won't steam well Journey to the West If he won't steam well the third chief said skin him before steaming him This panicked Pig who screamed at the top of his voice Don't skin me
I may be coarse but I'll go tender if you boil me If he won't steam well the senior demon chief said put him on the bottom tray of the steamer Don't worry Pig said Monkey with a laugh he's wet behind the ears
He's no old hand How can you tell Friar Sand asked
Generally speaking you should start from the top when steaming Monkey replied
Whatever's hardest to steam should be put on the top tray Add a bit of extra fuel to the fire get up a good steam and it'll be done
But put it at the bottom and lower the steam and you won't get the steam up even if you cook it for six months
He must be wet behind the ears if he says that Pig should be put on the bottom tray because he's hard to cook Brother Pig replied if he followed your advice I'd be slaughtered alive
When he can't see the steam rising he'll take the lid off turn me over and make the fire burn hotter
I'll be cooked on both sides and half done in the middle As they were talking a junior devil came in to report that the water was boiling
The senior chief ordered that the monks be carried in and all the demons acted together to carry Pig to the lowest shelf of the steamer and Friar Sand to the second shelf
Guessing that they would be coming for him next Brother Monkey freed himself and said This lamplight is just right for some action He then pulled out a hair blew on it with magic breath called Change and turned it into another Monkey he tied up with the hempen rope while extracting his real self in spirit form to spring into midair look down and watch
Not realizing his deception the crowd of demons picked up the false Monkey they saw and carried him to the third tray of the steamer near the top
Only then did they drag the Tang Priest to the ground tie him up and put him into the fourth tray
As the dry firewood was stacked up a fierce fire blazed
My Pig and Friar Sand can stand a couple of boilings sighed the Great Sage up in the clouds but that master of mine will be cooked tender as soon as the water boils
If I can't save him by magic he'll be dead in next to no time The splendid Great Sage made a handspell in midair said the magic words Om the blue pure dharma world true is the eternal beneficence of Heaven and summoned the Dragon King of the Northern Ocean to him
A black cloud appeared among the other clouds and from it there came at once an answering shout Ao Shun the humble dragon of the Northern Ocean kowtows in homage Arise arise said Monkey
I would not have ventured to trouble you for nothing
I've now got this far with my master the Tang Priest He's been captured by vicious monsters and put into an iron steamer to be cooked
Go and protect him for me and don't let the steam harm him The dragon king at once turned himself into a cold wind that blew underneath the cooking pot and coiled around to shield it from all the heat of the fire Thus were the three of them saved from death
As the third watch was drawing to an end the senior demon chief announced a decision My men he said we have worn out brains and brawn to capture the Tang Priest and his three disciples
Because of the trouble we went to in escorting them we have not slept for four days and nights
I don't think that they'll be able to escape now that they're tied up and being steamed You are all to guard them carefully Ten of your junior Journey to the West devils are to take it in turns to keep the fires burning while we withdraw to our living quarters for a little rest By the fifth watch when it's about to get light they're bound to be cooked tender
Have some garlic paste salt and vinegar ready and wake us up then we'll be able to eat them with a good appetite The devils did as they had been ordered while the three demon chiefs returned to their sleeping chambers
Up in the clouds Brother Monkey clearly heard these instructions being given so he brought his cloud down
As there was no sound of voices from inside the steamer he thought The fire is blazing away and they must be feeling hot Why aren't they afraid Why aren't they saying anything
Could they have been steamed to death
Let me go closer and listen The splendid Great Sage shook himself as he stood on his cloud and turned into a black fly As he alighted on the outside of the iron steamer's trays to listen he heard Pig saying inside What lousy luck What lousy luck
I wonder whether we're being closedsteamed or opensteamed What do you mean by 'closed' and 'open' brother Friar Sand asked
Closed steaming is when they cover the steamer and open steaming is when they don't Pig replied
Disciples said Sanzang from the top tray the cover is off We're in luck said Pig
We won't be killed tonight
We're being opensteamed Having heard all three of them talking Monkey realized that they were still alive so he flew away fetched the iron steamer lid and placed it lightly on the steamer
Disciples exclaimed Sanzang in alarm they've covered us up That's done it said Pig That means closed steaming
We're bound to die tonight Friar Sand and the venerable elder started to sob
Don't cry said Pig A new shift of cooks has come on duty How can you tell Friar Sand asked
I was delighted at first when they carried me here Pig replied I've got a bit of a feverish chill and I wanted warming up
But all we're getting at the moment is cold air
Cook sir What are you making such a fuss about putting more firewood on for
Am I asking for what's yours When Monkey heard this he could not help laughing to himself Stupid clod he thought Being cold is bearable If it got hot you'd be dead
The secret will get out if he goes on talking
I'd better rescue him
I'd have to turn back into myself to rescue them and if I did that the ten cooks would see me and start shouting That would disturb the old monsters and I'd be put to a lot more trouble
I'll have to use some magic on the cooks first Then a memory came back to him When I was the Great Sage in the old days I once played a guessing game with the Heavenly King Lokapala at the Northern Gate of Heaven and won some of his sleep insects off him
I've got a few left I can use on them He felt around his waist inside his belt and found that he had twelve of them left
I'll give them ten and keep two to breed from Monkey thought
Then he threw the insects into the ten junior devils' faces where the insects went up their nostrils so that they all started feeling drowsy lay down and went to sleep
One of them however who was holding a firefork slept very fitfully kept rubbing his head and face pinching his nose and continuously sneezing
That soandso knows a trick or two thought Journey to the West Monkey
I'll have to give him a double dose He threw one of his remaining insects into the demon's face
With two insects the left one can go in when the right one comes out and vice versa Monkey thought
That should keep him quiet With that the junior demon gave two or three big yawns stretched himself dropped the fork and slumped down fast asleep He did not get up again What marvellous magic it really works said Monkey turning back into himself
Then he went close to the steamer and called Master Rescue me Wukong said the Tang Priest when he heard him
Is that you calling to us from outside Friar Sand asked
If I weren't out here would you prefer me to be suffering in there with you Monkey replied
Brother said Pig you slipped off and left us to carry the can
We're being closedsteamed in here Stop yelling idiot said Monkey with a laugh
I'm here to rescue you Brother said Pig if you're going to rescue us do it properly
Don't get us put back in here for another steaming Monkey then took the lid off freed the master shook the hair of his that he had turned into an imitation Monkey and put it back on his body then released Friar Sand and Pig taking one tray at a time
As soon as he was untied the idiot wanted to run away
Don't be in such a hurry said Monkey who recited the words of a spell that released the dragon before going on to say to Pig We've still got high mountains and steep ridges ahead of us on our way to the Western Heaven The going's too heavy for the masterhe isn't a strong walker
Wait till I've fetched the horse Watch him as with light step he goes to the throne hall where he saw that all the demons young and old were asleep
He undid the rope attached to the horse's reins being even more careful not to alarm him
Now the horse was a dragon horse so had Monkey been a stranger he would have given him a couple of flying kicks and whinnied
But Monkey had kept horses and held the office of Protector of the Horses and this horse was besides their own That was why the animal neither reared nor whinnied
Monkey led the horse very quietly over tightened the girth and got everything ready before inviting his master to mount
Trembling and shaking the Tang Priest did so He too wanted to go
Don't you be in such a hurry either Monkey said
There'll be plenty more kings along our journey West and we'll need our passport if we're to get there
What other identity papers do we have
I'm going back to find the luggage I remember that when we came in the monsters put the luggage to the left of the throne hall said the Tang Priest
The loads must still be there Understood said Monkey who sprang off at once to search for it by the throne hall When he suddenly saw shimmering lights of many colours Brother Monkey knew that they came from the luggage
How did he know
Because the light came from the nightshining pearl on the Tang Priest's cassock
He rushed towards it and found that their load was unopened so he took it out and gave it to Friar Sand to carry
While Pig guided the horse the Great Sage took the lead They were hurrying to go straight out through the main Southern gate when they heard the noise of watchmen's clappers and bells
They found the gates locked and paper seals over the locks
Journey to the West How are we going to get out if the place is so closely guarded Monkey wondered
Let's get out the back door said Pig With Monkey leading the way they rushed straight to the back gates
I can hear clappers and bells outside the back gates as well and they're sealed too Monkey said
What are we to do If it weren't for the Tang Priest's mortal body it wouldn't bother us three we could get away by cloud and wind
But the Tang Priest hasn't escaped from the Three Worlds and is still confined within the Five Elements All his bones are the unclean ones he got from his mother and father He can't lift himself into the air and he'll never get away No time for talking now brother said Pig
Let's go somewhere where there aren't any bells clappers or guards lift the master up and climb over the wall That won't do said Monkey
We could lift him over now because we've got to but you've got such a big mouth you'd tell people everywhere when we're taking the scriptures back that we're the sort of monks who sneak over people's walls But we can't bother about behaving properly now replied Pig
We've got to save our skins Monkey had no choice but to do as he suggested so they went up to wall and worked out how to climb over
Oh dear
Things would have to work out this way Sanzang was not yet free of his unlucky star
The three demon chiefs who had been fast asleep in their living quarters suddenly awoke and fearing that the Tang Priest had escaped got up threw on their clothes and hurried to the throne hall of the palace
How many times has the Tang Priest been steamed they asked
The junior devils who were looking after the fires were all so soundly asleep because the sleep insects were in them that not even blows could wake them up
The chiefs woke up some others who were not on duty who answered rashly Ssssseven times Then they rushed over to the steamer to see the steamer trays lying scattered on the floor and the cooks still asleep
In their alarm they rushed back to report Your Majesties thththey've escaped The three demon chiefs came out of the throne hall to take a close look around the cauldron They saw that the steamer trays were indeed scattered on the floor the water was stonecold and the fire completely out
The cooks supposed to be tending the fire were still so fast asleep that they were snoring noisily
The fiends were all so shocked that they all shouted Catch the Tang Priest At once
Catch the Tang Priest Their yells woke up the demons senior and junior all around They rushed in a crowd to the main front gates carrying their swords and spears
Seeing that the sealed locks had not been touched and that the night watchmen were still sounding their clappers and bells they asked the watchman Which way did the Tang Priest go Nobody's come out the watchmen all replied
They hurried to the back gates of the palace only to find that the seals locks clappers and bells were the same as at the front
With a great commotion they grabbed lanterns and torches making the sky red and the place as bright as day The four of them were clearly lit up as they climbed over the wall
Where do you think you're going the senior demon chief shouted running towards them and so terrifying the reverend gentleman that the muscles in his legs turned soft and numb and he fell off the wall to be Journey to the West captured by the senior demon
The second demon chief seized Friar Sand and the third knocked Pig over and captured him The other demons took the luggage and the white horse Only Monkey escaped
May Heaven kill him Pig grumbled under his breath about Monkey I said that if he was going to rescue us he ought to do a thorough job of it
As it is we're going to be put back in the steamer for another steaming The monsters took the Tang Priest into the throne hall but did not steam him again
The second demon chief ordered that Pig was to be tied to one of the columns supporting the eaves in front of the hall and the third chief had Friar Sand tied to one of the columns holding up the eaves at the back
The senior chief clung to the Tang Priest and would not let go of him
What are you holding him for elder brother the third demon asked
Surely you're not going to eat him alive
That wouldn't be at all interesting
He's no ordinary idiot to be gobbled up just to fill your stomach He's a rare delicacy from a superior country
We should keep him till we have some free time one rainy day then bring him out to be carefully cooked and enjoyed with drinking games and fine music A very good suggestion brother replied the senior demon with a smile but Sun the Novice would come and steal him again In our palace we have a Brocade Fragrance Pavilion said the third demon and in the pavilion is an iron chest
I think we should put the Tang Priest into the chest shut up the pavilion put out a rumour that we have already eaten him half raw and get all the junior devils in the city talking about it
That Sun the Novice is bound to come back to find out what's happening and when he hears this he'll be so miserably disappointed that he'll go away
If he doesn't come to make trouble for another four or five days we can bring the Tang Priest out to enjoy at our leisure
What do you think The senior and second demon chiefs were both delighted Yes yes you're right brother they said
That very night the poor Tang Priest was taken inside the palace put into the chest and locked up in the pavilion
We will not tell how the rumour was spread and became the talk of the town
Instead the story tells how Monkey escaped that night by cloud unable to look after the Tang Priest
He went straight to Lion Cave where he wiped out all the tens of thousands of junior demons with his cudgel to his complete satisfaction
By the time he had hurried back to the city the sun was rising in the East
He did not dare challenge the demons to battle because No thread can be spun from a single strand Nobody can clap with a single hand
So he brought his cloud down shook himself turned himself into a junior demon and slipped in through the gates to collect news in the streets and back alleys
The Tang Priest was eaten raw by the senior king during the night was what all the people in the city were saying wherever he went
This made Brother Monkey really anxious
When he went to look at the throne hall in the palace he saw that there were many spirits constantly coming and going They were wearing leather and metal helmets and yellow cotton tunics In their hands they held red lacquered staves and ivory passes hung at their waists
Journey to the West These must be evil spirits who are allowed in the inner quarters of the palace thought Monkey
I'll turn myself into one go in and see what I can find out The splendid Great Sage then made himself identical to the demons and slipped in through the inner gates of the palace
As he was walking along he saw Pig tied to one of the columns of the throne hall groaning
Wuneng Monkey said going up to him
Is that you brother asked the idiot recognizing his voice
Save me I'll save you said Monkey
Do you know where the master is He's done for Pig replied
The evil spirits ate him raw last night At this Monkey burst into sobs and the tears gushed out like water from a spring
Don't cry brother said Pig I've only heard the junior devils gossiping I didn't see it with my own eyes
Don't waste any more time
Go on and find out more Only then did Monkey dry his tears and go to search in the inner part of the palace
Noticing Friar Sand tied to a column at the back of the palace he went up to him felt his chest and said Wujing Friar Sand also recognized his voice and said Brother is that you here in disguise
Save me
Save me Saving you will be easy said Monkey but do you know where the master is Brother said Friar Sand in tears The evil spirits couldn't even wait to steam the master
They've eaten him raw Now that both of them had told him the same story the Great Sage was cut to the heart
Instead of rescuing Pig and Friar Sand he sprang straight up into the sky and went to the mountain East of the city where he landed his cloud and let himself weep aloud Poor Master he said I fought against heaven was caught in its net Till you came along and delivered me Master
It became my ambition to worship the Buddha I strove to eliminate fiendish disaster
I never imagined that now you'd be murdered And I would have failed on your journey to keep you
Journey to the West The lands of the West were too good for your fate Your life's at an end
in what way can I help you Deep in misery Monkey said to himself It's all the fault of our Buddha the Tathagata who had nothing better to do in his paradise than make the three stores of scriptures
If he really wanted to convert people to be good he ought to have sent them to the East himself Then they would have been passed on for ever But he couldn't bring himself to part with them
He had to make us go to fetch them
Who'd ever have thought that after all the trouble of crossing a thousand mountains the master would lose his life here today Oh well
I'll ride my somersault cloud to see the Tathagata Buddha and tell him what's happened
If he's willing to give me the scriptures to deliver to the East then the good achievement will be propagated and we'll be able to fulfil our vow
If he won't give me them I'll get him to recite the Bandloosening Spell Then I can take the band off return it to him and go back to my own cave to play the king and enjoy myself again The splendid Great Sage jumped to his feet and went straight to India on his somersault cloud
In less than a couple of hours he could see the Vulture Peak in the near distance and an instant later he had landed his cloud and was heading straight for the foot of the peak
He looked up and saw the four vajrapanis blocking his way and asking him where he was going
There's something I want to see the Tathagata about Monkey replied with a bow
Next he was faced by the Vajrapani Yongzhu the indestructible king of Golden Glow Ridge on Mount Kunlun who shouted Macaque you're an outrage
When the Bull Demon King was giving you such terrible trouble we all helped you but now you've come to see us today you're showing no manners at all
If you're here on business you should submit a memorial first and wait till you're summoned before going any further
This isn't like the Southern Gate of Heaven where you can come and go as you please
Clear off
Out of the way Being told off like this when he was feeling so depressed drove Monkey into thundering roars of fury and his uncontrollable shouts and yells soon disturbed the Tathagata
The Tathagata Buddha was sitting on his ninelevel lotus throne expounding the sutras to his eighteen arhats when he said Sun Wukong is here
You must all go out to receive him In obedience to the Buddha's command the arhats went out in two columns with their banners and canopies
Great Sage Sun they said in greeting the Tathagata has commanded us to summon you to his presence Only then did the four vajrapanis at the monastery gates step aside to let Monkey enter
The arhats led him to the foot of the lotus throne where he went down to kowtow on seeing the Tathagata He was sobbing and weeping
Wukong said the Buddha what makes you weep so miserably Your disciple has often received the grace of your instruction Brother Monkey replied and has committed himself to the school of Lord Buddha
Since being converted to the true achievement I have taken the Tang Priest as my master and been protecting him on our journey No words could describe what we have suffered
We have now reached the city of Leonia near Lion Cave on Lion Mountain where three vicious monsters the Lion King the Elephant King and the Great Roc seized my master All of us disciples of his were in a very bad way too tied up and put in a steamer to suffer the agony of fire and boiling water
Fortunately I was able to get away and summon a dragon king to save the others
But we could not escape our evil star the master Journey to the West and the others were recaptured when I was trying to sneak them out last night
When I went back into the city this morning to find out what had happened I learned that those utterly evil and ferocious monsters ate my master raw during the night Nothing is left of his flesh and bones
On top of that my fellowdisciples Wuneng and Wujing are tied up there and will soon be dead too
I'm desperate That's why your disciple has come to visit the Tathagata
I beg you in your great compassion to recite the Bandloosening Spell so that I can take the band off my head and give it back to you Let your disciple go back to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit and enjoy himself Before he had finished saying this the tears welled up again
There was no end to his howls of misery
Don't upset yourself so Wukong said the Tathagata with a smile
You can't beat those evil spirits Their magical powers are more than you can handle
That is why you are so unhappy Monkey knelt below the Buddha and beat his breast as he replied Truly Tathagata I made havoc in Heaven all those years ago and was called Great Sage Never in all my life had I been beaten before I met these vicious monsters Stop being so sorry for yourself said the Tathagata
I know those evil spirits Tathagata Monkey suddenly blurted out
They say those evil spirits are relations of yours Wicked macaque said the Tathagata
How could an evil spirit be any relation of mine If they're not relations of yours how come you know them retorted Monkey with a grin
I know them because I see them with my allseeing eyes the Buddha replied
The senior demon and the second demon have masters
Ananda Kasyapa come here One of you is to take a cloud to Mount Wutai and the other to Mount Emei Summon Manjusri and Samantabhadra to come and see me The two arhats left at once as they had been commanded
They are the masters of the senior and the second demon chiefs
But the third demon does have some connection with me On his mother's or his father's side Monkey asked
When the primal chaos was first separated the heavens opened up in the hour of the rat and the earth at the hour of the ox the Buddha replied Mankind was born at the tiger hour
Then heaven and earth came together again and all living creatures were born including beasts that walk and birds that fly The unicorn is the most senior of the beasts that walk and the phoenix is the most senior of the birds that fly
When the phoenixes combined their essential spirit they gave birth to the peafowl and the Great Roc
When the peafowl came into the world she was the most evil of creatures and a maneater She could devour all the people for fifteen miles around in a single mouthful
When I was cultivating my sixteenfoot golden body on the peak of the snowy mountain she swallowed me as well I went down into her belly
I wanted to escape through her backside but for fear of soiling my body I cut my way out through her backbone and climbed Vulture Peak
I would have killed her but all the Buddha host dissuaded me to kill the peahen would have been like killing my own mother
So I kept her at my assembly on Vulture Peak and appointed her as the Buddhamother the Great Illustrious Peahen Queen Bodhisattva
The Great Roc was born of the same mother as she was
That is why we are relations of a kind When Monkey heard this he said with a smile By that line of argument Tathagata you're the evil spirit's nephew I shall have to go and subdue that demon in person the Tathagata said
Monkey kowtowed as he respectfully replied I beg you to condescend to grant us your illustrious presence Journey to the West The Tathagata then came down from his lotus throne and went out through the monastery gates with all the Buddha host just as Ananda and Kasyapa arrived bringing Manjusri and Samantabhadra
These two Bodhisattvas bowed to the Tathagata who asked them How long have your animals been away from your mountains Bodhisattvas Seven days said Manjusri
A mere seven days on your mountains is several thousand years in the mortal world the Tathagata replied
Goodness knows how many living beings they have destroyed there
Come with me to recapture them at once The two Bodhisattvas traveled at the Buddha's left and right hand as they flew through the air with the host
This is what could be seen The shimmering clouds of blessing parted for Lord Buddha As in his great compassion he came down from his shrine
He taught the truth about all beings since creation Explaining how everything had been transformed in time
Before him went five hundred holy arhats Behind him were three thousand guardians of the faith
Ananda and Kasyapa were both in close attendance Samantabhadra and Manjusri came to conquer monsters
The Great Sage had been granted this favour and succeeded in bringing the Lord Buddha and his host with him It was not long before the city was in sight
Tathagata said Monkey that's Leonia where the black vapors are coming from You go down into the city first said the Tathagata and start a fight with the evil spirits Do not win
You must lose and come back up
Leave it to us to recapture them The Great Sage then brought his cloud straight down to land on the city wall where he stood on the battlements and shouted abusively Evil beasts
Come out and fight me at once This caused such consternation among the junior demons in the towers on the wall that they jumped straight down into the city to report Your Majesties Sun the Novice is on the wall challenging us to battle That ape hasn't been here for two or three days the senior demon replied Now he's back challenging us to battle
Can he have fetched some reinforcements He's nothing to be scared of said the third demon chief
Let's all go and have a look The three chieftains all carrying their weapons hurried up on the wall where they saw Monkey Without a word they raised their Journey to the West weapons and thrust at him
Monkey held them off by swinging his iron cudgel
When they had fought seven or eight rounds Monkey feigned defeat and fled
Where do you think you're going the demon king asked with a mighty shout and with a somersault Monkey sprang up into midair
The three spirits went after him on clouds but Monkey slipped aside and disappeared completely in the Lord Buddha's golden aura
All that could be seen were the images of the Three Buddhas of Past Future and Present the five hundred arhats and the three thousand Protectors of the Faith who spread all around encircling the three demon kings so closely that not even a drop of water could leak through
This is terrible my brother said the senior demon chief lashing out wildly that ape is a really sharp operator
How did he manage to bring my master here Don't be afraid elder brother said the third demon If we all charge together we can cut down the Tathagata with our swords and spears and seize his Thunder Monastery The demons who had no sense of proper behavior really did raise their swords to charge forward hacking wildly
Manjusri and Samantabhadra recited the words of a spell and shouted Won't you repent now evil beasts
What else do you hope for The senior and the second demon chiefs gave up the struggle threw down their weapons rolled and reverted to their true images
The two Bodhisattvas threw their lotus thrones on the demons' backs and flew over to sit on them The two demons then gave up and submitted
Now that the blue lion and the white elephant had been captured only the third evil monster was still unsubdued
Spreading its wings it dropped its heavensquare halberd and rose straight up to try to catch the Monkey King with a swing of its sharp talons but as the Great Sage was biding in the golden aura the demon dared get nowhere near him
When the Tathagata realized what it was trying to do he made his golden aura flash and shook his head the supreme meditator in the wind to turn the creature into a bright red lump of bloody meat
The evil spirit seized it with a flourish of its sharp talons whereupon the Lord Buddha pointed upwards with his hand destroying the muscles in the monster's wings It could not fly or get away from the top of the Buddha's head and it reverted to its true appearance as a goldenwinged vulture
Opening its beak it said to the Buddha Tathagata why did you use your great dharma powers to catch me like this You have been doing much evil here the Tathagata replied
Come with me and you will win credit for a good deed You eat vegetarian food in great poverty and suffering at your place the evil spirit replied but here I can eat human flesh and live in no end of luxury
If you kill me by starvation you'll be guilty of a sin In the four continents I control countless living beings who worship me the Buddha replied and whenever they are going to perform a service to me I shall tell them to make a sacrifice to you first The Great Roc would have escaped and got away if it could As it was he had no choice but to accept conversion
Only then did Monkey emerge to kowtow to the Tathagata and say Lord Buddha today you have captured the evil spirits and removed a great bane but my master is dead At this the Great Roc said bitterly as it ground its teeth Damned ape
Why did you have to bring these ferocious men here to persecute me
I never ate that old monk of yours
He's in the Brocade Fragrance Pavilion now isn't he When Monkey heard this he quickly kowtowed to thank the Lord Buddha
Not daring Journey to the West to release the Great Roc the Buddha made him into a guardian of the dharma in his brilliant halo then led his host back to his monastery on their clouds
Monkey landed his cloud and went straight into the city where there was not a single junior demon left
Indeed A snake cannot move without its head A bird cannot fly without its wings
They had all fled for their lives when they saw the Buddha capturing their evil kings
Monkey then freed Pig and Friar Sand found the luggage and the horse and said to his fellowdisciples The master hasn't been eaten
Come with me He took the two of them straight into the inner compound where they found the Brocade Fragrance Pavilion Opening the door and looking inside they saw an iron trunk from which could be heard the sound of Sanzang weeping
Friar Sand used his demonquelling staff to open the iron cage over the chest and raise its lid
Master he called At the sight of them Sanzang wept aloud and said Disciples how were the demons beaten
How did you manage to find me here Monkey told him all the details of what had happened from beginning to end and Sanzang expressed boundless gratitude
Then master and disciples found some rice in the palace and ate their fill of it before packing their things and leaving the city along the main road West
Indeed Only a true man can find the true scriptures The will's shouts and the heart's labors are in vain
If you don't know when on this journey they were to see the Tathagata listen to the explanation in the next installment
In Bhiksuland the Hidden Gods Are Sent on an Errand of Mercy In the Palace the Monster Is Revealed and the Way Discussed A single thought at once disturbs a hundred monsters The hardest efforts are all to no avail
Journey to the West One can only wash away each speck of dust Tidy everything and polish well
Sweep all causation away and come to nirvana Waste no time and destroy the thousand demons
You surely will be free from obstructions And rise to the Daluo Heaven when your deeds are done
The story tells how the Great Sage Sun used all his ingenuity to fetch the Tathagata to subdue the demons and rescue Sanzang and the other two disciples after which they left the city of Leonia and headed West
When they had been travelling for several more months it was winter and this is what could be seen
The plum on the ridge was like broken jade As the water in the pond slowly turned to ice
All the red autumn leaves had fallen And the green of the pine looked fresher than ever
The pale and scudding clouds were on the point of snowing Flat lay the withered grass upon the hills
As far as the eye could see was chilly brightness As the unseen cold went right into the bone
Master and disciples braved the cold sleeping out in the rain and dining off the wind until as they were walking along another walled and moated city came into sight
What sort of place is that over there Wukong Sanzang asked Monkey who replied We'll know when we get there
If it's the capital of a Western kingdom we'll have to present our passport to be inspected and returned
If it's a prefecture or county town we'll go straight through Before master and disciples could finish their conversation they had arrived at the city gates
Sanzang dismounted and the four of them went in through the curtain wall outside the gates
Noticing an old soldier sleeping shielded from the wind under the Southfacing wall Brother Monkey went up to him shook him and said Sir When the old soldier awoke with a start to open his bleary eyes and see Monkey he fell to his knees to kowtow and say My Lord Journey to the West There's no need for such alarm said Monkey
I'm no evil god so why call me your lord Aren't you Lord Thunder God the old soldier asked kowtowing again
What a thing to say Monkey replied
We're monks from the East on our way to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven
We've just arrived here Could I ask what this place is called This answer finally eased the old soldier's mind
With a yawn he got back on his feet stretched and said Please forgive me reverend gentlemen
This country used to be called Bhiksuland but its name has been changed to Boytown Do you have a king Monkey asked
Yes yes the old soldier replied
Monkey then turned to report to the Tang Priest This country used to be called Bhiksuland but the name's been altered to Boytown though I don't know what the change signifies If it was Bhiksuland before why is it Boytown now the Tang Priest wondered
I expect there was a King Bhiksu who died said Pig and they changed the name to Boytown when a boy succeeded him Impossible said the Tang Priest impossible
Let's go in and make some enquiries in the street That's right said Friar Sand
The old soldier wouldn't have known anyhow and on top of that elder brother gave him such a fright that he talked nonsense
We'll ask some more questions in the city When they had gone through the third pair of gates they came to a great market on a main street The people were welldressed and their bearing distinguished
A hubbub of voices came from bar and music hall High hung the curtains outside splendid shop and teahouse
Business was good in firms by the thousand Wealth flowed free in shopping street and market
The dealers in metal and silk were swarming like ants Caring only for money while struggling for fame and wealth
With these noble manners magnificent scenery And peaceful waters it was a time of prosperity
Journey to the West The master and his three disciples who were leading the horse and carrying the baggage spent some time walking around the streets as they admired the general air of prosperity In the entrance to every house there was a basketwork coop of the sort geese are kept in
Disciples said Sanzang why do all the people here put coops in their gateways Pig's response to this was to look around and see that there were indeed lines of coops hung with satin curtains of many colours
Master said the idiot with a smile today must be a lucky one for weddings and celebrations Everybody's having a wedding Nonsense said Monkey
How could every single family possibly be having a wedding
There must be some other reason for this I'm going over to take a look You're not to go said Sanzang grabbing hold of him
You look so ugly that people might take offence I'll go as something else Brother Monkey replied
Making a spell with his hands the splendid Great Sage said the words of a spell shook himself turned into a bee spread his wings flew to one of the coops and slipped in through the curtains to take a look A little boy was sitting inside
Monkey looked inside another family's coop and there was a child in that too
He inspected eight or nine households and all of them had a child All were boys
there was not a single girl
Some were sitting up in their coops and playing and some were crying some were eating fruit and some were snoozing
His inspection over Monkey turned back into his normal self and reported to the Tang Priest There are little boys in the coops The oldest is under six and the youngest only four I don't know why they're here Sanzang wondered what the explanation could be
Turning a comer they saw the gateway to an official building It was a government hostel with golden pavilions
The venerable elder was delighted Disciples he said we will go into this hostel We can find out where we are give the horse a rest and put up for the night Yes that's right said Friar Sand
Let's go straight in This the four of them happily did a fact that the officials there reported to the hostel's superintendent
When the superintendent had led them inside greetings had been exchanged and they had all sat down the superintendent asked Where have you come from reverend sir I am a monk sent by the Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven Sanzang replied Now that we have arrived at this excellent establishment I will of course present my passport for inspection
Could we I wonder impose on your hospitality for the night The superintendent ordered tea and when it had been drank he saw to their entertainment and told the staff who were on duty to look after the pilgrims
After thanking him for this Sanzang went on to ask Could we go to the palace today to see His Majesty and have our passport inspected That will not be possible this evening the superintendent replied
It will have to wait until tomorrow morning
I hope that you will spend a comfortable night in this humble hostel A little later when all had been prepared the superintendent of the hostel invited the four travelers to take a vegetarian meal with him
He also told his staff to sweep out the guest rooms for them to spend the night in
Sanzang expressed endless gratitude
When they were all seated the venerable elder said I wonder if I could trouble you for information on something that I cannot understand
How do you raise children in your Journey to the West country People are the same the whole world over just as there are never two suns in the sky the superintendent replied
Children are born when their time comes after the father's seed has joined with the mother's blood and they have been in the womb for ten lunar months
After they are born they are suckled for three years and their bodies gradually grow
Everybody knows that What you tell me is no different from how they grow in my humble country Sanzang replied
But when we came into the city we saw a goose coop with a little boy inside in front of every house in the street
This is something I cannot understand which is why I ventured to raise the question Ignore that reverend sir whispered the hostel superintendent into Sanzang's ear Don't ask about it Put it out of your mind Don't even mention it
Would you like to settle down for the night before starting your journey again tomorrow morning Sanzang's response was to seize hold of the superintendent and demand an explanation
Watch your words the superintendent replied shaking his head and wagging his finger but Sanzang was not going to drop the matter He insisted on being told all the details
The superintendent had no choice but to dismiss all the staff on duty
When they were alone under the lamplight he whispered to Sanzang The goose coops you asked about are there because our king is a bad ruler
Why ever do you have to keep asking about it How is he a bad ruler Sanzang asked
I will not be able to set my mind at ease until you give me an explanation This country is really called Bhiksuland the superintendent replied Boytown is only what the people have started calling it
Three years ago an old man dressed as a Taoist came here with a girl just fifteen years old She was a ravishing beauty just like a Bodhisattva Guanyin
He presented her to our present king who was so smitten by her charms that she became the favorite of all his women She was given the title Queen Beauty
For some time now he's had no eyes for any of his other queens or consorts
He's so insatiable that he's been at it day and night
The result is nervous exhaustion and physical collapse He's eating and drinking next to nothing He might die at any moment
The Royal College of Physicians has tried every possible medicine without any success
The Taoist who presented the girl to the king was rewarded with the title of Elder of the Nation
He has a secret foreign formula for making people live a great deal longer
He's been to ten continents and the three magic islands to collect the ingredients Everything is ready
The only problem is that it needs a terrible adjuvant to help ita potion made from the hearts of  little boys
When he's taken it he'll have a thousand years of vigorous life ahead of him
All the little boys being kept in the coops are the ones that have been chosen
Their parents are so afraid of the king that none of them dares weep That's why they've put out the story that this place is now called Boytown
When you go to the palace tomorrow morning reverend sir you must only present your passport to be inspected and returned
Say nothing about any of this When he had said all this he left them
Sanzang was so horrified by what he had heard that his bones turned soft and his muscles went numb He could not help the tears that streamed down his face as he started sobbing aloud
Foolish king he exclaimed foolish king
Your lechery has ruined your health and now you are planning to destroy all those young lives How could you What misery
The pain of it all is killing me There is a poem about it that goes
The wicked monarch's folly makes him forget the truth Journey to the West His health is ruined by his unbridled lusts
Pursuing eternal life by killing little children He slaughters his subjects to avoid Heaven's punishment
This is all more than the merciful monk can bear He cannot accept the official's worldly wisdom
Long are his sighs as he weeps in the lamplight Stricken with grief is the Buddha worshipper
Master said Pig going up to him what's the matter with you
What you're doing is like taking a stranger's coffin to your own home and weeping over it
Don't upset yourself like that
As the rhyme goes When a monarch insists that his subjects will die None that are loyal to live will aspire When a father commands his own offspring to perish Any dutiful son will most surely expire
The people he's going to kill are his own subjects What are they to you
Take off your clothes get some sleep and 'don't worry about the ancients' Disciple said Sanzang his tears still flowing you haven't a shred of compassion The most important thing for us monks as we accumulate good deeds is to help others
How could this deluded king be so set in his wickedness
Never have I ever heard that eating human hearts could prolong life
How could something so terrible not grieve me Don't grieve so Master said Friar Sand
When you present our passport tomorrow and seethe king you can talk to him about it
Even if he doesn't accept your advice you'll be able to see what the Elder of the Nation looks like
Probably he's an evil spirit who's thought all this up because he wants to eat human hearts Wujing is right said Brother Monkey
Go to bed now Master and tomorrow morning I'll go to court with you to see what this Elder of the Nation is like
If he's human he's probably a heretic who doesn't follow orthodox ways but believes in drugs and I'll convert him with the essential teachings of intrinsic nature
If he's an evil spirit I'll catch him show the king what he is and urge the king to control his desires and build up his strength
Whatever happens I won't let him kill those children As soon as he heard this Sanzang bowed to Monkey with great courtesy and said What an excellent suggestion
But when we see the deluded king we must say nothing about this in case he thinks we are guilty Journey to the West of not knowing our place and spreading slander
What could we do if that happened I've got my magic powers Monkey replied
First of all I'm going to get the little boys in the coops away from the city so that he'll have nobody to take the hearts out of tomorrow
The local officials will of course report this and the king will be bound either to order a discussion with the Elder of the Nation or else to demand more information
This will give us a chance to submit our memorial without getting ourselves into trouble Sanzang was very pleased
How are you going to get the children out of the town now he asked
If you really can rescue them you will be doing the greatest of good deeds worthy disciple
But do it quick because if you lose any time you may be too late Summoning up his might Monkey stood up and gave Pig and Friar Sand their parting instructions
Sit here with the master while I do my stuff If you notice a magical wind blowing that'll be the boys leaving the city Sanzang and the other two disciples said We invoke the Saviour Bhaisajyaguru Buddha
We invoke the Saviour Bhaisajyaguru Buddha Once outside the doors the Great Sage whistled rose into midair made a spell with his hands and said the magic words called out Om pure dharma world and summoned the city god the local deities the officiating immortals the Protectors of the Faith of the four quarters and the center the Four Duty Gods the Six Dings and the Six Jias and the Guardians of the Teaching
They all came to him where he was in midair bowed and said Great Sage what is the urgent business on which you have summoned us in the middle of the night My journey has brought me to Bhiksuland Monkey replied where the king is a bad one who believes in evil doctrines He wants to take the hearts out of little boys to make the adjuvant to a medicine that he hopes will make him live for ever
My master finds this utterly horrible and has asked me to rescue the boys and destroy the demon
That is why I've asked all you gentlemen here I want you to use your magical powers to lift all the little boys coops and all over the city wall into a mountain hollow or somewhere deep in a forest Keep them there for a day or two Give them fruit to eat and don't let them go hungry
Keep watch over them in secret and don't frighten them or make them cry
When I've eliminated the evil brought the country back to good government and persuaded the king to mend his ways and am about to leave you must bring them back to me The gods all listened to their orders then brought their clouds down to land so that they could use their magical powers
The city was filled with a blustering negative wind that brought with it an allpervasive and sinister fog All the stars in the sky were obscured by the negative wind The moon was blacked out by the magical fog for many a mile
At first the wind was gusty And then it blew like a hurricane
When it was gusting Journey to the West All ran to the gateways to rescue their children Then in the hurricane They wanted to save their own flesh and blood in the coops
The air turned so chilly that none dared show their heads The cold was so piercing that clothes froze like iron
Vainly did parents look all around The families all were stricken with grief
The sinister wind blew right across the land As the boys in their baskets were carried off by the gods
Although that was a night of bereavement and grief Joy was coming to all the next day
There is another poem about it that goes Compassion has always been strong in the Sakyamuni faith The achievement of goodness explains the Great Vehicle
A multitude of holy ones all accumulate goodness For the Three Refuges and Five Precepts harmony is needed
The land of Bhiksu was not to be ruined by its monarch When a thousand little boys were to forfeit their lives
Monkey and his master had brought them to safety Which conferred more merit than the Great Wisdom
By the third watch of the night the gods had carried all the coops off and hidden them in all the safe places
Monkey then landed his auspicious light and went straight back to the government hostel where to his secret delight he could hear the other three still chanting We invoke the Saviour Bhaisajyaguru Buddha Master he said going up to them I'm back
What was the negative wind like Journey to the West Terrific said Pig
How did the rescue of the children go Sanzang asked
Every single one of them has been saved Monkey replied
They'll all be brought back when we set out again The master thanked him over and over again before finally going to sleep
When Sanzang awoke at dawn he dressed himself in his best vestments and said Wukong I am going to the early audience to present our passport If you go by yourself Master Monkey replied I'm afraid that you won't be able to manage Let me go with you
Then I'll be able to find out about the evil in this country If you go you will refuse to pay homage said Sanzang and the king may well take it amiss I won't be seen said Monkey
I'll go with you in secret and protect you This pleased Sanzang very much
He had told Pig and Friar Sand to look after the luggage and horse and was just about to set out when the superintendent of the hostel came in to see him
The superintendent was struck by the difference between vestments he wore this day compared with what he had been wearing the day before
His cassock was of brocade set with exotic gems On his head he wore a goldtopped Vairocana mitre
He held a nineringed monastic staff And hid a divine radiance in his breast
The passport was fastened tightly to his body Wrapped in brocade inside another cloth
He moved like an arhat come down to earth His face was truly that of a living Buddha
When the superintendent had greeted Sanzang courteously he murmured into his ear advice against meddling in matters that were none of his business
Sanzang nodded and assented
The Great Sage stole to a place by the gate said the words of a spell shook himself and turned into the tiniest of insects that flew with a highpitched hum to Sanzang's mitre
Sanzang left the government hostel and headed straight for the palace
Arriving at the palace gates Sanzang saw a eunuch officer to whom he bowed and said This humble monk has been sent by the Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven
Now that I have Journey to the West reached your distinguished country I must present my passport to be inspected and returned
I beg Your Excellency to report this to His Majesty This the eunuch duly did
The king was very pleased A monk from afar must be a holy man he said ordering that Sanzang be asked in
When the venerable elder had paid his respects at the foot of the steps of the throne hall he was invited to enter the hall and take a seat
Sanzang thanked the king and sat down
The king looked weak and enervated When he raised his hands to make a polite salutation he could not do so properly and he was incapable of continuous speech
His right was so blurred that he had to make several attempts to read the document that Sanzang handed to him before he could sign seal and return it to the Tang Priest who put it away again
The king was just about to ask why they were fetching the scriptures when one of his aides reported His Excellency the Elder of the Nation is here Leaning on one of his young eunuch attendants the king struggled down from his throne to greet the Elder
Sanzang hastily got to his feet stood to one side and looked round to see that the Elder of the Nation was an aged Taoist who advanced with a swagger towards the steps of the throne
On his head he wore a gooseyellow silken cap Round his body a scented cloak of silk and crane feathers And at his waist a triple sash of blue velvet
On his feet were sandals of hemp and grasscloth At the top of his rattan stick coiled a dragon The pouch at his chest was embroidered with dragon phoenix and flowers
His jadelike face radiated wellbeing A gray beard blew about his chin
Flames shot from golden pupils In eyes even longer than his eyebrows
Clouds followed his steps As he wandered through incenseladen mists
The officials below the steps received him with obeisances Announcing the presence of the Elder of the Nation
When he reached the throne hall the Elder of the Nation performed no obeisance but arrogantly strode straight in
The king leaned forward in a bow and said We are most fortunate that you have condescended to make your immortal way here Elder of the Nation He ordered that an embroidered stool be set on his left for the Journey to the West Elder to sit on
Taking a step forward Sanzang bowed and said Greetings Elder of the Nation The Elder sat majestically on his seat but instead of returning Sanzang's courtesy he turned to the king and asked Where's this monk from He has been sent by the Tang court in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven the king replied and is here to present his passport for inspection The road West is dark and dismal said the Elder of the Nation with a smile
There's nothing good about it The West has always been a land of bliss Sanzang replied
How could it not be good There is an old saying we once heard that monks are disciples of the Buddha said the king
I wonder whether it is true that by being a monk and turning to the Buddha one can live for ever When Sanzang heard this he put his hands together and replied
One who becomes a monk gets away from all kinds of causation
By understanding nature he learns that all dharmas are empty
Great wisdom is casual and drifts in nonliving
The true secret is hidden it wanders in extinction
When the three worlds are empty all origins are ordered when the six senseorgans are purified all troubles are finished
To be resolute singleminded and enlightened one must understand the heart When the heart is purified it can shine alone when the heart is sincere all regions are imbued with it
The true appearance has neither deficiency nor excess and can be seen in life
The images of illusion always decay Why seek what is beyond one's lot
The way to enter meditation is through meritorious deeds and by sitting in silence the root of cultivating one's conduct truly is charity and kindness
Great skill appears as clumsiness and knows that all deeds are achieved through inaction
The finest plans involve no calculation everything must be left alone
It only needs one heart not to move for every action to be perfect
It is truly absurd to try to strengthen the male by drawing on the female and nonsensical to try to extend one's years by taking elixirs
The only essential is that all the causation of every speck of dust must be discarded and that every type of matter should be empty
Live plain and pure let your desires be few Then naturally you will enjoy life without end for ever When the Elder of the Nation heard this he laughed at it
Phooey he said pointing at the Tang Priest phooey You're talking a load of rubbish monk
Fancy you talking about understanding nature and you a member of the faith that preaches nirvana
You don't have any idea of where nature comes from Sitting still like a dead tree to enter dhyana is wasted effort as far as selfcultivation and tempering are concerned
In the words of the saying Sit sit sit Your backside's split
The fire's too hot Good that's not What you don't realize at all is this
Journey to the West One who cultivates immortality has strong bones one who attains the Way has the most magical spirit
Carrying his bowl and ladle he goes into the mountains to visit his friends he picks every kind of herb to succor humanity
He makes a rainhat from immortal flowers plucks the fragrant orchid to make his bed
He sings claps and dances then goes to sleep
When expounding the Way he teaches the doctrines of the Supreme One he eliminates the evil of the human world with holy water
He takes the finest breath of heaven and earth gathers the essence of the sun and moon
By controlling the negative and positive forces he creates the elixir through the mastery of fire and water the foetus is formed On the sixteenth day of the month the negative is eliminated hazily and obscurely
In the twentyseventh day of winter the positive begins to grow darkly and mysteriously
He gathers the herbs of each of the four seasons refining his elixir to nourish the nine transformations
Astride his blue phoenix he ascends to the purple palace riding his white crane he goes to the jasper capital
He visits all the splendors of Heaven showing the efficacy of the wonderful Way
Just compare it with the dhyana teachings of your Sakyamuni your elimination of atman and your nirvana that enables you to shuffle off your stinking husk None of this lifts you out of the worldly dust
Among the Three Teachings it is supreme the Way alone has always been esteemed The king was delighted to hear this exposition and all the court officials exclaimed with admiration That's splendid 'the Way alone has always been esteemed' Sanzang was overcome by humiliation at all this praise going to his rival
The king then told his department of foreign relations to lay on a banquet of vegetarian food for the monks from a far country when they left the city to travel West
Sanzang thanked the king for his kindness and withdrew
As he was leaving the throne hall and going out of the palace Monkey flew down from the top of his mitre to say into his ear Master the Elder of the Nation is an evil spirit and the king has been bewitched
Go back to the hostel and wait for your meal while I get some information here Sanzang understood this and left through the main gates of the palace Of him we will say no more
Watch Monkey as he flies straight to a jade screen in the throne hall and lands on it
From the ranks of officials the military commanders of the capital stepped forward to report Your Majesty last night a cold wind carried away the little boys in their goose coops from every house in every ward of the city
They have vanished without a trace coops and all This report both alarmed and angered the king who said to the Elder of the Nation Heaven must be destroying us
We had the good fortune to be given the formula for your elixir after months of serious illness that the royal physicians have been unable to cure We were preparing to have the boys cut open at noon today and their hearts taken out to be made into the adjuvant for the elixir Never did we imagine that a cold wind would blow them all away
If this is not Heaven destroying us what is it Don't upset yourself the Elder of the Nation replied with a smile
By blowing them away Heaven is giving Your Majesty eternal life How can you maintain that Heaven is giving me eternal life when they have just been blown away the king asked
When I was coming to court this morning the Elder of the Nation replied I saw a uniquely marvellous adjuvant that will be far superior to  little boys' hearts
They would only lengthen Your Majesty's life by a thousand years but if you take my elixir with this other adjuvant you can live for a hundred million years The king was mystified about what this adjuvant could be but only after repeated questions did the Elder of the Nation reply The monk from the East who is being sent to fetch the scriptures has pure organs and regular features His is the body of one who has cultivated his conduct for ten lifetimes He has been a monk Journey to the West since childhood and has preserved his masculine purity which all makes him ten thousand times better than those little boys
If you can make a decoction from his heart with which to take my elixir I can guarantee you an extremely long life When the deluded king heard this he believed it completely Why didn't you tell us before he said to the Elder of the Nation
If it's as good as you say we should have kept him when he was here just now and not let him go This will present no problem the Elder of the Nation said You have already told the department of foreign relations to give him a vegetarian banquet
He can't possibly leave the city before eating the meal
Urgent orders must be issued to have the gates firmly closed Send troops to surround the government hostel and bring that monk here First we will try to win his heart by treating him with courtesy
If he agrees we will cut it out and give him a royal burial build him a temple and make offerings to him
If he will not agree we'll use rough methods We can tie him up and cut it out
There will be no problem The deluded ruler accepted this suggestion and ordered that all the gates be closed
He then sent the officers and men of the royal guard to surround the hostel
Having found all this out Monkey flew straight to the hostel turned back into himself and said to the Tang Priest Something terrible's happened Master something terrible Sanzang had just begun to eat the king's vegetarian banquet with Pig and Friar Sand when this sudden announcement scattered his three bodily spirits and made smoke come out of his seven orifices He collapsed in the dust pouring with sweat and unable to see clearly or speak
Friar Sand was so alarmed he came forward to help him back to his feet calling Wake up Master wake up What's so terrible Pig asked
What's so terrible
You should have broken the news gently instead of giving the master such a scare When the master left the palace I went back to keep an eye on things Monkey replied That Elder of the Nation is an evil spirit
A moment later the city garrison came to report about the cold wind carrying the little boys away
This upset the king but the Elder of the Nation cheered him up by saying that this was Heaven giving him eternal life
He wants to use your heart as an adjuvant for the elixir of immortality Master
The deluded king has accepted this wicked suggestion and ordered his best troops to surround this hostel
He's also sent an aide to ask you for your heart Master What a merciful and compassionate chap you are said Pig with a laugh
You saved the boys and made the wind blow all right but now you've got us in this disastrous mess Trembling and shaking Sanzang dragged himself to his feet seized hold of Monkey and said imploringly Good disciple how are we to get out of this If you want to get out of this said Monkey there'll have to be a switch What do you mean by a switch Friar Sand asked
If you want to survive Monkey replied the disciple will have to become the master and the master the disciple
Do that and we'll be safe Save my life said Sanzang and I will gladly become your disciple or even your disciple's disciple Journey to the West In that case there must be no hesitation Monkey replied continuing Pig mix up some mud at once The idiot loosened some earth with his rake then not daring to go outside for water lifted his tunic to make some water himself
With this he mixed up a lump of foulsmelling mud that he handed to Monkey
Monkey had no option but to beat it out flat and press it against his face so that it looked like a monkey's face
Then he told his master to stand up and neither move nor say anything while he placed the mask on his face said the words of a spell blew a magic breath and said Change The venerable elder now looked just like Monkey
He took off his own clothes and put on Monkey's while Monkey dressed in his master's clothes made a spell with his hands said the magic words shook himself and made himself look just like the Tang Priest
Even Pig and Friar Sand could not tell that he really was not
Just when they had completed the disguises together there came the sound of gongs and drums as a dense forest of spears and swords appeared
The commanders of the royal guard had surrounded the hostel with their three thousand men
A royal aide came into the main hall of the hostel to ask Where is the reverend gentleman from the Tang court in the East The superintendent of the hostel anxiously fell to his knees and said pointing In the guest room over there The aide then went into the room and said Venerable elder from Tang His Majesty has sent for you Pig and Friar Sand stood on either side of the imitation Monkey to guard him while the imitation Tang Priest went out through the door bowed and said Your Excellency what does His Majesty wish to say to me
Why has he sent for me The aide stepped forward to grab hold of him and say You and I are going to the palace His Majesty must have some use for you Alas
Wickedness was stronger than goodness and mercy Goodness and mercy only led to catastrophe
If you don't know whether they were to survive this departure listen to the explanation in the next installment
Searching the Cave to Capture the Fiend They Meet Longevity The Reigning Monarch Saves the Little Boys The story tells how the royal aide dragged the imitation Tang Priest out of the government hostel and marched him heavily surrounded by royal guardsmen straight to the gates of the palace where he said to the eunuch gate officer Please be so good as to report to His Majesty that we have brought the Tang Priest The eunuch officer hurried into the palace to pass this on to the deluded king who ordered that they be brought in
All the officials knelt at the foot of the steps to the throne hall leaving the imitation Tang Priest standing alone in the middle of them King of Bhiksuland he shouted what have you summoned me here to say to me Journey to the West We are sick with a chronic illness that has dragged on for many a day without any improvement the king replied
Now the Elder of the Nation has to our good fortune presented us with a prescription that has been made up All that is needed now is an adjuvant
The reason we have sent for you reverend sir is to ask you for the adjuvant
If we recover we will build a temple to you in which offerings will be made in all four seasons and incense will be burnt to you in perpetuity by our country I am a man of religion the imitation Tang Priest replied and have brought nothing with me
I do not know what adjuvant the Elder of the Nation has told Your Majesty you need Your heart reverend sir the deluded monarch replied
I will be frank with Your Majesty the imitation Tang Priest said I have a number of hearts
I don't know which you want Monk pronounced the Elder of the Nation who was standing beside the king
I want your black heart Very well then the imitation Tang Priest replied Produce your knife at once and open up my chest
If there is a black heart there I shall offer it to you obediently The deluded monarch thanked him delightedly and ordered an official in attendance to bring a small knife with a blade shaped like a cow's ear that was handed to the imitation Tang Priest
Taking the knife the imitation Tang Priest undid his clothes thrust out his chest pressed his left hand against his abdomen and cut the skin of his stomach open with the knife in his right hand There was a whoosh and out rolled a whole pile of hearts
The civilian officials all turned pale with fright the military officers were numbed
When the Elder of the Nation saw this from inside the throne hall he said This monk is a suspiciousminded character
He has too many hearts The imitation Tang Priest then held up the hearts one by one each dripping with blood for all to see They included a loyal red heart a pure white heart a yellow heart an avaricious heart a famehungry heart a jealous heart a calculating heart an overcompetitive heart an ambitious heart an overbearing heart a murderous heart a vicious heart a frightened heart a cautious heart a heretical heart and a heart full of indefinable gloom There was every kind of evil heart except a black one
The deluded ruler was horrorstruck unable to speak until he said in trembling tones Put them away
Put them away The imitation Tang Priest had taken as much as he could so he put his magic away and turned back into himself to say to the deluded monarch Your Majesty you're not at all perceptive
We monks all have good hearts It's only this Elder of the Nation of yours who has a black heart His would make a good adjuvant for the medicine
If you don't believe me I'll take his out to show you When the Elder of the Nation heard this he opened his eyes wide to take a careful look He saw that the monk's face had changed to something quite different
Heavens Recognizing him as the Great Sage Monkey who had been so famous five hundred years ago he made a getaway by cloud
Monkey did a somersault and sprang up into midair to shout Where do you think you're going
Take this from me The Elder used his stick with a dragon on its head to meet the blow from Monkey's cudgel
The two of them fought a fine battle up in the sky The AsYouWill cudgel Journey to the West And the dragon stick Making clouds up in the sky
The Elder of the Nation was really an evil spirit Using his fiendish daughter's seductive charms
The king had made himself ill through his lust The monster wanted to butcher the boys
There was no escape from the Great Sage's divine powers To catch demons and to rescue their victims
The cudgel's blows to the head were really vicious Splendid was the way in which the stick met them
They fought so hard that the sky was full of mist Casting city and people into darkness and fear
The souls of civil and military officials went flying The faces of the queens and concubines turned pale
The deluded king tried desperately to hide Trembling and shaking unable to do anything
The cudgel was as fierce as a tiger from the mountains The staff whirled round like a dragon leaving the sea
Now they made havoc in Bhiksuland As good and evil were clearly set apart
When the evil spirit had fought over twenty hard rounds with Monkey his dragon staff was no longer a match for the goldbanded cudgel Feinting with his staff the spirit turned himself into a beam of cold light and dropped into the inner quarters of the palace to take the demon queen he had presented to the king out through the palace gates with him She too turned into cold light and disappeared
Bringing his cloud down the Great Sage landed in the palace and said to the officials That's a fine Elder of the Nation you have The officials all bowed to him thanking the holy monk
No need for that said Monkey Go and see where your deluded king is Journey to the West When our monarch saw the fighting he hid in terror the officials replied We do not know which of the palaces he is in Find him at once Monkey ordered them
Perhaps Queen Beauty has carried him off As soon as the officials heard this they rushed with Monkey straight to the rooms of Queen Beauty ignoring the fact that these were the inner quarters They were deserted and there was no sign of the king Queen Beauty was nowhere to be seen either
The queens of the main the Eastern and the Western palaces and the consorts of the six compounds all came to kowtow in thanks to the Great Sage
Please get up Monkey said It's too early for thanks now
Go and find your sovereign lord A little later four or five eunuchs appeared from behind the Hall of Caution supporting the deluded king
All the ministers prostrated themselves on the ground and called out in union Sovereign lord Sovereign lord We are grateful that this holy monk came here to uncover the impostor
The Elder of the Nation was an evil spirit and Queen Beauty has vanished too When the king heard this he invited Monkey to come from the inner quarters of the palace to the throne hall where he kowtowed in thanks to Monkey Venerable sir he said when you came to court this morning you were so handsome
Why have you made yourself look different now I can tell you for a fact Your Majesty replied Monkey with a grin that the one who came this morning was my master Sanzang the younger brother of the Tang Emperor
I'm his disciple Sun Wukong There are two more of us disciples Zhu Wuneng or Pig and Sha Wujing or Friar Sand who are both now in the government hostel
I turned myself into my master's double and came here to defeat the monster because I knew that you had been deluded by his evil suggestions and were going to take my master's heart to use as an adjuvant for your elixir When the king heard this he ordered his ministers in attendance to go straight to the hostel to fetch Monkey's master and fellowdisciples
The news that Brother Monkey had turned back into himself and had fought the evil spirit in midair gave Sanzang such a fright that his souls scattered
It was lucky that Pig and Friar Sand were able to hold him up
His face was still plastered with stinking mud and he was feeling thoroughly depressed and miserable when he heard someone call Master of the Law we are ministers in attendance sent by the king of Bhiksuland to invite you to court to receive His Majesty's thanks Don't be afraid master said Pig don't be afraid
This time he's not sending for you to take your heart out I'm sure that elder brother has succeeded and they're inviting you there to thank you Even if they have come to invite me there because he has succeeded I could not face anyone with this stinking mask on Sanzang replied
We've got no option said Pig We'll just have to go to see my elder brother
He's bound to have a solution The venerable elder really did have no choice but to go to the main hall of the hostel with Pig and Friar Sand carrying the luggage and leading the horse
When the ministers saw him they were all terrified
My lord they said they both have heads like monsters Please don't take offence at our ugliness Friar Sand replied Both of us have the bodies that were left after an earlier life
If my master could see my elder brother he'd become handsome straight away When the three of them reached the palace they went straight to the throne hall without waiting to be summoned
As soon as Monkey saw them he turned round and came down from the hall to meet them Pulling Journey to the West the mud mask off his master's face he blew on him with magic breath called Change and turned the Tang Priest back into himself Sanzang was now in better spirits
The king came down from the throne hall to greet him as Master of the Law and ancient Buddha Master and disciples then tethered the horse and went into the throne hall to be presented
Does Your Majesty know where the monsters came from Monkey asked
Let me go and catch them both for you
Then we will have eliminated future catastrophe When all the queens consorts and concubines of the three palaces and six compounds who were behind the screen of bright green jade heard Monkey saying that he was going to eliminate future catastrophe they cast aside all their inhibitions about appearing in front of an outsider and a male one at that as they came out to bow to him and say We beg you holy monk and venerable Buddha to destroy them completely root and branch with your dharma powers
That would be an act of the greatest kindness and we would of course reward you richly Quickly responding to their bows Monkey insisted that the king tell him where the monsters lived
We asked him when he came here three years ago the king replied shamefacedly and he told us that it was only some twenty miles to the South of the city in Pure Splendor Grange on Willow Slope
The Elder of the Nation was old and had no son only the daughter that his second wife had given him She was just fifteen and unmarried He offered to present her to us and because we fancied the girl we accepted her
She was the favorite among all the palace women
We never expected that we would fall so ill that all the prescriptions of the Royal College of Physicians would be of no avail
Then he told us that he had a formula for an elixir for which a decoction of boiled little boys' hearts was needed as the adjuvant
In our folly we believed him and chose some boys from among the common people At noon today we were going to operate and take out their hearts
We never expected that you would come down to us holy monk and that at that very moment all the boys would disappear in their coops
Then he said that as you were a holy monk who had cultivated the truth for ten lifetimes and not yet dissipated your primal masculinity your heart would be ten thousand times more effective than the little boys' ones
In our temporary delusion we did not realize that you would see through the evil monster holy monk
We hope that you will make full use of your great dharma to eliminate any future catastrophe All the wealth of the nation will be given to you as your reward I will tell you the truth Monkey replied
Because my master took pity on the little boys in the coops he told me to hide them
Don't say anything about giving us wealth When I capture the evil monsters that will be a good deed to my credit
Come with me Pig Whatever you say elder brother Pig replied
The only thing is that I've got an empty belly
I'll be rather weak The king then ordered the department of foreign affairs to prepare a vegetarian meal at once
Before long the food arrived
Having eaten his fill Pig braced his spirits and rose by cloud with Monkey
The king queens consorts and civil and military officials were all so astonished that they all kowtowed to the sky exclaiming They really are immortals and Buddhas come down to earth The Great Sage led Pig twenty miles due South stopped their wind and cloud and started searching for the demons' home
All he could see was a clear stream running between banks on which grew thousands of willows he had no idea where the Pure Splendor Grange might be Indeed
Endless expanses stretched out in his gaze The embankment had vanished amid willows and haze
Journey to the West When he could not find the grange the Great Sage Sun made a spell with his hands said the magic word Om and summoned the local deity who approached shivering and shaking fell to his knees and called out Great Sage the local god of Willow Bank kowtows to you Don't be afraid Monkey said I'm not going to hit you Tell me this
is there a Pure Splendor Grange on Willow Hill
And where is it There is a Pure Splendor Cave the local deity replied but there has never been a Pure Splendor Grange
I suppose you have come from Bhiksuland Great Sage Yes yes Monkey replied
The king of Bhiksuland was hoodwinked by an evil spirit till I turned up saw through the monster defeated him and drove him away He turned into a beam of cold light and I don't know where he went
When I asked the king of Bhiksuland about it he told me that when the demon first presented him with the girl three years ago he asked the spirit about his background The demon said that he lived in Pure Splendor Grange on Willow Hill twenty miles South of the city
I've found this place with its wooded hill but can't see any Pure Splendor Grange That's why I asked you about it I beg your forgiveness Great Sage said the local god kowtowing
This is part of the domain of the king of Bhiksuland and I should have kept a closer watch on things
But the evil spirit had such terrible magical powers If I had given away what he was doing he would have come and given me a bad time That is why he has never been caught
Now that you are here Great Sage you need only go to the foot of the nineforked willow on the Southern bank walk round it three times to the left and three times to the right hit the tree with both hands and shout 'Open up' three times
The Pure Splendor Cave Palace will then appear On learning this the Great Sage sent the local god away again jumped over the stream with Pig and went to look for that willow tree
There was indeed a tree with nine forks on a single trunk
Stand well back Monkey ordered Pig while I make the gates open
When I've found the demon and chased him out you're to help In response to this order Pig took up his stand about three hundred yards from the tree while the Great Sage followed the local god's advice and went round the tree three times to the left and three times to the right then hit it with both hands shouting Open up
Open up An instant later a pair of double doors opened with a noisy whoosh and the tree was nowhere to be seen
Inside the doors was bright light of many colours but no sign of human life Confident in his divine might Monkey charged in
He could see that it was a fine place Shimmering clouds from which Sun and moon stole their brightness
White clouds billowing from the caves Bright green lichens running wild in the courtyard
Along the path rare flowers competed in beauty While plants on the steps vied in fragrant blossom
Journey to the West Warm was the air Where it was ever spring This was just like a fairyland Or Penglai the paradise of immortals
Creepers grew all over the benches Vines ran wild across the bridge
Bees flew into the cave carrying flowers Butterflies flirted with orchids as they passed the screen of stone
Hurrying forward for a closer look Monkey saw that on the stone screen was carved IMMORTAL PALACE OF PURE SPLENDOR
Unable to restrain himself he jumped over the stone screen to see the old monster embracing a beautiful woman and telling her breathlessly what had happened in Bhiksuland That was our chance they said together Three years' efforts should have paid off today but that ape's ruined everything Monkey charged up to them brandishing his cudgel and shouting I'll get you you fools
What do you mean that was your chance
Take that Pushing the woman aside the old monster swung his dragonheaded stick to block the cudgel
It was a fine battle that the two of them fought in front of the cave and quite unlike the previous one The upraised cudgel spat out golden light Vicious vapors came from the swinging staff
The monster said How dare you in your ignorance come to my home Monkey replied I intend to subdue evil monsters Journey to the West Said the monster My love for the king was no business of yours So why did you come to bully and interfere Answered Monkey A compassionate monk should bring misrule to an end
We could not endure the slaughter of children As they flung words at each other hostility grew Staff parried cudgel as blows struck at the heart
Precious flowers were destroyed as they fought for their lives Green moss became slippery when trampled underfoot
Pale grew the light in the cave as they struggled Crushed were the fragrant blooms on the crags
At the clash of their weapons the birds dared not fly Their shouts sent the beauties all running in terror
Only the monster and Monkey were left To stir up a hurricane that roared over the earth
Slowly their battle took them out of the cave Where Wuneng gave play to his mindless wrath
The sound of the commotion they were making inside so excited Pig where he was waiting outside that his heart itched As he could get no relief from scratching he raised his rake smashed the nineforked willow to the ground then hit it several times so hard that blood gushed straight out with a barely audible sound
This tree's become a spirit he said this tree's a spirit Pig had just raised his rake for another blow when he saw Monkey drawing the monster after him
Without another word the idiot rushed forward raised his rake and Journey to the West struck
The old monster was already finding Monkey too much to cope with so that Pig's rake made him more desperate than ever Abandoning the fight he shook himself turned back into a beam of cold light and headed East again
The two of them would not let the demon go but headed Eastwards in pursuit
Above the shouts of battle they heard the calls of the phoenix and the crane and looked up to see that it was the Star of Longevity from the Southern pole of the heavens
Placing a cover over the cold light the old man called out Don't be in such a hurry Great Sage stop chasing him now Marshal Tian Peng
This old Taoist offers his greetings Monkey returned his courtesy and asked Where have you come from Longevity my brother You've capped the cold light so you must have caught the monster old fat chops said Pig with a grin
Here he is here he is said the Star of Longevity smiling back
I trust you two gentlemen will spare his life The old devil's nothing to do with you brother said Monkey so why have you come to plead for him He's a messenger of mine replied the star with a smile
I carelessly let him escape to become a monster here Since he's yours make him turn back into what he really looks like for us to see said Monkey
The Star of Longevity then let the cold light out and shouted Evil beast
Turn back into yourself at once if you want to be spared the death penalty The demon turned himself round and revealed that he was really a white deer
Picking the staff up the Star of Longevity said You've even stolen my staff evil beast The deer lay down in submission unable to speak but only kowtowing and weeping
Look at him Brindled like a tablet of jade And carrying a pair of sevenbranched antlers
When hungry he used to find the herb garden On mornings when thirsty he drank from the misty stream
In his lengthening years he had taught himself to fly And through many a day had mastered transformation
Now that he heard the call of his master He resumed his own form and lay down in the dust
Thanking Monkey the Star of Longevity mounted his deer and was just leaving when Monkey grabbed hold of him and said Not so fast brother
There are a couple more jobs still to be done Journey to the West What jobs the star asked
The girl hasn't been caught yet and I don't know what sort of monster she is Monkey replied
We've also got to go back to Bhiksuland together to see the deluded ruler and show him what they really are In that case I'll be patient the star replied
You and Marshal Tian Peng can go down into the cave to capture the girl and take her back to show the king what she really is Just wait a little while said Monkey
We'll soon be back Pig then summoned up his spirits and went straight into the Immortal Palace of Pure Splendor with Monkey
Catch the evil spirit he shouted catch the evil spirit Hearing this great roar the beauty who was trembling with fear and unable to escape rushed behind the stone screen but there was no rear exit
Where do you think you're going Pig shouted
I'll get you you mantrap you whore spirit
Try my rake As the beauty was unarmed she could not fight back so she dodged the blow and turned herself into a beam of cold light and fled only to be stopped by the Great Sage who with two thumping blows of his cudgel knocked her off her feet and laid her low in the dust
She turned back into her real form as a whitefaced vixen
Unable to restrain himself the idiot lifted his rake and struck her a blow on the head
The great beauty of so many smiles was now a hairy fox
Don't smash her to pulp Monkey said keep her in that shape to show her to the deluded king The idiot grabbed her by the tail not minding the filth and dragged her out through the cave entrance with Monkey
Here he saw the Star of Longevity stroking the deer's head and giving him a dressingdown Evil beast he was saying why did you run away from me and come here to turn yourself into a spirit
If I hadn't turned up the Great Sage Sun would certainly have killed you What's that you're saying brother asked Monkey springing out of the cave
I was telling the deer off the star explained telling the deer off Throwing the body of the dead fox in front of the deer Pig said Your daughter I suppose The deer nodded then stretched its head out to sniff the body and whimpered as if with grief at its bereavement until the Star of Longevity cuffed its head and said Evil beast You're lucky to have got away with your life
What are you sniffing her for He then took off the belt he wore round his gown fastened it round the deer's neck and led it off with the words Great Sage let's go to Bhiksuland Wait a moment said Monkey I feel like cleaning the whole place up so that no other evil creatures can ever live here again When Pig heard this he raised his rake and started to smash the willow down wildly
Monkey then said the magic word Om and summoned the local deity once more Gather some dried firewood Monkey ordered him and start a roaring fire that will rid this place of yours of evil
Then you won't be bullied any more The local deity then turned around and with a roaring negative wind led his spirit soldiers to gather all sorts of withered vegetation that had dried out since the previous year frostbitten grass autumn grass knotweed grass mountain grass dragonbone grass rushes and reeds Once set alight they would burn like oil or grease Journey to the West There's no need to go knocking trees over Pig said Monkey Fill the mouth of the cave with all this and set it alight
that'll burn the place clean out And indeed once they were lit they turned the evil demons' Pure Splendor home into a fiery furnace
Only then did Monkey dismiss the local god and go with the Star of Longevity as they dragged the fox to the steps of the throne hall where he said to the king Here's your Queen Beauty
Do you want to fool around with her now This caused the king a terrible shock
At the sight of the Great Sage Monkey bringing the Star of Longevity with the white deer before the throne hall monarch ministers consorts and queens all dropped to the ground to kowtow
Monkey went up to the king and held him up Don't kowtow to me he said with a smile
This deer is the Elder of the Nation
It's him you should be kowtowing to The king was now so overcome with shame that he could only say Thank you holy monk for saving the boys in my kingdom
It truly was an act of heavenly kindness He then ordered the department of foreign relations to prepare a vegetarian feast had the Eastern hall of the palace opened up and invited the star the Ancient of the Southern Pole to take part in a thanksgiving feast with the Tang Priest and his three disciples
Sanzang bowed in greeting to the Star of Longevity as did Friar Sand
If the white deer is one of your creatures Star of Longevity they both asked how did he get here to become such a nuisance Some time ago the Lord of Eastern Splendor came to my mountain the Star of Longevity replied with a smile and I persuaded him to sit down for some chess The wicked creature escaped before our first game was over
It was only when I couldn't find him after my visitor had gone that I worked out by calculating on my fingers that he must have come here I had just reached here in my search for him when I met the Great Sage Sun using his mighty powers
If I had been any later this beast would be dead Before he could finish his remarks it was announced that the banquet was ready
It was a splendid vegetarian feast The room was overflowing with color Exotic fragrances filled the hall
Embroidered hangings made the tables magnificent Red carpets on the floor shimmered like the glow of dawn
From duckshaped censers Curled the scented smoke of eaglewood Before the king's place Were fragrant vegetables
See how high the towers of fruit were piled Sugar dragons and prowling animals
Molded mandarin ducks Journey to the West Lion confections Looking quite lifelike
Parrot goblets Cormorant ladles Shaped like the real thing
Every kind of fruit in abundance Each exquisite dish a delicacy
Giant longans and tender bambooshoots Fresh lichees and peaches
Sweet smelled the jujubes and persimmon cakes More fragrant than wine were the pinenuts and grapes
Many a sweet dish made with honey Steamed pastries of various kinds Sugardrenched doughnuts Piled up like bouquets of flowers Mountains of rolls on golden dishes Fragrant rice heaped high in silver bowls Long bean noodles in hot chili soup Tasty dishes came in succession
There was no end of button mushrooms Treeear fungus Tender bamboo shoots Sealwort Vegetables of many flavors A hundred kinds of rare delights
They came and went in endless succession Journey to the West All the abundant dishes offered at the feast The seating was arranged on the spot the seat of honour going to the Star of Longevity and the next best place to the Tang Priest
The king sat between them while Brother Monkey Pig and Friar Sand sat at the side places
There were also three senior ministers present to keep them company and the musicians and singers of the court theatre were ordered to perform
Holding his purple cloud goblet the king toasted them one by one
The only person who would not drink was the Tang Priest
Brother said Pig to Monkey I'll leave the fruit for you but you must let me have a good feed of the soup bread and rice With no further thought the idiot ate everything all at once He devoured everything that was brought in and left nothing behind
When the banquet was coming to an end the Star of Longevity took his leave of them
The king went up to him knelt kowtowed and begged the star to tell him the secret of eliminating disease and prolonging life
I didn't bring any elixir as I was here to search for my deer the Star of Longevity replied
I would like to teach you the techniques of selfcultivation but you are so weak in body and ruined in spirit that you would not be able to convert the elixir
All I have in my sleeve is these three jujubes that I was intending to offer to the Lord of Eastern Splendor to take with tea
As they haven't been eaten I can offer them to you now The king swallowed them and he gradually began to feel lighter in body as the illness was cured
This was the origin of his later success in achieving immortality
As soon as Pig saw this he called Longevity old pal if you've got any fire jujubes give me some I didn't bring any the star replied but I'll give you several pounds of them next time The Star of Longevity then went out of the Eastern pavilion expressed his thanks called to the white deer sprang on his back and departed by cloud
We will not relate how the king queens and consorts in the palace and the common people in the city all burnt incense and kowtowed
Disciples said Sanzang let us pack up and take our leave of His Majesty The king pleaded with them to stay and instruct him
Your Majesty said Monkey from now on you should be less greedy for your sexual pleasures and accumulate more hidden merit In whatever you do you should use your strong points to make up for your weaknesses This is the way to get rid of your illness and prolong your life
That's what we'll tell you Two dishes full of small pieces of gold and silver were then offered to the pilgrims to help with the expenses of their journey but the Tang Priest refused to accept a single penny
The king then had no choice but to order the royal carriage and invite the Tang Priest to sit in the dragon and phoenix coach while he his queens and his consorts pushed the wheels Thus they escorted him out of the palace
In the streets and markets the common people also came with bowls of pure water and incenseburners to see them on their way from the city
Suddenly there was the sound of a wind in the sky and  goose coops landed on both sides of the road The little boys in them were crying Unseen in the sky were the deities who had been looking after them the city and the local gods the deities of the altars the True Officials the Guardians of the Four Quarters and the Centre the Four Duty Gods the Six Dings and Six Jias the Protectors of the Faith and the rest of them who all responded with a loud shout of Great Sage on your earlier instructions we carried the boys away in the goose coops
Now that we have learned of your success in your task and your departure we have brought every one of them back again The king his queens and consorts and all his ministers and subjects fell to their knees to kowtow Journey to the West Thank you for your efforts gentlemen Monkey shouted to the sky
Please all return to your shrines now I'll get the people to make thanksgiving offerings to you With a soughing noise the magic wind then arose again and departed
Monkey then told the people of the city to come and collect their children
The news was spread at once and the people all came to claim the boys in the baskets They were very happy indeed Holding the boys in their arms they called them dear ones and darlings Dancing and laughing they told their children to take hold of the lords from Tang and bring them home so that they could express their thanks for the boys' rescue
Nobody young or old male or female was frightened by the disciples' ugly faces as they all carried Pig Friar Sand Monkey and the Tang Priest back to the city in the middle of a crowd that also brought their luggage and led the horse
The king could not stop them
Family after family laid on a banquet or a feast and those who could not offer hospitality made monkish hats shoes tunics cotton socks and other inner and outer garments in different sizes that they presented to the pilgrims
Only when they had been entertained in this way for nearly a month were the travelers able to leave the city
Portraits of them were painted and tablets bearing their names set up to these the people could kowtow burn incense and make offerings Indeed
Great was the gratitude for their enormous kindness In saving the lives of infants by the thousand
If you don't know what happened later listen to the explanation in the next installment
The Young Girl Seeks a Mate to Build Up the Male Protecting His Master the MindApe Sees Through a Demon The story tells how the king ministers and common people of Bhiksuland escorted the Tang Priest and his three disciples out of the city
Seven miles later they were still unwilling to part from the pilgrims but Sanzang insisted on getting out of the coach mounting the horse and taking his leave of them The people who had been seeing him off did not return to the city until the travelers had vanished from view
When the four had been travelling for a long time the winter and the spring too were over There was no end of wild flowers and mountain trees to be seen fragrant blossoms filled the view
To Sanzang's alarm another towering mountain appeared in front of them
Disciples he asked is there a way across the high mountain before us
We must be careful Master laughed Brother Monkey that's not what a seasoned traveler should be saying You sound much more like some pampered prince trying to look at the whole sky from the bottom of a well
As the old saying goes a mountain can't stop the road it can find its own way across
So why ask whether there's a way Even if this mountain cannot block the road Sanzang replied I am afraid that there may be monsters on the mountain precipices and evil spirits that will emerge from its deep recesses Journey to the West Don't worry said Pig don't worry
We're not far from Paradise here
I guarantee it'll all be nice and peacefulthere won't be any trouble As they were talking master and disciples reached the foot of the mountain without even noticing
Taking out his goldbanded cudgel Monkey climbed the rockface Master he called there's a path that goes round the mountain The going's very easy
Hurry up The Tang Priest now put his worries aside and whipped the horse forward
Carry the luggage for a while brother said Friar Sand to Pig who did so while Friar Sand held the horse's reins and the master sat in the carved saddle They hurried along the main path up the steep slope after Monkey
This was what the mountain looked like The peak was wrapped in clouds Torrents rushed down ravines
The paths were heavy with the scent of flowers And dense grew the countless trees
Blue were the gages white the plums Green the willows and red the peaches
Spring was all but over where the cuckoo sang When fledgling swallows chirped the festival was finished
Craggy boulders Bluegreen pines shaped like parasols
The track leading across the ridge Climbed high over a tracery of rocks The beetling precipice Was overgrown with creepers grass and trees
Peaks like a row of halberds vied in elegance Far from the ocean wave streams competed in gullies
As the master was taking an unhurried look at the mountain scenery he was moved to homesickness by the sound of a bird singing
Disciples he said After receiving His Majesty's command Journey to the West I was given my passport in front of the brocade screen
Watching lanterns on the fifteenth night I left the Eastern land And then was parted from the emperor of Tang
Just when the dragon and tiger winds both met I and my disciples had to struggle with the horse
Twelve may be the peaks of Mount Wu But when shall I face and see you again' Master said Monkey you're always suffering from homesickness You're not like a monk at all
Stop worrying and keep going don't upset yourself so
As the old saying goes you've got to work hard if you want to be rich and successful What you say is quite right disciple said Sanzang but I do not know where the road to the West runs Master said Pig it's all because our Tathagata Buddha can't bring himself to give those scriptures away He must have removed the path because he knows we're coming to fetch them Why else can't we get to the end of the journey Don't talk such nonsense said Friar Sand
Just keep going with big brother
As long as we stick with him we're bound to get there in the end As they were talking master and disciples came in sight of a great expanse of dark pine forest
In his fear the Tang Priest called out Wukong no sooner have we taken that precipitous track over the mountain than we come to this deep dark pine forest
We must be careful There's nothing to be scared of said Monkey
Nonsense said Sanzang
Never trust what appears to be absolutely upright and be on your guard against evil masquerading as goodness
I have been through quite a few pine woods with you but never one as vast and deep as this Just look at the trees
Densepacked to East and West In lines to North and South
Densepacked to East and West they reach the end of the clouds In lines to North and South they touch the azure firmament
Thorns and brambles grow closetangled all about Journey to the West Knotweed wraps itself around the branches
Liana coils round kudzu vine Kudzu coils around liana
Where liana coils around kudzu Travelers cannot move between East and West Where kudzu coils round liana Merchants may not ply between North and South
In this forest You could spend half a year Not knowing whether sun or moon was out Or travel for miles And never see the stars
Where the outlook is to the North the view is unbounded On Southern slopes the bushes are in flower
There are thousandyearold locust trees Tenthousandyearold junipers Pines that endure the winter cold Mountain peaches that bear fruit Wild peonies And hibiscus All growing in a closepacked profusion So wild that not even a god could paint it Birdsong could be heard
Parrots shrieking Cuckoos calling Magpies in the branches Journey to the West Crows feeding their mothers Orioles with their aerial dance As the mynas adjust their voices
Quails singing Swallows chirping Mynas imitating people And thrushes that could recite sutras
Then there were Great beasts swishing their tails Tigers gnashing their teeth
Aged foxes and raccoondogs disguised as ladies Ancient gray wolves at whose baying the forest shook
Had the Pagodacarrying Heavenly King come here His power to suppress demons would have been of no avail
The Great Sage Sun was unafraid Clearing the way ahead with his cudgel he led the Tang Priest into the depths of the forest
They had been travelling in this carefree style for many hours without seeing any sign of a way out of the forest when the Tang Priest called out Disciples we have been through no end of steep and dangerous mountain woods on our journey West Thank goodness we have found this purity and elegance and a smooth path
The rare and unusual flowers here are truly delightful
I intend to sit here for a moment to let the horse have a rest
I am besides famished
Go and beg me some meatfree food from somewhere Master said Monkey please dismount while I go begging This the venerable elder did
While Pig tied the horse to a tree Friar Sand put the luggage down brought out the beggingbowl and handed it to Monkey
Sit still here Master Monkey said and don't even say the word 'fear'
I'll be back in a moment While Sanzang sat upright in the shade of the pines Pig and Friar Sand amused themselves looking for flowers and fruit
Let us tell of the Great Sage who somersaulted into mid air brought his cloud to a hall and looked back All he could see coming from the pine forest were auspicious clouds and auras that coiled and spread all around
Good good he found himself saying Do you know why He was expressing his admiration for the Tang Priest the reincarnation of the Venerable Golden Cicada and a holy man who had cultivated his conduct for ten successive lifetimes which explained there was such an aura of good omen above his head
Journey to the West Five hundred years ago when I made havoc in heaven Monkey thought I wandered to the very corners of the oceans and ran wild at the end of the sky
I led a host of spirits and called myself the Great Sage Equaling Heaven
We subdued dragons and tigers and I took us off the registers of death
I used to wear a triple golden crown and a coat of golden mail and with my goldbanded cudgel in my hands and my cloudtreading shoes on my feet I had  demons under me
They all used to call me Lord Great Sage I really was someone in those days
But ever since being rescued from Heaven's punishment I've been a smalltime nobody as his disciple
I reckon that as the master has such an aura of auspicious clouds over his head things are sure to turn out well for us on our way back to the East and I'm bound to win the true achievement As Brother Monkey was congratulating himself along these lines he saw a column of black vapor rising from the South of the forest
That black vapor means evil for sure he thought with alarm
No black vapors could come from our Pig or Friar Sand While the Great Sage was still trying to make out exactly what the vapors were coming from Sanzang was sitting in the forest clarifying his mind and contemplating the Buddhanature as he recited the Mahaprajnaparamita Heart Sutra when suddenly he heard a highpitched cry of Help This is all very well said Sanzang with astonishment but who could that be calling so deep in the forest It must be someone terrified by a wolf a tiger a leopard or some other wild beast
I shall go to take a look The venerable elder rose to his feet and walked through the thousandyearold cypresses and even more ancient pines holding on to vines and creepers as he went close enough to see a woman tied to a big tree The top half of her body was bound to the trunk with creepers and her lower half buried in the ground
Sanzang stopped to ask Why are you tied up here lady Bodhisattva It was quite obvious that the wretched creature was an evil monster but with his mortal eyes in a worldling's body Sanzang was unable to perceive this
The monster's response to the question was to weep copiously
Just look at the tears rolling down her peachy cheeks
She was so lovely that fish would have sunk and wild geese fallen out of the sky at the sight of her the beauty of her sorrowing and sparkling eyes would have made the moon hide away and put the flowers to shame
Sanzang did not dare go any closer to her as he opened his mouth to ask What crime have you committed lady Bodhisattva
Tell me so that I can rescue you The evil spirit then quickly put together a pack of lies as she replied Master my home is in the country of Pinpo which is some seventy miles from here
Both my parents are at home and they are very great lovers of goodness All their lives they have been on good terms with their relations and devoted to their friends
At the Clear and Bright Festival they invited all their relations and members of their own family to pay their respects at and sweep the ancestral graves A whole procession of carryingchairs and horses all went to the graves in the wilds outside the city
Here we set out our offerings and had just burnt the paper models of horses when a band of brigands sprang upon us with the sound of gongs and drums
They charged us shouting 'kill' My parents and relations all got hold of horses and carryingchairs and fled for their lives
Because I am so young I was too frightened to run
I just collapsed and was carried back to the mountains by the brigands The top chieftain wanted me for his lady the number two chieftain wanted me for his woman and the third and fourth ones both fancied me for my looks There were seventy or eighty of them all quarrelling over me and none of them would give way So they tied me up here in the forest and broke up the band
I've been here for five days and five nights now and I'm only just alive now I'll soon be dead
Goodness only knows which ancestor however many generations back accumulated the virtue that brought you here to me today reverend sir
I beg you in your great mercy to save my life I won't forget your goodness to me even when I lie dead under the nine springs of the underworld When she had finished speaking her tears flowed like rain
Journey to the West As Sanzang really did have a merciful heart he could not help weeping and sobbing himself Disciples he shouted
Pig and Friar Sand were still looking for flowers and fruit in the forest when suddenly they heard their master's anguished cry
Friar Sand said the idiot the master's found a relation here What nonsense brother said Friar Sand with a smile In all the time we've been going we haven't met a single good person so where could any relation of his have come from If it's not a relation why's the master crying for them Pig asked adding You and I had better go to take a look Friar Sand did indeed go back to where they had been before
Leading the horse and carrying the luggage they went up to the master and asked What's up Master The Tang Priest pointed at the tree as he replied Pig untie this lady Bodhisattva and save her life Without caring whether this was the right or the wrong thing to do the idiot set to
The Great Sage meanwhile saw from up in the air the dense black vapors completely obscuring the auspicious glow This is bad he said this is bad
If the black vapors are covering the auspicious glow that means something evil is threatening my master
Never mind about begging for foodI'm going back to see the master He turned his cloud back and landed in the forest where he saw Pig recklessly untying the ropes
Going up to him Monkey grabbed an ear and threw him to the ground
The master told me to rescue her the idiot protested looking up to see Monkey as he scrambled back to his feet so why did you push me over like that
You're just throwing your weight about Brother replied Monkey with a smile don't untie her
She's an evil spirit who's been putting on an act to fool us Wretched ape shouted Sanzang talking nonsense again
How can you possibly take a girl like this for an evil spirit There's something you don't know Master Monkey replied In the old days I tried all these tricks myself when I wanted some human flesh
You couldn't possibly tell what she is Master said Pig pouting sulkily don't let that Protector of the Horses take you in
She's a local girl We've never had dealings with her before on our long journey from the East and she's no relation or inlaw of ours so how can you say she's an evil spirit
He's trying to get rid of us by making us go ahead so he can turn a somersault and get back here by magic
Then he's going to have a bit of fun with her and ruin our reputation You cretin shouted Brother Monkey stop talking such rubbish
I've never done any such outrageous thing on all our journey to the West
I reckon it must have been some reckless womanizer like yourself who forgot his principles when he saw a good chance I expect you tricked some family into taking you as their soninlaw and tied her up here That's enough of that said Sanzang that's enough
Now then Bajie Your elder brother usually sees things very clearly Ignore what he is saying
Let us be on our way Splendid said Monkey with great delight you have a good destiny Master Please mount
Once we're out of the pine forest there will be a house where we can beg for some food for you The four of them then pressed on together leaving the monster behind
Journey to the West The story tells how the monster gnashed her teeth with fury as she was left tied there to the tree I've heard tell of Sun Wukong's tremendous magic powers for years she said and now that I've seen him today I know that his reputation's wellfounded
As that Tang Priest has been cultivating his conduct ever since he was a boy he has never lost a drop of his primal masculinity I was longing to mate with him so that I could become a golden immortal of the Supreme Ultimate I never expected that monkey to see through my magic and save him
If I'd been untied and released I could have carried him off whenever I chose and he'd have been mine
Now that Sun Wukong has made those damaging remarks and taken the Tang Priest away my efforts have all been for nothing
Let's see what happens when I give him another couple of shouts Not shifting her ropes the evil spirit made the most of the wind being in the right direction to carry some highpitched words of morality into the Tang Priest's ear
Do you know what she was shouting
Master she called if you forget your conscience and refuse to save a living being's life what's the use of your fetching the scriptures from the Buddha When the Tang Priest heard this call he reined the horse in and said Wukong go and rescue that girl You've started on your way Master Monkey replied
What made you think of her again She is shouting again there the Tang Priest said
Did you hear Pig Monkey asked
My big lugs cover my earholes Pig replied and I didn't hear anything Did you hear Friar Sand I was walking ahead carrying the pole with the luggage Friar Sand replied
I wasn't paying attention and I didn't hear anything either Neither did I said Monkey
What did she say Master
You were the only one who heard What she called was quite right the Tang Priest called
She asked what was the use of fetching scriptures when I went to visit the Buddha if I forgot my conscience and refused to save a living being's life
To save a human life is better than building a sevenstoried pagoda
Rescuing her straight away would be even better than worshipping the Buddha and fetching the scriptures If you're wanting to be charitable Master Monkey replied you're incurable
Just think of all the demons you've met in all the mountains you've crossed on your journey West since leaving the East
They've often taken you into their caves and I've had to rescue you I've killed tens of thousands of them with this iron cudgel of mine
So why can't you bring yourself to let a single devil die today
Why do you have to rescue her Disciple the Tang Priest replied there's an old saying 'Do not fail to do a good deed because it is small do not commit a bad deed because it is small' You're still to go and save her If that's the way you're going to be Master I can't accept that responsibility Monkey replied
You insist on rescuing her and I dare not try too hard to dissuade you When I did make a little attempt to do so you lost your temper again
You can go and rescue her if you want to Watch your tongue ape Sanzang retorted
Sit here while Bajie and I go to rescue her Journey to the West The Tang Priest went back into the forest and told Pig to undo the ropes around the top half of her body and dig the lower half out with his rake
The demon stamped her feet fastened her skirt and happily followed the Tang Priest out of the pine forest
When she met Monkey all he did was to wear a mocking smile
Impudent ape said the Tang Priest abusively what are you smiling at I'm laughing at you Monkey replied You meet up with good friends when your luck is going well And when it's going badly you find yourself a belle Impudent macaque said Sanzang being abusive again
What nonsense I have been a monk ever since I came out of my mother's womb I am now making this journey West at His Majesty's command with the devout intention of worshipping the Buddha and fetching the scriptures
I am not the sort of person to care about wealth and office so what do you mean by my luck going badly Master replied Monkey with a grin you may have been a monk since you were a child and you may be good at reading sutras and invoking the Buddha but you have never studied the text of royal laws This girl is young and beautiful
If monks like us travel with her we may well meet with evil people who arrest us and turn us in to the authorities They won't care about worshipping Buddhas or fetching scriptures They'll treat it as a case of illicit sex and even if that isn't proved we'll still be convicted of abduction You will lose your ordination license Master and be beaten half to death
Pig will be sent into exile and Friar Sand sentenced to penal servitude Even I won't get off scotfree
No matter how I try to talk my way out of it I'll still be found guilty of wrongdoing Don't talk such rubbish Sanzang shouted
After all I did save her life There will be no trouble
We are taking her with us
I will be responsible for whatever happens You may say you'll be responsible Master Monkey replied but what you don't realize is that so far from rescuing her you're destroying her I saved her life by rescuing her from the forest said Sanzang so how can I be destroying her If she had stayed tied up in the forest without any food for three to five days ten days or even half a month and starved to death said Monkey she would at least have gone to the Underworld with her body in one piece
But now you've taken her away from there You're on a fast horse and travelling like the wind The rest of us have to follow you How will she be able to keep up on her tiny feet She can barely walk
If she gets left behind and a wolf a tiger or a leopard eats her up you'll have killed her You are right Sanzang said Thank you for thinking of it
What are we to do about it Lift her up and let her ride on the horse with you replied Monkey with a grin
I could not possibly ride on the same horse as her moaned Sanzang Then how is she to travel Monkey asked
Bajie can carry her on his back Sanzang replied Journey to the West You're in luck idiot said Monkey
There's no such thing as a light load on a long journey Pig replied
Having to carry her isn't luck With your long snout you'll be able to turn it round and chat her up on the quiet while you're carrying her Monkey replied which will be very convenient for you Pig's reaction to hearing this was to beat his chest and jump about in fury
That's terrible he said that's terrible I'd sooner put up with the pain of a flogging from the master
If I carry her I won't possibly come out of it clean You've always been a slanderer
I'm not carrying her Very well then Sanzang said very well then
I can walk a little further I shall come down and walk slowly with you
Bajie can lead the horse with nobody riding it You've got yourself a good bargain there idiot said Monkey roaring with laughter
The master's done you a favour by letting you lead the horse You are talking nonsense again ape said Sanzang
As the ancients said 'When a horse is to travel three hundred miles it cannot get there by itself' If I walk slowly are you going to leave me behind
When I go slowly you will have to go slowly too
We shall all take the lady Bodhisattva down the mountain together We can leave her in some convent temple monastery or house that we come to Then we will still have rescued her You're right Master Monkey replied
Let's press on quickly Sanzang took the lead while Friar Sand carried the luggage Pig led the riderless horse and the girl and Monkey carried his iron cudgel as they carried on together
Within seven to ten miles the evening was drawing in and a tall building came into sight
Disciple said Sanzang that must be a temple of some sort We shall ask to spend the night here and be on our way first thing tomorrow What you say is right Master said Monkey
Let's all get a move on They were soon at the gates where Sanzang told them Keep well out of the way while I go in first to ask if we can stay for the night
If it looks suitable I shall send someone to call to you So they all stood in the shadows of the poplars while Monkey kept an eye on the girl his iron cudgel in his hand
The venerable elder walked forward to see that the gates were hanging crooked and falling to pieces
What he saw when he pushed the gates open chilled him to the heart The cloisters were deserted The ancient shrine left desolate
The courtyard was overgrown with moss Sagebrush and brambles choked the paths
Journey to the West The only lanterns came from the fireflies While the croaking of frogs had replaced the waterclock
The venerable elder started crying Indeed
The desolate halls were falling down The lonely cloisters collapsing
Broken bricks and tiles lay in a dozen heaps And all the pillars and beams were askew
Grass was growing all around The kitchens were crumbling and buried in dust
In derelict towers the drums had lost their skins Broken was the glass lamp
The color had gone from the Buddha's golden statue The figures of arhats lay strewn upon the floor
Guanyin had turned to mud in the soaking rain Her pure vase with a willow spray fallen to the ground
No monk was to be seen there by day And only foxes slept there at night
As the wind roared with the sound of thunder This was a place for tiger and leopard to shelter
The walls around had collapsed And no gates could be closed to guard it
There is a poem about this that goes For many a year had the temple been unrepaired In its derelict state it had gone from bad to worse
Journey to the West The gales had destroyed the faces of the temple guardians And rainstorms had washed the heads off the Buddha statues
The vajrapani had collapsed and been soaked through The local god had lost his shrine and stayed outside at night
Two other things were even more depressing Bell and drums lay on the ground instead of hanging in their towers
Summoning up his courage Sanzang went in through the inner gates where he saw that the belltower and drumtower had both collapsed leaving only a single bronze bell planted in the ground its bottom half the color of indigo
With the passage of the years the top half of the bell had been bleached in the rain while the earth's vapors had greened the lower part
Bell Sanzang called aloud as he touched it Once you roared from high in the tower Calling afar from the painted beam where you hung
At cockcrow you used to ring in the dawn And at evening you announced the dusk
Where now are the lay brothers who begged for the copper Or the craftsman who cast it to form you
Both I imagine are now in the Underworld They have gone without trace and you are left silent The venerable elder's loud sighs had by now disturbed someone in the monastery
A lay brother who was offering incense heard the voice climbed to his feet picked up a broken brick and threw it at the bell
The bell's clang gave the venerable elder such a fright that he fell over then scrambled up again to flee only to trip over the root of a tree and go flying again
As he lay on the ground Sanzang raised his head and said Bell I was just lamenting your fate Journey to the West When suddenly you clanged
On this deserted route to the West Over the years you have turned into a spirit The lay brother came over to Sanzang and steadied him as he said Please get up reverend sir The bell hasn't become a spirit
It was I who struck it just now Looking up and seeing how dark and ugly the other was Sanzang said I suppose you are a goblin or some other evil creature
I am no ordinary man I come from Great Tang and I have disciples who can subdue dragons and tigers
If you run into them your life will be lost Don't be afraid my lord replied the lay brother falling to his knees
I'm no evil being I'm a lay brother who looks after the incense here
When I heard those fine things you were saying just now I wanted to come out and welcome you but I was afraid that it might be some demon knocking at the gates
That was why I didn't dare come out until I'd thrown a piece of brick at the bell to calm my fears
Please rise my lord Only then did Sanzang calm himself sufficiently to reply Lay brother that fright was almost the death of me
Take me inside The lay brother led Sanzang straight in through the third pair of gates What the Tang Priest saw here was quite different from outside
A cloudpatterned wall built of blue bricks Halls roofed with green glazed tiles
The holy statues were sheathed in gold The steps made of pure white jade
Blue light danced in the Buddha hall Fine vapors rose from the Vairocana chapel
Above the Manjusri hall Were decorations of flying clouds In the Library of Scriptures Were patterns of flowers and green leaves
On the roof above the triple eaves stood a precious jar In the Tower of Five Blessings embroidered covers were spread
A thousand bright bamboos waved over the dhyana seat Journey to the West Ten thousand bluish pines threw their light on the gates
Jadecoloured clouds reflected gold on this palace Auspicious clouds drifted round the woods full of purple mist
Each morning the fragrant breezes could be smelled all around In the evening painted drums were heard on the high hills
There should be morning sunshine to patch torn robes How can the sutra be finished by the light of the moon
The courtyard at the back is lit by half a wall of lamps A column of fragrant smoke shines in the hall
Sanzang saw this but did not dare go inside Lay brother he called why is the front of the monastery so dilapidated but the back so neat and tidy My lord said the lay brother with a smile these mountains are full of evil creatures and brigands On clear days they roam the mountains to rob and on dull ones they shelter in the monastery They knock the Buddha statues down to use as seats and burn the wooden pillars for firewood
The monks here are too feeble to argue with them which is why they have abandoned the wrecked buildings at the front for the brigands to stay in They have found some new benefactors to build the new monastery for them Now there is one for the pure and one for the impure
This is how we do things in the West So that is the way things are said Sanzang
As he walked further Sanzang saw written over the gate in large letters SEAGUARDING MONASTERY OF MEDITATION
Only then did he stride in through the gates where a monk appeared coming towards him
Just see what the monk looked like His hat of velvet and brocade was held with a pin And a pair of bronze rings hung from his ears
His tunic was made of woolen stuff And his eyes were white and bright as silver
He held in his hand a selfbeating drum As he recited scriptures in an unknown tongue
Sanzang did not know before Journey to the West That he was a lama on the road to the West
As the lama came out he saw how very handsome and elegant Sanzang was clearbrowed and fineeyed with a broad forehead and level top to his skull ears hanging to his shoulders and arms so long they came below his knees He looked like an arhat come down to earth
The lama his face wreathed in smiles went up to Sanzang chuckling with delight to grab hold of him feel his hands and feet rub his nose and tug at his ears as ways of showing his friendliness
After leading Sanzang into the abbot's lodgings and going through the rituals of greeting the lama asked him Where have you come from venerable Father I have been sent by His Majesty the Emperor of Great Tang in the East to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures from Thunder Monastery in India in the West Sanzang replied
As we were passing this way when it was becoming dark I have come to your distinguished monastery to put up here for the night before leaving early tomorrow morning
I beg you to grant me this expeditious help You shouldn't say that replied the lama with a smile you shouldn't say that
We didn't really want to become monks We were all given life by our mothers and fathers and only cut our ties with them because we had unlucky destinies and our families could not afford to keep us
Even though we are now disciples of the Buddhist faith you must not talk empty words I spoke in all sincerity Sanzang replied
However far is the journey from the East to the Western Heaven the monk said
Along the way there are mountains there are caves in the mountains and there are spirits in the caves
I don't think that a lone traveler looking as delicate as you could possibly be a pilgrim going to fetch the scriptures You are quite right abbot Sanzang replied
I could never have got here alone
I have three disciples who clear my way across the mountains and build me bridges over rivers
It is only because they have protected me that I have been able to reach your monastery Where are your three distinguished disciples the lama asked
Waiting outside the gates of the monastery Sanzang replied
Father said the lama with alarm you don't realize that there are dangerous tigers wolves evil bandits ghosts and demons here
We don't dare roam far even by day and we shut the gates before nightfall
How can you leave people outside this late He then told his disciples to ask them in at once
Two young lamas hurried outside
At the sight of Monkey they fell over and then fell over again when they saw Pig
Scrambling to their feet they ran back in as fast as they could and said My lord your luck is out Your disciples have disappeared There are only three or four evil monsters standing outside the gates What do they look like Sanzang asked
One has a face like a thunder god the young lamas replied one has a face like a tilthammer and one has a green face and terrible fangs
There is a girl with them tooshe has oiled hair and a powdered face Journey to the West You would not know who they are replied Sanzang with a smile
The three ugly ones are my disciples and the girl is someone I rescued in the pine forest My lord the lama said how can a master as handsome as you have found yourself such ugly disciples Ugly they may be Sanzang replied but they are all useful Ask them in straight away If you take any longer the one who looks like a thunder god is a bit of a troublemaker
He was not born to a mother and father and he will fight his way in The young lamas then hurried outside again and fell to their knees shivering and shaking as they said My lords Lord Tang invites you in Brother said Pig if he's invited us that's that
Why are they shivering and shaking They're scared because we're so ugly Monkey replied
Rubbish said Pig We were born that way
None of us is ugly from choice Make yourself look a bit less ugly said Monkey and the idiot really did tuck his snout into his tunic and keep his head down as he led the horse while Friar Sand carried the pole and Brother Monkey brought up the rear holding his cudgel in his hand and dragging the girl along
They went past the ruined buildings and cloisters and in through the third part of gates
When they had tethered the horse they went into the abbot's lodgings to meet the lama and take their seats in order of precedence
The lama then went inside to lead seventy or eighty young lamas to greet them tidy their rooms give them a vegetarian meal and look after them
Indeed In storing up achievement be mindful of mercy When the Buddha's Dharma flourishes monks admire each other
If you do not know how they left the monastery listen to the explanation in the next installment
The MindApe Recognizes a Monster in the Monastery The Three Search for Their Master in Black Pine Forest The story tells how Sanzang and his disciples came to the Meditation Monastery where they met the lamas and were given a vegetarian meal
When the four of them had eaten the girl was also fed
By now night was gradually falling and the lamp was lit in the abbot's lodgings
The lamas who wanted to ask the Tang Priest about why he was going to fetch the scriptures and were also eager for a look at the girl stood packed together in rows under the lamp
Abbot said Sanzang to the lama he had first met when we leave your monastery tomorrow what will the road West be like Before answering the lama fell to his knees
Sanzang quickly helped him up and said Stand up please
Why do you greet me in this way when I ask about the road Journey to the West When you travel West tomorrow reverend sir you will find that the road is level the lama replied There is no need to worry
There is just one thing at present that is rather awkward I wanted to tell you about it as soon as you came in but I was afraid that it would offend your distinguished self
I only venture to tell you now that the meal is over that you will be most welcome to spend the night in the young lamas' room after your long hard journey from the East
But it would not be right for the lady Bodhisattva to do so
I don't know where I should invite her to sleep Your suspicions are not called for abbot Sanzang replied and you should not suppose that my disciples and I have wicked ideas
When we were coming through Black Pine Forest this morning we found this girl tied to a tree
My disciple Sun Wukong refused to save her but out of my enlightened heart I rescued her and have brought her here for you to put up abbot As you have been so generous reverend Father the abbot replied we can set out a straw mattress behind the devarajas in the Devaraja Hall for her to sleep on That's splendid Sanzang said splendid After this the young lamas took the girl to sleep in the back of the hall while in the abbot's lodgings Sanzang urged the officials of the monastery to put themselves at their ease whereupon they all dispersed
We have had a hard day Sanzang said to Brother Monkey
We must go to bed early and be up early in the morning They all slept in the same room guarding the master and not daring to leave him
Later that night The moon rose high and all was peaceful The Street of Heaven was quiet and nobody moved
Bright was the Silver River the stars shone clearly The drum in the tower hastened the changing watch
We will say nothing more of the night
When Monkey rose at first light he told Pig and Friar Sand to get the luggage and the horse ready then urged the master to start out
But Sanzang wanted to sleep longer and would not wake up so Monkey went up to him to call Master The master raised his head but still could make no reply
What will you say Master Monkey asked
Why is my head spinning Sanzang replied why are my eyes swollen and why an I aching all over from my skin to my bones When Pig heard this he stretched out his hand to feel the master's body It was feverish
Now I understand said the idiot with a grin He had several bowls too many of last night's free rice and went to sleep headdown
It's indigestion Nonsense shouted Monkey Let me ask the master what's really the matter When I got up in the middle of the night to relieve myself Sanzang replied I did not put my hat on
I think I must have caught a chill in the wind Journey to the West I'm sure you're right said Monkey Can you travel now I cannot even sit up Sanzang replied let alone mount the horse
The journey will have to wait What a thing to say Master said Monkey As the saying goes 'A teacher for a day is one's father for life' As your disciples we are like your sons
There's another saying that A son does not have to shit silver or gold As long as be can do what's needed he'll be fine
If you're not feeling well you shouldn't be worrying about the journey being delayed
There'll be no problem about waiting for a few days The three brotherdisciples all looked after their master
The morning was followed by midday and dusk and after a good night dawn returned
Time fled and three days had soon passed
The morning after that Sanzang tried to sit up calling Wukong as I have been very ill these last couple of days I have not asked you before have people been giving food to the lady Bodhisattva we rescued What are you bothering about her for laughed Monkey What you should be concerned with is your own illness Yes yes said Sanzang
Help me up and fetch me paper brush and ink Borrow an inkstone here in the monastery What do you want them for Monkey asked I want to write a letter Sanzang replied
I shall seal it up with our passport and ask you to deliver it for me to His Majesty Emperor Taizong in Chang'an Easy said Monkey I may not be much good at anything else but when it comes to delivering letters I'm the champion of the whole world So wrap the letter up and give it to me
I'll take it to Chang'an in a single somersault give it to the Tang Emperor and come back with another somersault before your brush and inkstone have dried up
But why do you want to write a letter
Tell me what you want to say in the letteryou can write it down later This is what I will write said Sanzang weeping
Your subject beats his head three times upon the ground With a triple shout of 'Long live Your Majesty' as I bow to my lord
The civil and military officials ate all present And four hundred courtiers all listen to what is said Journey to the West Years ago I left the East on your command Hoping to see the Buddha on the Vulture Peak
But on my journey I have met with obstructions And been delayed by unexpected disaster along the way
My illness is grave I cannot move one step The gate to Buddha is as distant as the gate to heaven
I will not live to bring back the scriptures I submit with respect that a new envoy should be sent When Monkey heard this he could not help bursting out into uproarious laughter
You're hopeless Master he said thinking that sort of thing after just a touch of illness
If you were seriously ill you'd only have to ask me to find out whether you were going to live or die I have my own special way of dealing with it I'd ask 'Which king of the Underworld dared think of this
Which of the judges issued the warrant
Which demon messenger is coming to fetch him' If they make me angry I'll lose my temper the way I did when I made havoc in Heaven smash my way into the Underworld with my cudgel capture the ten kings and rip the sinews out of every one of them
I'll show them no mercy Stop that boasting disciple Sanzang replied
I am very ill Brother said Pig going up to him it's very awkward to have the master saying he's in a bad way and you insisting he isn't
Let's settle things as quickly as we can sell the horse pawn the luggage buy a coffin to bury the master in and split up You're talking out of turn again you idiot Monkey replied
What you don't realize is that the master used to be our Tathagata Buddha's second disciple His original name was the Venerable Golden Cicada
This is great hardship he has to endure because he once slighted the Buddha's Dharma But brother Pig replied even if the master did slight the Buddha's Dharma he was exiled to the East and born into another body amid the sea of right and wrong and the battlefield of tongues He swore an oath to go to the Western Heaven worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures Every time he's met an evil spirit he's been tied up and every time he's come across a monster he's been hung up He's had to put up with every kind of agony That should be enough Why has he had to be ill as well This is something you wouldn't know about Monkey replied
The master once dropped off to sleep instead of listening to the Buddha teaching the Dharma and as he drowsed he trod on a grain of rice with his left foot That is why he has to be ill for three days in the lower world So goodness only knows how many years someone who eats as messily as I do will have to be ill replied a shocked Pig
Brother Monkey replied the Buddha will spare ordinary creatures such as you There's something else you don't know
As the poet said Journey to the West Hoeing millet in the noonday sun Sweat drops on the ground beneath the millet
Who understands that of the food that's in the bowl Every single grain was won through bitter toil The master will only be ill today
Tomorrow he'll be better I am feeling different today from how I did yesterday said Sanzang
My throat is absolutely parched
Go and find some cold water somewhere for me to drink Fine Monkey replied
If water's what you want Master that means you're better
I'll go and fetch some Monkey at once took the begging bowl and went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery where he came across all the monks redeyed and sobbing with grief The only thing was that they dared not cry aloud
Don't be so petty little monks said Brother Monkey
Before we leave we'll thank you for the days we've spent here and we'll pay for our cooking fuel and lighting by the day
You really shouldn't be such pustules We wouldn't dare accept it the lamas said at once falling to their knees we wouldn't dare What do you mean you wouldn't dare said Monkey
It must be that longsnouted monk of ours who has an enormous appetite
He'd eat you out of house and home My lord the lamas replied there are over a hundred senior and junior lamas in this monastery If each of us kept you for a single day we could afford to support you for over a hundred days
We're not the sort of skinflints who'd calculate what you will cost us in food If you're not working out the cost then why are you sobbing Monkey asked
Lord the lamas replied there's an evil monster in the monastery We don't know which mountain it's from
Last night we sent two junior lamas to strike the bell and beat the drum We heard the sound of the bell and the drum but the lamas never came back
When we looked for them the next day all we found were their monk's hats and shoes lying in the courtyard at the back and their skeletons They had been eaten
In the three days you have been here six lamas have disappeared from the monastery
That's why we can't help being frightened and grieved
When we realized that your venerable master was ill we couldn't stop these tears stealing out even though we kept the news to ourselves Say no more said Brother Monkey who was both shocked and delighted by what he heard It must be an evil monster who's killing people here
I'll wipe it out for you My lord the lamas replied any evil spirit worthy of the name has magical powers
It's bound to be able to ride clouds come out of the underworld and disappear again
As the ancients put it so well 'Trust not the straightest of the straight beware of the inhuman human' Please don't take offence my lord when we say that if you can rid our monastery of this scourge that would be a great happiness for us
But if you can't catch it Journey to the West things will be pretty difficult What do you mean by things being pretty difficult Monkey asked
We will be honest with you my lord the lamas replied
Although there are only a hundred or so of us lamas in this monastery we all became monks as children
When our hair grows we have it shaved off Our clothes are patched with rags
We rise in the morning to wash our faces Then bow with hands together In submission to the Great Way
At night we tidy up burn incense And piously pray Chanting the name of Amitabha
When we look up we see the Buddha On his ninefold lotus throne Wellversed in the Three Vehicles Riding in his mercy on clouds of dharma And we long to see the Sakyamuni in the Jeta park Looking down we see into our hearts Accept the Five Prohibitions Pass through a thousand aeons And live each life amid the countless dharmas Hoping to understand emptiness and the impermanence of matter
When the benefactors come Old young tall short fat thin We each beat wooden fish Journey to the West Strike bronze chimes Slowly and deliberately With the two rolls of the Lotus Sutra And the short Litany of the Emperor of Liang
When the benefactors do not come New old strange familiar rustic smart We put our hands together Eyes shut Silent Entering meditation on the rush mats Firmly closing the gates under the moon
Let the orioles sing and other birds chirp in idle strife They cannot mount our expeditions and compassionate chariot of dharma
This is why we cannot subdue tigers and dragons Or recognize monsters and spirits
If my lord you provoked the evil monster To which we hundred and more lamas would be but a single meal All of us living creatures would fall to the wheel of rebirth This ancient monastery of meditation would be destroyed And finally there would be no light at the Tathagata's assembly
This would cause great troubles When Brother Monkey heard the lamas say this anger surged up from his heart and hatred from his gall What a stupid lot you lamas are he shouted at the top of his voice
Are you only aware of those evil spirits
Do you know nothing of what I've done Really we don't the lamas replied in very quiet voices
Then I'll tell you briefly about it Monkey said
Journey to the West I used to subdue tigers and dragons on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit I once went up to Heaven and made great havoc in its palace
When I was hungry I nibbled just two or three Of Lord Lao Zi's elixir tablets When I was thirsty I sipped six or seven cups Of the Jade Emperor's own wine
When I glare with my golden eyes that are neither black nor white The sky turns deathly pale While the moon is hidden in cloud
When I wield my goldbanded cudgel that's the right length It strikes unseen And leaves no trace behind
What do I care about big or little monsters However rough or vicious they may be
Once I go for them They may run away nimble about hide or panic
Whenever I grab one They'll be filed down cooked ground to bits or pulverized in a mortar
I'm like one of the eight immortals crossing the sea Each of whom gives a unique display of his magical powers
Lamas I'll catch that evil spirit and show it to you
Then you'll know what sort of person this Monkey is When the lamas heard this they nodded and said quietly From the way this damned baldy is shooting his mouth off and talking big there must be something behind it all Journey to the West They all made polite noises of respectful assent except for the older lama who said Wait
Your master is ill and catching the evil spirit is not as important as that
As the saying goes When a young gentleman goes to a feast He either gets drunk or eats till he's filled
When a strong warrior goes into battle He either is wounded or gets himself killed
If you two fight it out here you may well get your master into trouble too
It's not a sound idea You're right said Monkey you're right
I'll take my master a drink of cold water and be right back Picking up the begging bowl he filled it with cold water went out of the monastery kitchen and back to the abbot's lodgings and called Master cold water for you Sanzang who was just then suffering torments of thirst raised his head held the bowl with both hands and took only one sip of the water
It really was a case of A drop when you're thirsty is just like sweet dew Get the right medicine and you'll feel good as new
Seeing the venerable elder gradually recovering his spirits and looking less worried Monkey asked Could you manage some soup and other food Master That cold water was a magical cure Sanzang replied I have already half recovered from my illness
I would like some food if there is any The master's better Monkey shouted repeatedly at the top of his voice
He wants some soup and other food He told the lamas to arrange some at once They washed and boiled rice made noodles cooked pancakes steamed breadrolls and prepared vermicelli soup
Four or five tables of food were carried in but the Tang Priest ate only half a bowl of rice gruel while Monkey and Friar Sand managed only a tableful between them Pig gobbled up the rest
The dishes were then taken out the lamp was lit and the lamas dispersed How long have we been here now Sanzang asked
Three whole days Monkey replied
By tomorrow evening it will be four days We could have covered a lot of distance in three days Sanzang replied
Never mind about the distance Master said Monkey
We'll be on our way tomorrow Journey to the West Yes said Sanzang even if I am still a little poorly there is nothing that can be done If we're setting out tomorrow let me catch the evil spirit tonight said Monkey
What evil spirit Sanzang asked in astonishment
There's an evil spirit in this monastery that I'm going to catch for them Monkey replied
But how can you be having ideas like that before I have even recovered from my illness Sanzang asked
If that monster has magical powers and you fail to catch it then it will kill me won't it You're always running people down Monkey replied
Wherever we go I subdue evil creatures Have you ever seen me come off second best That could only happen if I did nothing
If I act I'm bound to win Disciple said Sanzang clutching him the saying is quite right that goes
Do people a good turn whenever you can If it is possible treat them with mercy
Worrying cannot compare with true kindness Better be patient than strive for supremacy In the face of his master's impassioned pleas and refusal to allow him to subdue the monster Monkey could only speak frankly I'll be honest with you Master he said
The evil spirit has been eating people here Who has it eaten Sanzang asked with shock
In the three days we've been here it's eaten six of this monastery's young lamas Monkey said to which Sanzang replied
Foxes will grieve at the death of the hare Creatures will all for their own kind show care
As it has eaten monks from this monastery and I am a monk too I will let you go but do be careful No need to tell me said Monkey I'll wipe it out the moment I get my hands on it Watch him as he tells Pig and Friar Sand in the lamplight to guard the master
When he leapt happily out of the abbot's lodgings and went back to the Buddha Hall he looked and saw that though there were stars in the Journey to the West sky the moon had not yet risen and it was dark inside the hall
He breathed out some of his magic fire to light the glazed lamp then beat the drum that stood to the East and struck the bell to the West
That done he shook himself and turned himself into a young lama of only eleven or twelve who was wearing a yellow silk shirt and a white cotton tunic striking a wooden fish with his hand as he recited a sutra
He waited till the first watch without seeing anything happen
The waning moon rose only in the second watch Then a roaring wind could be heard
It was a splendid wind Black mists cast the sky into darkness Gloomy clouds cover the earth with murk
Inky black in every quarter All enveloped in indigo
At first the wind raises dust and dirt Then it blows down trees and ravages woods
Amid the dust and dirt the stars still shine When trees go down and woods are ravaged the moonlight is obscured
It blows so hard the Moon Goddess holds tight to the sala tree And the Jade Hare hunts all around for the medicine dish
The Nine Bright Shiner star lords shut their gates The dragon kings of the four seas close their doors
The city god in his temple looks for the little devils Immortals in the sky cannot ride their clouds
The kings of the Underworld search for their horsefaced demons While the panicking judges get their turbans in a tangle
The wind blows so hard it moves Mount Kunlun's rocks And churns up the waves on rivers and lakes
As soon as the wind had passed by there was a fragrance of musk and incense and the tinkling of pendants
When Monkey looked up he saw that a woman of great beauty was going towards the Buddha Hall
Monkey mumbled the words of a sutra for all he was worth
The woman went up to him put her arms around him and asked What's that sutra you're reciting Journey to the West One I vowed to said Monkey
But why are you still reciting it when the others are all asleep she insisted
I vowed to so why shouldn't I Monkey replied
Keeping a tight hold on him the woman kissed his lips and said Let's go round the back for a bit of fun Monkey deliberately turned his head aside as he replied Stop being so naughty Do you know how to tell people's fortunes from their faces the woman asked
I know a bit about it Monkey replied
What can you tell about me she continued
You look to me rather like someone who's been driven out by her parentsinlaw for carrying on with strangers You're wrong she replied you're wrong
I have not been driven out by my parentsinlaw Nor have I carried on with strangers
Because of my ill fate in an earlier life I was married to a husband who is much too young And can't do his staff in the candlelit bedroom That is the reason why I have left my husband
As the stars and moon are so bright tonight and we are fated to come hundreds of miles to meet each other let's go round to the garden at the back to make love When Brother Monkey heard this he nodded to himself and thought So those stupid lamas all died because they were led astray by lust
Now she's trying to lure me
Lady he said in reply I'm a monk and still very young
I don't know anything about lovemaking Come with me and I'll teach you the woman replied
All right then Monkey thought with an inward smile I'll go with her and see how she fixes things Shoulder nestling against shoulder and hand in hand the two of them left the Buddha Hall and went straight to the garden at the back
Here the monster tripped Monkey over and sent him to the ground
With wild calls of My darling she made a grab for his crotch
So you really want to eat me up my girl he said seizing her hand and throwing her off balance so that she somersaulted to the ground
Journey to the West So you can throw your sweetie to the ground can you my darling she said
If I don't take this chance to finish her off what am I waiting for he thought
As they say hit first and win strike second and lose He leaned forward with his hands on his hips sprang to his feet and reverted to his own form
With a swing of his goldbanded iron cudgel he struck at the monster's head
In her astonishment she thought What a terror this young monk is When she opened her eyes wide for a better look she realized that he was the Tang Priest's disciple Monkey but she was not afraid of him
What sort of evil spirit was she you may wonder A golden nose Snowy white fur
She makes her home in a tunnel Where she is thoroughly safe
Three hundred years ago after training her vital forces She paid several visits to the Vulture Peak Carrying a full load of flowers and wax candles Tathagata sent her down from Heaven
She was a beloved daughter to the Pagodacarrying Heavenly King Prince Nezha treated her as his own sister
She was no bird that fills up the sea Nor was she a tortoise carrying mountains on its back
She did not fear Lei Huan's swords Nor was she afraid of Lu Qian's blade
She came and went Flowing like the mighty Han and Yangtse Moved up and down Even up a peak as high as Mounts Taishan and Heng
Seeing the charming beauty of her face You would never know she was a mousespirit with great powers
Journey to the West In the pride in her enormous magic powers she held up a pair of swords that rang out as she parried to left and right moving East and West
Although Monkey was rather stronger he could not overpower her
Then magic winds arose on all sides dimming the waning moon
It was fine battle they fought in the garden at the back Evil winds blew from the ground Dim was the light of the waning moon
Deserted was the hall of the Brahma Kings And the devils' cloister could not be clearly seen
The back garden saw a battle Between the warrior Sun A sage in Heaven And the furry girl A queen among women Both competing in magical powers and refusing to submit
One turned her heart in anger from the darkskinned baldy The other glared with his allseeing eyes at the finely dressed woman
With swords in her hands She is no female Bodhisattva
The blows of the cudgel Were as fierce as a living vajrapani's
The resounding golden band flashed like lightning For an instant the iron shone white as a star
In fine buildings they grabbed at the precious jade In golden halls the mandarin duck figurines were smashed
As the apes howled the moon seemed small Vast was the sky as wild geese called
The eighteen arhats Applauded in secret Journey to the West Each of the thirtytwo devas Was struck with panic
The Great Sage Monkey was in such high spirits that his cudgel never missed
Realizing that she was no match for him the evil spirit frowned suddenly and thought of a plan as she extricated herself and made off Where do you think you're going you baggage Monkey shouted
Surrender at once The evil spirit paid no attention and fled
When she was hardpressed by Monkey's pursuit she took the embroidered shoe off her left foot blew on it with a magic breath said the words of a spell called out Change and turned it into a likeness of herself that came back at him waving a pair of swords
Meanwhile she turned her real body with a shake into a pure breeze and went
This was Sanzang's star of disaster
She headed straight for the abbot's quarters lifted Sanzang up into a cloud and on the instant before anyone could see anything she was back at Mount Pitfall and inside the Bottomless Cave where she told her underlings to prepare a vegetarian marriage feast
The story switches back to Brother Monkey who fought with desperate anxiety until he was able to seize an opening and smash the evil spirit to the ground with a single blow only to find that she was in fact an embroidered shoe
Realizing that he had fallen for a trick he went straight back to see the master But was the master there
There were only the idiot and Friar Sand muttering together
His chest bursting with fury Monkey put all thought of what he ought to do out of his head and raised his cudgel to lay about him I'll kill the pair of you he shouted I'll kill the pair of you The idiot was desperate but there was no way for him to escape
Friar Sand however as a general from the magic mountain who had seen a great deal adopted a very mild and conciliatory approach when he stepped forward knelt down and said Elder brother I understand I'm sure that after you've killed us two you intend to go straight back home instead of rescuing the master When I've killed you two I'm going to rescue him myself Monkey retorted
How can you say that replied Friar Sand with a smile
Without us two it would be a case of You can't spin a thread from only one strand Or clap with the palm of a single hand
Who'd look after the luggage or the horse for you
We'd do much better to forget our differences and fight side by side like Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya than to have a battle of wits like Sun Bin and Pang Juan
As the old saying goes Journey to the West To kill a tiger you need your brothers' help Have fathers and sons fight together in battle
I hope you will spare us brother so that tomorrow morning we can all work together with a single mind in our search for the master Although his magical powers were tremendous Monkey knew what was right and needed at the time so that Friar Sand's entreaties made him change his mind
Get up Pig and Friar Sand he said
But when we hunt for the master tomorrow you'll have to make a real effort The idiot was so grateful at being let off that he would gladly have promised Monkey half the sky
Brother Friar Sand said leave it all to me The three brother disciples were so anxious that none of them could sleep They wished they could make the sun rise in the East with a nod of the head and blow all the stars out of the sky with a single breath
After sitting there till dawn the three of them packed up and were about to get out only to find the gateway barred by one of the lamas who asked Where are you going gentlemen This is most embarrassing Monkey replied with a smile
Yesterday I boasted to all the monks that I'd capture the evil spirit for them So far from me capturing her she's made my master disappear
We're off to look for him My lord said the lamas with horror our trivial problem has got your master involved
Where will you look for him I know where I'll look Monkey replied
Even though you're going please don't be in such a hurry said the lamas
Have some breakfast first Two or three bowls of hot gruel were brought in that Pig cleaned up with great gusto What fine monks he said
When we've found the master we'll come back here to see you again What you mean is come back to eat their food said Monkey
Go and see if the girl is still in the devarajas' hall She's gone my lord the lamas said she's gone
She has spent only one night there and is gone the next morning Monkey cheerfully took his leave of the lamas and made Pig and Friar Sand lead the horse and carry the luggage as they headed back East
Brother said Pig you're wrong Why are we going East You wouldn't know said Monkey
That girl who was tied up in the Black Pine Forest the other dayI saw through her with my fiery eyes and golden pupils but you all thought she was a good person
And now it's her who's eaten the monks and her who's carried the master off
You all did a fine thing rescuing that 'lady Bodhisattva'
As she's carried the master off we're going back the way we came to look for her Good good sighed the other two with admiration You're much cleverer than you look
Let's go Journey to the West The three of them hurried back into the forest where this was what could be seen Piles of cloud Heavy mists Many a layer of rock A twisting path
The tracks of foxes and hares cross each other Tiger leopard jackal and wolf move in and out of the undergrowth
With no sign of a monster to be seen in the wood They do not know where Sanzang might be found
In his anxiety Monkey pulled out his cudgel shook himself and made himself look as he had when he made great havoc in Heaven with three heads six arms and six hands wielding three cudgels With these he lashed out furiously and noisily among the trees
Friar Sand said Pig when he saw this not finding the master has made him go off his head In fact Monkey had beat a way through the trees and flushed out two old menthe mountain god and the local deitywho went up to him knelt down and said Great Sage the god of this mountain and the local deity pay their respects That rod certainly gets results said Pig
He clears a path with it and flushes out the mountain god and the local deity
If he cleared another path he'd even flush out an evil star Mountain god local deity said Monkey you're a disgrace
You're hand in glove with the bandits here When they make a good haul they buy pigs and sheep to sacrifice to you On top of that you're accomplices of the evil spirit You helped her kidnap my master and bring him here
Where's he being hidden
If you want to be spared a beating tell me the truth right now Great Sage the two gods said with alarm you are misjudging us
The evil spirit doesn't live on our mountain or come within our jurisdiction
But when the wind blows at night we have heard a thing or two about her Tell me everything you know said Monkey
The evil spirit carried your master off to a place over three hundred miles due South of here the local deity replied
There's a mountain there called Mount Pitfall with a cave in it called the Bottomless Cave
He was taken there by a disguised evil spirit from that cave This news gave Monkey a shock that he did not reveal
Shouting at the mountain god and the local deity to dismiss them he put his magical appearance away turned back into himself and said to Pig and Friar Sand The master's a long way from here Journey to the West If it's a long way let's go there by cloud Pig replied
The splendid idiot went ahead on a wild wind followed by Friar Sand on a cloud
As the white horse had originally been a dragon's son he too came by wind and mist as he carried the luggage on his back
The Great Sage set off by somersault as he headed due South and before long a high mountain came into view that was blocking the way for the clouds
The three of them took hold of the horse and stopped their clouds
This is what the mountain looked like The summit touched the azure sky Its peaks joined with the blue of the heavens
Trees by the million grew on every side While flying birds sung noisily all around
Tigers and leopards moved in packs Water deer and roebuck walked through the bushes
On the Southern slopes rare flowers bloomed fragrant On the Northern side the snow never melted
Steep and craggy were its ridges Sheer were its overhangs and rockfaces
Pinnacles shot straight up And deep ravines curved all around
It was dark green among the pines And the rocks were jagged It struck fear into the traveler's heart
No sign could be seen of woodcutters And the immortal boys picking herbs had vanished
The tigers and leopards here could make mists And all the foxes set winds roaring
Journey to the West Brother said Pig this mountain's so high and sheer there must be evil on it Goes without saying Monkey replied
High mountains all have monsters there's never a steep ridge without spirits
Friar Sand he called you and I are going to stay here while we send Pig into the mountain hollows to look around and find out the best way for us to take If there really is a cave palace he must discover where the entrance is
Find everything out so that we can go in together to find the master and rescue him Just my lousy luck said Pig having to go first and take the brunt Last night you said we could leave it all to you Monkey replied so why are you trying to get out of it now Stop shouting at me Pig said
I'm going The idiot put down his rake tugged at his clothes and leapt emptyhanded down from the mountain to find the path
If you don't know whether this departure was to be for good or ill listen to the explanation in the next installment
