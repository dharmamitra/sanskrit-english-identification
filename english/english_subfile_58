That is the Dharma that the supreme human teaches Yet when these conditions are present and the seed is ceasing the sprout formsThrough the name power sovereignty and might of the great king Dhṛtarāṣṭra may I be free of all grahas and misfortunesand teach it to othersThe gods showered a cooling rain of flowersWhy should the bodhisattvas meditate on it Because it brings the attainment of omniscient wisdomRather bodhisattvas minds cause all beings to put down their loadsAnd its outer form will remain for the same length of timeJust like the dharmas so are sentient beingsBut within the nature of the realm of phenomena there is no afflictionI accurately understood the precise identity of suffering the source of suffering the cessation of suffering and the path leading to its cessationActing in perfect accordance with his words his unerring statements were always genuineThe cloud satiates them allwill cure aches and painsNakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña it is like the way that the stream entrants the oncereturners the nonreturners the arhats and pratyekabuddhas have transcended all ordinary foolish beingsBhagavat when you teach what I request the devas gain unwavering faithThe planets the moon the stars and the sun may fall from the sky to the groundSo with shame and embarrassment they now bowed to the feet of the SageGreat King Prince Sarvārthasiddhas eyelashes are like those of a bullThe monk patricide then told his wards Venerables construct a sweatchamber for the saṅgha and for meVenerable Lord This transcendent perfection of wisdom is profound hard to discern and hard to realizeThey act for the welfare of all realms of sentient beingsThis is the common mantra of the oblation offeringFor immeasurable hundreds of thousands of eonsnanda it is even said that I am a nihilist or that I am an eternalistAs soon as the Bhagavān placed his right hand upon Candraprabhas head in that very instantEven the darkest regions of the world filled with negativity and obscurity where even the renowned great power and magical ability of the sun and the moon are unable to produce light colors or heat were bathed in light In those realms the unfortunate beings normally cannot even see their own hands But even there the dazzling light shoneWithout understanding that the wrathful dances And the seals are merely an illusory displayAs King uddhodana had such love for the Bodhisattva and wanted to please himIf you ask why these phenomena up to and including unconditioned phenomena are neither fettered nor liberated because they are themselves nonexistent because they are themselves void because they are themselves nonarising because they are themselves unceasing because they are themselves not fettered and because they are themselves not liberatedConsider the assembly of bodhisattvasIf I see him now I will beg his forgivenessThe brahmin Tiṣyas time came as did ārikāsAnd to those who with hands in homage upon their head Are searching for the state of omnisciencethey were skilled in the knowledge of the higher and lower capabilities of all beingsso it is that they correctly perceive the real nature of perceptionssaid to that complete saṅgha of bhikṣusMañjuśrī when is one a beginner bodhisattvaThis occurs in an instantBecause he is endowed with the great strength of NārāyaṇaI shall name this prince Bimbisāra Essence of GoldIf they are endowed with such cognitionand so they may sayit is inseparable from the true nature the limit of reality and the essence of phenomenaSince the eyes are nonapprehensible it follows that socalled eyes are nothing but a mere name or conventional termWhen these conditions cease to exist it also ceasesThese flowers are proper indeedThe lord can even grant the rulership of the three worldsWhen this occurred the monks made them too wait seven or eight days and so some left without having been allowed to go forthHaving placed it in a vessel with the blood dripping kañcu One places it in a red earthen vesselThe aspect of awakening of complete joy is a gateway to the light of the DharmaIf your stream of being keeps samaya vows as your pledge You will be liberated through attributesAlthough he sees the king surrounded by his courtnanda you should remain in equanimity with regard to the deeds of the bodhisattvasWith seven they are greatThe aggregates elements and sense mediaHaving entered the Kurukullā mountain It rouses Tārā and as she is summoned She is made to be present before oneselfThey see millions of buddhas As numerous as the Ganges sands āradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving the sensory element of the mental faculty the sensory element of mental phenomena and the sensory element of mental consciousness as entitiesand having even refined the buddhafields they will swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentYou outshine everyone and transcend the desirous path of the three realmsFrom above the lion throne within the great lotus of gems and jewels ten innumerable quintillions of light rays now issued forthThose gandharva maidens remember the name of Bodhisattva

the presence of a noble being so I ask you please introduce me to a monkwouldnt this cause them to engage in or identify with erroneous viewsSimilarly when these are dedicated toward omniscience in an uncreated manner and without apprehending anythingWhat is meant by its being realized by those who have the ten strengths It means that it is an arduous practiceThey do not preoccupy themselves with the talk of towns cities villages markets and palace circlesThe Bhagavān was dwelling in Anāthapiṇḍadas park in the Jeta Grove in rāvastī along with a large monastic assemblyYoung man at that time King rīghoṣa made a request to that great assembly of bodhisattvasSubhūti the Bodhisattva Maitreya having attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentTheir voice is deep like the trumpet of an elephant or the rolling of thunderHomage to you Buddha powerfulThe face of the Bodhisattva however remained as pure and stainless as the orb of the full moon when it escapes the mouth of Rāhubut they do not apprehend any of those thingsKauśika great bodhisattva beings should train accordingly in the transcendent perfection of wisdomhe will nevertheless teach the Dharma in accordance with his previous prayersChandas eyes filled with tears as he spoke to his masterThat is called the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor endWhen he acquires grass and travels to the seat of awakening And as he conquers the demons and gains awakeningWith many eyes and half a body With one eye and twelve stomachsIn the same vein he will not teach the sacred doctrine according to the notions that all other attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are utterly pure or that they are not utterly pureLet him follow the learned one who masters disciplined conductin the same vein they do not apprehend all the other designations concerning physical forms up to and including the designation of physical forms as nonentitiesGreat King Prince Sarvārthasiddhas hair is deep blue like the neck of a peacock or kohl powder and curls to the rightLikewise wherever the element of consciousness is transferred to and migratesyou have crushed the assault of the enemyAlso the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas who will emerge in the future along with their monastic assemblies of śrāvakasVenerable Lord Great bodhisattva beings of the present who are limitless in number residing in the innumerable countless and limitless world systems of the ten directions having trained in this supreme vehicle the Great Vehicle currently acquire omnisciencesome mansions were made of combinations of gold silver beryl crystal red pearl coral and emeraldRatnavara at that time thought to himself   tthey will all dispel that condition of being a woman suffering unhappiness and afflictionsMonks while the god in this way was encouraging the Bodhisattva a dream occurred to King uddhodanaIn the presence of the protector of the worldhave led to his abandoning all disturbing emotions actualizing arhatship and inspiring such a massive conversionContemplating repulsiveness serves as the remedy for desireThey will always be mindful and gentle And have the patience of a sugatas childThen the gods of the sky approached the ThusGone OneAh You have divine vision and are wise and adept in wisdomThey do not seek buddhahood that has great power They do not search for the Dharma that ends suffering The aspectless is explained as the gate to liberation of the samādhi of nosigntAccording to our understanding of what the Blessed One has said anyone who does not set out toward unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening will not manifest out of the absorption that encapsulates all meritThey will know that even though such individuals abide therein they will continue to bring sentient beings to maturity to honor sentient beings with everything that actualizes their happinessthe court scribe said You should go and look for himIn a similar way the entire retinue present could see the buddha realms in all ten directionsBhadrapāla then said to MahauṣadhiIn his mind the Blessed One knew the bodhisattvas wish and so spoke to the bodhisattva Vyūharāja sayingWhoever has brought this ignorance to a halt Has exhausted all forms of existence for goodThis was the seventh chapter on the wheel of expulsion from The Tantra of the Vajra in the UnderworldThis girl that I offer you Grants all the pleasures of loveand the inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of apprehensions concerning purification Those are the fourneither

down to that good man they made the wish May all living beings attain eloquence such as thisdie among humans and are reborn among humansMoreover Subhūti great bodhisattva beings should be equipoised in the attitude of loving kindnessāradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings who have cultivated the mind endowed with omniscience give inner or outer objects to those who desire themWhen the Guide came to that supreme city And placed his supreme foot upon the gateways thresholdVenerable Lord If enlightenment itself is the path and the path itself is enlightenmentAnd will spend his time happily at ease Until awakening to the state of cool reposeāradvatīputra just as the utter purity of the applications of mindfulness is without foundationHaving here relinquished pleasure and having earlier already abandoned pain mental pleasure and mental displeasure now fade away There is the meditative stability named Unseeking  There is the meditative stability named No Fixed AbodeAfter two or three days of teaching him how Dharma practitioners conduct themselvesThe wise do not argue with fools They politely avoid themand similarly that the designations of the ears the nose the tongue the body and the mental faculty do not constitute a bodhisattvaThey cannot cultivate the transcendent perfection of generosity and similarly they cannot cultivate the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdomWe are going outside the townTheir bearers are the six superknowledgesdoes space abide in the eyeHis body is unshakable and indestructible like NārāyaṇasThey discern that physical forms are void and do not focus on themQuick get up You must depart without delayArranged in different places were dancers and performers skilled in performing divine songs dance and musicThose humans who are indifferent To their bodies which are like lumps of foamYoung man on hearing this King Mahābala was pleased delighted joyful inspired and happyWhenever they teach the Dharma to anyone the devas hearing the beautiful

who sees the truthThe bodhisattvas there will enjoy various Dharma delights Dharma liberations concentrations absorptions attainments and miraculous manifestationsand likewise when they engage in union with the emptiness of sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena they are said to engage in union with the transcendent perfection of wisdomI pay homage to you a loving friend of beings who benefits othersHe is endowed with all supreme aspects and therefore is known as the one who has purified the surface of the mirror of wisdomAfter the preceptor had allowed the nāgas going forth

explained by the godsThe bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya and the many hundred thousands of quintillions of bodhisattvas were then astonished and amazedWhat wise ones on seeing this Would hold fast to their body Merely through a mental wishIf someone should request a teaching they will not respond with deceptive statementsHis head is all gray his teeth are few and far between and his body is so

Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin rejoiced as did the other bodhisattvas the great hearers akra Brahmā the guardians of the world Maheśvara the gods of the pure abodes and the other millions of godsAgain he sat for a bit before saying Father open the doorHe prostrated touching his head to the Bodhisattvas feetTo benefit beings for six years you underwent hardshipand henceforth not remain in either nihilism or eternalismSimilarly they should cultivate the four correct exertions the four supports for miraculous ability the five faculties the five powers the seven branches of enlightenment the noble

badly to dharmabhāṇakas who hold this sūtra be they laypeople or renunciants and whether what is said be true or not the bad karma will be much more dreadful than if a being with an angry mind an evil mind and a wrathful mind were to speak badly to the Tathāgata to his face for an entire eonsome have four clairvoyancesFollowing the Bodhisattva were eighty thousand chariots beautifully outfitted with lattices of golden bells and with parasols victory banners and flags hoistedWhen both are seen to resemble an illusory spirit there is no bodhisattva spirit nor any disciple spiritOut of concept

revealTherefore nanda have trust and understand it to be soāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of fundamental ignorance and in the same vein of all the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death as arising or ceasing constitute a bodhisattvaThey cannot be harmed in any way and attain unwavering strengthit is the termination of concepts from analysisHe repeats this a second and a third time but the third time he says preceptor in place of masterThe Bhagavān was residing at Vulture Peak Mountain in Rājagṛha together with a great bhikṣu saṅgha of a full hundred thousand bhikṣusMonks King uddhodana both saw and heard that the Bodhisattva had been inspired in these waysSince sentient beings are nonapprehensible nothing is designated as a sentient beingVenerable Lord Why is the purity of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness due to the purity of the selfāradvatīputra just as the notion of a tathāgata arhat and completely perfect buddha engaging in the emptiness of internal phenomena is without foundationwho brings freedom from fearHe overcame his opponents attacksāriputra those sons and daughters of

perfect buddhahoodsome of whom engage in generosity some in ethical discipline some in tolerance some in perseverance some in meditative concentration and some in wisdomThen there was a certain monk present within the assembly who thoughtI would of course also bear with ordinary types of sufferingInfuriated some hurled iron balls the size of Mount Meru As well as blazing mountain peaksBeing free from such fears they will also not have any fears anxieties or qualms about staying in the wilderness and so they will turn toward complete solitudeor the sun rising in the early dawn or a golden

virtuous and nonvirtuous conduct that it is called consciousnessthey don the armor of great compassionMañjuśrī let us take these many living beings into the presence of the Lord so that they may see the Tathāgata and bow down to himThe bodhisattva knowing emptiness Has no attachment to saṃsāraThe bodys awareness and its elements of tasteSimilarly the real nature of the ears nose tongue body and mental faculty is one and the same real nature as the real nature of omniscience They are not two but indivisibleThis will remove all diseasesplease give your aid to the bodhisattva great beingsOn this day my wishes have been fulfilledEach of these rivers has five hundred tributariesThe awareness is explained as engaging in the sameness of the three times with respect to all dharmasThe flowers scattered by humans for the Jina Formed a parasol of flowers in the skyhe is ungraspableWith the assembly of yakṣas and rākṣasas in attendance The four guardians of the world who possess great magical powerWith the welfare of sentient beings comes the accumulation of merit And from that accumulation complete enlightenmentWhere did the previous thusgone ones sit when they attained unsurpassed genuine and perfect awakeningThey will be reborn thereinAlways make offerings to the Sugata And this supreme samādhi will soon be attained Just as the real nature of the Tathāgata is undifferentiated nonparticular and without dualityHolding great numbers of perfect precious flowers And bowed down at the Sugatas feet iIt is the pleasure grove of bodhisattvas It is that which terrifies the mārasThen the Tathāgata the arhat the Samyaksaṃbuddha Amitābha said to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara with a voice as beautiful as a cuckoos songowing to the emptiness of all intrinsic defining characteristicsAs he was before so he is afterward Know that all phenomena are like that like the sound of an echoand causes entry into the path to the vision of the tathāgatas wisdomthe limit of the future and the intervening present are nonapprehensiblebut those deities do not bring liberationtThe Blessed One said to the venerable great MaudgalyāyanaMay you ferry across all those wallowing in the ocean of existenceEndowed with mindfulness concerning subsidiary afflictions thorough afflictions and complete afflictionsThey enjoyed all the superknowledges of the bodhisattvas and had attained all the dhāraṇīs and all the confidence of the bodhisattvasthere were to exist an indication of phenomena even for only the duration of a fingersnapO Green Acala hū phaṭand likewise the gods of the

equanimity with mindfulness and introspection and experienced physical pleasure Aware and cognizant he felt physically at easeSo long will all virtuous attributes that should be cultivated be perfectedThese are contaminated phenomenaThey must not hold grudgesLife is better for the livingI shall command the Four Great Kings and the host of yakṣas together with their retinues to guard protect and shield this teachingThey teach this peace this samādhi And are invincible and irreproachable Noble one Have you found such a store of qualitiesThus without any doubts or reservations they trust in the secret of the thusgone ones mindand their vanishing that he praised esteemed honored and extolledThe crowns of gods brush your feet Abandoning home aspiring to mendicancy Finding no joy in the three realms having no graspingSimilarly they do not consider whether or not they engage in union with sufferingIt is like the head of a viper or a fire pitthat much I have realizedIt is finding no joy in the three realms It is having a motivation that is not discouragedMay all sentient beings animate and inanimate be well here May they pay homage to the Saṅgha The supreme assembly venerated by gods and men May there be wellbeing here todayIf we are to do such a thing then you should determine which girl would be a suitable match for the princeit is because emptiness does not set in motion or reverse anything at allSimilarly if they engage with the notion that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness arise or that these are nonarising then they are merely engaging with mental imagesAwakening Mañjuśrī is to be at peace utterly at peaceTherefore one who wishes for the peace of enlightenment Should abandon every kind of bad action He is called the source of the precious Dharma because he has perfected all the precious teachings that lead to awakeningto perceive the elements as though they were poisonous snakesThis person in saffroncolored robes is a renunciant so he is no threat to usThe substances absorptions and meditationsAt that time there was a temple called Snow Templekinnaraswhenever the gods of the heaven of the ThirtyThree are being defeatedyet relatively they consciously take up existencepūtanas kaṭapūtanas and pāṃśukūla piśācas also see methe same goes for the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdomInside the bow one should draw a jewelshaped lotusbudAnd he then spoke to the vast gatheringas well as those who wish to meditate on the ten powers of the tathāgatas and the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas should all train exclusively in the transcendent perfection of wisdomThose who have a nonmaterialistic motivation And teach the nonmaterial DharmaIt is likewise that the element of consciousness takes on attention and assumes feelinghe will not be stained by the faults of existenceHaving put in the mouth the transformed mustard fruitThey were dedicated to the practices of a bodhisattva which means they were dedicated to the perfection of generosity the perfection of good conduct the perfection of patience the perfection of diligence the perfection of meditation the perfection of wisdom and the perfection of skillful method love compassion rejoicing equanimity and the thirtyseven factors for enlightenmentParasols were carried by the buddhas of one hundred billion realmsWithin six months one will become in reality Equal to VāgīśvaraNor does the wind element think I perform the function of the bodys inhalation and exhalationthey do not apprehend and do not consider physical formshe felt satisfied delighted and elatedThis concludes the chapter on dependent origination sixteenth in the glorious tantra of Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa called The Sole HeroHaving overcome the demons they bring down a rain of wealthFather Mother it is not good for me to live at home It is good for me to go forthManifestly perfect buddhahood has not been attained by anyoneSelfOriginated Blissful One in infinite places we prostrate to youWhen the seed element is given off to develop into another treeThey abide by not abiding within any abodesAlong with her army and retinue she had been present in the gathered assembly but now she rose up to leave for her homeFrom the four of right left above and below Emerges space the fifthAll those beautiful and delightful sounds Cannot equal a hundredth of the Buddhas voice Thus bodhisattvas are vessels of jewelsWhy are they called soand I will repeat the Dharma teaching correctlywhat then Blessed One is consciousnessSince the time has now come for the Blessed One to pass into parinirvāṇa may the Blessed One pass into parinirvāṇa May the BlissGone One pass into parinirvāṇaThen in their last lives in the same instant the same moment the same second they will attain the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood each in their own buddha realm among the worlds in the ten directionsSimilarly They can see sentient beings in the world systems of all the ten directions numerous as the sands of the River Ganges according to the past deeds they have accumulatedDivine son if bodhisattva great beings did not apply themselves to the truths of the noble onesThe fourth Dharma gate that he manifested is called the great array It accomplishes the unique strength of the accumulation of wisdom which ascertains the meaning of the different categories related to all the factors of awakeningTherefore in this Sahā world realm he is known as He Who Gives Freedom From FearSo it isIf you ask what is the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities it too is the absence of any essential nature in anything originating from combinations of causes and conditionsMake offerings always to the Jinas stūpas And this supreme samādhi will soon be attained you also taught the queens and your sonSihavikrīḍitaOn the relative level the applications of mindfulness are a gateway to not letting any roots of virtue diminishThat is it That is it Subhūti It is just as you have saidThus they do not practice with a mind that is confined to duality but with a mind that is equally there for all sentient beings a mind that practices by taking all sentient beings into accountIf a man is being attacked by bandits And wishing to save his life he tries to run awayLord this sexual union Can increase and vitalize The semen menstrual blood penis vagina and breastsThe gods in all directions together with the nāgas yakṣas and gandharvas said to each otherVenerable Lord This transcendent perfection of wisdom is profoundVajrafierce very angryThere are some monks and priests who are unable to separate their mind and body from the objects of their desireThese are not humans I think they must be godsNoble son this is an essence like riceOnce I do so I will proceed to the seat of awakeningThen they contemplated human existence They thought about saṃsāric existence in this wayShould we take hold of all the lands of the trichiliocosm All the myriad hundreds of thousands of subterranean bodies of water And all the myriad livelihoods of beings in those placesThereafter through the unfolding of the links of dependent origination they should be attentive to the origination of the entire great mass of sufferingIgnoble desires are condemned by the wise onesSome mansions were made of goldI will do so no matter whatVenerable āradvatīputra if there were a mind to be observed inside outside or in between then there could also be a liberated mindHe should find a companion bhikṣuOr otherwise should recollect the BuddhaAnd do not act with deception toward the guru That is what is called the supreme restraint of the mind Then Akṣayamati said to the BhagavānThese phenomena optical illusionsThe nature of the mental faculty is emptiness Emptiness is the mental facultycoralSukhakarī She Who Causes HappinessYou are not able to go even one krośa Without having to take a stepSome placed their ten fingers together in homage And they cried Oh the Jina compassionate one Divine son ultimately all phenomena are utter wishlessnessholding a white lotus in her left handWhoever has discipline also has insight from the ordinary wealth of the populace they obtain what is essentialliving in a celestial mansion with a retinue of hundreds of thousands apsaras gracing himThis concludes the chapter on deity practice twentyfifth in the glorious Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa tantra called The Sole HeroThen the Bhagavān with the fingers of his right hand opened the center of the great precious stūpa that was floating in the airWhat are these four Suffering the origin of suffering the cessation of suffering and the path that leads to the cessation of sufferingthese sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage will have been totally consecrated in the understanding that all things up to and including omniscience are emptinessNoble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities are engaged in yogic practice This is the excellent doorway of the way of logic The subtle difficulttosee realm of experience of the jinasIn the northeast draw darkgreen Envy Vajrī So one should draw the canvasmaṇḍalaAnd eight thousand living beings purified their eyes of Dharma regarding phenomena so that they became cleared of

unsuccessful one should do it for the third timeone will oneself behold the lord in a dream and show him to others tooshould commit this transcendent perfection of wisdom to writing or have it committed to writingThey liberate these beings from rebirths as hell beings animals and beings born in Yamas world and from existences deprived of the eight freedoms as well as from negative rebirths

meritsInside this second temple hovered an identical third structure which also did not touch the second structureVenerable Lord When you say that great bodhisattva beings who continue to engage in union with the transcendent perfection of wisdom deserve respectTherefore relatively one speaks of possessing knowledge even though that knowledge is ultimately utterly unbornWithout attachment they

who have excellent correct conductVenerable Lord if the notion of sights as with signs is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of sights as signless become a bodhisattvaHe will have innumerable countless hundred thousand quintillions of bodhisattvasMoreover he already has many sons It is not proper for the Bodhisattva to be conceived in this familyPlease quickly establish in the happiness of nirvāṇa The beings touched by diseases who have suffered for so long By dispensing the medicine of DharmaIn the terrifying age of destruction They will undergo hardshipMahauṣadhi replied the Blessed One it is as follows Suppose a hunter went into a dense forest and drew his bowVenerable Lord If all things are signless free from recollection and free from attentionor it enables one to

TakṣakaWe should go into the four directionsGreat King it is therefore certain that the Bodhisattva will awaken to unexcelled perfect and complete buddhahoodHe should avoid association With those who will kill various creaturesEmpowered through the arrow and the other three The disciple has been made a vessel for the DharmaGreat bodhisattva beings who practice accordingly should perfect

buddhahood so every day you must come to this very place and take your meal before returninghas no attachment to any entity and despite designating conventional things with all sorts of termsāradvatīputra is called the transcendent perfection of mundane generosityThe Bodhisattva accepted these meals but he also gradually began to go on alms rounds in the local village In this way he regained his previous luster appearance and strengthwobbled rocked and swayed vibrated shuddered and reeledIt is so Great BrahmāOnly one who is himself a bodhisattva can harass another bodhisattva andNow you should keep this teaching with you and teach it elaborately to othersAlthough they may be revealed according to the conventional ways of the worldYou are neither pompous nor timidIn your seven incarnations as a manI will answer your questions and bring satisfaction to your mindThe Bhagavān previously turned the wheel of Dharma in the ṣipatana deer forest in the land of VārāṇasīIf the saṅgha were to permit this action I would ask the venerables who can allow it to please remain silentand others who are as numerous as the sands of the river Ganges pervade their own buddha realms with the power of their speech and proclaim You should place your trust in this Dharma discourse called Complete Embrace by all Buddhas which praises inconceivable qualitiesThen King uddhodana went to his home and spoke to Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī sayingif a follower of another tīrthika order wishing to go forth approaches any one of youIf someone were thrown by a murderer Off the summit of Meru in order to be killedAll the area was decorated by the clothing of Tuṣita devasyet those who are generous cannotProstrations to the bodhisattva of the southwest Sūryaprabha  tHe is well versed in the various conditions of beings their intentions and their conduct Thus he seeks to free from taking rebirth in hell or as animals hungry ghosts or in the world of Yama all those beings who are tormented by the diseases of desire hatred and bewilderment and by the sicknesses of the fundamental and secondary defilements as well as those obscured by pride vanity and arrogance or by attachment suffering fear and anger To this end by using various skillful means various practices various states of concentration and supernatural powers he brings beings to all stages of liberationOn seeing it he thinks I shall go and speak to the kingundiminished insight undiminished liberationOne should also eat her vomit And her excretaHomage to all buddhas and bodhisattvasHis saṃbhogakāya consists in the fact that he comes forth just like a cloudGiving away crest jewels and crowns represents the bodhisattvas achievement of the unseen crown of the headteinote xmlidUT ThereforeNoble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities abide within the absence of marksand then vanished that very instantThere you will quickly accomplish A great unsurpassable benefit for beings iiSo it is needless to say that I cannot do so all by myself in the realm of the asurasThey see all the buddhafields without even leaving their state of concentration and without being affected by dualityThat is the power of smell that they will acquire But they still will not have the divine sense of smellAt the same time they should not regard things as being similar or dissimilar even in the slightest degree since there are no such distinctions in the realm of phenomenaHe cannot be countedAlso when they are absorbed in compassion they focus on the nature of mind that directs compassion and love to all those beingsYou should give me what little you havefor as many eons as the number of grains of sand in the GangesThey never give rise to an aspiration to be A pratyekabuddha or śrāvakaAnd the bodhisattvas who settle in a buddhafield of such intense hardships must have inconceivably great compassionIf there were no sentient beings the bodhisattvas could not achieve complete buddhahoodI will definitely practice generosity by offering medicinethe samādhi named Creating UnionA rain of flowers a great fragrant rain fellSomeone who is classified as having Medium wisdom is said to be a pratyekajinaWhat constitutes their negativity of speech and what constitutes their negativity of mindThese childish beings are devoured like merchants consumed by demonessesThey maintain the discipline of correct conduct And they rejoice in seedlings of the tree of the DharmaMonks before I achieved perfect awakening and became a perfect buddha I went alone into the wildHomage to you heroic being Homage to you supreme beingHaving perfected an infinite wisdom They liberate an infinity of living beingsTherefore quickly turn your minds to either the śrāvaka vehicle or the pratyekabuddha vehicle and you will swiftly be definitively released from saṃsāraIn the same vein the abiding mode of the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline is mundane and its nonabiding mode is supramundaneThey should not dwell on the notion that I having attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and become a tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha should turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine Noble son it is like this As a comparison if it were to rain day and night on the four great continents for a twelvemonth year I could count each drop but noble son I cannot calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvaras accumulation of meritWho are these great many young boys who cry within the monasterys grounds at twilightwhile the long rainy season is one day shy of three monthsit is neither with signs nor is it signless it is neither mundane nor supramundaneThey see that all speech is like an echo Momentary and without substanceTherefore make offerings to the

throats and the great sound of their finger snaps shook all the hundreds of thousands of quintillions of buddha realms in the ten directionsand swiftly you will manifestly and completely awaken to unsurpassable perfectly complete enlightenmentIt fills the body like sesame seedsMay the people prosper And the king be in accord with the DharmaJust like space it is without characteristics That is

nonvirtue led him to be lacking in the mind of awakeningTo Dharmadhvaja you offered a robe and to Nirodha a handful of beansjust as I want no one to hurt me order someone to hurt me or rejoice in someone hurting me with harsh cruel insulting or defamatory wordsThis tīrthika has petitioned the saṅgha to allow him to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four monthsthese two great beings and their retinue of gods saddened and dejected disappeared then and thereOne of the young gods former wards an elder in the saṅgha and an arhat was seated in the meal rowAnd the son of the king protected him From the thousands of bhikṣus who were his adversaries all of them will have the name SamantaprabhāsaHe will be a jina with great miraculous powersThey will not deviate whatsoever from remembering the incalculable eonsWith a triumphant gait he now began the walk toward the great Bodhi tree This tree was the king of trees and was found at a place characterized by sixteen unique featuresThese qualities are also trained in by means of a mind that is free of resentment rivalry and harm and is expansive immeasurable and nondualSubhūti if the real nature were an entity and not a nonentity andThey who possess this supreme samādhi Do not praise themselves And never criticize othersI will give up my body and my life And whatever happiness there is in the worldThey know all actions yet

of wisdom And you declare it to be profound up to and including the narratives and the established instructions all originate from this transcendent perfection of wisdomAjita this is what a noble man or noble woman should knowIs located on the rightYou are untainted by mundane concerns Like a lotus floating on waterWhen five sages were coursing through the skyEven billions of māras cannot know The minds of those wise onesOnly one can defeat Māra With his sentinels troops and mountsDont you see these women with eyes like blooming lotuses Who are adorned with garlands of many precious gems Sparkling like a flash of lightning amid cloud banks in the sky So beautiful as they rest on their bedsam one who will not be reborn and I will attain final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where no residue of the psychophysical aggregates is left behindBodhisattvas are not like those who teach sweetly while thinking differentlyHe therefore addressed Rudraka with these wordsneither is it imbued with happiness nor is it imbued with sufferingAnd those who hear it are delighted and respectfulMahāsthāmaprāpta if you doubt are uncertain are unsure or are wondering who at that time on that occasion were the beings who disparaged and censured that bodhisattva mahāsattvaThey experience concentration and awakening sentient beings and thusgone ones all in a nondualistic wayand in the same vein Senior āradvatīputra the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities are nonexistent and nonapprehensibleIn the same vein Subhūtiothers with palaces were made of heaps of uragasāra sandalwoodThey perceive happiness as being like a dream perceive it as being impermanent like a dreamthey should reflect in the same vein as before Alas When I have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment in this buddhafield I will practice the six transcendent perfections until all sentient beings possess the thirtytwo major marks of a superior man and so on in the same vein as before down to they will also approach omniscienceMoreover nanda if those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage always maintain scrupulous conduct and make offeringsNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities have abundant faithBecause they heard the sacred Dharma of the Supreme Vehiclethis is to be relinquisheddelight means purity of mindIgnorant they will reject the Dharma that is taughtTheir gentle speech will be like the song of a goose And their voice will have the fifty aspects of speech Supremely devoted to embracing the Wisdom The natural mode is not in the accumulation of words This mode this nature does not dwell anywhereMoreover āradvatīputra the same also applies when great bodhisattva beings definitively cultivate in all respects the four applications of mindfulnessThey become worthy recipients of the donations of the whole world with its gods humans and antigodsNoble son in the world named Vivṛta you will be the Tathāgata the arhat the samyaksaṃbuddha perfect in wisdom and conduct the sugata the knower of the world the unsurpassable guide who tames beings the teacher of gods and humans the buddha the Bhagavat Bhasmeśvaraand if others did not comprehend it this would be harmful to methe lords of the rākṣasas and three hundred yakṣiṇīsI asked it Why are you laughingāradvatīputra do you think that the designation of physical forms as entities or nonentities constitutes a bodhisattvaand the good name of the Tathāgata will be celebrated far and wide recollection of deathIf someone is chained in iron fetters Or imprisoned in wooden stocksMahāsthāmaprāpta in the pastVajrapāṇi then said these wellspoken wordsNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities are skilled in the means of attractionThey will not speak unpleasant things about them nor will they have the concept of being their opponentIn this Sahā world realm there are my thousands of bodhisattvas who are as numerous as the grains of sand in sixty Ganges RiversThe gathering of yakṣas respondedSome great bodhisattva beings are not fixated on this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomSimilarly they should not dwell on the notion that the fruit of entering the stream is well distinguished by conditioned phenomena nor should they dwell on the notion that this fruit is well distinguished by unconditioned phenomenaIt must not be dividedQuick prepare twenty thousand elephants Dark blue like mountains or storm cloudsThe Jina knowing what they intended Taught this samādhi of peace that is difficult to seeAnd find fame and fortuneHowever he had not had his meal and therefore fasting for a fifth dayThey see that due to such causes such conditions and such bases their death due to the destruction of the body brings a passage to the joys of the higher realms where they are born among the godsAt that time those bhikṣus Will not even have those trainings Divine princes it is so It is just as you have spokenI rejoice in the virtues of wandering beingsthe pure nature is the dharmakāyaThey asked him Blessed One did Gautama fare happily during the unseasonable sevenday stormThe four mahārājas guard the four directionsAll these suffering beings have no protectorOne should drink two parts of the bark of ivory tree and one part

this worldStop all the wind and rainon being shown this precious gemstone immediately after seeing it their poison would vanishThese childish beings are confinedRegarding this there are also some concluding versesSimilarly Subhūti if individuals who have attained the level of eightfold acceptance and individuals who have entered the stream who are tied to one more rebirth who are no longer subject to rebirth who are arhats pratyekabuddhas bodhisattvas and genuinely perfect buddhas were entities and not nonentitiesWith a genuine and correct realization of the meaning they see realityThen this moon among men Rose slowly from his seatThey should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that The limit of my lifespan is inestimablebut one cannot say that he therefore knows phenomena on account of phenomenaWhatever does not conflict with the intrinsic nature is rationalAre not able to describe the ocean of qualities That the omniscient buddhas have In a later time there appeared in this world the Tathāgata the arhat the samyaksaṃbuddha the one with wisdom and conduct the sugata the knower of the world the unsurpassable guide who tamed beings the teacher of gods and humans the buddha the Bhagavat ikhinWere to contemplate this without a thought of anything else Even for them this would be beyond the scope of their knowledge He replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of malice and tolerancewhat are the aspects of the path on which they abide and through which they then swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentThey were beings of noble birth great elephants who had accomplished their tasks and completed their workThe monks asked the Blessed OneThus the wise ones at that time Gave much advice to that sovereignFor ten million eons they will practice bodhisattva conduct And make offerings to ten thousand million buddhasLikewise in the same vein it also understands all the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities without apprehending anythingGo invite them all into the palacetakes off his soft clean beautiful clothes puts on dirty clothesHis mind is peaceful and his actions are gentleTherefore reverend āriputra do not point to liberation by abandoning speechPāpīyān bodhisattvas are well known and acknowledged by gods and humans throughout the great trichiliocosm This is why bodhisattvas receive such propheciesSo alas do sickness and old age rob the vitality of beings And destroy their faculties bodies and strengthIs your sickness diminishingWith his senses still he has looked at the memorials of the thusgone ones with unblinking eyes He has made a firm resolve to inspire other beings to meet the ThusGone One and therefore he is the One with Deep Blue EyesMonks for bodhisattvas who have reached their last existence it is customary that the buddhas the blessed ones who dwell in the realms within the ten directions always come while these bodhisattvas amuse themselves in the female quarters and encourage them through singing and music to enter the gate of DharmaProstrations to all relicsWhat has no sign has no wishThey delight in those objects and feel attached to them long for them wish for them strive for them crave and thirst for them become senseless for them and are burned by them This striving after the objects of desire never brings peaceHe restored the perfect tree to its former gloryif they are not accepted by a spiritual mentorThe Hayagrīva chakra is concealed at the

there in his mind recited this verse to the BhagavānThe sound of conches and of paṇavas And the sound of bherī drums and kimpalasWhen this came up in conversationFor the sake of pleasures with their desire as the cause and basis they experience many forms of sufferingBlissful One that is amazingThey have respectfully placed their hands together How can we make our practice perfect They think of lack of perception as perceptionGentlemen the ocean is full of many terrorsThe Great ramaṇa is the one who thus proclaimsIf you ask what is the knowledge of the cessation of sufferingAt that point a brahmin who loved fire paid it homage and respectThis is compounded and that is uncompoundedVenerable Gautama these are spare seats If you like you may sitThen in order to discard the ordinary The mind must once more be emptiedand which is not shared in common with any śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhaswill teach this Dharma teaching while remaining in contact with happiness and being free of harm and will have companions with whom to chant the DharmaHere with the boat of tenacity I crossed the great ocean of cyclic existence With its crocodiles of passion and desire Its waves of craving and its grasping at wrong viewsThen Bodhisattva Mahāsattva rya Avalokiteśvara asked the BhagavānYour kinfolk the best of people may beat me and aska nonvirtuous spiritual friendIt is like an ancient well

capable of destroying Namuci singlehandedlyand become equipoised in meditative concentration while they lack skill in means and who cultivate wisdom while they lack skill in meansIn this way as the Bodhisattva proceeded on his way they besprinkled him with showers of flowers made of various jewels and praised him with these versesSo will be this accumulation of meritthey will not actualize the

smells tastes tactile sensations and the sphere of mentally cognized featuresName and form are pure owing to the purity of consciousnessIn the same vein one who wishes to attain emancipation in things without defining characteristics merely wishes to attain emancipation in the element of dispassion the element of cessation and the emptiness of physical forms andSaving them from all degeneration and shining with the light of insightYet when hearing this very sūtra a bodhisattva May form the wish to establish it well Either within his body or within a bookYoung man you should train by thinking I will practice completely pure physical conduct in that waymeditate on patiencethey will not see forms with their eyesVenerable Lord I do not in the slightest think that the sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas will ever regress from unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and become śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhasNoble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities keep their smiling faces free of angry frownswhich is the great secret of the buddhas which is concealed by all the buddhasThe nonforsaking of perseverance with regard to this attention endowed with omniscience is called the transcendent perfection of perseverance of great bodhisattva beings when they practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomWould be unable to move a single hair On that wise BodhisattvaAnd to liberate beings from the ocean of existenceFrom where have you come just nowMay you beat the kettledrum of the sublime DharmaHe is known as the person the great person the lion of a man the one who is not subject to fear and the thrill of excitementIf you ask why it is because physical forms are empty of physical formsThe word arhat and likewise the word Dharma And the word saṅgha also appeared at that time If you ask what it is in which they are not stableThey are the inconceivably numerous kinds of inner knowledge concerning the composite the inconceivably numerous kinds of inner knowledge concerning teaching the compositeThen Yamas guards will again seize themhe emerged from the capital city of Ratnāvatī and went to the stūpa that contained the fingernail of the BhagavānOne can break the spell by taking the splinters outEven those who entertain malicious thoughts find ill will unpleasant they do not wish for it do not like it and do not enjoy itWhile being within cyclic existence they should not train in such a way that perpetuates cyclic existenceFor the real nature of the noble eightfold path and so forthOne should grind the root of Indian sesbania blending it with rice waterthey know and see who has fallen who has flourished who hurtsSimilarly when a preparation Of gajapippalī and white butterfly pea Is smeared onto the penis together with freshly churned buffalo butter The penis will become healthy and strongTo this end by means of relative truth the skillful ones Manifest displays such as this one hereand he became skilled in removing himself from the shortcomings and faults of cyclic existenceThey should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that I should enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvasThey are called those who long for the Mahāyāna and they escape from the three realmswhich are like an echoBy understanding those phenomena which are conceptualized as names and symbols they will not become fixated on physical formsand although he is reborn he does not adhere to the continuation of sinHow does the Buddha ākyamuni teach the DharmaSeeing this as clearly as amalaki seeds placed in the palm of their handIt is because such bodhisattvas are to regard all modes of birth as unreliableThe rich man is always looking Through a round window at the manThis is the emptiness of inherent existencemake offerings to the blessed Vāgīśvara and to ones precious guruBecause of delusion one enters as the consciousness of a new beingIn

proceed into the animal realms or into the world of Yamaāradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings who maintain this union never entertain thoughts of miserlinessThey will pay homage to it bow before it and only then consider departing again for their own abodes the total consummation of the earth elementHe then thought of his mother and father from his previous life as a young nāgaākyamuni the most illustrious of great sages now beautifies all placesThose great leaders minds never waver As they give away their hands their feet their head and their kingdom for those of the Yama world as a being of the Yama world and so forthThus they stay clear of those who live in inappropriate places those who rely on and cultivate the spells of the Lokāyatas and those who cherish gain honor worship and venerationthe dispenser of generosity is without defining characteristicsWithout praising themselves or blaming others their discipline is excellentSome hold up their hand outstretched Others keep their hair in a braided knotAnd concealing their flaws The foolish ones departed In the past their practiceBut friends I would be acting without gratitude and it would be inappropriate if I were not now to achieve unexcelled perfect and complete awakeningThey replied Noble one our young nāgait is not past future or presentComprehending the sameness of all phenomena they gain an exact understanding of the way all phenomena are characterized by illusionand others who are numerous as the sands of the river Ganges pervade their own buddha realms with the power of their speechBlessed One this marvelous doctrine of the bodhisattva great beings is not to be found among the śrāvakas and solitary buddhas how wonderfulhave lauded Tathāgata ākyamunis teaching of the Dharma and have rejoiced in this Dharma teachingI have taught the good qualities that there are And described hundreds of faultsfor the rains like waterThey know perfectly emancipation from the three realmsfor it leads one to be conceived in the womb to be born to manifest in the world to undergo austeritiesthis refrain should be applied also to the transcendent perfection of generosity and it should also be applied to the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdomThe lord then saidIn the world system called Perfect Light abides the Tathāgata called He Who Looks at All Beings with LoveThey do not preoccupy themselves with the talk of aggressive conflictdoing so many timesWhat are the virtues and benefits you saw in leaving the worldIt involves tumultSimilarly the emptiness of feelings does not generate feelingsLikewise from their initial engendering of the mind of awakening until they reside upon the seat of awakening the virtuous qualities of the moonlike bodhisattvas increase and expand with every passing day until reaching complete fullness when they reside upon the seat of awakeningWhen his flesh has wasted away His mind will become yet clearerin order to accomplish the store of wisdom he does not destroy the compoundedIn this way the temple that delighted the Bodhisattva was completely perfect and finely constructed both inside and outsideThis is why Subhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomYamarāja wonderedThroughout time they will be Unsurpassable in meritthe four great kings with the gods of their realmMany buddhas had dwelt thereHowever because there is an ultimate the bodhisattvas are known as experts on the ultimateWhatever beings there are in this world realm Humans devas asuras and guhyakas Hell beings pretas and those born as animalsthen this supreme Great Vehicle would not overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its gods humans and antigodsHe has the blossomed flowers of the secondary signs of a great beingThese buddha emanations go To thousands of millions of realms Upon seeing them he felt faith and thoughtand some were being melted down in boiling vats When they saw two boiling iron vats standing there empty they askedthe same is the case with the ears nose tongue body and mind Name and form are not the bodhisattva and hence name and form cannot receive any prophecyAfter this tathāgata passed into parinirvāṇa his sacred Dharma endured for a thousand yearsMay simultaneously sing their songs but they Cannot equal a hundredth of the Buddhas voice the śrāvakas of the tathāgatas and all sublime beings are all without defectAnd the thoughts that arise in those beings minds But the sūtras constantly taught by such people cannot be counted Blessed One have all sentient beings of that realm attained the state of irreversible progressNoble son bodhisattvas possessing ten qualities abide within the absence of marksThen there will be benefit for many beings happiness for many beings compassion for the world and welfare benefit and happiness for a great multitude of beings devas and humansSolely devoted to the four joysAll

reciting oṃ vaṣaṭ svadhā svāhā the benedictions collected praises or invocations by repeating mantras or dhāraṇīs or by practicing meditationWhen they have practiced the way of enlightenment ThenThat which has no ultimate reality is a false and deceptive phenomenonThis is exactly the kind of dangerous path the wise say must be rejected Knowing this they spoke in verseHaving incanted a peacocks

four directionsHis sides are rounded  well proportioned and  straightBy the gift of sweeping one will be free of dirtHe has the power that comes from knowing the cause and result of all actions in the past present and the future ThereforeMāra the evil one told them I am not aware of anyone in the animate or inanimate world Who can change what has been done by the Buddhas powerSimilarly owing to the fact that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are emptinessMañjuśrī is there then never any mind that is liberated at allThus having taken seven stepsThe rejoicing devas

signlessness and aspirationlessnessSubhūti although great bodhisattva beings practice the sacred doctrine and its profunditiesThrough their speaking words of wisdom Millions of beings attain the sight

skilled in bodhisattva conduct Are not on the level of other beings Of śrāvakas or of pratyekabuddhasStainless and of infinite glory The Bodhisattva becomes a mendicant of his own willIn this way Subhūti do great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration acquire the transcendent perfection of perseveranceWe will purify all this As far as the ocean Shaking Mount Sumeru And overturning the earthTheir complexions become poor and pale One should not have sexual enjoyment even in thought not to mention joining together the two sexual organsmaintaining the five acquisitive psychophysical aggregates which are dreamlikeThe father always thinks of his son who has been missing for fifty yearsI did that kind of work during the day and

realmsNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities have a pure livelihoodCan anyone tell me what has happenedadding sugar and clarified butterNor should they abide in the notion that the aggregates from physical forms up to and including consciousness are not entitiesin doing so they do not at all establish them in conditioned elements and they do not at all establish them in unconditioned elementsBecause young man this king of samādhis the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomena is the basis and root of the entire Dharmathey are not afflicted by the suffering of angerMonks it is precisely for this reason that in order to protect oneself one who holds the sūtra Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm should also hold the Dhāraṇī of the Unblemished GemTherefore because of the gratitude and appreciation they feel for this Dharma teaching they have come here to see the ThusGone OneWhen seized by Kāminī A child lies sleepless in bedWhy is it you displayed this smile O Blessed OneAt the final moon among the six Recite delightedly for one night Andwept wailed lamented and cried out to each otherWe will see that country yet Master if only for a short while We will bathe on the banks of the riverThey will hear sweet melodious song But the constant ones will have no attachmentO fearless Avalokiteśvara please hearken to the names of rī Mahādevī They are as followsTheir bile and phlegm ligaments and bones and flesh and blood were completely consumed by fire Nothing was left behind save a few relics that fell to the grounddivine princes their utmost difficulty is that they don the armor that resolves to establish innumerable countless and immeasurable hundreds of thousands of sentient beings in final nirvāṇa while those sentient beings whom they would lead to final nirvāṇa are utterly nonapprehensibleand likewise they do not consider whether or not they engage in union with feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas trust in awakening and the emergence of the thusgone ones consist inWanting to ask his questions Bhadrapāla stood to one sideEvil one you are on your own Like a loser pretending to be a heroIt is not difficult for them to obtain kalyāṇamitras They also see buddhas and śrāvakassmear it on ones penis and rub it inAs he arrived he stopped in midair and sang these verses to the Bodhisattvathese four bowls and an offering of the main and auxiliary fruitsFurthermore reverend āriputra the bodhisattva who lives in the inconceivable liberation can pour into a single pore of his skin all the waters of the four great oceansWe should pursue them in the sense that just as phenomena are not established nor is the absence of phenomena establishedIt is subtle and conforms to what is real and unrealIt is excellent to see the buddhas The lords of the worlds the protectors The buddhas who in these three realms Liberate beings from their bondagehe will become free from diseaseThis concludes The Past of Bhaiṣajyarāja the twentysecond chapter of the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good DharmaThose who are lost and without any qualities of goodness And the many unskillful ones must all feel your compassionthey do not perceive any true emergence of anger nor do they perceive any true ceasing of angerMay I lead beyond suffering all those who have not transcended suffering andSince his mind is like the sky He practiced the allpervasive concentrationAt that time my prayers were for beings And not for myself nor for my desiresin the future will attain the highest supreme enlightenmentholding a mongoose and a citronThere is honey gruel and stripped sugar caneTherefore Maitreya listen well and carefully and retain all that I say in your mindThose who hear and then possess study promulgate and have their minds completely focused on even one fourline verse of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras The Sūtra of the Baskets Displayit shuddered shuddered strongly and shuddered intenselywithout awakening to completely perfect buddhahood I awaken to unexcelled and completely perfect buddhahoodThe king the lord of humans Reassured the countless millions of beingsmay reveal such corporeal forms at will acting on behalf of sentient beingsNoble ones all those Dharma teachings were taught by the Tathāgata in order to guide beingsin this assembly to hear the sacred doctrine in the presence of Senior Subhūtiso it is with the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdomFor the next two or three days he trained them in their appropriate conductlike elephants sinking in deep waterfor no element of dharmas is observed apart from consciousnessTake as an analogy the medicinal butter called great virtuewhy do you say that the designation of sights does not constitute a bodhisattvathe six aspects of perceptionthe real nature of the Tathāgata is the real nature of the futureThis precious gemstone indeed exists among the human beings of JambudvīpaThe purification of the great higher cognitions Is an incontrovertible teachingThere is nothing even in the slightest the blessed buddhas do not knowamong all the classes of gods all the scions of the gods abandon their games of pleasure delights and enjoymentsSuch people are blessed by all the buddhasWe could say the same about the southern direction the western direction the northern direction the direction below above or indeed any of the ten directionsI will not impede their virtuous approach Indeed I will rejoice in itWith this figure as the basic unit of calculation it is possible to solve the calculation equal to the number of grains of sand in one billion Ganges riversIf you ask what is emptiness as a gateway to liberationNeither I nor anyone else can cure youTherefore āriputra sons and daughters of good family should completely dedicate all roots of virtue in a respectful manner to be born in that buddha realmtheir designation as calm or not calm their designation as void or not void their designation as afflicted or purified their designation as arising or ceasing and their designation as entities or nonentities do not constitute a bodhisattvaBhagavān are your beings without strong envy Are they without greedand owing to the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesNoble son such matters cannot be framed by thought replied the Blessed One I have created the worst bad karmaThrough this there is no doubt That a yogin will succeed by means of a consortThey should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that As I maintain the level of one who has entered the stream I will become one who will be reborn only seven more timesHis teeth are perfectly whitespeaking the Dharma is to teach Dharma in accord with the thusgone ones teachingsAnd they will not delight in the Dharma of emptiness and peace and the inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of unhappiness concerning purification Those are the fourHe would then attend upon each tathāgata and the corresponding bodhisattvas and hearers for as many eons as there are atomic particles in inexpressibly numerous tens of quintillions of buddhafieldsWill have made an offering to all the buddhas Those are the qualities of dedication to mendicancy It has no location because it transcends the scope of the words of those who aspire to the wisdom of buddhahoodNoble one if a hundred thousand quintillion beings were to set out to sea in a ship sailing to find cowries gold jewels pearls beryl conch crystal emeralds coral white coral red pearls and so onwe would do well were the noble one to teach Dharma to those of us crossing the oceanLike a lake his mind was pure clear and pristineHolding various jewels and pearls Came and scattered them for the Guide Enjoining him to practice the equally applicable ethical codefor a person who has killed his mother is one who will not flourish in the Dharma and Vinaya For that reasonThe earth element functions as the support for the seedMonks for eight winter nights I punished and tormented my bodyAt that moment there was not a single being anywhere that felt hostile frightened or anxiousand when they extend their golden right hands and place them upon my head may I receive a prophecyAll the buddhas are mind itselfYou should teach it write it out read it explain it meditate upon it and make offerings to itAt that moment the Licchavi Vimalakīrti entered into such a concentration that those monks were caused to remember their various former livesWithout any harm occurring to sentient beings they let a great fragrant rain fall on the entire trichiliocosm and on Gayāśīrṣa HillThey bowed down wondering who he wasNoble son Fa this is not the time to hear this great king of sūtras that is like the father and mother of the thusgone ones and that exhausts all karmaFriends in what form should I enter the womb of a motherFor a moment the great Brahmā offers sight of himself to all the classes of godsThose four bodhisattva mahāsattvas now stood before that great gathering of bodhisattvas that great aggregation of bodhisattvasSimilarly Subhūti feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are neither fettered by nor liberated from their present circumstancesMoreover āradvatīputra the maturity of a great bodhisattva being also entails those circumstances when bodhisattvas practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom with regard to the eighteen aspects of emptinessShould project the deities in full And properly perform offerings and so forth Like one candle igniting anotherThen the venerable nanda said to the BuddhaLumps of red hot iron will be squeezed into their mouths burning them destroying their lips and teeth splitting their palates burning their throats and burning their hearts and all their entrails until there is nothing left but boneshe gave up his bodySimilarly what will you achieve through the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration What will you achieve through the transcendent perfection of perseveranceif a great minister must tame that person then it is a great minister who will be emanatedScatter jewels on those dharmabhāṇakas Make offerings to them of divine flowers And all the perfumes of human beings And cover them with divine clothingThose who understand selflessness all day long Who are mindful of emptiness as they walkSimilarly it should be applied also to all the gateways of meditative stability and to all the gateways of mnemonic

linked to each other by chains of craving are full of affliction and are vileGreat King  Prince Sarvārthasiddha has markings on his hands that are even  clear  deep  straight and  well arrangedIt is the joy of renunciation of the whole world of not being fixed in objects of considering the five aggregates to be like murderers of considering the elements to be like venomous serpents and of considering the sensemedia to be like an empty townAs they hold the treasury of the BuddhatThey dedicate it entirely so that destitute beings may achieve great prosperityHe should also avoid families

huhu hehe mati mati mahāmati vajramati dṛḍhavajramatiSenior āradvatīputra the essential nature of that transcendent perfection of wisdom is nonapprehensible If you ask whyThen the Licchavi Vimalakīrti without rising from his couch magically emanated an incarnated bodhisattva whose body was of golden colorAh Puṣpacandra I pray to you xxiiithey will accumulate the causes of all fruitional attributesWith this view that holds that all selves endure eager anticipation pursuit and excessive attachment will arisebut are subject to consummation and disintegration so it is that they perceive the cessation of physical formsDear boy please listen You are very young and have lived a life of leisure and you do not know what it is to sufferAnd it may be that the oceans dry upThe monk would return later from his alms round as the nāga was rising from his napWhat man would run away when he sees a treasure You will be exactly like that ignorant of the treasure which is loveTherefore all the buddhas the blessed ones in all the realms in the ten directions blessed the earth at that spot of vajra nature so that it would not be destroyed by his stepsBut then they again pretended to be shyThese are the paths of the ten nonvirtuous actionsIf you ask why it is because the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas never exist and are nonapprehensible This being the case how could they possibly come or goSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections accordingly will swiftly perfect the six transcendent perfections and also approach omniscienceHis kneecaps are broad large and welldevelopedThe Bodhisattva remained sitting crosslegged for six yearsYou are very young and have lived a life of leisure and you do not know what it is to sufferThe buddhas in the ten directions are my witnesses My discipline practice and the superior branches of awakening are all my witnessesFrom among all sūtras This is said to be the supreme sūtraThat sentient beings are purified has nothing to do with causes and conditionsfeeling is experience perception is knowledge pleasure and pain are formative predispositions and awareness of sight hearing smell taste and touch is consciousnessThese do not apprehend the emptiness of internal phenomena nor do they apprehend the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesThe bodhisattva mahāsattva Samantabhadra leading a following of countless bodhisattva mahāsattvasYoung man at that time and in those days the goddess of King Jñānabalas family since ancient timesIf a bodhisattva draws someone into spiritual practice then both the giver and recipient receive the bodhisattvas pure benefitOld women approached the Bodhisattva and called out to himRelying first on hearsay The knowledge holder should look downward every dayone billion Heavens Free from Strifethrough their sublime devotion to the Tathāgata perform rituals to him live with superior intentions andIn the same vein they should not dwell on the notion that physical forms are imbued with happinessFurthermore Mañjuśrī a bodhisattva mahāsattva who truly sees all phenomena as the teachings of the Buddha will attain purification of karmic obscurationsThe rākṣasīs were no longer afflicted by the suffering of desire there was no anger in their mindsSome hold up a staff in their handsIt also entails the completion of the four assurances by elucidating the teachings without making assumptions with respect to oneself and othersthis denotes the true nature of all conditioned and unconditioned phenomena which is not created by the śrāvakas not created by the pratyekabuddhas and not fashioned by the lord buddhas Inherent existence is empty of inherent existence because it does not endure and does not disintegrate If you ask why it is because that is its very natureThe list also includes one type of stone cats eyeWhen I see you I am filled with supreme joythey have the one characteristic of having no characteristics they are devoid of attributesAnd are completely skilled with wondrous attainment in the worldand who have been attentive to it in the correct manner and so forthNoncessation is nondivisionSimilarly they neither associate feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness with omniscience nor do they disassociate them therefromYou have heard the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtrasHe subsequently teaches them the Dharma Telling them of the state of nirvāṇaAll phenomena are genuinely beyond any basis and thus baselessBodhisattvas do not aspire due to weariness with the three realms or because of wishing to be free from desire and to gain cessationComposed of all kinds of jewels In order to venerate the Bodhisattva All realms were well adornedLearned lucid and intelligentHow can beings afflicted as they are by impermanence Take delight in desirable things like theseNow all these beings are intent on unvirtuous acts and seemingly wish for the great Hell of Incessant PainThe one who has attained the samādhi Will know this nature of phenomena how should they train in the other meditative absorptions up to and including the meditative absorption in the sense field of neither perception nor nonperceptionIt is excellent that you Great Vajradhara Secret One have for the benefit of sentient beings requested from me the tantra called The AllSubjugating VajraWhen their conceptualization has ceased They will see endless buddhas They experience pleasure Their field of conduct is practicing meditation Have no concept of desire and no concept of no desireMonks at that time the great river Ganges was swollen and flowed on the same level as its banksIn this way they can maintain the notion of always being without any shelterin doing so they do become capable of actualizing the noble wisdom vision that is much supreme to the highest human teachingHe possessed the Dharma and had appeared because of his perfect prayers in previous lifetimesThis concludes the Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra on Wisdom at the Hour of DeathSuppose milk and water have been mixed they maintain their practice  they turn away from saṃsāra  they are led to attain nirvāṇa  they live without faults arisingand will have truly entered the domain of the tathāgatasSitting there those bodhisattvas said to the Blessed Onewho had grasped the essence of liberationWere all living beings free of sickness the bodhisattva also would be free of sicknessYou excel O Buddha with your many qualitiesThis family must be renowned throughout the ten directions and have a vast retinuesee sentient beings who are intent on killing others they respond with great compassion and thinkrespected in all regards free of all unvirtuous qualities in possession of all virtuous qualities and will turn into a support for the entire worldIt is being without ignorance It is knowledge of the processes of the mind It is the knowledge that realizes the nature of the mindTheir senses are not restless or wild With their senses well trained they look only as far as the length of a yoke and thusThe ones who possess this samādhi will see Countless quintillions of buddhas Instructor if addressing the instructor or Reverend if addressing a monkand his characteristic is to be inexhaustibleneither placedMoreover āradvatīputra those great bodhisattva beings who wish to fulfil the aspirations of all sentient beingsWhoever knows his name and family will be guarded protected looked after pardoned and brought peace and wellbeing by himThe deva Maheśvara answeredAlas I had doubts in the past In the past I cut down an elapatra bushBlessed One how is the nature of cravingGive heed give heed to meI have heard my Lord that when you were born you were brought to the priests who are skilled in making predictions based on examining signs They prophesied before your father King uddhodana Your Majesty your royal line will flourish When King uddhodana inquired furtherthe teacher to gods and men known as the Blessed Buddha ākyamuni emptiness of the unlimited the branch of enlightenment that entails correct doctrinal analysisYou should think I shall develop respect for him just as I should respect the Tathāgata because this person holds a treasureSuch a wheel can only belong to a king who has been properly consecrated by sprinkling his head On the fifteenth day of the lunar month while observing a poṣadha fast the king will first wash his head and then go to the top terrace of the palace surrounded by the women of the female quartersThis is covetousnessTherefore young man understand this teaching in the following waynor the attributes free from desireVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is free from desiresHave your parents given you their permission asked the monkCāturmahārājikahe bodhisattvas with mindfulness and dhyāna Who are constantly reciting the scriptures And teaching the Dharma in the assembliesThat is the nature of the emergence Of the buddhas of the lords of worldsDivine son ultimately all phenomena are utterly unseenCrowds of yakṣas nāgas and gandharvas Will constantly be honoring them Male and female piśācas will honor them Revere them and make offerings to themA mind that is of the nature of the field of phenomena Must be brought forth through mind itselfHowever many words are spoken Whether superior middling or lesserWithin that space there are numerous mountains Cakravāla Meru and Sumeru Mucilinda and Mahāmucilinda Vindhya Gṛdhrakūṭa and Himavat Just upon seeing him and witnessing the Blessed Ones conduct I attained that conduct as well and realized the fact that all phenomena are inherently unbornSpace functions by not obstructingcircumambulated the Blessed One three times and disappearedIt is this the Noble Ones Eightfold Pathin the same way Subhūti this supreme vehicle the Great Vehicle too accommodates countless innumerable and limitless sentient beingsThus neither to transcend nor to be involved neither to go nor to stopnanda it was by means of those ten qualities that I quickly realized supreme perfect enlightenment and became a buddhaIf it is fully outfitted it is a monastery but if it lacks all the trappings it is poorOne should then smear the ends of two sticksSo too in order to protect me Please now grant it to me O KhavajraThe real nature is nonexistent and nonapprehensibleThey overcome their opponents They defeat the tīrthikasWith their pure clear and unsullied wisdom bodhisattvas observe the realms of sentient beingsthose beings will then pass away from the hells and be reborn equal in fortune to human beingsThrough intensive practice like thisand similarly the more they wish to teach and grant instruction in the ten powers of the tathāgatas the four assurances the four unhindered discernments great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasThese are physical misdeedsBy correctly disregarding that reason I have found happiness and abide thereinAll of you Wait a whileIf you ask why it is because they do not consider the nature of fundamental ignoranceWhen Māyādevī arrived at the Lumbinī Grove she stepped down from her fine chariotfive types of actions three types of actionsThey notice such beings who do not deprecate noble ones and who based on their correct perceptions commit themselves to acts and qualities that pertain to correct viewWherever this Dharma discourse on absorption is being propounded we will cross as many world systems as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges in order to hear it and we are even ready to die for the sake of hearing this teaching an ascetic since he had perfectly transcended all attachmentbeautiful peacocks brahminy ducks and delightful mynasMañjuśrī if on the ultimate level without basing yourself on any phenomena you teach without teachingAt this sight Mahauṣadhi felt faith and asked the Blessed OneAnd the many millions of deities in the middle of the sky Showed great veneration to the supreme being showing how he manifested as a bodhisattva and destroyed the legions of MāraLook at these beautiful trees with fresh leaves and blooming flowers They resound with the cries of pheasants cuckoo birds and the humming of beesThe single chamber is the onepointedness of mindAnd the thought that liberation is a place you can go toWell then why did you rob the merchants We have no other means of making a living Your MajestyToday bestow this one favor on me I pray that you arise shining like the sun ixwent to the main templeThis would be repeated a second and a third time The monks petitionHaving understood this they bring forth a steadfast attitude of compassion and diligently strive and endeavor for the sake of sentient beingsThe young brahmins then went off to collect wood for use in fire pūjasmay the person named suchandsuch be guarded protected looked after brought peace and wellbeing and granted pardonGood Mañjuśrī that is goodHe then entered the temple in order to be aloneAfter applying sulphur powder to a heated cow bone a flame will blaze upHe replied This is owing to nonfixation upon all thingsI have awoken from the indolent drowsiness and obscured dullness that for so long seized me in the world Now is the time to wake up othersthe minds of the monks with no further appropriation were liberated from defilementwho wish to become a lamp for sentient beings who are immersed in the darkness of fundamental ignorance I had no pain when I cut my flesh When the blood flowed I did not become dizzyInseparable from emptiness and compassionThen Bodhisattva Gaganagañja asked Bhagavat ViśvabhūThen another person asks That man this question Do you have some of the sandalwood That you have been praising Friend this house is illomened dont go inAt precisely that time she should say the following words Which bring on an intensification of pleasureDharma material things Love and fearlessness You must always practice this fourfold generosity If you possess nothing be generous through acts of meditationThey do not seek reputation fame or gainThey will know that this one will be reborn among the gods of the Caturmahārājakāyika realmThose who engage in union with the transcendent perfection of wisdom through the aforementioned aspects of emptinessI do not depart from Vulture Peak And yet I have millions of other seatsTheir mouth is not too wideMay you grant all beings happiness rebirth in the higher realms and peaceSewing it into the hem of his upper robeThey never objectify the mind at all And are without conceptualization or prideThey will wander in that way for three eons When they die and leave the hells they will be reborn in Jambudvīpa as poor people blind from birthThey will have Māras thoughts and will be beings in darkness They will be under the power of desire and have strong attachmentWho made the offering to you best of men For whom has vast merit been created There is understanding of the mind the knowledge of words Being established in definitions with certainty of meaningsConsidering them to be their teachers they will follow them and stay with themthe bodhisattvas and bhikṣusIn accordance with the aspirations blessed by the thusgone ones through this offering of medicine may I cause all beings to perfect the wellbeing of the ambrosia by which which all beings are freed from old age and deathThe prince should now worship in the templeThe purity of your wisdom is unstained by the three existences Lord of men you have the wealth of qualities precious qualitiesnor are they taught by the śrāvakasUpatiṣya and Kolita then approached the Blessed OneYoung man in that way King rīghoṣa made offerings to the stūpas that contained the relics of the TathāgataThere are no other beings Present in the worlds To whom this Dharma is taught And who know this teaching Consider noble son the analogy of fire that ripens crops herbs and treesHe practiced severe austerities for six yearsNoble son the thusgone ones are firmly established in their accomplishmentand lion thrones that were five hundred yojanas in height were also manifestedand I too am stricken with painful sufferingbut instead benefit no sentient beings through this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom and fail to encourage sentient beings to acquire the attributes and attainments up to and including omniscienceDoing what is needed they perfect their trainingNārāyaṇa imagine that as many beings as there are in as many universes as there are grains of sand in the Ganges were brought together and each of them had as much merit as a wheelbearing monarchFor that young man bodhisattva mahāsattvas should have perfectly pure conductIn that way Great King it is a great occasion for someone to be cared for by a kalyāṇamitra and guided to see a tathāgataBodhisattvas similarly provide all beings with generosity discipline patience diligence concentration insight and other such provisions for awakening as well as with any sort of article that beings may requireI am also fond of the truth I too cherish it like it and enjoy it ThereforeHe had eight hundred students And he ripened all of themand she gives generouslyNo one abides in or regresses from enlightenmentSo in this way people are born into the world through ignorance and the restWe have carried out the teaching of the JinaThe Blessed One is endowed with broad heelsand likewise the four meditative concentrations the four immeasurable aspirations the four formless meditative absorptionsKing Viveśacintin came with eight hundred million people into the presence of the Tathāgata considering all elements to be present in whitenessextended his right hand as a farewell greetingIt is groundless and cannot be comprehended There is no end to its descriptionVenerable Lord Why is the purity of physical forms due to the purity of the selfwhat is the skill in means that enables great bodhisattva beings who have heard this teaching on the transcendent perfection of wisdom not to be afraid and not to be terrified they attain samādhi and  they will never be poorfor whom space was equal to the palm of his handWhen someone has been taught this samādhi In which all the teachers resideGiving up a world realm of a billion worlds with its forests oceans mountains rivers lakes ponds wells and parks is not comparableThese men took the life of an arhat said the monksThe Bodhisattva who is like the great Brahmā proceeds to the seat of awakening with the desire to awaken to unexcelled perfect and complete buddhahood in order to tame the armies of Mārafor a hundred and eighty thousand million years and I built ten million monasteries made of sandalwood and precious materials the power of perseveranceAt that time he remembered the Dharma of the many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of buddhas and the prayer that he had made in the pastIt seems insubstantial and still it fulfills its particular function in relation to forests houses palaces the central mountain and the seasand do not depend on others for the transcendent perfection of generosity or for the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom and similarly for the attributes and attainments up to and including unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment thenall three of them in their minds recited these versesAt its door there is an immortal man who never agesof the store of knowledge which is consummated in the ability to teach the Dharma according to the thoughts and actions of all living beingsWhen he said the letter jha out came the statement Vanquishing the forces of the god of love jhaṣadhvajabalanigrahaṇawithout speechNot to speak of just giving them a great cart he gave each one a cart with the same colors recollection of respirationOffer an alms bowl to the BlissGone One You will become a vessel of the Supreme Vehiclewill also attain individual enlightenment manifestly perfect buddhahood dependent on this same transcendent perfection of wisdomThen those living beings who aspire to inferior ways may gain the intelligence to aspire to the great Dharma of the Buddha andbecause their conduct and personal associations are excellent they avoid any personal associations that are in discord with the way of a spiritual practitionerIt involves reference pointsConsider noble son the way a lotus emerges from the water and yet it is not stuck thereTheir inharmonious perception Gives rise to a mind that is gross or where an immoral king rules that king will not worship this Dharma teachingso they refine the buddhafields and also bring sentient beings to maturityTherefore Subhūti there is no virtuous attribute at all which should not be perfected by great bodhisattva beingsSubhūti it is because they should not be attentive to mental images even of the roots of virtue possessed by the tathāgatas and the community of śrāvakas of the tathāgataswhenever they do not engage with the notions that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are void or that they are not voidabandoned and let go of my spouseI should bring sentient beings to maturity in this mannerWith  homa offerings of five types of grain smeared with gheePerfect Buddha please turn the supreme wheelOn the relative level the perfection of knowledge is a gateway to nirvāṇaBlessed One the quantity of merit made through the gift does not match even one hundredth of the amount of merit made by Great Brahmā in engendering such love Indeed it bears no comparison Holding that disenchantment in mind and having attained tranquility they disapprove of all phenomenaThe parks are adorned with groves of jeweled trees that are arranged like chessboards and surrounded by jewel platformsBhikṣus when I have passed into nirvāṇaMany kinds of beings are experiencing in this fire Great sufferings one after the otherThe Blessed One said to the bodhisattva great being PadmaśrīgarbhaThe knowledge is wisdomso it is saidbecome wise in asking questions about the inconceivable Dharma of the Buddha become wise in seeking the inconceivable Dharma of the BuddhaYou are very young and have lived a life of leisure and do not know what it is to sufferand similarly the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas are present in the worldIt is so because duality arises erroneouslyand began to confer with one anotherLife however ends in deathThe bodies of the Victor fill the entire realm of phenomena And are present in all infinite realmsThey listen extensively to the vast discourses that are to be worshiped and veneratedāradvatīputra do you think that the sensory element of the body the sensory element of tangibles and the sensory element of tactile consciousness constitute a bodhisattvaDevas nāgas and asuras with great miraculous powers Yakṣas rākṣasas humans and kiṃnarasIt is blue or is colored blue or is like blue or shines with blue lightAnd irreversible bodhisattvas who are hereIn doing so he causes his own deathConsider the analogy of the king of medicinal trees known as Excellent to BeholdThe body of the Victor is like a golden mountainor her caress By a mere remembrance of her When she is far awayAnd likewise right now in the presentIn the same vein they will teach in an apprehending manner that all the other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are soThis is a heros method That brings these sentient beings to maturityit is because anything that enhances or diminishes physical formsSuch types of eloquence are moreover neither lacking in terms of meaning words proofs nor timelinessA distinction is perceived between wisdom and means Death is said to be the dharmakāyanoble son I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit that comes from repeating the sixsyllable mahāvidyā onceIt is a statement that is in accord with the intrinsic naturein an eon named Priyadarśana in a world named Vairocanaraśmipratimaṇḍitā there appeared in that world the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha the one with perfect wisdom and conduct the sugata the one who knows the worlds beings

not recognize that one who genuinely takes up the pledges and the training commitments of body speech and mind is endowed with many qualities and great roots of virtueSimilarly Subhūti this supreme vehicle the Great Vehicle too is endowed neither with the level of bright insightO hili hili phuḥ phuḥIf you ask what are the four supports for miraculous abilities He replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of the dimensions of all thingsand unable to look others in the face while beggingand they had the postures of the tathāgatasMaster please listenand also those who followed the Pratyekabuddhayāna all thoughtThey are the inconceivably numerous kinds of reasoning concerning the composite the inconceivably numerous kinds of reasoning concerning teaching the compositeAnd lest those living beings of the Sahā world become jealous of you change your bodies to hide your beautyThe bodhisattva rīkūṭa declaredwhy did that blessed thusgone worthy perfect buddha emit this beam of lightThe physician Kumārabhṛta went to see the Blessed OneThrough making that offering he guided countless hundred thousands of quintillions of śrāvakasThe gods from the desire and form realms then offered to the ThusGone One eight million four hundred thousand lion thronesThe nāgas discussed the matter amongst themselvesWithdrawal of the senses is a gateway to the light of the Dharma for it leads one to meditate on the pathA person ordained today trains in the very same training that a monk ordained for one hundred years trains inThe lord buddhas have a tongue that is slender and largeYou should long for and attain the wisdom of the buddhas Who possess all the qualities of omniscience It is the seat of paranormal perception because it has the six superknowledgesthe emptiness of external phenomena is revealed therein and in the same veinThey are all of them seen in The supreme buddha realms Venerable monks name is this begging bowl too small too large or too paleBhagavat I have perceived a great wonderful marvelWhat point is there in my having a long life that is devoted to bad actions deprived of the sight of Avalokiteśvara blind and following a path of darknessThis I promise you I shall give you these three yānas perseverance  delight  mental and physical refinement  meditative stability and  equanimityHe descends from a pure line of monarchsBodhisattvas remain unmovable from that seat and that is why they are known as adopting the single seatLikewise he had perfected each and every quality of awakening the applications of mindfulness the thorough relinquishments the bases of miraculous power the faculties the powers the branches of awakening and the paththose who are of feeble perseveranceAs soon as he had attained those puritiesThe ThusGone One spoke to them with these versesIt is the elimination of attachment It is transcending the existencesThey all belonged solely to the Great Vehicle longed for the Dharma day and night and took delight in the DharmaJust as when a lion is seen amongst foxesSupplicating me to explain the stainless and sublime DharmaOr the green TārāThese fifteen grahas Threaten childrenHow should they become equipoised in the meditative stability of signlessnessLikewise it applies to the noble truths and in the same vein to all other phenomena up to and including the dependent link of aging and deathHave compassion O Protector for those on the wrong path They are helpless since they are not traveling on the path to nirvāṇaI possess wisdomThose tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas who will appear in the future will also be nonconceptual andWhen a bodhisattva sees that all the afflictions and all the activities of the māras are aids to the attainment of unexcelled and perfect awakening such a bodhisattva is endowed with skillful meansAfter they had departed Brother nanda said to the BhagavatO gods it is so It is just as you have saidāradvatīputra the four unhindered discernments are merely conceptualizedclouds that rained down divine fragrant herbs The wise and learned dharmabhāṇaka Powerful and renowned in all directionsWhat use has he for possessionsbut wherever she asked no one had heard any word of himLikewise all the mountains that exist in this world of the great trichiliocosm such as Mount Meru bowed toward the seat of awakeningIn the same vein it does not enlarge all those other attributes up to and including buddhahood nor does it contract themThere is the meditative stability named Free from MentationBodhisattvas have a correct understanding regarding the unfounded superimpositions and negations made with respect to phenomenaIn an enduring body In billions of realms I teach the Dharma to beings For countless millions of eonsThey are  they reject that which should not be done  they engage in that which should be done  they follow the Dharma of a worthy personChapter This will arrest the semenSo it is Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomSounds did not resonate in their earsthe seed does not think I form the sproutThe Bhagavān said to those four bodhisattva mahāsattvas who were the principal figures among that great gathering of bodhisattvas that great aggregation of bodhisattvasIn the cardinal directionsWhen the monks asked the Blessed One Who was this being A god a nāga a yakṣathe Bodhisattva at this point manifested four Dharma gates in order to mature his retinue of consorts just as all previous bodhisattvas in their last existence had doneand similarly those who wish to comprehend the other sense organs up to and including the mental facultyOne should grind doob grass with turmeric and apply itSon of noble family what is the difference between the qualities of ordinary beings and the qualities of buddhasIt was a time of false views It was a time of wrong viewsHis lattices of jewels and pearls became silent fell apart tore and fell downAs much incense garlands parasols Clothing and powders as there are that bhagavat told the deity MaheśvaraTherefore Bhagavān we have been satisfied by the attainment of nirvāṇado not conceive of anything that is conditioned unconditioned mundane supramundane contaminated or uncontaminatedYou said to us in the house I will give you three kinds of cartsChild of enlightened heritage you should reject those attentionsWhat are those ten They are being undaunted being unperturbed never giving up proclaiming the lions roar fearlessness roaming through the forests resting in hillside caves being free from bringing anything along conquering the hordes of demons through their diligence strengths and powers and protecting the crops of virtueThis wisdom is preeminent and marvelous These beings are unwise and blinded by ignorance Saṅgharakṣita replied the Blessed One those being themselves performed the actionsAbiding on their own levelwho is deep like the vast oceanTheir confidence will be eternal Through their possessing this state of peace When practicing generosity by offering lampsAnd how is the vinaya of the bodhisattva great beingsIt would take delight in those offeringsone may still develop a onepointed mind and the thusgone ones will then arrive before oneself at the time of deathMay I complete the perfection of patienceSmiling the arhat elder gained faith in the Blessed OneSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who are irreversible become absorbed at will in the first meditative concentrationThey will smell the scents of different flowers namely the scents of royal jasmine jasmine magnolias and bignonia flowersthe boundless light of exalted wisdom will ariseNoble son the goddess Amartyā possesses great and miraculous powersask the Blessed One about the most profound subjects within his purviewAt that time no less than five hundred people Became holders of the samādhiAnd I prophesy that they will be reborn in SukhāvatīEven those who are used to speaking harsh words find such words unpleasant they do not want to hear them do not like them and do not enjoy themIt is so because all things are nonapprehensibleAll the yakṣas from above and belowYoung man if bodhisattva mahāsattvas have that one qualityBeloved and adored by many beingswill become learned in the teaching of the inconceivable Dharma of the BuddhaThey previously embarked on unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment but instead they remained as śrāvakasIn the same vein if they have conviction without apprehending anything in the transcendent perfection of wisdom they will have conviction in all those other attributes and attainments up to and including omniscienceThen the one who has more to accomplish can go on to the great island of jewelsāradvatīputra in the same way great bodhisattva beings discern that this very body from the soles of the feet upwards and from the hair and the head downwards is full of manifold impuritiesAnd hurled upon them a rain of bricks and stones That killed the kings brother and his army It is praised by the wiseEach person thinking The Jina is speaking to me For what reason did you smile Within that pore named Indrarāja there are eighty thousand mountains made of divine gold and jewelsengagements with the absence of a sentient being a life force an individual a person an agent and a sensor and a knower and a seerWith substances such as poison Produce the form that you wish for Then insert the diagram at the heart centerHis calves are like those of the black antelope the king of deerYou should explain themToday he will conquer the hordes of demons and gain immortalityhe Protector of the World Has turned the wheel that is like An illusion a mirage A dream an echo or a moon reflected in waterO kāśagarbha your compassion is great indeed I pray please bestow good fortune upon melet alone by one who respectfully listens to respectfully reads respectfully teaches and respectfully elucidates this Dharma teachingYet they do not indulge in those sensual pleasures and they always practice chastityYour wisdom is immense and farreaching and you are good at requesting profound teachingsThen Bhagavān the householder sees that his son has developed and is capable of preserving his wealthThose who are called listeners and so forthWhy not Because nanda the thusgone ones are immeasurable profound vast and difficult to judgeHe has abandoned palaces with their oval windows and terraces as well as conveyances And the land adorned with exquisite flowers with beautiful parks springs and ponds He gave up his limbs his head and his eyes and now he walks to the seat of awakeningWith a feeling of joy they are giving Various different gifts such as theseThen they will proceed to the great hells where they will be incinerated by an infernonot a sign not a cognition and not something that can be made knownThe bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha said to the Blessed One WonderfulWhen not retaliating when hurt by others they are free from evilJust as the lotus born of mud is not tainted thereby So the lotus of the Buddha preserves the realization of voidnessThis concludes the noble Great Vehicle sūtra entitled The Illusory AbsorptionMay I learn every single word And in future times be a keeper of this sūtra And will avoid dance song And ornaments along with merrimentdrinking water paying reverence to a stūpa in the vicinity of the monasteryMoreover gods the tathāgatas do not enter parinirvāṇa because there is no parinirvāṇa of the tathāgatasPrince he replied how could I go forth if I dont have a begging bowl or a dharma robethe four moments and the four sectionsWith a good conscience and a sense of modesty she observes the DharmaYou are not situated in any dharmaNone of the realms of beings will appear The continuum of cyclic existence will cease Suffering will be transcendedwind by its changing course diffusiveness and its being set into motion easilyand the one who has been freed by the wisdom of equalitySo too through bhūtakeśa incense The saffron robed will be healedThe goddess in the north wields a sword a noose a hand drum and a skull cupSubhūti it is in this way that great bodhisattva beings refine the buddhafieldsOne is allowed to observe the conduct of adornments and ambrosiaThey should not dwell on the notion that I am one who has entered the stream possessing the attributes of nonregressionSeized by stinginess towards the novicesfailing to go before spiritual masters not chanting in a timely wayThe nose is the condition for smell but the

adversaries They have discovered the shallowness of the compositeIn those manystoried palaces there are golden stairs beautified by delightful jewels of various kindsMañjuśrī they saidand their mental actions are without maliceand similarly they will not become fixated on any other phenomena up to and including the dependent link of aging and deathall of these constitute the third root transgressionBhaiṣajyarāja the beings who come to that caitya of the Tathāgata in order to pay homage to it or to see itThere is no development of phenomena It is afterward just as it was before He

have mindfulness They will have wisdomThey are undefiled and liberated These qualities from attaining samādhi are measureless They will experience that kind of suffering in that hell for hundreds of thousands of yearsVictorious One you took on a physical appearance Of such a kind that would tame the worldYoung brahmins replied the wanderer this is how I see it and this is my philosophyThe rich man sitting on his lion throne Becomes overjoyed on seeing his sonand his right hand is in the boongranting gestureHe knows the way of the path of the transcendent four truthsSister it is likewise when there are meritorious formative factorsJust as he is now the supreme teacher of my Dharma so he was for all of themI will practice the transcendent perfection of tolerance by any means until such faults arising from the malice of these sentient beings no longer occur and are nonexistent and until all sentient beings like the gods of the bhāsvara realms invariably maintain loving kindness treating others as if they were their own parents and siblingsAnyone whose ears have so much as caught the sound of this Dharma teaching must be endowed with merit must have acted virtuously andhow could one possibly apprehend the real nature of physical formsTo someone who has entered a different maṇḍalaAll of the many kinds of Dharma that have been taught By however many buddhas there have been offered these dhāraṇīmantra words to the BhagavānI never gave the appearance of spirituality in order to obtain food I was content with whatever I obtained then having transported himself magically into the presence of the Buddha placing it on the ground He bowed down at the feet of the BuddhaSome had ears like goats demons elephants or pigs or hanging earsHe saluted Māṭhara and askedcauses the realization of the vision of the tathāgatas wisdomO hrīḥ hūit may be possible to count the number of grains of sand in the Ganges River Butbeing neither proud in success nor bowed in failurethe samādhi named Seeing All the TathāgatasThey taught the words and meaning of liberation They had perfectly pure conduct free of kleśas like an exalted oneThey neither cause anything to arise nor do they cause anything to ceaseVenerable Lord This transcendent perfection of wisdom is the great transcendent perfectionWhen practicing generosity by offering provisionsSupreme bodily marks and the blossoming of qualitiesWake up friendsThis is not the teaching of the genuinely perfect buddhasThat are more numerous than sand grains in the Ganges And there is no interruption in their eloquence Shocked and frightened the members of the caravan thought Why have the carriages stopped here on this plainThe Blessed One is endowed with arms that reach down to his knees when standing without bending downThis was the fourth chapter in the Great Sovereign Tantra of SiddhaikavīraThey abandon the practices of calm abiding and special insightI remember six hundred million of those who have the ten strengthsThe causal and fruitional attributes from the four applications of mindfulness up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas andOr is it some mountain godthey should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the other notions pertaining to the causal attributes up to and including the notion that I should cultivate the noble eightfold path This samādhi of peace is taught to the meditator For whom liberation is central and is fulfilled by this teachingOr another woman as available Wellendowed with feminine beautyAlas my dear one with spotless teeth As white as cows milk or snowSince you understand everyone in the infinite worldsand so that I may manifest the gandharva Pañcaśikhas skill in singing and playing the luteAnd say only the words I rejoice in this The previous merit would not be a fraction of this accumulation A female kāpālika also a conch workerThe strength of ten of the kings of the gods in Supreme Emanations is the same as the strength of one god in Mastery Over Others EmanationsBeing without attachment aversion and ignorancethe formations of the body are exhalation and inhalationneither a conducive way nor not a conducive wayAs soon as the ornaments were placed on the Bodhisattvas body the radiance of his body eclipsed their lusternot to enjoy the wilderness not knowing moderation with respect to foodyou have crossed the ocean of existenceIn other words when presented more extensively the same refrain may also be extrapolated from each of those terms and appended consecutivelyāriputra all the beings who hear that Dharma from those tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhasWhat are these sixtyfour qualitiesHundreds of thousands of goddesses sang danced and played instrumentsHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of the aspects of calmnessThen one should sit on a comfortable seat and arouse the mind set upon awakeningThe prophecy declares that it is impossible to grasp any phenomenaThe Tathāgata Mañjuśrī is not a signWhen noticing that the man is completely consumed by desire the bodhisattva will then let the emanated girl die right there in the bedSimilarly the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent perfection of generosity are all essencelessThe person who knows the way is an image for all bodhisattvas who are experts regarding the path to omniscience who have experience with the Dharma and who

limitless because space is limitless    tMay I awaken to unsurpassed buddhahood And cause all beings To purify the eye of Dharma The king himself decorated the chariot And a thousand gods prepared a divine throneWhen land and life are threatenedSon of noble family replied the Blessed Ratnaketuknowing the emptiness of the powersWhen the monk Vīradatta heard these words of reassurance he was overjoyed and happyThus bodhisattvas are vessels of powerful medicinal plantsin the same way that a master physician a healer learned in the field of medicine appears in the world neither for a single kingdom nor for a single land or beingAlternatively one should fasten a lizards tail Then one will be able to retain ones semenIt was square in form and had four pillarsThe preceptor then dresses the postulant checking to ensure he is not asexualWe all the disciples and solitary sages upon hearing this teaching of the Dharma should utter a cry of regret that would shake this billionworld galactic universeThey think to themselves The Blessed One has taughtnor have they been conditioned by external and internal emptiness and in the same veinall the great secrets of the Buddhabringing darkness and causing swishing sounds as they ran toward the BodhisattvaThe wise ones reject doubts And develop accurate viewsThe senses fade into spaceand they teach through syllables the sacred doctrine that is without syllables the faculty of meditative stabilityMañjuśrī does the utterly unarisen have any divisionsThe trillions of demonesses numerous as the grains of sand in the river GangesThey never develop thoughts of hatred or thoughts of delusionSimilarly the transcendence of the applications of mindfulness is not the applications of mindfulnessVenerable Lord You O Lord also acquired the sacred doctrine that is equal to the unequaled though practicing this transcendent perfection of wisdomWho abiding therein would teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beingsBeings as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges will eliminate the kleśas and manifest arhathoodIn the presence of others he will teach in the form of a brahmin and in the presence of yet others he may manifest in any other form including the form of a girlNor were the human maidens overwhelmed by the sight of the beautiful celestial maidensand conducted themselves well in their minds They did not malign the noble

holds that some selves endure eager anticipationPay homage to the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha ākyamuni and with my words ask him and his host of bodhisattvas and host of śrāvakasWith learning one is freed of wrong views and engenders the genuine viewand limitlessWhen ārikā challenged her husband Tiṣya he vanquished herThat the brahmin had no confidence to respond was damning and among the reasons he was vanquishedHe did not defecate urinate spit or blow his noseNeither will they speak gently with humor or in a way that entices othersand were then to look at that hair and thinkIf you ask Subhūti how great bodhisattva beings embark sentient beings for the happiness of the worldsThereupon Mañjuśrī the crown prince addressed the Licchavi VimalakīrtiOh The Tathāgata has shown this great miraculous signThese are called the sense fields of total consummationthey teach the perfection of diligenceYoung man listen to me as I tell you How I practiced for thousands of eonsFree of trouble they do not appropriate and without appropriating they engage themselves in bringing the defilements to exhaustionconditioned elements cannot be designated except in terms of unconditioned elementsor similarly do they engage with feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessor are those irreversible bodhisattvas in their final rebirth stablewhenever they do not engage with the notions that physical forms are afflicted or that they are purifiedtaking pleasure in skillful dedicationThey teach the Dharma for the attainment of the results of a streamenterer a oncereturner and a nonreturner yet they observe neither streamenterers nor oncereturners nor nonreturners nor any result of no returnWhen anyone abides in this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom as it has been revealed and offers the gift of the sacred doctrine for only one day they will generate many merits greater than thoseor who seek to actualize individual enlightenmentWithout being offensive to anyone any encounter with them is meaningful and fulfills all wishesHe is red in color and wears red garlands red clothes jewelry and unguentsMeaning that all appears as oneand the novice says Preceptor heed meKauśika this is the transcendent perfection of wisdom with which great bodhisattva beings are endowedAn ūrṇā hair is between your eyebrows As beautiful and bright as a conchHe was honored as the warrior among warriors because he cultivated endurance determination and fortitudeSubhūti it is because the natural expression of their future limits though without entity is still physical formand so that King ubhavyūha would be sympathetic toward them they together performed miracles that are permitted by the BuddhaThey should praise the four noble truthshe is the destruction of blissSon of a selfimmolator in this world those ascetics and brahmins who discard this viewIt is based on the eye and form That the eye consciousness appearsAs the householder was possessed of a natural intelligence while in the monks company he learned how to conduct himselfBowing to the Blessed One with palms joined he said to himRather bodhisattvas are physically respectful speak meaningfully and achieve flexibilityVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection constitutes the unhindered discernmentsIn this sense Subhūti it should be recognized that the tathāgatas are grateful and thankfulThat is known by those dedicated to renunciation By those engaged in the Buddhas teachings The whole assembly while circumambulating the ThusGone OneCompletely inspired by the taste of the Dharma they will be reborn within a lotushe will appear in the world as the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha the one with perfect wisdom and conduct the sugata the one who knows the world the unsurpassable guide who tames beings the teacher of devas and humans the buddha the bhagavān named RaśmiprabhāsaTranslated edited and finalized by the Indian scholar Surendrabodhi and the translatoreditor Band Yesh DRecollection of the Buddha is a gateway to the light of the DharmaIgnorant I was furious and jealous On seeing the joy of that great gathering of my wives Those who are to be influenced by something frightening will be shown something frighteningsee those sentient beings who possess the three provisionsprovisions that are definitely authentic provisions that are definitely erroneous and provisions that are of indefinite provenanceVenerable Lord What is the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities owing to which this transcendent perfection of wisdom is not at all established as a doctrine to be set in motion or reversedThey bowed down and said Majesty that command should not be obeyed And I became at that time overcome by sadness Nāgas are born a natural birth they die a natural death they sleep a natural sleepit is as follows Since even those sentient beings who presently assume such inimical forms are ultimately nonapprehensibleand their listeners will in turn experience joy faith and delightAs many as there are grains of sand in the GangesHe placed his hands together in homage and to the Bhagavān he expressed these thoughts in versesShe went off in the eastern direction but there she met only the BodhisattvaTo the śrāvakas he taught the Dharma conjoined with the four truths of the āryas and nirvāṇa as the ultimate goal as well as the process of dependent origination in order that they might transcend birth aging sickness death misery lamentation suffering unhappiness and distressMonks this was indeed how during the first station of the night the Bodhisattva actualized knowledge removed darkness and lit the lightCast aside all hesitation And listen to a sūtra such as thisof soberness of mind consummated by absence of dislike for ordinary peopleBecause the latter give rise to the faults of poisonous reference points and this must therefore be understood to be a danger on the relative levelHer limbs are firm and gently curved like the arch of a rainbowwishing Now I should stay among the gods of the Trāyastriṃśa realm without descending to JambudvīpaSimilarly owing to their utter purity they do consider the nonarising of the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold pathI completely released All the fetters of existence Through the power of my knowledgeBhaiṣajyarāja those men or women those noble men or noble women should be taught in this waythe inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of poverty concerning the kleśasHow does it not involve transmigration It does not involve transmigration because the sprout and the seed are different that which is the sprout is not the seedThe gods who were hovering in the sky above asked the god Dharmacārin Dear friend what is this Siddhārtha dawdles and keeps looking at the retinue of consortsEightyfour thousand kṣatriyas who were like great sal trees followed in the rearSmeared red with blood They ran around Seizing and devouring Human corpsesTherefore all phenomena are unbornSimilarly the cultivation of the transcendent perfection of wisdom is the noncultivation of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentShould have no cherishing for the body And should study well this Dharma Bodhisattvas should be like springs lakes pools and ponds resolved to make the water of the sublime teachings inexhaustibleAnd then heard the words Strike Catch this friend of darknessHow O lord would you explain the inverted conductSome have the heads of humans And the bodies of wild cocks or asseswith excellent marital unions in the pastLike fire and like the blade of a swordHe does so exclusively for this reason and never because he is controlled by pride or the wish for wealth respect or fameand also act for the benefit of sentient beingsOn seeing this the seers said Gentlemen these ascetic sons of the ākya are sanitaryBrother nanda heard from the Bhagavān the prediction of his own attainment of the highest complete enlightenment He heard the description of the qualities of his own buddha realmMonks at that time there was a solitary buddha named Mātaṅga who dwelt on Mount Golāṅgulaparivartana in the city of RājagṛhaIt does not apprehend the world system of form and the world system of formlessnessother bodhisattvas should know that alas for this reason those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage have not been favored by the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and similarly by the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent perfection of generosity and in the same vein that those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage have not been favored by all attributes and attainments up to and including omniscienceLike the rapids of a mountain torrent they quickly pass and are turbulentBecause he has the heroic capacity to guide sentient beings he is called the one who strides with unerring stepsit is the nonapprehension of any entity in anything whatsoeverThey have vast love and compassion for them While remaining in joy and equanimityThey will become weak dogs and jackals And become playthings for othersHe follows the ways of the outsiders without ever becoming an outsiderThe beings who follow that way And those who depend upon themone who is no longer subject to rebirth one who has attained arhatship or individual enlightenment will be reborn in the inferior realmsJust as akra did to the lord of the demigods Here I destroyed with the sword of wisdom The deceptive one who selfobsessed Was powerful enough to rule over the three realmsSon of noble family bodhisattva great beings should not accept anything unless they can imagine giving it away and have an attitude of generosity toward itAnd to see this Lord who has passed into nirvāṇaTherefore young man that is what you should understand through this Dharma teachingYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of knowledge of suffering What are the four kinds of knowledge of sufferingThey will urinate and defecate in the places the saṅgha usesand they do not become fixated on anything at allnor does the expanse of reality consider the sensory element of visual consciousnessThe Blessed One then addressed Senior Subhūti as followsAh Arise you who have escaped from the prison of existence Ah You have sacred supreme wisdom and knowledgeIs the supreme boundary that seals the area All the way to the ends of the surrounding mountainsAnd sees that the mountain is ablaze in glorySome are made of diamondsWhere one understands liberation yet does not enter final and complete liberation there is the domain of the bodhisattvaWhen the sage became a buddha a Dharma king Who taught the nature of all phenomenaSeven hundred and sixty million beings All heard this sūtra The removal of poison brings peace in the worldtogether with a great assembly of twentyfive thousand monks All of them were arhats who had exhausted their outflowsWill be free of the entire multitude of concepts And those wise ones will constantly be in meditation āriputra in the presence of twenty hundred thousand quintillion buddhas that I have ripened you for complete enlightenmentThus you should worry little about such a thing happening in this worldTherefore young man when you have received This Dharma teaching of the samādhiHow Bhadrapāla do you think it runs jumps dances or does any other number of thingsFor so long he has venerated parents monks priests spiritual teachers and worthy ones by putting his head to their feetIt entails absorption in the four formless meditative absorptions by understanding that the three world systems are nonapprehensibleBut the only liberation in store for this mendicant is to get up and fleeHas come in order to listen to this DharmaIt may be a beautiful sight for beings And a marvel for the world and its devas And when a monk perfectly accomplishes it he too becomes an accomplished adept sagacious righteous and an agent of virtueWill be a supreme human Who accomplishes a far greater activityEven at the very top of a tree its seed is not presentNoble son you may wonder about the character of the bodhisattvas skill in dedicationThe maṇḍala should be drawn as beforeSons of noble family with roots of virtue that focus upon diligent application may you acquire the superior intention directed at the Three JewelsSubhūti this is the Great Vehicle of great bodhisattva beings designated as the sameness of the three timesWho are all awaiting youThe horses and elephants even though they were being led along without ridersand having been incinerated they will again become sentient denizens of the great hells in other world systemsNoble son from venerability through to their leading into the city of liberation this is how bodhisattvas areBhikṣus there are the roots of merit in your beings that I have ripened in the pastThe spirits would not show up inside or even outside those peopleaccompanied by eightyfour thousand other beings

made of beeswax who is adorned with the double vajraBodhisattva mahāsattvas who have the restraint of the mind obtain the light rays that are called as bright as flames The noble saṅgha in Samantabhadra Forest Requested you in many different waysKhadira and jujube woods should be lit the ground should be strewn with flower petalsBhagavān why is she so poor in this wayAnd were dedicated to the teaching of that Sugata Were not few but were as numerous as the Ganges sands Those who recite that name are rareThe full extent of the templepalace represents the Buddhas abodeOne should eat as one pleases their fecesRather they were taught by Māra and they were taught by other hereticsIn the great Avīci hell a wall encloses a ground made of burning ironI shall cleanse myself of whatever bad actions I have done in the pastNoble lady though I have done much for this king he has not taken care of mewho was worshiped by everyoneProstrations to the tathāgata Buddha SamantabhadraIn distinction from hearers and solitary buddhas it proceeds without proceedingSubhūti you should know this indeed to be the physical purity the verbal purity and the mental purity of those bodhisattvasHe the Benefactor will attain immortality And bestow absorptions higher knowledge immortality and happinessThe u vowel diacritic and the rest then gradually dissolveA person who is about to die will by reciting the mantra continuously live one hundred yearsthis lotus was foremost throughout the world in terms of knowledge yet untainted by the eight worldly concernsand cultivate wisdomnor is it an object to be actualizedBhagavān childish ordinary beings are neither separate from the teachings of the Buddha nor have they realized themtBlessed One we too will abide by what Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta has explained hereProstrations to the tathāgata in the World without Dust Buddha SiṃhaThe oldest son of KuberaThey are inconceivable and immeasurable vast like spaceWhat is the nature of feelings perceptions and formative predispositionsIt does not pursue gain and honor nor does it pander to othersAlso those whether adults or children Who in learning or for their own amusementHis skin is smooth and goldenIt is the comprehension of the entire three realms It is a raft for crossing to the other shoreIn the same way that a seed emerges from mature trees but not from immature ones at the time of death consciousness appears from the bodyand worship it in the three periods of the day with offerings of fragrant flowers and so forththey will not be those who are seeking for faults in others they will not speak ill of other bhikṣu dharmabhāṇakas they will not say unpleasant things about them they will not state unpleasant things about themWith onepointed mindand they turned the wheel of the sacred doctrine that is equal to the unequaledThere will be no decline in their wisdom After eating one pill one can eat poison without it taking any effectGreat King  Prince Sarvārthasiddha has hair that curls into the forms of the endless knot the mark of auspiciousness the mark of eternal happiness and the mark of prosperityBrahmā master of the world took five hundred divine parasols and offered them to the Blessed One on his rightthe noble man or woman will be among the company of bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have attained retentionAnd why noble son is this so Because the thusgone ones are the Dharma bodyIs there no imputation of the transcendent perfection of generosity and of the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdomGuide for the entire world I salute youMoreover āradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings in order that they might abandon their view of selfThe body of the Bodhisattva as he entered the womb of his mother was just this wayThis is the crown empowermentthe minds of five hundred monks were freed from defilements without further clingingWhen they witness my lionlike display they will direct their minds toward unsurpassed and complete awakeningOn this occasion they then sang these versesSo long as I uphold the Lokāyata philosophy I will not cut my fingernailsSon I can face my own death but I couldnt bear watching my son dieIt is the supreme essence of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara bodhisattvas gained acceptance that phenomena are nonarisingNoble son listen carefully and keep in mind what I will explain to you nowThe dwelling place of the supreme individuals The level not that of the many kinds of tīrthikaYet many hundreds of gods and humansThey bowed down their heads to the Bhagavāns feet circumambulated him three timesThen akra mighty lord of the gods addressed Senior Subhūti as followsand thus ceased accepting gold and silverWhat you may ask are the threeand returns to his former community of tīrthikasListen venerable newly ordained monks nameDue to the absolute purity of what is this purity of phenomena illuminating he askedthe sensory element of the ears the sensory element of sounds and the sensory element of auditory consciousnessI see some bodhisattvas Who forsake all delight in amusementsNārāyaṇa bodhisattvas should not be intimidated by these fourThen the Licchavi Vimalakīrti asked those bodhisattvasāradvatīputra do you think that the designation of the eyes as void or not void constitutes a bodhisattvaPresent here are the heart sons of the Jina Who show the greatest bodhisattva miraclesNoble son replied the Blessed One you should know this Dharma teaching as The Jewel CloudWhen discerning the realm of phenomena to be empty they are free from evilThen Mahāsthāmaprāpta after both the Dharma and the outer form of the Dharma of the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja who had passed into nirvāṇa had ceased to existThe five suffix endings the palace of knowledgeThe Blessed One then said to the bodhisattva great being noble AvalokiteśvaraTherefore be agreeable without malice And always be pleasant to everyoneSome time later the meal was laid out andIf anyone opposes that kind of dharmabhāṇaka someone who upholds this sūtraAnd the length of each of their lives Were to be countless tens of thousands of millions of eons Yakṣas and rākṣasas are vanquished By the body of The Great TrichiliocosmThere is delight in complete peace emptiness and the absence of attributes There is the sound of the lions roar the sound of the compassionate ones The body that is empty and selflesshere are some who might ask that if all those phenomena are neither conjoined nor disjoinedThe heart children of the Jina are present here Gazing at the Jina with hands together in homage  I too father had the dream That was sent by the goddessThen Bhagavān that householder calls that that poor man sonYou compassionate one have appeared here For the sake of all beingsYou may wonder noble son how bodhisattvas remain in the application of mindfulness with respect to the bodyIt is not a construct not a concept inconceivable and not a mental placementNoble son bodhisattvas who wield excellent power possess ten qualitiesyou will have to endure suffering as a denizen in the hell realms for a long time to comeproviding a support for those who have nonethings are not apprehended because the other attainments up to and including unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment are nonapprehensibleSenior āradvatīputra physical forms being empty of inherent existence are internally without support and also they are externally without support and nor do they have any support in between those twois one and the same real nature as the real nature of omniscience They are not two but indivisibleI am the generous giver of the Dharma the Teacher The unexcelled Lord of the DharmaNoble one you are an accepter of alms but we are seekers of meritbore delicious fragrances leaves flowers and fruitsBhagavān we confess this offence of ours we have been always continuously thinking This is our nirvāṇa or We have attained nirvāṇaThen there will be benefit for many beings happiness for many beings compassion for the world and welfare benefit and happiness for a great multitude of beings devas and humansthey do not consider anything at all in terms of minorities and majoritiesnext imagine that this is also the case with the beings who are present in all the worlds in the ten directions as far as space extendsThe lord is surrounded by the eight great kings of the yakṣasSome tried to lure the Bodhisattva with offers of lovePracticing supreme pure Unique bodhisattva conduct The aspect of awakening of complete mindfulness is a gateway to the light of the DharmaFriends a bodhisattva is not conceived in his mothers womb while the moon is waningWhen Gopā and the assembly of consorts awokeHe emanated flocks of melodious soft and beautiful birds of many different shapes and colorshe is the One Who Never Loses His LiberationIn that way he adorned the city of Rājagṛha with countless displaysHe enters Rājagṛha on his alms round Like gold he is of refined nature And bears the thirtytwo markslikewise the transcendent perfection of wisdomintoxicating substances like grain alcohol and its byproducts which leave one uninhibited singingThe Bodhisattva had come to this great celestial palace where he now addressed all the gods of the Heaven of JoyHaving incapacitated the effigy with thorns one should recite the mantrathe defilement of ignoranceWhen iva and other gods heard thisBy means of their excellent discipline they will gather the gods and receive the praise of the thusgone onesIf the right eye throbs it announces something badseparating them from the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path and separating them from emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessnessThe pillars and the wall panels are also burning And the yakṣas and pretas are emitting cries The Blessed One has feet that are marked with the motif of the wheelbeing impervious to all demons and demonic godsBodhisattvas should be objects of veneration never apart from the mind of awakeningWhen such an amazing pure being as this appears Gods and humans acquire a tremendous boonOwing to the utter purity of all things they do not apprehend those who are tied to one more rebirth those who will not be reborn and those who have attained arhatshipWith the King of Aṅga slain Campā fell into Prince Bimbisāras hands at which point he sent a message to King Mahāpadma sayingJust like awakening so also the water elementThe sick bodhisattva should tell himselfand similarly owing to the nonduality of feelings perceptions formative predispositions consciousness and all other attributes up to and including enlightenmentMañjuśrī as you gave this teaching one hundred proud monks liberated their minds from defilement with no further appropriation consciousness which arises contingent on formative predispositionsProtect him the best of menThey perceived the Bodhisattva who was in the womb of his mother in the form of a child who has already taken birth extending his hand and moving it in various positionsSimilarly they illuminate the world systems of the other directions up to and including the intermediate directions numerous as the sands of the River Gangesone part of the potash of barley one part of the potash of plantainAs the Bodhisattva spoke these words Māra the evil one felt very uncomfortable and sadIt is not deliberationBrahmā did you remove the structure that delighted me in the past when I was a bodhisattva and stayed for ten months in my mothers wombIf the Blessed One would grant me the opportunity to ask them and hear his answersnanda so it is that the sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who wish to honor wish to venerate wish to respect and wish to make offerings in the presence of the tathāgatas with diverse flowers and so forth up to and including ribbons and diverse musical soundsSubhūti those individuals who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas immediately having heard this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom form aspirations toward itAlso Subhūti there are great bodhisattva beings who can indeed see with their eyes of flesh across an entire dichiliocosmFor as long as disease has not struck you and you are not old and gray hairedand in the same vein do you think that anything other than the other sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of the mental faculty constitutes a bodhisattvathat the ripened fruit of that action has made his intellect sharper finer and more incisivemade of the wood of the aśoka treeit is because all things are invariably unactualizedHe would offer them robes almsfood bedding seats remedies for exhaustion medicinal herbs and provisionsBeings rejoiced and played and made offerings of food and drinkYou are not tired You are not exhaustedIt will also chase away ghosts spirits of the deceased ghouls gods and demonsThe ingestion of the other gathered substances that bestow the result of omniscienceIt is likewise that this body based on the strength of its merit shows itself adorned by the affluence and wealth of the household of a head merchantSome beings long for omniscient buddhahood for the wisdom of buddhahood for selfarising wisdom for wisdom without a teacherBhagavān what accumulation of good karma has that noble one created such that through that creation of an accumulation of good karma he has attained this excellenceAlthough they see all the deaths transmigrations and rebirths of all beings so clearly with their divine eye ultimately they see nothing whatsoevernor do they come or goVery beautiful they sit there constantly Like a fire in a great darknessThe living beings who are disciplined through an immeasurable period of evolution actually perceive a week to be the passing of an eonHooks of light rays shine forth And immediately they arriveSuch is the bodhisattvas expertise with respect to the vehicles of the hearers and solitary buddhasLook upon those innumerable and uncountable bodhisattvas who dwell in the ten directions in the east south west and north above below and all around and who are now in the sublime realm of the Heaven of JoyListen goddess lower one of your branchesIf you are the master of sense pleasures you should not go to the lower realmsThey did not take their minds and their mental events as me or take them as mine andBhagavān we had no desire for itReverend Mahāmaudgalyāyana even the expression to teach the Dharma is presumptuousMañjuśrī the crown prince is coming here with numerous attendants Now may this house be transformed into emptinessIt penetrates trees and walls and casts no shadowAt that point the ThusGone One addressed the divine beings headed by Maheśvara who had come from the pure realmsThrough the ten virtues limitless beings are tamedMañjuśrī with what in mind do you say soand I will gratify you with answers for each of the questions you askAnd also angerthese are definitively crushed Through the perfection of this great tantrathe concept of selfdemonstrate the dissolution of the adamantine bodywhenever they do not engage with the notions that physical forms are perfected or that they are not

mean you have found ambrosiaThe Bhagavān said to the rākṣasīsSon of a noble family you should view the three bodies of the Tathāgata in the following wayMañjuśrī is there a method by which a lazy bodhisattva great being can be diligentThey arise from detachment with a single aim a single principle reduced to a single thing remaining in a single principle striving with a single conviction wishing all beings to be free with that single wish that very wishVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection cannot be appropriatedIn summer the first month after spring When flowers were covered in buds and bloomingJust as the conditional cause of a body gives rise to the mans desire when he sees the womans formVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is unblemishedWithout being indolent or disheartened They should offer to the Buddhas relicsThis delighted fourfold retinue Is looking at you hero and at meBut that body cannot be measured And therefore it is inconceivable Even a householder practitioner of secret mantra May not take such a womanto win the falsely wise by means of true wisdomSimilarly owing to the fact that physical forms feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are not endowed with the powers of the tathāgatasreducing his body to that of a mere skeleton he asked his motherYou have unimpeded knowledge of the three times Therefore I have asked you my questions lion of the ākyas And quickly attain an immaculate samādhi Those are the benefits of pure correct conduct teach this transcendent perfection of wisdomSimilarly the emptiness of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness is not consciousness and the aforementioned aggregatesIt is not possible O goddessNoble son it is for this reason that the bodhisattvas shave off their hair and beardLifted the hooves of Kaṇṭhaka with their hands That were as spotless and pure as the anthers of a lotus flowerKnowing the nature of form and of the eye is nonattachmentWho are you You cry so heart wrenchingly With disheveled hair and your beauty impaired Lamenting your son so intensely And throwing yourself on the groundThe following ten constitute the absorptions of the bodhisattvasHe will have one thousand sons all of them full fierce warriors with wellbuilt bodies that destroy the armies of the enemyMonks with this purpose in mind the Bodhisattva went to see Rudraka the son of Rāma When he met RudrakaHonor venerate and revere himThey were without afflictions and controlledThe Buddha then said to the venerable UpāliBodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara now radiated many blue yellow red white crystal and silver light rays that reached Tathāgata ViśvabhūGoddess I speak truthfullythe samādhi named Sublime GiftFrom the torment of illness misery and aging You have no other refuge than good actions They will see themselves honoring venerating and making offerings to those tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas and to the stūpas of those tathāgatas with flowers garlands incense unguents powders religious robes clothing parasols victory banners ribbons and diverse musical soundsmahoragas humans and nonhumans kings of regions balacakravartinsThey will not end up in the intermediate eon of weaponsThis was the eleventh chapter on the arrangement of mantras from The Glorious Tantra of the Vajra in the UnderworldLook at akra lord of the gods as he is playing enjoying and amusing himself with the five divine objects of pleasure in his Palace of VictoryNirvāṇa is the basisSimilarly I do not hold the emptiness of the essential nature with respect to unarisen feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness to ariseakra will only listen to the one with such invincible powerBhadrapāla it assumes whatever scent is predominantThese noble ones do not delight in the activities of society they delight in the absence of society Their diligence does not weaken they apply themselves with diligenceHe will also attain receptivity to the birthlessness of phenomenaOr imagining ones own wife as having the form of the goddess one should do the practiceFrom a seed comes a sprout from a sprout a leaf from a leaf a stem from a stem a pedicel from a pedicel a pistil from a pistil a flower and from a flower comes a fruitArising through conditions and as deceptive as a dream If you leave the city will become disturbed and steeped in darknessas well as mundane beings including gods humans antigods and gandharvasIf you ask what is aspirationlessness as a gateway to liberationThose sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who cultivate unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment who practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom just as it has been explained and who despite practicing with that goal do not remain on the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas because they do not actualize the finality of existence associated with those levels are all worthy of homageVenerable Lord This purity of phenomena is not subject to involuntary reincarnationMay they ensure that even food mixed with the five impure foods Is unadulterated for meWho have no respect toward celibates They are unable to understand enlightenment I see it Lord Here before me is a display of splendor such as I never before heard of or beheldWell said well saidthere came a boy whom they nurtured and raised until he grew into a manthe one with the peaceful mind the one who has perfected tranquilityO White Vulture devour the poison and the harmful anger

remember you when we have returned to SarvagandhasugandhāGrahadattaIn this way Subhūti do great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of perseveranceEven Prasenajit King of Kosala would regard himself as a pauper were he to see Bhadrapālas power wealth and prosperityāradvatīputra just as the notion of a tathāgata arhat and completely perfect buddha having the four applications of mindfulness is without foundationnanda long ago the Tathāgata the arhat the completely and perfectly enlightened Buddha Sukhābha lived in this worldIt is thus that they perfect the transcendent

views might great bodhisattva beings adopt with respect to all thingsthose fruits are without essential nature and they themselves are not satisfied merely by abiding thereinSimilarly I identify with sights and likewise with sounds odors tastes and tangiblesall attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are pureIn what way O lord does Great Bliss arise in the body through the union of wisdom and meansdue to the maturation of sentient beings previous karmaThey shake the entire earth With its mountains and oceans Mañjuśrī how is thatRoṣaṇa is angry at himShould I join them there or participate in the purification hereThe encounter of the seed with the flower acts as a condition for the mingling of the scent and the sesame oilto be tied down by deceitBhaiṣajyarāja the Tathāgatas Dharma robe is great patience and gentlenessin all such cases those men women boys and girls who have the disposition of ordinary people would thinkneither a concept nor not a conceptYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of mantra words What are the four kinds of mantra wordsThey dwelt in those hundreds of parks Where there were the blossoms of karnikaraWith patient acceptance they do not develop any malicious intentIt is not easy to find a Dharma teacherHe inspired them he filled them with joy and he guided them Then he rose from his seat and departedwho desires the Dharma should attend to the spiritual friendthey will be afraid and terrified on hearing this teaching concerning the transcendent perfection of wisdomHis buddha realm will be completely pure level delightful attractive beautiful made of crystal adorned by jewel treesAnd so on up to manifesting the relics of a tathāgata for beings who are to be guided by the relics of a tathāgataWhen they fail to obtain anything they do not become sad or despondent and they do not lose faith in their donors or benefactorsHaving heard these words the ten thousand Brahmās were inspired with high resolve and conceived the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenmentIn that state they asked questions such as What is this How did this come about and What is the nature of this but could find nothingThis bodhisattva has brought sentient beings to maturity and that one has notOne should eat the powder of emblic myrobalan and ground sesame with clarified butter and honey Then the effect will be the samenanda then allowed the two to go forththey do not think that they should actualize itAnd they will not request anything from their followersIf one were to ask why it is because those transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom are empty of the transcendent perfection of wisdom and the aforementioned transcendent perfectionsIt is free from elaboration and stainlessāradvatīputra the ten aspects of knowledge are merely conceptualizedAnd although they were your executioners you still remained forbearingin your fierce form expel expeland the venerable Saṅgharakṣita like a swan spreading its wings flew with his miraculous powers up into the sky above tmay I cause all beings to achieve smooth fine and golden skinHundreds of thousands of other beings were also present such as gods and goddesses of the night guardians of the world Varuṇa iva Yama Virūḍhaka Kubera akra Virūpākṣa and Dhṛtarāṣṭra as well as asuras garuḍas gandharvas kiṃnaras and mahoragasHe would not react against the teaching of DharmaSubhūti the passage commencing with the words the illusionist or the skilled apprentice of an illusionist as indicated above along with the examples given in the first part of this chapter leu dang po is similarly applicable hereWho always practice emptiness devoid of attributes They will soon become sugatas in the world Like grasshoppers fallen into a forest fireSubhūti great bodhisattva beings should consider such matters at the outset by training in the bodhisattva path thinkingSimilarly I identify with the transcendent perfection of generosityWhen their feet are cut through on the great road of razors as they lift that foot another foot will replace itthere is no suitable analogy for it and there is no suitable simile for itWhen it comes to the time of death And their thoughts are continuinghe and  gods were reborn together in the Totally Immaculate world system the buddhafield of the thusgone one the foedestroyer the completely perfect buddha Immaculately Renowned KingWe have learned them from his son the young brahmin UpatiṣyaSon of noble family the extent of the ThusGone One Amitābhas life is boundless Even if you had a trillion eons to describe its limits it would not be easyBecause he is seeking enlightenment He will be the son of all those jinasThey are the inconceivably numerous words of nonmovement concerning the compositeFurthermore Mañjuśrī a bodhisattva who sees all phenomena as arising from the ground of space will attain purification of karmic obscurationsAs the bhikṣu had been walking upon the kings road some dust had blown into one of his eyesHowever venerable āradvatīputra affliction is the very nature of the realm of phenomenaMay all the merit gained thereby go to all beings So that they may reach precious supreme peaceful and blissful awakeningNoble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities never separate from their spiritual teachersThey have become trained when they carry out their activities when they acknowledge what they have done instead of failing to acknowledge itne billion realms of the Cloudless HeavenOwing to the utter purity of all things they do not apprehend fundamental ignorance and they do not apprehend the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death    tAnd so he traveled through various villages cities towns countries kingdoms and palaces teaching the Dharma to others In this waySensory contact that is visually compounded is empty of sensory contact that is visually compounded and so with the other compounded aspects of sensory contact up to and including sensory contact that is mentally compounded which is empty of sensory contact that is mentally compoundedmy illness would be assuagedI should establish them in individual enlightenmentThe Blessed One was staying in rāvastī at Jeta Grove in the park of AnāthapiṇḍadaWhatever the wise bodhisattvas do They always follow the nature of the DharmaMahāsthāmaprāpta the one known by the fourfold assemblies as Sadāparibhūta at the time on that occasion of the teaching of the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja pleased that number of tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhasRather bodhisattvas minds take delight supreme delight in correctly knowing the qualities of a buddhaWith this inward disengagement without moving outwardly they move to ripen others Through the disengagement of their diligence they understand the disengagement of sentient beingsMañjuśrī a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the result of attaining the streamFinds inspiration only in the ministers skill And will not fully pierce the knowledge of the kingA lord of the world appears in the world In order to teach the wisdom of buddhahoodStanding in front of the king he saidThey will betray their bodhicitta the mind of enlightenment and go to the lower realmsWhen never giving up on any sentient being they are irreproachablethey were in charge of begging bowls and they said to an arhat novice who had at the time been appointed keeper of the sealsseason transforms the seedIt is therefore considered a very serious transgression that leads to rebirth in the lower realmsSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who possess those attributes indications and signs are revealed to be irreversibleEnthralled and satiated With such delightsBut the sage determined to benefit beings Through his accumulation of merit did not turn back The buddhas in all directions who have passed away And those of the future and those who are presenta modality that is unattractivewith the exception of defecating urinating throwing away his toothbrushIn this way by a mere utterance one effects the protection from all fearsof the store of wisdom which is consummated in the uniform gnosis free of acceptance and rejection in regard to all thingsthat noble man or noble woman will gain eight hundred qualities of the eyesknows neither arising disintegration nor remainingIf he should ask Does an afterlife neither exist nor not existWhile you are bound by all bonds I have been definitively freed from all bondsone should hold a sword wrought from fine iron in ones handHe may show the ways of the passions yet he is utterly dispassionate and naturally pureand the most prominent of allWe could say the same about the southern direction the western direction the northern direction below above or indeed any of the ten directionsEven the words the lower realms The pretas animal birth the beings of hell And even the word woman will ever stay unheardBodhisattvas similarly are naturally soft and speak gentlyBhagavān if there are not three yānasHave no concept of pride and no concept of no pride No concept of ignorance and no concept of no ignoranceThey will hear even those completely pure words And they will remember everything that has been taughtand canopies that were all of the finest quality and produced all forms of unexcelled exuberanceWhere should the liberation of the tathāgatas be soughtBecause what is pure does not become pure it just is pureIn the same vein they should meditate on the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path andThen one will obtain the girl one desirespossess it keep it recite it to others promote itIt is the knowledge of the minds conditionThis divine being is the bodhisattvas revelation of his correct knowledge purified through diligenceSimilarly it should be applied to the applications of mindfulness and to the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path and to the ten powers of the tathāgatas and the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasThat these two pristine beings have come together Is just like butter and clarified butterTaking sixty of the bandits who had been captured alive General Virūḍhaka returned to the king with the stolen goodsThey should regard various possessions as utter encumbrancesHis lifespan and the period of his sacred Dharma will also be the sameThe bodhisattvas there are fortytwo hundred thousand leagues tall and their own thrones are thirtyfour hundred thousand leagues high as oozing pustules large pustules small pustules exanthema leprosyMay I complete the perfection of generositySo the four kings came back with four alms bowls made of silver four made of beryl four made of quartz four made of coral four made of emerald and four made of every gemSon can you match the ways of calculation with the great mathematician Arjuna an expert in the knowledge of numbersIf someone wishing to go forth approaches any of youIt teaches the absence of conflict with respect to phenomena and is a gateway to special insight with regard to all phenomenaLord when Vimalakīrti had discoursed thus eight hundred householders in the crowd conceived the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenmentReverend Saṅgharakṣita are you not thirsty Are you not hungrydoes not distinguish between those situationsand if two echoes were to reverberate from the sound of the words of those two peopleSimilarly do those sentient beings resemble a phantomJust like sentient beings so are the fieldsBodhisattvas should have great compassion striving for the aims of all beingsthose of us overcome by greed thought and even said We should not serve the food until the visiting monks have leftSimilarly the sensory elements are empty of notions of I and minethey comprise  the power of faith  the power of perseverance  the power of recollection  the power of meditative stability and  the power of wisdomTo Sarvābhibū you offered a pearl necklace and to Sāgara a lotus flowerthe knowledge of the pathBased on this presumption when at the time of death they see their coming rebirth they become apprehensive uncertain and doubtful about the Buddhas enlightenmentVenerable Lord The more great bodhisattva beings approach unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentfor those in meditative concentration like a fire lensThey will have unrestrained bodies and unrestrained speech And unrestrained minds and will descend to the lower existences Whatever taste is unpleasant will be transformed when it comes in contact with the tongue into a divine flavorIf these do not exist and are not apprehensible how could one be liberated by perceiving them as entities or by perceiving them as nonentities or by perceiving them as both entities and nonentitiesA paṇḍaka is one who will not flourish in the Dharma and Vinaya thereforeAs midnight arrived the Bodhisattva spoke to Chanda In a voice captivating like Brahmās and sweet as a nightingaleNow when it is your turn you do not answer the question beings to the level of wheelbearing monarchEven the names of the sense fields of total consummation do not exist internally nor do they exist externally and nor do they abide between these twobut the body of the Tathāgata is without the slightest thoughtO Buddha O Dharma O SaṅghaSubhūti so it is that when great bodhisattva beings train accordingly in the real nature of these attributes they do train in omniscienceAs due to the coming together of six elementsdivine aromatic substances appearthe five powersThey do not attach importance to meditative concentrationLord for the sake of all sentient beings please explain the secret of enlightened mindWhat do you think Mahauṣadhiwhich is greater the poison that Nanda Upananda and so on have at their disposal or a drop of aconite or hālāhalaBodhisattva Mahāsattva Sarvaśūra Those who know that phenomena have no self Have an empty nature and the characteristic of clarityAccepting interdependence does not disturb its peace it is infinitely peaceful It is reality itself Its nature is none other than that not like that or neitherYou are not able to know What malicious thoughts others have Or what kind thoughts they haveGreat King if you look in our scriptures you will see that the prince Sarvārthasiddha will not stay at homeThey are tied down by envy and miserliness and suffer from an abundance of afflictionsAn attribute of bhagavān buddhas is that whenever they smile light radiates from their mouths in myriad colors such as blue yellow red white vermillion crystalline and silverof fine physiquewithout their parents consent from faraway lands where their parents could not be consultedand so forth up to not considering the wisdom of omniscienceWhich is profound hard to behold and subtleBecause he is endowed with the Dharma body and the wisdom body he is genuinely beyond all worldly concernsThe real nature of those great bodhisattva beings engages with this real nature of phenomenaSimilarly O gods this doctrine is profound owing to the profundity of the selfThis has not been spoken by the TathāgataThe same goes also for the world system of formlessnessThey should not dwell on the notion that physical forms are empty nor should they dwell on the notion that they are not emptyKnowing the Dharma is a gateway to the light of the Dharma for it leads one to apply the Dharma assiduously and in the correct mannerAlso there were eight hundred million with the same name Of SvabhāvadharmottaraniścitaThere the Bodhisattva blessed the surrounding area which was as vast as the entire world with its four great continentsO Vāgīśvara muḥthe inconceivably numerous accumulations of wisdom concerning the kleśasWhen a bodhisattva considers the giver and the recipient to be the sameness of the limit of reality such a bodhisattva will have departed by means of the perfection of insightThat is to say the three vehicles are indeed designated as the vehicle of the śrāvakas the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas and the vehicle of the genuinely perfect buddhasspace has no locationand attain the ability and power to work for the benefit of all sentient beingsIt seems love cannot pacify the attachment anger or delusion of beings nor any of the afflictions they have accrued over the course of infinite eonsIf he should exert himself then all is wellThen bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya thoughtHe is unstained like a lotus and his discipline smells sweet like a flowerThen he flew through the air from one shore to the otherThey did not think about it and did not come outthey bowed to the ThusGone One and then stood to one sideThe maturation of the development of the aggregates formed from birth and their disintegration is what is meant by birth causes aging and deathWhen bodhisattvas practice generosity they do not give refuseBy the fruition of the practice of that disciplinePracticing for enlightenment without pride And attaining the absence of pride is the highest enlightenment The golden lotuses have a golden hue a golden sheen and manifest as goldThe Tathāgata who has attained perfect buddhahood a long time ago has an immeasurable lifespanThey will always meet the Buddha hear the Dharma and the Saṅgha will be honoredIn this way the main gods as numerous as grains of sand in the Ganges became accomplishedKing uddhodana then said to the BodhisattvaSo that the beings who hear about the qualities will have faith And you cause them to aspire to the qualities of a buddha If one were to ask why Venerable Lord it is because physical forms are empty of physical formsFrom the mouths of both the organs of their tongues emergedOne sick monk even died for lack of someone to nurse himthey are liberated from the six existences of the three realmsfinally all the villages suburbs cities capitals provinces and wildernesses All this could be clearly seen by everyoneand with the great miraculous manifestation of leading a following of devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kinnaras mahoragas humans and nonhumansnoble sons I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit that comes from the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras The Sūtra of the Baskets DisplayThe bornblind man does not have faith in those people and does not believe what they have saidGentlemen whose army is thisWhat is having veneration and experiencing joy It is knowledge through realization and knowledge through scriptureWhat two qualities Thoroughly applying themselves in calm abiding and developing skill in insightYet our family rule is such that a girl can only be granted to someone who is skilled in the arts and not to a man who lacks these skillsThe king gained faith in the Sugata And attended him for a thousand years  Compared to someone who with a pure mind Has honored for millions of eons as numerous as the Ganges sandsFree from name and formIt is after training therein that the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas are discerned in the worldOnly beings who have created previous merit have such dreamsand as she moves to the next life she will take ordinationvenerable MahākapphiṇaOr they see it like a great swamp or like walking on swords Or like the edge of a knife smeared with honeyThey are not noble son answered the Blessed OneWhen you have a seed a sprout can grow Yet the seed is not the sprout Still it is not differentThey spread their great love and compassion throughout all the worlds of the ten directionsat that time they are near to the highest complete enlightenmentThe universal monarch merely has to think of commissioning an army and it is doneSeeing this the thusgone ones wish to show them the extreme impermanence of things Thus arises their great compassion for sentient beingsSeeing such beings the thusgone ones wish to teach them the Dharma so that they can muster diligence and pursue liberation Thus arises the thusgone ones great compassion for sentient beingsUltimately it is not about generating wisdom nor is it about bringing wisdom to an endThose beings who had faith in the Jinas teaching Made offerings to him and honored him On the relative level nonconceptuality is a gateway to the absence of disturbing emotionsSo his time came and he died and he was reborn among the denizens of Avīci the Great Hell of Unrelenting TormentHe has a distinctively erotic appearancenonarising is nondisturbanceFor that buddha I built Ten million monasteries Made of special sandalwood And some of precious materials In this way the true nature knows no permanence or impermanenceImagine that a man comes to experience the taste of a fruit that no other sentient being has ever tasted beforeVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection constitutes the facultiesFree from any concerns it does not keep anything in mindWhen manifesting the attainment of the fruition they are irreproachablethey practice their generosity with a mind endowed with omniscienceMonks these two themselves performed the actionswhich have accrued a heap of karma whose results have maturedSocalled desire can be understood to be imperfectThrough that merit he created He always taught this sūtra and finallyI left my capital city Ratnāvatī On the way to a place that was a park They scattered to the gates of the cities From house to houseWhen the things in which those beings are engaged are examinedWhoever wishes to venerate the guides And likewise the solitary buddhas and the listeners Should give steady rise to the mind of awakening And always keep this sūtra firmly in mindcreating harmony through material things means to share food drink soup beverages snacks clothing and so on equally with everyone elseand lack of knowledgeshould be worshiped as a thusgone one and should be regarded as ones own parentIf you wish to please me do not delay thisSimilarly past feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are empty of past consciousness and so forthTadyathā aṭṭe naṭṭe tanaṭṭe anate nāti kunaṭi svāhāIt shows Gopā that soon I will illuminate with the light of knowledge The entire world which is plagued by delusion and the darkness of ignoranceWith faces of camels oxen and elephants and terrifying eyesBecause he is born due to conditions and causesshould hear this revealed equality of the nature of all phenomena samādhi and obtain it understand itthrough the force of his merit the Bodhisattva will conquer Māras armyA person who is a convert to a tīrthika order is one who will not flourish in the Dharma and Vinaya He was a king of physicians for this entire world And he was always healing beingsBy living a lie evil is incurred And from evil a rebirth in helland they do not dedicate it to the level of the pratyekabuddhas butFor since all living beings are utterly liberated the tathāgatas see them as having the nature of ultimate liberationAnd there are others far more numerous With assemblies that are numerousOffering food represents the achievement of longevity luster power and happinessThe past itself is also the nature of spaceSince liberation is inexpressible goddess I do not know what to sayIt has equality and has no inequality There is no desire and there is no aversionSubhūti do you think that signlessness is one thing and the attributes of the pratyekabuddhas are anotherEven though they are born in the animal realms for the sake of sentient beingsFrom the left side Bhayaṃkara saidAll these dharmas are immaculate peaceful And devoid of cessation and birthBhagavān I have come here from the buddha realm of the bhagavān tathāgata RatnatejobhyudgatarājaBālāha the king of horses was enjoying the sarvaśetāna herb When he had finished enjoying it he rolled back and forth on the golden sand and shook his bodyWhen the best of beings has passed into nirvāṇa I will uphold this sūtra in that very difficult time  There is no essence here to be known whatsoever There is no coming no going that is the subtle mode of phenomenaand those who listen to it listen to presumptionThinking My son with inferior aspiration Works at clearing away rubbish heapsThereupon the Licchavi Vimalakīrti kept his silence saying nothing at allIndeed would anything be heard or cognized by any sentient beingWhy is that It is because a woman has still not attained five statesFriends close relatives cousins kings ministersThe skilled bodhisattvas while seated Grasp the sun and moon in their handsWho are upholders of this highest sūtra When the Guide of the World has passed into nirvāṇaThen five thousand celestial maidens bearing divine childrens ornaments came before the Bodhisattvas mother and asked how the birth was and whether she was wearySubhūti great bodhisattva beings who possess those attributes indications and signs are revealed to be irreversibleand at that time in that era in the realm Virajā He replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of creatorsand also bhikṣus bhikṣunīs upāsakas and upāsikās who followed the rāvakayānaYet immovable and calmOne of red nature should make love to a red girland thus not abandon all sentient beingsSince all these phenomena arise erroneously from dependent origination and have been grasped through the maturation of past actions what other cause can there be for your perception of nonentities as entitiesCovering themselves with their upper robes they addressed him as followsthe requisites for happiness pleasure and sensual enjoyments that Bhadrapāla commandsThey have no longing for songs and no longing for dance They have no longing for incense and no longing for drinkHomage to Tathāgata DrumarājavivardhitaśrīHaving obtained honey and turmeric One should mix it with milk and

did you not see I obtained this resting place by making a pactThey do not consider whether the eyes have aspirations or are without aspirationsYou may wonder noble son how bodhisattvas remain in the application of mindfulness with respect to the mindAs another analogy were the nāga kings Nanda Upananda and so on to drink but a tiny drop of poisonous aconite or hālāhala even they would dieThey

might establish a single sentient being in the result of an arhatReverend a small number of elder monks and a large number of new monks discussed the matter during the rains retreat in RājagṛhaMaitreya how do such bodhisattva mahāsattvas have emancipation in the perfection of wisdomAll phenomena are nondual and thus without gatewayand you should know that they are not his arhats or

by the illusionist or the skilled apprentice of an illusionist actually turn into an elephant or that they turn into a horse bull or another living creatureSubhūti all the attributes of the buddhas have the modality of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment great bodhisattva beings too do not transgress this modalityHe saw all the cities towns estates kingdoms royal cities and lands as well as all gods and humansthe fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasThrough offering incense to infinite wisdomthere are not in all those hundreds of

be novices but will have practiced the roots of merit for a long timeAnd made this gift continuously For as many eons as there are sands of the Ganges The signs will be seen in dreams And the accomplishments themselves will manifestThe Blessed One is endowed with a hair ringlet that grows between his eyebrows and which is as soft as cotton and white as a water lily the moon a conch the

recollect many former abodesor who had a body belonging to the animal realmthey achieve and maintain the other meditative concentrations up to and including the fourth meditative concentrationThe Bhagavān now looked toward the eighty thousand bodhisattvas who had attained retention and had turned the irreversible Dharma wheelAt that time the bodhisattva Maitreya was present in that very retinueowing to inappropriate actions simply regress from those superior attributes to the interim states which comprise the level of the śrāvakas and the level of the pratyekabuddhasSimilarly I

has transcended all mundane qualitiesYou should not teach this to those who are proud Who are arrogant and who are unsuitableHowever noble son unlike deer bodhisattvas who live in the wild are not constantly afraid and they do not have any of the shortcomings of deerIt is neither miracululous nor magicalhaving heard this teaching of the Dharma of the great heroic bodhisattvas and being delighted pleased and overjoyedHe replied This is owing to its transcending of all the doctrines of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhasOne should draw a triangular maṇḍala on cotton smeared with the mark of the moonThey also possess that which is secret Which they do not teach to beingswhether they are holding an outer patched robe a waist cloth or an alms bowlthey understand that the fruit of entering the stream is neither with attachment nor is it without attachmentFrom the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment great bodhisattva beings should be steadfastThey have no other refuge here It brings the attainment of omniscient wisdomwho commit this transcendent perfection of wisdom to writing and then retain hold master andHow should they train in equanimityThe

commanded by the vidyādharas and Kaśika clothBetween phenomena there is no distinction And through knowing that there is cessation my insight was now free and pure Monks at that point I declared that I had awakened to unsurpassable perfect and complete buddhahoodIn this way bodhisattva great beings do not disappoint the blessed buddhasrecognition of ugliness recognition of putrefaction recognition

of defining characteristics the defining characteristics of defining characteristics and their combinations are concerned it is impossible for any of them to know and for any of them to be knownWhat is attending upon wise beings It is attending upon buddhashen the retinue of sixtyeight hundred thousand queensCandraprabha perfectly extensively adorned His vast and excellent homeit is because sentient beings deserve to be offered sanctuary and because the bodhisattvas escort them to the citadel of fearlessnessit denotes the meditative absorptions starting from the first meditative concentration and continuing as far as the sense field of neither perception nor nonperceptionThere are world realms where the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara teaches the Dharma to beings in the form of bodhisattva mahāsattvashaving ignorance and being without ignorance having craving and being without cravingThey will reach a place of supreme joy and genuinely take refuge Always rejecting the dharma of the foolish Rejecting all that disgraces the family of the BuddhaYet your mind is liberated from all migrationsThe guide of the world Abhijñājñānābhibhū Was seated upon the Bodhimaṇḍathe

taught by the victorious onesIf you ask what is the tolerance that understands the profound nature of phenomenaAjita when in this teaching I saw the light ray of this kind that was the Bhagavāns omennot examining ones past and present actions to be concerned with what is irrelevant to examine what should not be examinednanda whoever hears without hearing a little of this Dharma teaching even if it is just a single syllablesome mansions were made of flowers of nutmeg jasmine magnolia pāṭalam mountain ebony aloe flower and gotaraṇi Like the flower of the fig tree It is extremely difficult to find a jinaand neither their sprouts nor their flowers are apparent within the body of the seedhis is the armor of the transcendent perfection of wisdom offered by great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomGiving up all such places that are in discord with the way of ordained practitioners entirely they remain in the application of mindfulness with respect to such placesThe thirtytwo goddessesIn that respect Mañjuśrī what does it mean to be cut off from the three spheresAnd then one should not visualize even the light raysThose who possess these marks of one hundred merits do indeed outshine akra Brahmā all the worlds protectors śrāvakas and solitary buddhasWith his palms joined he stands facing the assemblyIt then occurred to him When there is no

work It was later modified and finalized in terms of the new translationthe samādhi of the crest adornment of the victory bannerHence the mantra thereby established Has indeed been taught by the buddhasit is devoid of arising it is devoid of production it is devoid of cessationAt night when the old and young in this city were deeply asleepWhen bodhisattvas practice diligence they do not relish the taste of diligenceand similarly no sensory element of the eyes sensory element of sights or sensory element of visual consciousnessthe aspirationlessness that is a gateway to liberationLike a wishfulfilling jewel he fulfilled all aspirationsWithout overlapping or being squeezed In that way the Buddhas Dharma is inconceivable Son of noble family bodhisattva great beings who wish to achieve this absorption that encapsulates all merit should avoid everything that is not meritorious and exert themselves in taking up everything that is meritoriousSince they have worshiped the shrines teachings and saṅghas of the thusgone ones with abundant service adherence and practiceIf it is the sole that twitches it is far awayAnd those jinas have as many buddha realms too Each one separate and with distinct characteristics He should then ask the disciple to recite Ah pleasureThere is no being in the ten directions Who can equal the Lord of the World let alone be greaterReverend what is it that the venerable Koṣṭhila has doneThey do not attach importance to perseveranceBhagavat I have never seen nor heard of tathāgatas having the kind of accumulation of merit that Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has let alone bodhisattvasIn response the Blessed One expressed his approval to the Four Great Kings saying Excellent excellent great kingsAnything that is conceptualized neither arises nor ceases and is only conventionally designated by names and symbolsVenerable Lord This transcendent perfection of wisdom is profound I have committed the sin of slaying the bhikṣu Which was extremely wicked and will destroy my happinessSo you the noblest and most powerful of menIf you ask why Subhūti it is because this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom with which great bodhisattva beings are endowed has the great benefit of attaining unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmenttWhoever sees all phenomena as unarisen has abandoned its originThe nāgas and the others replied Excellent Blessed One They then listened appropriately The Blessed One is endowed with calves resembling those of an antelopeIt is difficult for all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas to knowFor what reason Mother it is because the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Jaladharagarjitaghoṣasusvaranakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña is teaching extensively the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma to the world and its devas and we are going to listen to itReverend if the Blessed One says an impostor should be excludedIt is like when a person who is foolishtMañjuśrī I too have been inspired to speak about the way in which bodhisattva great beings carry out the bodhisattva practicesOther food too as availableIt does not move toward objectsthey

other aggregates up to and including consciousness not one thingThe wandering mendicant reṇika indeed became a follower of the Great Vehicle endowed with faith owing to the power of his volition and he subsequently entered into it by understanding the emptiness of inherent existenceand in the same vein there are no causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighty minor marksYou who know how beings engage in various good deeds Please divulge everything by way of a prophecythose who harbor thoughts of falling into the vehicles of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhasRather it is the sway of these two young brahminsRenunciation is itself the very absence of virtues and benefitsThis noble son is entitled the Maheśvara episodeToday Guide these various kinds Of wondrous and superior marvels have occurredand then honor revere respectHe made three circumambulations of the Blessed One and prostrated himself Then kneeling on his right knee Vajrapāṇi requestedSo it is Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom determine those things which are dreamlike those things which are like a phantom and so forthāriputra the man then saw the great fire burning everywhere throughout his houseFor ten million eons We shall feel compassion for beingsThose bodhisattva great beings who seek to increase their merit will listen to this absorption that encapsulates all meritConsider noble son the analogy of the earthThey will regard the sacred Dharma as an elixir ambrosia and medicineThis profound transcendent perfection of wisdom is hard to realizeThe bodhisattva Priyadarśana declaredConsider noble son the analogy of the moon during the dark fortnightand thus bodhisattvas continue the pursuit of the qualities that complete the accumulations for awakeningSimilarly bodhisattvas are constantly flowing constantly streaming and constantly moving toward omniscienceSimilarly the nonarising of all other attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience is not omniscience and the restindeed there is no arisingOne should drink seeds of Indian sesbania with black pepper over the period of three daysWho is openminded and suffers because of never having heard the DharmaBhagavān we are just like that We are unaware of the past prayers That the Tathāgata has given us In many lifetimes in the past a long time agoand with his blazing intelligenceVenerable Lord Those who would don this armor for the sake of sentient beings are actually seeking to buttress the skyAh You have divine hearing and possess the supreme DharmaOf all the Tathāgatas śrāvakas Who are present here The māras advocate this life of birth and death and the bodhisattva does not avoid lifeThese are the thirtytwo marks of a superior manO

and reverberate when struck by the Bodhisattva with his handhe was in suffering and unhappy and therupon he recited these lines of verse to that great assembly of bodhisattvas The Blessed One is endowed with a hair ringlet that grows between his eyebrowswill not find any such opportunityThey listen without listening to the instructions beyond reference pointsconsume them with a mind free of concepts and devoid of intrinsic natureThe bodhisattva who maintains retention Remains loving always unwavering and unshakableāradvatīputra those great bodhisattva beings have embarked on unsurpassed

following extensive verses to the youth CandraprabhaO child of enlightened heritage The eyes are empty of notions of I and mineEven the many countless millions of eons That all those dust particles represent Could not convey how many eons have come to an end Since that sugata passed into nirvāṇaThe Blessed One then said to youthful MañjuśrīIt is false being fated to be broken and destroyed in

with a great saṅgha of five hundred monks and with twelve hundred bodhisattvas all of whom had obtained dhāraṇīsThey should scent it with aromatic jarsI would not generate any thoughts of anger toward any sentient beingsSimilarly they should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that I should cultivate ten powers of the tathāgatasFor this reason too great bodhisattva beings who do not realize the uniformity of all things are worthy of homageVenerable Lord By acquiring which mnemonic incantations do the irreversible great bodhisattva beings not squander the sūtras spoken by the Tathāgataand relying on that kalyāṇamitra I fulfilled the six perfectionsSupreme Being you shine forth Like the king of mountains in the middle of the oceanThis is the vow of personal liberationI will explain various methodsFor someone who has wished to hear itIt is because it genuinely transcends the three times that this vehicle is called the Great VehicleIn order to make happy the fourfold assembly he gives them the gift of the town of nirvāṇa and the great city of the DharmaThey have perfect intent due to an unwavering motivationThe hungry and the thirsty were relieved of their hunger and thirstThey will never be separated from the mnemonic incantations that are neither fettered nor liberatedwhen those individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas are endowed with faith tolerance confidence higher aspiration willingness volition and renunciationare free from dustAnd also If there is anyone who could make use of anything I have I will give that thing to that being without any resentment or regretBrother Nanda Brother UpanandaSimilarly there are views concerning the applications of mindfulness the correct exertions the supports for miraculous ability the faculties the powers the branches of enlightenment the noble eightfold path and liberationOnce the sprout has been produced red white or blue flowers will ariseYou have no recollection or mental placementFall down and lick her lotusthe individuals who are tied to one more rebirth the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth the individuals who are no longer subject to rebirthIn that respect Mañjuśrī bodilessness is what cannot be cognized by the eye consciousnessneither effort nor slothHe continued to ponder The monk Gautama is said to have a great deal of powerSuch suffering has befallen us and there are no prospects for livingBhikṣus I remember that in the past in a time gone by he was a holder of the Dharma of nine hundred and ninety million buddhas What will assuage your illness my good man asked the prince What shall I give youVenerable Lord Similarly it is dependent on these great bodhisattva beings that the gods of the Caturmahārājakāyika realm are discernedVenerable one the mind does not have any form and it cannot be shown It has no appearance yet is unimpeded It has no dwelling and is imperceptibleWhat wise man could reject Such noble leadershipWhen recited continuously it will bring enormous gloryor discarderhe teaches Dharma without attachment to theseLikewise so long will the paths of the ten virtuous actions emerge in the worldThose who write teach and worship this teaching of the Dharma will be visited by the Tathāgata in their homesappropriation relinquishment conceptualization dependence clingingNoble son this Dharma teaching has been taught by the seven thusgone onesI sewed a precious jewel a priceless jewel that could fulfill all your desires into the hem of your clothes so that you could live happilyNoble one my spouse has conceived a childyou do not form concepts about the worldthe stride that actualizes the attainment of omniscient wisdomWe have gained great benefit from having seen a holy man such as heManifest praise to the teachings spoken by the Blessed OneThe Kurukullā yogin Should dissolve a pearl on account of the eyeHe has renounced the earth with its oceans along with countless precious objectsThat would not be a very difficult task And would not take such great dedicationlikewise all the aggregates up to and including consciousness are not a selfIf you ask why it is because they do not consider the nature of these sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of auditory consciousnessFor the one who must be trained by gods a god will be emanated and to the one who is to be tamed by Vajrapāṇi the latter will appearThey will see a great hero A tathāgata on GṛdhrakūṭaFirst the deceased person agitated and distressed sees various hellbeings appearThey said Father do not speak such words We will not slay such a bhikṣu Boys would you visit every place of which you hearDaśarathaputra transformed himself into a dwarf who wore a deerskin as a sash held a bamboo staff and carried a stoolthen we will have insulted the Blessed One and we will have failed to protect the Dharmait is because ultimately all phenomena are the same in being utterly unarisen and the bodhisattva great beings are the sameYoung brahmin you did say thatWhat is having that which will bring benefit to others It is benefiting othersThey resemble donkeys and they explain the Dharma most clearlyMonks this monk Saṅgharakṣita comes with gifts for the TathāgataIf you ask Subhūti how great bodhisattva beings act as a protector of the worlds in this regardMonks the ThusGone One then accepted the alms bowl from the great king Vaiśravaṇa regarding him with compassionThey will also refine their respective buddhafieldsVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is like an echoHave returned to the park so dont worry anymoreMañjuśrī what do you thinkIn the dreams he will sit before sick people and manifest whatever appropriate medicine and instruments can pacify their illness And with one treatment he will heal all illnessThey will not speak or express anythingThe Bhagavān placed upon the head of the youth CandraprabhaThey will never be separated from the extrasensory powers that are neither fettered nor liberatedwho do not belittle others and do not praise themselvesHowever monks as time went on many of these gods nāgas yakṣas gandharvas demigods garuḍas kiṃnaras and mahoragas as well as akra Brahmā and the world protectors began to think to themselvesand countless innumerable devas and humans will develop an irreversible aspiration to the highest supreme enlightenmentAs they sequentially proceed on their mendicant route they do not become weary or disturbed and develop neither attachment nor aversion to the beings they meetBecause I myself was then at that time Prince Giver of All WealthThus he became an arhat free of desire for the three realmsHowever if this should not accomplish it Reverse the mantra chain and do the recitationImmersed in the practice of the completion stageSend away all the hunchbacks and all the blind deaf and mute people as well as anyone who is deformed or crippledThen akra mighty lord of the gods said to Senior SubhūtiHow did you attain patient forbearance in seeing all phenomena as nonarisingWhoever among them has heard even one verse or heard one line of a verse or with just one aspiration has rejoiced in this sūtra for all those in the fourfold assembly BhaiṣajyarājaTo live by indulging the mind is proper for fools and to live in control of the mind is proper for the disciplesIn doubt the monks questioned him who severs all doubts the Blessed BuddhaBecause of the roots of merit that were produced by his veneration he and his retinue were caught byThe third dedication prayer isThe victorious ones will relinquish their bodies For those deluded because of holding on to a self And for those who always want things to be permanent So that they may be introduced to impermanenceThinking this one enters through the fontanel of ones future father just like a falling stargo without your perfumesThe path of renunciation brings only suffering And taming the mind is hardOn all of these occasions he has become a Dharma preacherSimilarly the nāga kings Nanda and Upananda Similarly also Takṣaka and KṛṣṇagautamaThey are the perfections of generosity discipline patience diligence concentration insight skillful means aspiration power and wisdomVenerable Lord For these reasons this transcendent perfection of wisdom is the great transcendent perfection possessed by great bodhisattva beingsall other attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are nonarisingThis will remove excess wind and phlegmTheir skin will be the pure color of beryl and will bring happiness to those beings who see itTherefore have I accomplished A body that is inconceivable and radiant too Since it sees entities as nonentities it comprehends both entity and nonentityThey came into the presence of that jina And addressed questions to that supreme humanThus will bodhisattva great beings who abide by the component of discipline attain these four exalted states nor would it cause the slightest harm to that which is still and solidOne will be born as a haughty spirit One of the kings of the eight charnel grounds Devoid of compassion an eater of flesh and bloodOnce the being has seen these things it yearns for themKing rīghoṣa then came there accompanied by his harem and the people of the villages towns and regionshave obtained

they traveled to Kapilavastu that sublime city with a hundred thousand gardensThey discussed among each other saying Either the time has come for the asura king Bali to die or the time has come for us to be slainThe events of the past future and present are not the bodhisattva and therefore the three times cannot receive any prophecyKauṇḍinya understood the meaning And so the Three Jewels came to beand it was ornamented with many hundreds of thousands of silk tassels and garlandsand should observe freedom from desirelet alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with bodhisattva followers as numerous as the grains of sand in twenty Ganges RiversWhoevers name one includes in the mantra she will arrive One should make love to herSome great bodhisattva beingsMañjuśrī no dharma whatsoever can be found for which there may be arising or cessationHis power gained from merit in millions of lives is thwarting your miraclesVenerable Lord The transcendent perfection of wisdom is the mother of the bodhisattvas because it generates all the attributes of the buddhasin the form of Lord Mañjuvajra SiddhaikavīraMay my wealth be spontaneously accomplishedHe contemplated the impure nature of the body and developed a feeling of repulsion and then disgustMañjuśrī the Tathāgata obtained an awakening that has no root and no ground to stand uponMoreover the precious structure that delighted the Bodhisattva clearly reflected all that is found within the abodes of the gods of the desire realmAfter tying the root of sensitive plant to ones ear during the fertile period of ones cycle one will become pregnantO Blessed One certainly not exclaimed āriputraBy rubbing two flat pieces of stone together at night timenot lack of spaceBodhisattvas do not aspire toward unexcelled and complete awakening in reliance on othersMañjuśrī awakening cannot be explained in terms of the body the mind or dharma nondharma real unreal truth or falsitythey give rise to disrespect disparage them denigrate them and speak ill of themToday you have conquered the demons at the foot of the king of treestouched and inspiredis the armor of the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationThen Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi bowed his head to Bhagavat ikhins feet and departedNoble son bodhisattvas will go alone and compose themselves with their minds withdrawn and extremely wearyYet neither are these temporary phenomena entirely nothingYoung man however many words there can be for forms the tathāgata has that many appellations for themThatness is spaceWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas expertise with respect to the reversal of cyclic existence consist inOne should make love to Passion VajrīNevertheless in order to also satisfy the intellect of those who lacked dedication the Bodhisattva picked up the bundle of grassVenerable āradvatīputra what is the abode of the thusgone onesWhoever breaches the samayaWhat is the liberation of liberative art integrated with wisdomand to

wishes are fulfilledRatikara Dharmavyūha VyūharājaApart from causing his own death Does he achieve anything by separating himself from womenThe power of mindfulness is a gateway to the light of the

the world The other was king over the other half I will not be one who prizes words Lord of humans quickly teach me the practice had accumulated a trillion retentions were unobscured and had insight into the Dharma all attained patienceTo cover his body he wore stainless white clothes of the finest quality without any blemishes whatsoeverand their faces become redWhile the blessed Bodhisattva was dwelling in the Abode of TuṣitaIf you ask what is the knowledge of phenomenaAt that time the earth shook in six different ways And the buddha realms were pervaded with stainless lightWho in the teaching of that sugata will attain The six higher knowledges the three insights and great miraclesThis wise supreme man has a moonlike face with the beauty of a blooming lotusemanating an assembly of fully ordained monks an assembly of fully ordained nuns an assembly of laymen and an assembly of laywomenandThe mad had their sanity restoredthe insentient statues of the gods such as iva Skanda Nārāyaṇa Kubera Candra Sūrya Vaiśravaṇa akra Brahmā and the guardians of the world all stood up from their seats and prostrated at the Bodhisattvas feetAnd no merit greater than pleasuresimilarly on the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdomHe has many servants He is a wealthy man in that great landknowledge apprehension understanding and realization aroseReverend nanda to believe there can be illness in such a body is irrational and unseemlyIt is not the purview of beginnersIf I were to teach this truthThe nature of the four gnoses Are the antidotes that destroy the four demonsthey do not see it or identify it as sufferingyou will all become tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhasSon of noble family the accumulation of discipline too involves defilement and grasping and ripens in the aggregateswhich is free of factors connected with evil deeds and nonvirtuesMonks as the Bodhisattva was about to pass away and take rebirth many hundreds of thousands of bodhisattvas who were bound by just one more birthHe himself acted and accumulated thus so no one else experiences Maudgalyāyanas actions and accumulations for themselvesO gods This doctrine is profound owing to the profundity of spaceAt this point the god Excellent Rule asked the Blessed OneMañjuśrī a dharma with no real perfection cannot be spoken of as either even or unevenI am from the NorthIt liberates all sentient beings who have fallen into the ocean of saṃsāraEven the names of the understanding of all phenomena the understanding of the aspects of the path and the understanding of omniscience do not exist internally nor do they exist externally and nor do they abide between these twothe emptiness of all things and the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics were all entitiesI could with playful ease Get hold of all the water in the four oceansSubhūti when those great bodhisattva beings have passed awayHow can they engage in every type of giving and thus attain the untaught generosityTherefore the one who desires supreme unsurpassable enlightenment The accumulated wisdom of buddhahoodAnd bring down storms and rains of rock and meteorthe sublime attributes of great bodhisattva beingsSuch was his first aspiration prayer from the pastpromulgate it and make it widely known to others those bodhisattva mahāsattvasThe color and brilliance of this light even outshone that of the sun and the moon those magical planets that are otherwise so highly praised for their great power The light shone so brightly that it illuminated even places so dark that those beings who are born there cannot see their hands even if they hold them right in front of their facesWhat six qualitiesAll the young princes had the twentyeight marks of a great being and all of them had genuinely attained unsurpassed and completely perfect awakeningGiving away vehicles such as horses elephants and chariots represents becoming included within the bodhisattvas Great Vehiclethe supreme vehicle the unequaled vehicle the unsurpassed buddha vehicle that is the foremost sublime and most excellent vehicle ThereforeSome are to be converted by godsThere are also two types of chakra First are the chakras themselves second the channelsHaving that belief they will be dedicated to the teachings of the Tathāgatato perceive existences with an attitude of renunciationWhen Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta saw that array of lotuses he asked the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha ākyamuniOn the other hand the vehicle will come to rest by way of its nonrestingThe king greeted him with words of welcome and askedIf you ask what these four are āradvatīputra they may be described as followsAnd they feel delight and joy And amuse themselves going in every directionasked Where has my son goneIt was a voice praised by the lord of the gods and the lord of the demigodsor he will become a king of Dharma He will be endowed with the Dharma or the seven precious emblemshas attained the forbearance that understands that ultimately all phenomena are utterly unborn utterly unarisenOnly after all that did he attain the enlightenment of buddhahoodThey spontaneously see The myriad insentient and sentient The locales and multitudes of beingsperforms an act of motion alone so that the monk who inquires into confidential matters may question the student about impedimentsTherefore were I also to indulge in desire in the way that worldly beings do that would not be becomingunderstands that their body is insubstantial like a dream an illusionBhagavān in order to abandon afflictions I have abandoned these apprehensions of the Buddhas teachingsIn fact the Bodhisattva did not even use his hand to shelter himselfthis lump should be sealed in a crucible together with some sand After heating it upthat the drop of butter extracted with that very tip of a hair split into one hundredths would be able to outshine the four great oceans filled with butterNext is the number called vāhanaprajñaptiThe ultimate truth which is so because it is the opposite of all forms of speech statements cognition objects of cognition activities conventions and acts is a gateway to all dharmasEven if all gods and humans became As swift and strong as you are And gathered in a single place They would be unable to harm this peerless beinghappiness and suffering will not be experienced butThey do not apprehend the emptiness of all intrinsic defining characteristics as the emptiness of all intrinsic defining characteristicsand similarly that universal monarchs will emerge in the worldpraised by Indra and the gods who attend himnot to be a community leaderFive thousand gods and humans accepted that phenomena are nonarisingthe four correct exertions the four supports for miraculous ability the five facultiesHowever Mañjuśrī when this happens there is neither a cloud nor anything that can be designated as a cloudAnd so the young brahmin Koṣṭhila began to study Lokāyata philosophy in the presence of the brahmin TiṣyaConclusion of the sixth chapter Cultivation of the SamādhiYoung man the Tathāgata will always give you that opportunityAfter the venerable āriputra had allowed his going forth and given him ordinationIn this way they know that they are untrue That phenomena are like illusions that they are naturally emptyand similarly this doctrine is profound owing to the profundity of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessThe god asked But Mañjuśrī if the blessed buddhas do not teach the Dharma for the sake of the transcendence of suffering then why do they appearYoung man what is the restraint of the mind Bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have the restraint of the mind are without fear of the Dharma of the buddhas and have attained the unshakable liberated mindThey have reached safety They have attained freedom from fearOne who sees dependent arising as constant without life force devoid of life force true unmistaken unborn not arisen uncreated uncompounded unobstructed imperceptible tranquil fearless incontrovertible inexhaustible and by nature never stilledthey do not do so out of  aversionSubhūti great bodhisattva beings behold those sentient beings who are born in the three lower realmsHe is the gatekeeper of the city of DharmaGentlemen the King of Aṅga has been crowned and anointed a kṣatriya kingthe one who abides in great compassion the one who abides in great rejoicingMoreover nanda if any sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage were to establish the sentient beings of Jambudvīpa as many as they are in the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth in the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth in arhatship and in individual enlightenmentthe nature of all attributes and unconditioned phenomena up to and including the finality of existence is nonentityāradvatīputra it is for these reasons that great bodhisattva beings who engage in union with the transcendent perfection of wisdom are said to engage in unionis designated as the mundane gift of the sacred doctrineHappy is the freedom from desire That transcends evilWords do not go in any direction Words do not come from anywhere Who has this powerwho wish to enunciate the sacred doctrineKuberakāntā Beloved of Kuberaand kneeling on his right kneeWithout praising myself without belittling others and without any concern for material things I shall teach the Dharmatheir hair is of even length and styled wound to the right and beautifulSubhūti do you think for example that an arhat can emanate as an arhat whose contaminants have ceasedNeither the sun nor the moon thinks I shall shine I shall benefit sentient beingsThose with foolish understanding think My sons and my wealthSubhūti that is so You have spoken correctlyDo you seek to squander the offerings of the faithful and invite misfortuneCutting off all his limbs Eager to chop off his headand become the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha VimalanetraWhen they are separated from their lives they will look back at JambudvīpaShe looked among all the trees and eventually arrived beneath a very special and exquisite fig treeNoble son bodhisattvas possessing ten qualities are guides who unmistakenly point out the pathIn that way therefore the youth Candraprabha provided divine food with a hundred flavors to the Bhagavānand came first to all of their chores He would rise early and sayoffer it as a gift to the buddhas the bhagavatsthe inconceivably numerous words concerning the kleśas and the inconceivably numerous words concerning purification Those are the fourHe understood that in the end any amount of wealth will be used upHe must always remain inside with the maidens so that he will be addicted to their pleasuresThat wisdom is difficult to understand For the foolish who suddenly hear itI am omniscient and allseeing Devas and humans you should come to me in order to hear the DharmaHe is beyond the three timesin the same vein just as the notion of a tathāgata arhat and completely perfect buddha having the other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas is without foundationto relinquish those who observe disciplineHe is skilled in teaching the Dharma to others according to their capabilities and thereforeDespite this the medicines taste and efficacy are formless Their formless taste and efficacy manifest through the vigorous appearance of the personattraction for the motherThis completes the tenth chapter from The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines entitled Extrasensory PowersNo one shall cause him any problems through a hostile mindand all will be reborn in the hellsSo come quickly for that reasona lack of respect for the buddhas as well as a lack of respect for the Dharma the saṅgha the training the noble ones and those who maintain pure conduct whether senior intermediate or beginnersthey circumambulated him three times and then praised him with these versesSir game does not eat other gameThe novice put it in his mouth and on tasting it knew it to be divine ambrosiaOne feels extreme passion for ones future motherListen friends Other beings have also been born hereThey never offer leftovers or anything rotten or decayingVenerable Lord If owing to the emptiness of the unlimited and the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor endthe aroma of a spreading pleasing incense Will be in this realm O bhikṣusnor any turning back of concepts and thoughtsAnd you should speak of this to other śrāvakas alsoHe considers motionlessness yet he moves in order to develop all living beingswith Dharma pouring like rain recollecting and placing the Dharma in the mindAnd it is the eighteen unique qualities of a buddhaLike a tree with flowers and fruits People love a person who delights in givingWhich has eight thousand trillion verses And moreover another hundred septillion He has relinquished the cause of debate and has not engaged in divulging secrets that cause discord among othersFor this reason divine princes it is difficult for great bodhisattva beings who don the armor of great compassion for the sake of sentient beings who do not existMonks they have already practiced and they already possess pure qualities of accomplished scholarsTheir births and their deaths Are the processes of their mindsand free from concepts unappraisable and free from appraisals and equal to the unequaled and free from parity with the unequaledThen the Blessed ākyamuni spoke to the bodhisattva great beingsSimilarly you should know that when these great bodhisattva beings are successful in their practice their realization will be irreversibleOne should put the soles of her feet Against the base of ones thighsIt is knowing that the skandhas dhātus and āyatanas are like illusions and renouncing themthat Bhīmasena is the son of VāyuTell me O Central Deity All the meanings of the adornments and the restI possess such vast treasure as this And I am close to the time of my deathWell then venerable āradvatīputra what is this liberated mind of yoursAt that moment the Licchavi Vimalakīrti having focused himself in concentrationas the brahmin Māṭhara is the elder I ask that you have him defend a position firstwho uttered these verses of praise to the Tathāgata the Arhat the perfectly enlightened Buddha JyotivikrīḍitābhijñaWith either conduct devoid of view Or view devoid of conductFor these reasons Senior āradvatīputraEach of them praised those tathāgatas with praises of the buddhas rendered into verseThus bodhisattvas are capable of containing the limitless rainclouds of DharmaAs it is indestructible and not destroyed it is without destructionIt is an unbreakable vajra recitationBodhisattvas are not born in barbarian lands where people are foolish bewildered and stupid like sheepIt is the wisdom and skillful means itselfThen akra lord of the gods together with the gods from the Heaven of the ThirtyThree paid homage to the ThusGone One with a display of flowers incense garlands unguents parasols standards and flagsAvalokiteśvara Mahāsthāmaprāpta and Amoghadarśin Gandhahasti Ratnakusuma and RatnabāhuThey could not bend a hair on my body let alone kill meSubhūti when sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritagethe inconceivably numerous kinds of words concerning behavior in regard to teaching the compositeSimilarly when ignorance ceases all these other phenomena that are based on a lack of knowledge will cease as wellAfter that the rays of awareness from the round sun of the Tathāgata even descend upon the body of those sentient beings with mental continua that are stuck in what is wrongVenerable if these two were but seven years old when they went fortha magnificent array of many hundreds of thousands of clusters of precious gemsWill be under the power of gain and honor And they will criticize each other Since he is no longer subject to old age and death he is known as the one who discovered the cool qualityImagine a person splits the tip of a hair into one hundred pieces and then uses the tip of one of those pieces to lift up one drop of water from the oceanlike a kingly swan taken to wing flew up into the sky above blazingNoble son why are you silentThus a bodhisattva who lives in the inconceivable liberation can magically transform any kind of living being into a universal monarch a Lokapāla a akra a Brahmā a disciple a solitary sage a bodhisattva and even into a buddhaThis is my son I am his fatherWe bow to you who have cut the bondage of all fettersThey do not apprehend unconditioned elementsFirst the Bodhisattva proposed a mathematical problemwere to take from there a single smallest particle And having traversed a thousand worlds put it downhear with their divine earIf you master will impart instruction to her I shall not prevent this girl from listening to the DharmaI too shall guard protect and shield those who comprehend hold read and perfectly master this Dharma discourseProstrations to all the buddhas of the ten directionsThere were no fewer than six hundred billion In the saṅgha of that jinaNot being perceived is to have no abodeand similarly no four applications of mindfulnessEven King uddhodana kept watch at the palace gate accompanied by five hundred young ākyas mounted on elephants and horsesThus all of King uddhodanas intentions were perfectly fulfilled Then the king wondered Now what shall I name my young sonone should recite the mantra while looking into the skyTeach the wisdom of the tathāgatas So that we and these beings Will attain this highest enlightenmentYou who are the god of humans I ask you to tell me Through whose power have you become Someone who today has guided countless beingsThe bodhisattvas will know through their smells Whatever are used as adornments The different materials that are worn on the body Clothing garlands ointments and perfumesHere I awakened to the realizationHe is powerful with an army unafraid of the kings from surrounding landsAgain venerable āradvatīputra asked Māra PāpīyānSimilarly it neither has obsessions fetters or latent impulses nor is it without themBeyond that is the number called kuruṭuand similarly they totally cultivate thoughts of compassion thoughts of empathetic joy and thoughts of equanimity and they do so without apprehending anythingand in the same vein the noble eightfold path are themselves omniscience and omniscience is the noble eightfold path and so forthmove on to one with a pleasant smellForm is not the bodhisattva and hence form is not something that can receive a prophecyIntoxicated with the arrogance of patience they create all the suffering that results from fundamental heedlessnessWhich fourIn the past O Receptacle of Qualities

was a sovereign A king named VarapuṣpasaThey are like lightning and clouds unstable and empty All are without a self without a being without a soul up to the nonappropriation of the gateways of mnemonic incantation and the gateways of meditative stabilityI say they will not be released from suffering and so forth in subsequent rebirthsConsider noble son how the god Candra is always adorned and never looks shabbyFix it firmly at the end and clearly pronounce the mantra guhya bhakṣa abhakṣe hūAll of it was held by the son of the jina By the dharmabhāṇaka Varaprabha Similarly it should be extensively applied to all the other attributes and attainments as well up to and including omniscienceThen the Bhagavān praised Youthful Mañjuśrī Very well donethere is the meditative stability named Unattached Liberated and Uncovered like SpaceProstrations to the tathāgata Samādhihastyuttaraśrī buddha of the northeastThen Bhagavān the poor man wandering in search of food and clothes comes to the residence of the man who has much money gold property grain treasure and storehousesI have not disclosed this The kings who are dedicated to their desires Those rulers of the world throw away their prosperitySimilarly Subhūti in the same vein as beforeWhen they see reality they can free sentient beings from the prison of cyclic existenceThe buddhas those great immaculate kings the jinas Have patience for such fools as thesethey are neither mundane nor are they supramundane andIn the emptiness of nonentities the emptiness of essential nature is not discernedI will give you an answer in seven daysMany hundreds of beings are delighted and worship youWhen Māyādevī sat upon the lion thronevenerable BāṣpaSkillful means are gateways to the light of the Dharmait remains as the supreme syllableBhagavān how can bodhisattvas become unobscured and purified with respect to all phenomenaAnd no one sees anyone higher than them These are distinctive qualities of the first patience With all the billions of skills that induce amorous infatuation The girls were unable to seduce the BlissGone One who has the gait of a young elephantYet ultimately no lifeforce soul man person human or human being is observed either and they cannot be attached to themThey must be afraid of engaging in negative deedsSimilarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are like a dream like a magical displaySincere interest is a gateway to the light of the Dharma for it enables one to make great effort and be free from doubtThe Bodhisattva told me in a soft and gentle voiceI ask that the venerable saṅgha guide mea precious jewel a precious woman a precious steward and a precious generalThis being the case Venerable Lord As they remain in evenness of mind There will be an evenness of ripening results There is the meditative stability named Utterly Devoid of Delimitation  There is the meditative stability named Dispelling of Doubt  There is the meditative stability named Without Settled Focus  There is the meditative stability named Single ArraySimilarly physical forms are also free from contaminants and not included within the three world systems owing to the emptiness of inherent existenceVenerable nanda however much a monk is involved in boasting conceit constructionNow I am oldWith one guñja of this An experienced person will transform a great quantitythis turning of the wheel of the sacred doctrine is not the first in Jambudvīpa nor is it the secondTherefore make the village of Nālada the standard victors prizethat the bodhisattva mahāsattva Samantabhadra came to this Sahā world realmThat was me while I was practicing bodhisattva conduct I will make them perceive the elaborate sūtras with corrupt viewsBut your complexion has faded and is almost goneNor at all with caṇḍālas swindlers Or those who are tīrthikasIf you ask what are the faculties that acquire the knowledge of all thingsmay my body become goldenNoble one you have defeated the opposing forces of the mārasAnd in their placeOne should prepare an infusion of hogweed and raṇḍa in sixteen parts of water reducing it by boiling to just one partThe effect does not come from a mistaken cause Barley does not sprout from a grain of wheathe was taken to school He went there amid hundreds of thousands of auspicious signs and he was surrounded and attended by tens of thousands of boysSubhūti it is because sentient beings the Great Vehicle and space are all nonapprehensibleThis completes the Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra entitled The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand LinesIt is knowledge of the worldNoble ones King ubhavyūha having praised the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Jaladharagarjitaghoṣasusvaranakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña through describing those qualities thenOne should know that the Great Vehicle is nonexistent because space is nonexistentThey should cultivate an attitude that regards all sentient beings as their parents brothers and sistersThen go forth sonOne will be free from wrinkles and gray hair and will live for five hundred yearsThey have no kleśas and give material things away They know the characteristics of thingsand not be fearful not be terrified and not be gripped by terror on hearing the inconceivable Dharma of the Buddhathere was the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara who had through his past roots of merit seen such light rays from many tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhasThen Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara said to herThey lack convictionsBecause of such faults the wise avoid the foolish And live alone like deer in the forest An adept should investigate his body speech and mindEven if Māra and Māras followers were to appear thereWhy should the yakṣas rejoice in it Because it closes the pathways to all the lower realmsThe discernment of meaning is the meaning in the knowledge of phenomenarequested him Lion who is Lord of Humans Teach the Dharma With your excellent speech Satisfy us who are in this worldYour splendor is like that of the sun or wellpurified gold It is like the newly risen and stainless moon Like the fire whose flames are fed by the sacrificial butter Your splendor is like a blazing flash of lightningThis will cure feverIf it is a past birth it is already finishedBecause they are free from attachment to joyBhagavān my lustful mind arose later onIf they thought of the beings in the hell realms in the morningHere the mighty sugatas Lead with the sublime DharmaOne kills the father in order to take his placeI tried to wake up the assembly of men and ladiesThose splendorous beings that have courage because of being true Those supreme leaders of beings also do not congregate togetherIf I see him now I will beg his forgivenessThese indeed āradvatīputra represent the Great Vehicle of great bodhisattva beingsThey will quarrel with each other And develop intractable evil maliceHe then decreedThey constantly have this vision of the buddhasThe Blessed One replied Subhūti great bodhisattva beings have been well trained in the emptiness of internal phenomenaIt should not be given to tīrthikasSon of noble family since they have no misgivings concerning such actions and fear no consequences this is the eighth root transgression for beginner bodhisattvasnot tiring in the positive development of living beingsWith this mantra the vacā fruit should be mashed And mixed with milkI must apply myself to eating even less than thisBy writing this mantra interspersed with the beneficiarys name on a wall with chalk one will cure all eye diseasesI am displeased when I hear them let alone see them let alone consort with themWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas perfect giving free of expectation of a reward consist inconceiving of the world as a garden of liberationSubhūti the systematic presentation of the various fruits may be disclosed when the relative truth is taken as the standard butSimilarly the emptiness of the truth of the path is not the truth of the pathbut when their passion is spent desire vanishesWitnessing this thirtytwo thousand beings in the retinue of the Blessed One developed the mind set on unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening Such were the miracles that the Blessed One producedThey should understand the single characteristic of all phenomena and yet not enter faultlessnessHe did not consider that understanding to be outside physical forms nor outside the other aggregates up to and including consciousnessTheir bodies will not be afflicted by illnessTherefore Subhūti great bodhisattva beings who wish to transcend all the transcendent perfections should train in this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomThe thunder from clouds the beat of a drum Thunderclaps and the voice of Brahmāāradvatīputra the eight sense fields of mastery are merely conceptualizedBlessed One there must be many bodhisattva great beings who attained the illusory absorption in that buddha realmHe joyously exclaimed King may you be victorious and live longgreat loveSimilarly they do not make assumptions about the ten powers of the tathāgatasThey all requested the ThusGone One to turn the wheel of Dharma with these wordsThey do not make assumptions on account of that wisdom and so forth They do not make assumptions on account of the act of wisdom and so forth and they do not make assumptions about the act of wisdom and so forthAbode of Myriad FlowersTherefore those who wish for the path to nirvāṇa Must follow the path of the noble ones Similarly the physical forms feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness that are void constitute the nature of the six transcendent perfections that are also void and so oneven the wisdom of the buddhas is unable to know the limits of the merit created by such honoring venerating worshiping and offeringmanifested the miracle of his right hand taking hold of the right hands of those in the entire gathering of bodhisattvasBeautifully taught by all the buddhasOnly after the Blessed One had given his consent did their hair fall out and they were clothed in robesKuntī and the other rākṣasīs said to the BhagavānMy emanations proceed To thousands of millions of realmsFor as long as they are incinerated by an inferno they will experience the sufferings of the denizens of the hellsTheir understanding is perfectly pureI will teach the application of mindfulness that carefully considers feelings as arising and ceasingor sentient being or life force or living being or man or personThere will be cessation of suffering and the end of rebirth To drive away snakes one should scatter gravel that has been incantedThe sixth great merit results in becoming SunirmāṇaratiI should refine the buddhafields in this mannerYour Majesty I will bring My beautiful jewel palacewhich neither decreases nor increasesRemember your previous actionswhile some writhed on the ground as if they were fish pulled from water and criedand those in the worlds under the sway of Yama they should reflect Alas When I have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment in this buddhafieldas far as Akaniṣṭha also will arrive thereThe man who fathered meWhile the Blessed One was residing in the palace of the king of the gods in the Akaniṣṭha realmThen the Bhagavān performed that miracle and through the power of the Buddha the five hundred instruments were played excellentlyOmniscience is pure owing to the purity of the understanding of the aspects of the pathThey comprise  the eye of flesh  the eye of divine clairvoyance  the eye of wisdom  the eye of the sacred doctrine and  the eye of the buddhasones own selfawarenesswhen one achieves and abides in the sense field of infinite consciousness thinking Consciousness is infiniteFor these reasons Senior āradvatīputra the nonarising of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness is not consciousness and the other aggregatesHe is the one with the supreme form beautiful to behold He is the one with calm facultiesSimilarly they also actualize formative predispositions of the meritorious nonmeritorious and neutral sorts through their body speech and mindGentlemen as the ruler of all who have been crowned and anointed kṣatriya kingswhenever they do not engage with the notions that physical forms are entities or that they are nonentitiesThe Jina who was perfect with control over his senses Perceived the kings pure conductHaving become a universal monarch one attains The kingdom and the pleasures of the senseshe blends them togetherAt the time of invitation offer drum And trumpet music fruits and incenseIn hell they see many hundreds of celestial pleasure groves with trees in full bloom and areas of broad green meadowsriyāmatī and Yaśamatī Yaśaprāptā and Yaśodharā Suutthitā and Suprathamā Suprabuddhā and SukhavyūhāIn order to tame Māra you entered this battleThat person who is a hero with that meditation And aspires for the highest enlightenmentVenerable ones he replied I do not wish to participate in the Dharma teaching that youthful Mañjuśrī is now givingSubhūti great bodhisattva beingsFor these reasons Subhūti this supreme vehicle the Great Vehicle also accommodates countless innumerable sentient beingsThose bodhisattva great beings who seek to acquire the marks of one hundred merits will exert themselves in the practice of meditating on this absorptionAn uncountable number of eons ago this son of noble family the bodhisattva mahāsattva kāśagarbha attained acceptance that phenomena are nonarising attained discriminating awareness and attained the meditative concentration of brave progressionSubhūti it is soYour parks are the best of the best full of flowers and fruits and resounding with the singing of birdsWere he to accomplish only this this brahmin boys insight would surpass my ownPreceptor I have not fallen ill upon going forthacquire a corporeal form through which they will refine the buddhafields and bring sentient beings to maturityBecause the thusgone ones do not turn the wheel of Dharma without being requestedPossessing these extrasensory powers and so forth they will travel from buddhafield to buddhafield and they will venerate those lord buddhas honoring them with all resources and they will also bring sentient beings to maturation and refine the buddhafieldswhen those who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas immediately after hearing this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom form aspirations toward itPlace the diagram in a fresh clay cup And draw a crossed vajra on the lidGods although this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom has such defining characteristics for the sake of the world the tathāgatas have named symbolized designated and expressed it in conventional termsHe was a lamp of wisdom for the entire world But because of my desires I had him slain and therefore may the Tathāgata reveal well the body that is the relic of the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna Some carried flaming mountains in their hands while playfully riding on other mountains as their mountThe Blessed One is born with an extremely upright postureand tie it to the head of someone who is bound it will release him from bondageThey know the minds of all beingsHouseholder he replied do you think my ascetic attendants simply sprout up like weedsAwareness is explained as the awareness that understands the meaning and understands consciousnessAs they had now given the true prophecy they returned to their own abodesKnowing the Dharma that is without activity They have entered nonduality which is the same as spacebeautify the teaching of the BuddhaThen the great king Vaiśravaṇa said to the three other great kingsFor how long have they embarked on unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentAh Even wrongdoing can be checked I shall go forth among these peopleAll great displays In all the limitless millions of realms Now manifested at this place By the power of the BodhisattvaWhen they hear something that is stupid and mistaken They will repeat those blameworthy words a hundred times And steadfastly wandered in this way for eight years While remaining in wandering his life came to an end At that time the Blessed One spoke to the group of five monksA monk whose discipline has lapsed will feel regretThus for numerous eons for hundreds of thousands of eons and throughout incalculable numbers of eons they simultaneously teach the Dharma to all beings employing all sorts of analogies and approaches and yet there is no end to their teaching of the DharmaA balacakravartin king when pleased Gives to his warriors many cowriesLater he went to the Jetavana where he posed his question to a monkIt is thus that they perfect the transcendent perfection of wisdomWorshiped by him pleased I shall grant complete attainmentand the inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of ignorance concerning purification Those are the fourIn this way this Dharmamethod of mine will spreadEnlightenment is not a door for the sensemediaThis they consume free of desireHe then approached the bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa spoke with the bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa about many pleasant and joyful things and then sat down to one sidehaving obtained what he sought and with his wishes fulfilledBut the bodhisattvas who read hear believe and teach this profound teaching with its impeccable expressions reconciling dichotomies and its analyses of stages of developmentthese are veterans in the religious practiceEntered the temple where the Lord of the World Contemplated in meditation on one seat For an entire eightyfour eonsBut that echo is not past future or presentThe faults associated with the mind fade away in those whose minds delight in meditationIf they abide in cognize and are intent on feelings due to sensory contact that is visually compounded and so on up to feelings due to sensory contact that is mentally compoundedIt is dualistic to refer to aggregates and to the cessation of aggregatesSimilarly are feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness neither fettered nor liberatedExperienced the sufferings of hell For countless billons of rebirths Master can you settle a matter in debate in my presence with this brahmin Tiṣyasat down on the lion throne with its great jewel lotus inside He sat with his legs crossed and observed the entire gathering of bodhisattvasNoble son only those who have served as many buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River will come across this discourseIt was a pleasing bed bestrewn with flowers There she unfastened her tiara of precious jewels Like a goddess in the Miśraka GardenExhausting defilements is not what bodhisattvas minds are likeis bringing sentient beings to maturity is refining the buddhafields and is even conjuring emanational forms through miraculous abilitiesthey should praise and rejoice in others who abstain from wrong viewsHowever much they teach They will not become proud The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra The Sections of DharmaI haveThe sage thoughtāradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings thinkNārāyaṇa they apply these four to everythingand his circle of students was small he said to the young brahminsIf someone perceiving this teaching as their master worships it with parasols victory banners Fa and flags orRelinquishing sovereignty over the four continents and Jambudvīpa as well as its kingdoms represents the bodhisattvas achievement of sovereignty over the kingdom of the sacred Dharma Therefore Your hand is burning But you are not disturbedI the King of the Dharma shall proclaim it I shall guide toward the highest enlightenmentthe one with powerone billion realms of the Unlofty Heavenbut I did see something somewhat amazing and remarkable so listen as you pleaseFled throughout the ten directions Crying out with loud wailsThen the rākṣasī named Lambā the rākṣasī named Vilambā the rākṣasī named KūṭadantīBased on the lips throat palate and tongue The sounds of syllables are producedthey do not preoccupy themselves with degenerate moralityWhat is the attainment of joy It is the nonperception of all phenomenaI can say just a little about his poresWe will approach him once he has risen from this state And with that they sat off to one sideThat is how you should regard inner form tooThey were just as they are nowand offer incense consisting of aloeswood sandalwood frankincense and myrrhSimilarly the transcendent perfection of wisdom should be actualized due to the nonactualization of the transcendent perfection of generosity and the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdommighty nāgasThat which leads to the intrinsic nature is rationaland yet their mind does move for the sake of accumulating roots of virtue ripening sentient beings and upholding the sacred DharmaListen for I shall teach you their benefits The joints of their bodies are well articulated  Their crown protuberance is inconspicuousMoreover āradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplineand induce them to enter and become established in the expanse of nirvāṇa where there is no residue of the psychophysical aggregatesNothing arises to their conceptual mind They know emancipation from all phenomenadie among spirits and are reborn among humansthe tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū who had come to the sublime highest Bodhimaṇḍa and was seated on a lion throne at the foot of the Bodhi treeThe Blessed One gave them instructionsThey should also observe that the attributes of the definitive transcendent perfection of wisdomGood sir is your condition tolerableIt is just as you have saidhow could one be liberated by perceiving physical forms as entities or by perceiving them as nonentities or by perceiving them as both entities and nonentitiesWithout these conditions the body cannot be bornThey should not initiate the workings of demonsKnowing that nature of phenomena I remain in the dharmakāya Imagine then that the person traveling from the east knows the path very well because he has traveled on it before and that he knows what it is like all the waynor is it included within the world system of formlessnessTheir head will burst into seven pieces Like the foliage of a basil plantand in the same vein they will turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine that is equal to the unequaledThereupon the Blessed One addressed Senior āradvatīputra as followsThese are the guides that appeared in two eons I made offerings to them for the sake of enlightenment The strength of ten bodhisattvas who have been definitively emerged for one trillion eons is the same as the strength of one bodhisattva who has been definitively emerged for ten trillion eonsFor that bodhisattvas project emanations at the sites where there are nonBuddhists such as the carakas the parivrājakas and the nirgranthasAnd the guides become visibleThey know no contentment and rob others of their wealthVenerable Lord How is the transcendent perfection of wisdom absolutely pure because all things neither arise nor cease and are neither afflicted nor purifiedAnd should each sentient being be inspired by their own type of formSubhūti in the same way one who wishes to attain emancipation in things without defining characteristics merely wishes to attain emancipation in the fruit of entering the streamAt the time of tying the amulet one should make the sick person face east andare never born among beings of inferior species or class and never descend to the levels of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas because they have perfected the roots of virtueSubhūti the emptiness of internal phenomena constitutes the sameness of great bodhisattva beingsanoint it with sandalwood paste and feed it milkthey introduce others to this misapprehensionand which are in no way displeasing to the eyeSome people need an analogy to understand the meaning expressed by a skilled beingThis concludes the twentyfourth chapter on Trapuṣa and BhallikaOnce there he saw that fine seats had been arranged and choice foods laid outIn the village of Kāṣṭhavāṭa there lives a royal priest named PotalakaAlas those who remain in the world are obscured by the black darkness of ignoranceThis makes them spin for a long time in cyclic existence the source of suffering Their suffering experienced in hell is extremely painfulHow should they train in the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline andMeanwhile trailing behind the students of the young brahmin Maudgalyāyana walked reciting mantras on their way to the cityIn this way he demonstrated hardships for six years without ever weakening his resolveKnowing the monk was likely to pass by one of the main crossroads Upatiṣya went there to waitby such causes conditions and bases have become downcast and depressedYour Majesty a bodhisattva a great beinghe felt blissful and happyAny practice related to any demon constitutes bodhisattva practiceThe thusgone ones feel great compassion for sentient beings since all phenomena are without marks and yet sentient beings experience marksand they will attain final nirvāṇa in which no residue of the psychophysical aggregates is left behind Yet this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom will neither be diminished nor replenishedSon of noble family it is in this way that you should look upon arising and cessation due to karmic conditionsand knowing that the great assembly of people had gathered to hear the DharmaFar more difficult will be If someone after my nirvāṇa Is a holder of this sūtra And makes one being hear itLord it is wonderful that this holy person having left a buddhafield as pure as Abhirati should enjoy a buddhafield as full of defects as this Sahā universeand an abundance of thousands of groves and trees of different types and flawless blossoming lotus flowerskaṭapūtanas and pāṃśukūla piśācas also come see me He claims I converse with the godsThe bright radiance of an illuminating orb of light free of dust and dimness made them even more beautifulIt is being first to speak on seeing beings Does the Jina teach this samādhi the sons and daughters of noble family who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas will perfect their roots of virtue classes of garuḍa  classes of wanderersone should add Make such and such respond to my practiceKauśika can you guard protect and offer sanctuary to a dream a mirage an optical aberration a magical display or a phantomShe proceeded to the aśokatree forest where she felt at easethose who have maliciously caused a tathāgata to bleedThe Dharma that those buddha bhagavāns taught was heard by all without exceptionSimilarly the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of generosity are empty of the transcendent perfection of generosity and so forthIf he should ask Is there not an afterlifeI will mount a white sixtusked king of elephants and reveal myself to themWhen it has spread through them A rain of incense fallsIn this regard bodhisattvas think as follows All feelings without exception are sufferingThis completes the twentyfirst chapter from the Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines entitled Early IndicationsVenerable Lord How then does it bring about attainmentOh look at his figure The students replied Yes we see him He is amazingHe becomes longlived so that he lives for a great ageHaving learned that he set off for a remote landAll those young princes had been born out of chastityOne will clear worms and indigestion completelyThere is such inconceivable speech But the bodhisattvas have no pride I have no fear that I will fall into lower realms And I will not again become a womanInstead they think Without knowing or hearing such teachingsWhen Mañjuśrī Kumārabhuta delivered this teaching in a manner beyond reference pointsin dismay thinks I should not be killedThus guru give me the sixsyllable queen of mahāvidyāsapplying the Dharma according to the DharmaThey do not consider whether the body is connected with the mental facultynanda I knew through foresight thatSimilarly it has not been revealed so that sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena might be grasped or not graspedthere are few who could respond in the manner of an irreversible great bodhisattva being whether they abide on the purificatory levels or the nonpurificatory levelsWhen the young brahmin Upatiṣya taught the five hundred young brahmins to recite brahminic mantraswho have been imprisoned are separated from friendsThus noble son just as is the bodhisattvas production of the spirit of enlightenment so is his positive thoughtThe monk officiant then asks about the monk who inquires into confidential mattersThis made the Bodhisattva very delighted and he thought to himselfBhagavān what is the cause and what are the factors whereby when bodhisattva mahāsattvas are practicing infinite bodhisattva conductEven so Mahauṣadhi for the body cravingWherever you shall sit travel or rest And wherever the hearers who are the children of the BlissGone Gautamaand began to look all about themestablish all beings too in great nirvāṇaThey train in accord with all the jinas Those wise ones do not practice nonDharmaI will definitely practice generosity by offering musicYes that is so Mahauṣadhi continued the Blessed OneThe Tathāgata always has the quality of nonarisingKing uddhodana then said to the assemblythey may be styled as the transcendent perfection of wisdom and the restKnowing his perfect conduct the Sugata The Lord of humans the one with wisdom free of attachment smiledSubhūti conditioned elements the nature of conditioned elements the real nature of conditioned elements the essential nature of conditioned elements and the defining characteristics of the essential nature of conditioned elementsAs they hear the teachings they apply them and subdue their prideAnd they will smell the many kinds of smells The pleasant and unpleasant smells that there are In this entire realm of worldsYoung man at that time and in those days King Jñānabalas daughter was sixteen years old and she was beautiful attractive and charmingAnd these people are only the five aggregatesWhen they are sitting they are fully aware that they are sittingIn the form of Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇathe discernment of definitions and the discernment of eloquence I shall manifest these fournot seeking the delusions of othersand this purity of omniscience are indivisiblethey become endowed with great compassion and they accomplish the benefit of countless beingsThey have reached the perfectionTadyathā agaṇe gaṇe gauri gāndhāri cāṇḍāli mātaṅgi pukkasi saṃkule vrūśali svāhāWe shall go to meet Youthful Mañjuśrīadherence to the points taught by the thusgone oneswill

gentle have pleasing speech and speak tenderly Are observed and beloved by many people And those people never have enough of gazing upon them Their happiness was destroyedThe site was also adorned with trees made of various precious gemsLikewise the practice of the buddhas starting with Vipaśyin and ikhinThere is only one goddess wisdom Abiding in five formsIt was adorned with all sorts of jewels in many different arrangements and patternsThe seed phrase supreme ma teaches the way all phenomena are bereft of middle and extremesAs protection from the danger of arrows and thievesWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas excellent unperturbed patience consist inand began searching for him among the gods but he did not see him thereThe time for safeguarding The welfare of humans has nearedWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas excellent patience that does not differentiate consist inThen came twenty thousand horses covered with golden ornaments and full of jewelsAll of them were there to request Dharma teachings from the ThusGone OneFor those qualities of the body That I have indicated In the same vein all attributes and unconditioned phenomena up to and including the finality of existence are empty of the nature of the finality of existence and so forthwhenever they do not engage with the notions that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are imbued with happiness or that they are imbued with sufferingNeither is it the case that such action cannot be cleared away through wisdom Having said thisThey follow the Dharma but not based on the pathThey are  they devote themselves to wisdom and perfect it  they follow the example of the buddhasAnd this sprout of name and form is not created by itself not created by another not created by both not created by śvara not transformed by time not derived from prakṛti not dependent on a single factor and not born without any causeWhen was this At such and such a time a long time agoThus the tathatā and the self are not two they are nondualO noble guide we are tired exhausted frightened and miserable We are going to turn back This jungle goes on too farBhṛgu Aṅgiras and others who exerted themselves in austerities Did not attain that supreme state so forget about you an ordinary manNow monks since the ThusGone One wanted to cross the riverPure Being please come hereAnd likewise practices the conduct of supreme love And has the motivation to benefit all beings This should be known as the perfection of disciplineFor if you do not from this day forth I shall neither eat your food nor honor youReverend the two of them are not yet fifteenIt is said that multicolored cords And unbroken white mustard grains Will protect them Long live the childrenDivine being the omniscient mind the mind that is equal to the unequaled the mind that is superior to all of the three worlds the mind that is entirely beyond the hearers and solitary buddhaswhen bodhisattvas do not perceive that mind to be present inside outside or bothOffering ones feet represents the bodhisattvas Dharma feet that lead to the seat of awakening Thereforefreedom from pride conceit and arrogance by being continuously mindful of subsisting on almsOne should blend pigeons droppings with honey and after applying this to the penisEvil one you are garrulous Like an impudent crowcircumambulated the Bhagavān three times and with hands together in homagewhile the accumulation of learning is like the limitless sky throughout the ten directionsSimilarly they become equipoised in the meditative equipoise of the sense field of infinite space and in the other formless absorptions up to and including the meditative equipoise of cessation YetWhen I had said these words the Licchavi Vimalakīrti came there andI do however think that they will long for unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and that they will aspire even more toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentThey may become suns or moons Indras Brahmās or lords of creatures They may become fire or water Or earth or windI approached the realm of Tathāgata Padmottama arrived there Assuming the form of White AcalaNoble one make vast offerings to my relicsits blood is not contaminatedIn what way you may wonder do bodhisattvas open up and arrange the infinite structures of great palaces of distinct Dharma teachingsThey are covered with excellent clothWith such confidence bodhisattvas pursue their training diligently and persistentlythe sensory element of gustatory consciousnessA complete severance is not what bodhisattvas minds are likeIt will perish and after death will not arise againor born of Manu or son of Manuthey set in place and protect their buddha realmsUncontaminated physical forms are neither fettered nor liberated and similarly uncontaminated feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are neither fettered nor liberatedPacked with intestines liver spleen lymph and saliva it is weakWell Great KingThe aspectless is explained as the gate to liberation of the samādhi of nosignLeading sentient beings to the absence of self it knows the self to be without selfThus bodhisattvas are free from acquiring things through pretense and flatteryEnjoin him to practice the equally applicable ethical codeThe lord the Acala of Reality Is well concealed by me in all the tantrasTwo thousand bodhisattvas came to accept that phenomena are nonarisingSimilarly if they engage with the notion that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are afflicted or that these are purified then they are merely engaging with mental imagesBodhisattvas see these infantile dull and unskilled beings that are present in each of the six realmsVenerable Lord This transcendent perfection of wisdom is established by means of great deedsSimilarly the transcendence of the eyes is always without fearI also saw the bodhisattva mahāsattva Bhaiṣajyarāja who has attained the might of the power of diligence and the bodhisattva mahāsattva PradānaśūraJinaputra Ajita also manifested A divine splendid parasol that emitted delightful soundsThey benefited many millions of beings And after like an extinguished flame attained nirvāṇa They have these qualities through knowing the nature of phenomena He is called the one with a body that issues forth entirely from the realm of phenomena because he transcends the path of spacelike visionAs Indra Brahmā and the guardians of the world all offered their praises and acclaimThe ritual of arranging mantras How might that beBlessed One bodhisattvas should respectfully learn all its profound topics and put them into practiceHe had the sharp vajra weapon of supreme wisdomHe has never tired of giving all kinds of elixirs to those who needed them ThereforeWhatever you seek and wish That request I shall grant youNoble son when bodhisattvas have attained this intrinsic nature they feel I must establish all beings too in this intrinsic natureHe then resolved to exert himself in quest of the Dharma with the thought Now where will I find the sublime teachingsTheir bodies become youthful like that of a young prince whose every whim is attended toIt entails absorption in the nine serial steps of meditative equipoise by perceiving cyclic existence and nirvāṇa without dualityIt is the knowledge of the bodys conditionThis sūtra is extolled by the sugatas And upheld by many bodhisattvasThen the two bodhisattvas went before the Blessed One the thusgone worthy completely perfect Buddha ākyamunithe supreme beingIf he consents there should be no delayFor the sake of protecting all beings Listen to me for all incantationsIf you ask why it is because they do not consider the nature of the truth of the cessation of sufferingJust as many thousands of savages Do you harm in various waysDivine being moreover whenever a bodhisattva turns back or enters he is an irreversible bodhisattvathe saṅgha of bodhisattvas and the saṅgha of bhikṣusSenior Subhūti it is for this very reason that the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment of the bodhisattvas is extremely hard to bring forthYou have no conceptualization whatsoever You have the wisdom of nonattachment toward the three existences I the tīrthika tīrthikas name ask that the reverend and compassionate saṅgha out of your compassionWith the tail of the peacock you tame all nāgasMy Teacher is omniscient He knows everythingTheir eyes will be beautified By eight hundred qualitiesThis is the king of all good advice Given by all thusgone onesThose beings you saw were his disciples when he lived and dwelt in the ṣipatana Deer Park near Vārāṇasībeing insatiable in the skill of perfect dedication andthey become absorbed in the meditative concentrations the immeasurable aspirations and the formless absorptions and thenfinally departing from the presence of the Blessed Onecollects virtuous and nonvirtuous actionsHaving accepted it he spoke in verse to the great king VirūḍhakaThe medicines should be given To the patient while he is facing eastThereupon the Licchavi Vimalakīrti performed the miraculous feat of placing the entire assemblyWhen this tathāgata teaches the sacred doctrine no sentient beings will hesitate wondering whether this doctrine is in fact the doctrineIt is the contemplation of phenomena It is seeking to hear the DharmaThe bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya then spoke these verses to Mañjuśrī KumārabhūtaIn this supreme practice of bodhisattva conduct They will always experience happiness Subhūti if for example an illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist standing at a crossroads in the presence of a large gathering of people were to offer food to those in need of nourishment and dispense all those other aforementioned gifts up to and including the appropriate human resourcesThe unfindability of phenomena is found But that finding also cannot be foundAs monastics they muster diligence to attain what had not been attained comprehend what had not been comprehended and actualize what had not been actualizedThe great king Virūpākṣa now arose from his seatIt is knowledge of the past It is knowledge of the futuretherefore I would exclude impostors from this Dharma and Vinayait is because they consider that those applications of mindfulness are not applications of mindfulnessdo not come from anywhere do not go anywhere and do not even abide anywherewho will abide in the real nature and then attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment let alone abide exclusively in the real nature and teach the sacred doctrinethey will spoil the saṅghas bedding with urine and fecesThe tathāgatas do not originate from skandhas dhātus and āyatanaswhat hopes I had for you to become king of the world were dashedWhat did he pray forSon of noble family bodhisattvas who have achieved this absorption that encapsulates all merit have left the eight unfree states behind and will not be born in the lower realmsThat is to say although bodies that are not meritorious result amongst hells beings or in the animal state or the world of the Lord of Death or among the demigodsHow does it standYoung priest listenSubhūti if the transcendent perfection of wisdom were not absolutely void andand installed me among gods and humansfully awaken to unexcelled and complete buddhahoodOne should visualize the wind maṇḍala arisen from the syllable yaSimilarly if they engage with the notion that entities exist in feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness or that entities do not exist therein then they are merely engaging with mental imagesThey teach this sacred doctrine without transgressing those aspects of emptiness at allBut when Mañjuśrī a lot of rain falls on the great earth from the atmosphere and the sky aboveWhen sounds were heard he was neither startled nor did he avert his gazeBy the twelfth year he was free from being intimidated by any of the treatises as he was thoroughly acquainted with all of the crafts and artsHaving incanted some ash with this mantra one should apply it to the eyes making a dressing with itYoung man if the amount of merit that is obtained By those who possess and recite this samādhi Were to become a phenomenon that has formThe Jina teaches the Dharma equallyThe offering of flowers incense perfume garlands ointments powders clothing parasols banners and divine flags and the offering of other material gifts and the offering of uragasāra sandalwood does not compareThe one with infinite sight knew their request AndAt that time the bodhisattva mahāsattva Prajñākūṭa who had come from the buddha realm of Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna that was in the downward direction said to Tathāgata PrabhūtaratnaThey will be devoid of shame They will have lost the wealth of the mendicantAs the teacher removes the blindfoldFriend go from this Brahma realm up to the Heaven of the ThirtyThree and tell themSubhūti when a son of enlightened heritage or daughter of enlightened heritage who follows the vehicle of the bodhisattvas has heard this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom and then retained held recited mastered and been attentive to it in the correct manner and also practiced it with the real nature as his or her focus that son of enlightened heritage or daughter of enlightened heritage who follows the vehicle of the bodhisattvas would generate much greater merit than the aforementioned meritsAt that time the Bhagavān said to the nāga king Sāgaraneither having obtained the result nor not having obtained the resultEndowed with the liberations and emptinesses And likewise the major and minor marksEnter the residence of the Jina And wear my Dharma robeO abiding in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationThat is to say they should not dwell on the notion that I am a follower on account of faith or I am a follower on account of the doctrineSimilarly those who wish to abandon desire hatred and delusionthe samādhi named Lightnings Illuminationand similarly when they establish cognize and become fixated on the notion that the sensory elements from the eyes to mental phenomena are unceasingāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of fundamental ignorance and in the same vein of all the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death as empty or not empty constitute a bodhisattvaBhikṣus other than the Tathāgata there is no one who can match Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra in meaning or in wordsThe bodhisattvas who know emptinessSubhūti these are the five extremely refined eyes of great bodhisattva beingsImmaculate One destroyer of the afflictions birth and death Gods nāgas yakṣas gandharvas And the powerful demigods await youand I will make them venerable in every kingdomHe knows impermanence but is not complacent about his roots of virtueIt is the seal of the nature of all phenomena It is the transmission of a quintillion sūtrasThe ThusGone One has pulled out the thorn of prideNor does the body think I am produced by these conditionsthey are not taken in hand by an excellent spiritual mentorO child of enlightened heritage The ears nose tongue body and mental faculty are similarly empty of notions of I and mineHe was residing there together with a great saṅgha of eight thousand monkswhat is the cause and what is the conditionThe previous thusgone ones used a seat of grass as they attained unsurpassed genuine and perfect awakeningA woman who is of white complexionno one to listen and no one to understandSurrounded by bodhisattvas He is seated on a lion throneThe completion of the trichiliocosm can be likened to that which is superior to the entire world yet extends throughout space containing all world realmsPomegranate trees woodapple trees āmalakī trees banyan trees

gods at the seat of awakening And the arrays of the sons of the victorious ones They all stand together set forth for the wheel of Dharmathese constitute the first root transgressionIn this way Subhūti do great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration acquire the transcendent perfection of toleranceNo Rudraka repliedThey are the inconceivably numerous kinds of wealth concerning the composite the inconceivably numerous kinds of wealth concerning teaching the composite The lord buddhas have a tongue that is slender and largeSuch is the bodhisattvas excellent power of miraclesI myself cooked the pieces of flesh And added various flavorings archeryWhat does he mean by those who aspire to inferior waysThey should praise the maturity of the bodhisattvasThey retain what they have heard for the sake of benefiting others who have no protectoreye ear nose tongue body and mindAbruptly released the moonSome slapped their arms with their hands and others beat their headsIt is not practiced out of worldly concerns Rather they thinkThe world is drawn by the mind but the mind does not see itselfFor a full two hundred million eons He did not descend to an unfortunate existence He should avoid association With pig farmers and shepherdsJust as the Lord of the World knew that You should also know it through this samādhi Listening to the Dharma is excellentthe sixth door was made of silverSimilarly for sentient beings the windlike bodhisattvas expel the torments of desire anger dullness inferior realms inferior views misdeeds doubt poverty negativity craving for things separation from the delightful contact with the repulsive and diseaseYou have appeared through virtue gathered over a long timeSome loosened their clothes to reveal their hips adorned with girdlesThough one seeks for it in the ten directions It will be not be found because it is empty understanding the degrees of peoples spiritual faculties to dispel the doubts of all living beings It is maintaining good qualities  It is not relying on rebirthWithin that third temple made of incense was a throne with cushionsThe bodhisattva Nārāyaṇa declaredEach of the gods also expressed this desire saying I also want to carry the guide of this worldIt is because those who perform incantations in the world for the sake of healing sentient beings render these secret mantra syllables supreme principal exalted sublime profound vast authentic impenetrable and uniqueit is the seal of the DharmaThen the physicians sons who do not have deluded perception see the color of the medicine smell its aroma taste its flavor and quickly drink it They become completely free from all illnesshe offered for the Bhagavāns body two lengths of cloth of the value of a trillion silver coinsWhat is the realization of wisdom It is the realization of both mundane and supramundane qualitiesAt that time there will be no inferior beingsSenior āradvatīputra for these reasons these aforementioned statements are indeed nonarisingAnd were to teach them to millions of beings Together with the transmission of instructionsNakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijñaSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who possess such acceptance surpass all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhasāriputra I also teach the Dharma to beings through a single yānais called signlessness as a gateway to liberationThe eons are to be counted from the point at which a bodhisattva enters the sameness of all phenomena not from the first arousing of the mind of awakeningJust as in the prophecy To the fearless rya āriputraand they will perfect the other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasGreat bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom in that mannerSimilarly the nonappropriation of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness is not consciousness and the other aggregates on account of the emptiness of their inherent existenceSuch are the bodhisattvas who possess inalienable diligenceOne should put some beans in ones mouth and recite the mantraOne never tires of looking ata thickly woven cloth smeared with vaṅga seeds of āraThe thusgone ones have fully and perfectly awakened to all things uncompoundedness lack of existence lack of occurrence lack of origination lack of emergence absence of marks and absence of characteristics They know that no phenomenon comes goes or remains They know that phenomena are inherently pure inherently luminous inherently beyond suffering and like spaceThe oath is to be administered with the following words Thousands of nāgas always pay homage to it And so do garuḍas yakṣas and kiṃnarasalthough he has transcended the three realms he has love for them like that of a father for his only sonWe confess our fault in your presenceAll the tathāgatas sent their attendants in that waythose who have reached the eighth leveland just as they wish their bodies have power over beings as far up as those in Brahmās realmin the same way nonceasing nonconditioning nonorigination nonapprehension nonaffliction and nonpurification are without foundationNow what do you think could the semiprecious stones found in the city outshine the precious gemstones of berylpervaded by the aroma of incense from a variety of censers adorned by garlands and wreathsLikewise they know exactly which teachings lead to the attainment of a single rhinoceroslike solitary buddhaMastering all these roots of virtueWhere there are no erroneous views there is no selfFor many countless hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons they will have honored it with beautiful melodious clear sounds of many kinds of kettledrums and large kettledrums the sound of musical instruments and percussion different kinds of song dance and amusements and countless different kinds of musicWhen their time has come and they die they will be reborn here so these two vats have been reserved for themNoble son replied the Blessed One there are no differences between their bodies as such yet the body of a bodhisattva and the body of a thusgone one still differ in terms of the power of their qualitiesIt is likewise that the element of consciousness subtle and invisible though it is generates bodies and then abandons them again before producing other bodiesthe applications of mindfulnessAnd why is thatSimilarly they do not engage with the notion that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are entities or that they are nonentitiesIf they should say that then all is well A serious breach occurs if they do not say thatDharmamatiWith this queen of incantations Great Upholder of the Secret Mantra I will protect and form a boundary around the person named suchandsuchMaster Upatiṣya urged if the whole of what little renunciation we have is for ambrosia and the search for ambrosiaOne should write this mantra on a clay pot with chalk fill the pot with ashesThey should avoid those with poor conductWith that the bandits set upon the caravan taking the lives of some merchants asThe dharmabhāṇaka wondered where this voice had come fromIf you ask what constitute the three gateways to liberationIf you ask why it is because there are no sentient beings because sentient beings are nonapprehensible because sentient beings are nonarising because sentient beings are unceasing and because sentient beings are in fact emptinessMake this effort for the benefit of beingsBecause this is how much he was gripped by great compassionFor that reason it is called the transcendent perfection of supramundane generosityThe way of the sacred teachings of the lord buddhas who reside and are present in the innumerable world systems of the ten directions at the present timeand Venerable Lord is this noncultivation of all things indeed the cultivation of the transcendent perfection of wisdomnor with the hope for a higher existence nor with the hope for followersbut do so with the Dharma in mindMonks at that moment akra lord of the gods was unable to resist the Bodhisattvas request and soAnd their home is deep thought on the meaning of voidnessthe one with brilliant light that reaches everywhere the light that grants friendly disposition and great delightMany thousands of bodhisattvas were seated upon those lotusesThe person whose name has been interwoven with the mantrathe unsurpassable guide who tames beings the teacher of gods and humans the buddha the Bhagavat UmeśvaraThis Maitreya is how the bodhisattvas have excellent compassionMeditating with dedication complete dedication Like a deer live always in the forests not so in the case of those that are explained by the śrāvakasIf everyone

doctrine even for the sake of their own livesSimilarly the gateways to liberation are not one thing and illusions anotherSubhūti if physical forms were one thing and the emptiness of inherent existence anotherWhat are those ten They are excellent view through the purification of views excellent discipline immaculate conduct keeping proper personal associations conduct free of affliction

does not pay heed Instead he says Tear him up Beat him Destroy him Dont let him escape aliveYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of knowledge of modesty What are the four kinds of knowledge of modesty It is discernment the wisdom that enters peace It is the knowledge of the different categories of all lettersIn this way one avoids future defilement In the absence of defilement actions are exhaustedMahārāja Dhṛtarāṣṭra Mahārāja VaiśravaṇaMonks a person who has killed his father is fit to be excluded from the communityIf you ask why it is called the transcendent perfection of

nonhuman beings will honor venerate respect and make offerings to them with ribbons and so forth along with various musical soundsSubhūti all things have a modality that is neither diminished nor enhanced great bodhisattva beings too do not transgress this modalityVenerable Lord In what things should great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom abideOr serve as their disciplesand similarly I am maintaining ethical disciplineand taking his robes and ornaments he offered them to the Buddha Bhaiṣajyarāja sayingHe entered nirvāṇa millions of eons ago But still he listens to the DharmaLikewise from inside outYou must not look down on females Particularly not anyone by the name of TārāThe young brahmins then went off to collect wood for use in fire pūjasLikewise the prediction of Dīpaṃkara shall come to passWhat is meant by it not being the level of the tīrthikas It means that their level is the false pride of a practitionerWhen they step off the great road of razors five hundred thorns each with sixteen spikes will pierce each footSeer as you instruct I shall not preach replied SaṅgharakṣitaIn the same way Mañjuśrī it is due to the complete purity of the mind as well as due to proper cultivation that sentient beings see the body of a tathāgataCandraśrī Glory of the Moon Sūryaśrī Glory of the Sun Sarvagrahaśrī Glory of All the PlanetsThis mantra can be mastered by reciting it  timesSimilarly those who are tied to one more rebirth the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth those who are no longer subject to rebirth the

obtain great splendorI turn to the heavens and fly into the skyThe buddhafield will be made of beryl and be adorned with lotus flowers of gold from the Jāmbū RiverVenerable Lord When great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom how do they definitively comprehend that all things are like a dream and that all things are like a phantom and so onIn the same way one should practice with a gandharva made of bambooLooking throughout all Jambudvīpanot bound not liberatedContent with what is hers she should lie with her husband free from carelessness She should not be arrogant or slothful She should comport herself fittingly Someone may be able to catch an echo A stone may be able to float on the waterThen Brother Sthavira Mahāmaudgalyāyana Brother Subhūti and Brother Mahākātyāyana with trembling bodies and unblinking eyes stared at the Bhagavān andThe Bhagavān teaches the samādhi That is the field of experience of a hundred thousand trillion buddhas I have taught the Dharma that the whole world was reluctant to acceptIn this way they render even the names of the web of the roots of affliction unknownA gandharvī even a female hellbeingThat is to say they abide in the two extremes of eternalism and nihilism and so forthattributes that are mundane or supramundanehung with armletsSince you delight in concentration your personal qualities benefit

that space there are the lakes and oceans All rivers and similarly ponds and springsAs an analogy a welltrained conjurer displays various cities archways parks vehicles physical forms of a universal monarch amusements and entertainmentsFrom the left side Vātajava saidThrough this queen of incantations Great Upholder of the Secret Mantra the person will escape on each and every occasionLike a sacrificial post made of precious substances he was refined dazzling and brilliantthe precious wheel the precious elephant the precious horse the precious jewel the precious wife the precious steward and the precious ministeror a water bubblethat this body is insubstantial and all phenomena are impermanentEvil one today you will be dried up by the Bodhisattva Like the waterfilled footprint of a cowOr is it uncompounded in natureSubhūti it is because the essential nature of dreams will not attain emancipation from the three world systems andthe inconceivably numerous words of unquantifiability concerning the kleśasformerly in times gone by there lived a prince named Giver of All Wealth goodlookingThe impermanence of physical forms is indeed emptiness and emptiness indeed is the impermanence of physical formsThey have obtained a human life that is difficult to obtain But they have not become skilled in any craftAnd also for a sextillion and a nonillion but beyond that

the power of patience at all times How did you attain the preeminence of a tathāgata and the heroism of a tathāgataTherefore young man bodhisattva mahāsattvas who wonder How can I know the nature of all phenomenaHe teaches the Dharma in the form of Maheśvara to beings who are to be taught by MaheśvaraSubhūti in the sameness of things past time is nonapprehensiblewith but a weeks worth of hair and beardLikewise if that person is to be tamed by brahmins warriors townspeople or country dwellers then indeed the relevant type of person will be emanatedYet Your Majesty whoever is peaceful and gentle Informed by the noble and stainless Dharma And filled with knowledgehe is satisfiedThose people will go to hell when they die iiiThey will always cultivate the five higher cognitions And those heroes will always be in the presence of the sugatas But the moon has not moved onto the water Know that all phenomena are like that They always work for the sake of all sentient beingsBhikṣus the Mahābrahmā

constitute the element of consciousnessFree from the two extremesthey experience innumerable countless and immeasurable sufferings and discomforts among the denizens of the hells among animals and among anguished spiritsSo it is Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings should practice the six transcendent perfections which are the emptiness of inherent existenceThe village gatekeeper recognized him and askedAll the words that they speak Come forth through the power of the jinas Therefore we will sneak in overrun his exposed camp and kill him while their guard is down and their armor offIn this teaching of the sacred doctrine is there no imputation of physical formsWhen people hear that you have renounced all this The world with its gods and humans will long for the sameI contemplated this meaning in that way While gazing there upon the tree The incantations make their garden Which blossoms with the flowers of the factors of enlightenmentMoreover āradvatīputra malign demonic forces will transform themselves into the guise of a buddhaThey will see all of the Merus Sumerus and CakravālasNo longer will I behold the assembly of divine siddhas Who make offerings to you day and nightto ripen beingsI seek to serve you gentlemenethical discipline tolerance perseverance meditative concentration and wisdom never exist and are nonapprehensibleOn the relative level ill will is a gateway to an ugly appearanceThen after contemplating I began to make my offeringsThe Blessed One was dwelling in Nyagrodha Park in Kapilavastu together with a great saṅgha of five hundred monksThey are established on various levels As beautiful devas and humans As akras Brahmās and as cakravartinsāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness as having aspirations or lacking aspirations constitute a bodhisattvawho are the lowest among the realms of sentient beings and who all buddhas and bodhisattvas have given up on Then I meditated upon this samādhi I listened correctly to the teaching of those jinasThe destroyer of yakṣas and rākṣasas When well contemplated and well applied The incantation that guards kingdoms Called Liberator of Kingdoms Is the most sublime sūtra for protection In the entire great trichiliocosmthe prince fixed the King of Aṅgas head onto a long pole and displayed it sayingand these are the retributions for mental misdeedsWhat is rejecting those who are not wise beings It is rejecting tīrthikas who have the view of objective realityShe has attained the retention by which she remembers the words and meaning of the teachings of all tathāgatasBrahmānana highest of humans DP Had a lifespan of twenty thousand years Candrabhūti after the body has lived its lifeFurthermore Maitreya if bodhisattvas possess six qualitiesHow does it entail the producing of a large result from a small cause A large fruit is produced from the planting of a small seed Therefore it entails the producing of a large result from a small causeThey are brahmins They are snātakas They are masters of the Vedasand similarly if feelings were one thing perceptions another thingWhy should the wise comprehend it Because it brings the attainment of irreversibilityMonks there are two extremes that you should avoid when you have taken ordinationYou defeat all the tīrthikas Like a lion defeats jackals One causing the other they arise in dependence Yet all the childish beings do not recognize thisDivine son it is as in the following analogyWhen they do not relish the blissful taste of concentration they are irreproachableCompletely fills the secret gemIf the ordinand responds I have gone forth the inquirer asks himwhose essential nature is nonentity and emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristicsJayamatiI am trying to persevereShould I give you food or drink A ridingmount Jewelry Gold gems pearls or various kinds of precious thingsthey were moved by the desire to visit ita tantra text and so forthThat which is called the restraint of speechHe never loses his absorption in the formation of faith and thereforeThen through further development of the path of cultivation this same individual will abandon attachment to the world system of desire and malice in their entiretyThrough a single syllable may you realize all the natural expressions of speechEvil one I will not pass into parinirvāṇa until my elder monks have become restrained lucid proficient courageous and learned until they have embarked on the Dharma in an authentic way and become masters themselves and until they can overcome opponents in concordance with the Dharma and teach the Dharma in conjunction with miraclesWho are you venerables What karma has led you to thisand as awakening is at peace understand that all sentient beings are at peaceperfected the sixtyfour crafts fully mastered all the artsFurthermore āriputra why is that tathāgata called Amitābha Immeasurable Lightthey do not regress to the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas andpausing on the seventh stepFor sixty whole intermediate eons he taught while sitting on the one seat with a motionless body and a motionless mindAt the throat in the chakra of enjoyment One enjoys the six flavors Thus Rasanā is concealed in the chakra of enjoymentAs soon as the two holy beings had spoken these words all of the bodhisattva great beings in the world of Sukhāvatī assembled and said in a single voicewho are the ones who remain at the foot of a treenor should they have any special attachment to their livesthere were two monks who had committed some infraction and were too ashamed to appear before the LordGoddess what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female stateThe bodhisattvas the meditative stabilities and this transcendent perfection of wisdom are without duality and they are inseparableTo him should one explain this tantraO ṇā blind in one eye enthrall such and such SvāhāThus Brahmā lord of the Sahā World as well as the other gods of the pure realms settled on those seats that had been arrangedQueen Māyā bathed and applied perfumes to her body She ornamented her arms with many bracelets and dressed in the softest and most beautiful garments Joyful happy and rapturous accompanied and encircled by ten thousand womenIn the East they are wiseDeploring evil they regret it and confess itThis concludes the Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra on Dependent ArisingIf you ask what is the knowledge of the extinction of contaminantsSince all these phenomena are equal to spaceNoble son within the perfect palace of the Heaven of Joy there are beings who act carelesslyThose phenomena are to be brought aboutHe hung it with many precious strings of beadsThrough this my gift may all sentient beings attain happiness in this lifetime May they attain final nirvāṇa in the expanse of reality that is beyond sorrow and where there is no residue of the psychophysical aggregatesAnd so monks once again the Bodhisattva turned his fine chariot around and returned to the cityThe four bases of miraculous power are gateways to the light of the DharmaThis is maliceKilled should be the evil ones Those who disparage the Buddhas teachingThis is not the teaching of the Teacher This is not the path that progresses to perfect enlightenmentBlessed One asked the bodhisattva VajrapāṇiMoreover Kauśika when great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomReverend Upāli conceptualization is total affliction and not conceptualizingRespectfully one should prepare a seat for that Dharma teacher offer praise and frequently express ones approval of the teachingMeanwhile the disciplinarian stood at the end of the senior monks rowBrahmadatta felt great pity for me And he taught me this supreme samādhi Annapānadā She Who Gives Food and Drinkakra king of the gods along with the other gods of the Heaven of the ThirtyThreeThey do not consider whether physical forms are calm or not calmBy continuing with that kind of activity Their sufferings only increase He had vanquished the demonic opponentsThus young man there are countless names of nirvāṇa and the tathāgata too has that many appellationsone should draw A yellow one nicely marked with a jewelcomparable to an illusion without characteristicsso it would be good if I could also find a flat stone on which to wash this clothReverend that is the cause due to which the Tāthagatas companions are now so fewNor could any phenomena absolutely void be attributed and sustained as existent or nonexistentHow can that outshine all the hearers and solitary buddhas who rely on reference points who are included under the unconditionedaccompanied by a great assembly of brahmins kṣatriyas vaiśyas and śūdras gazing upon himIn every single instant they can visit and return from innumerable worldsThis completes the twelfth chapter from The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines entitled Meditative Stabilityso it is that they correctly perceive the real nature of formative predispositionsNeither the sphere of mental objects nor knowledge have formhis mind was as firm and unmoving as Mount Meruthese śrāvakas will not preserve or teach this kind of sūtraunlike those of other human beingsBlessed One asked the bodhisattva SarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhinIf ones body becomes malodorous one will die within three daysSimilarly the imperishability of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness is not consciousness and the other aggregatesMay I realize the teaching of nonselfMañjuśrī a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the result of a nonreturnerPadmaśrī do you see the bodhisattva mahāsattva GadgadasvaraThe children of the sugatas who are without attachment Through wisdom are established in the highest enlightenment those born in the water and on landThis method that benefits all beings Is based on seeing that the world is without refuge And tormented by the three types of sufferingthey also refine the buddhafields and they bring sentient beings to maturityThough they hear blessed buddhas may inquire about what they already knowThe sameness of the three times is empty of the sameness of the three timesthe pacification of elaborations is nondisturbanceSo it is Subhūti that from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment until they are seated at the Focal Point of Enlightenment great bodhisattva beings should train in the perfection of all virtuous attributesYou are absorbed into nonappearanceGive rise to devotion on hearing it And become those who are guidedThe seventh aspect of liberation ensues when the sense field of nothingatall has been completely transcended in all respects and one achieves and abides in the sense field of neither perception nor nonperceptionThe Blessed One the tathāgata arhat perfectly awakened omniscient allseeing BuddhaLord of the World listen to me And understand its true meaning Giving away ones spouses sons and daughters represents the bodhisattvas awakening to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood Therefore I will definitely practice generosity by giving away my spouses sons and daughtersBecause I was practicing in a conceptual mannerThey should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion May the desire hatred and delusion of those sentient beings who have scented the fragrance of my Tree of Enlightenment be eliminatedthat I should hear this Dharma discourse and hear this topic from the Blessed One the best of men is hairraising and amazingSeeing that his father ruled in ways compatible with the principles of justice the boy thoughtThus noble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities have a pure mindAnd so ultimately he speaks neither falsely nor trulyJust as the moon appears in water yet is not thereThat which is unappraisable is designated as unappraisableThe buddhas do not stay by themselvesand will neither engage in generosity nor maintain their disciplineThey make offerings from their own hands with respect and reverence and their motivation is pure wholesome and virtuousthrowing a lasso casting a spearThen Senior āradvatīputra asked the Blessed OneOne should grind the roots of sensitive plants and wild indigo with cold rice porridgeThe enormity of his merit and wisdom has purified his bodyI must expunge a wrongdoing he repliedconstitute the negativity of mindA king receives veneration surrounded by a crowd of peoplenot true not real with no mind without intentionWhen the māra gave this teaching five hundred bodhisattvas attained acceptance of the nonarising of phenomenaWe will also protect that land We will worship those who teach it and will protect them appear to them and inspire themSimilarly once they have rejoiced in those roots of virtuous action possessed by great bodhisattva beings who already abide on the levels up to and including the tenth level and similarly in those roots of virtuous action possessed by great bodhisattva beings who are tied to only one more rebirthAnd give them the prophecy of becoming a supreme being Saying Noble one here in a future time You will reach the highest peace and wisdomHow could bodhisattvas become anything other than all those remaining phenomena up to and including the link of aging and deathNoble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities are endowed with excellent diligenceBlessed One do the thusgone ones not gain their true accomplishment over three incalculable

masters sons daughters spouses relatives and kinsmen but impatient with othersThis continuing nature cannot be described It is the empty unfluctuating continuity of phenomena one should request

retinues were tamed and bowed before the Blessed OneThese various ritual methods have been set forthThe Blessed One considered whether or not these merchants had any meager roots of virtue and saw that they didEstablish them in the highest knowledge And then this king of samādhis will not be difficult to attain Similarly the ten powers of the tathāgatas do not apprehend the limit of future time

lightHe is known as the one who possesses the maṇḍala of the profound perfection of wisdom that is hard to gain and hard to beholdThe nine causes of antagonism are a cause of afflictionThe bodhisattva great beings who abide there within the illusory absorption are indeed limitless and countlessThat which belongs to a shrine belongs to the Dharma belongs to the saṅgha and that which was not given or not offeredall such things bodhisattvas do not take and do not make their ownThese are the attributes of śrāvakasHis body was adorned with the thirtytwo characteristics of a great being and he was ornamented with the eighty fine markstended to them as one does an irrigation channel and emerged without indecisionThey also refine the buddhafields they pass from one buddhafield to another buddha fieldIllusions are worthless absent emptyThe bodhisattvas walk each evening along these walkways while thinking about various aspects of the MahāyānaJust as a pile of barley sesame wheat or lentils is called a heap so the accumulation of things belonging to the limbs and other parts of the body is called a heapand similarly why would they have a view concerning the eyes and in the same vein why would they have a view concerning the other sense organs up to and including the mental facultyThe body of a bodhisattva in his last existence is free from the four stages of embryonic development Instead he appears seated with all his limbs organs and characteristics fully formedBhagavat I request that you teach what samādhis Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has previously remained

of the thirtytwo primary signs of a great beingThe statement that all phenomena are devoid of a sentient being and a life force is rationalConclusion of the nineteenth chapter The Teaching of the Inconceivable Dharma of the BuddhaWith a beautiful formthey prostrated at his feet and circled him three times scattering sandalwood powder aloeswood powder and māndārava flowersAnd what are these marksthey teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings with an undistracted mindaction does not show itself within the body nor does the body show itself within actionAs soon as he entersthey do not pay attention with the twofold overscrupulous attentiveness of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas to the notion that physical formsone billion realms of the Heaven of Limitless VirtueThe way that they are following Is the way of those who kill their mothers It is the way of those who kill their fathersIt was a tree to which the wholesome and peaceful gods of the pure realms would bow down and touch with their heads including their topknots and diademsMake excellent images that are fashioned From gold or silver and also sandalwoodand in the same vein they grant the other aforementioned gifts up to and including the appropriate human resources but they have not actually dispensed any gifts to any sentient beingNoble son those who possess knowledge of only certain fields of learning may run out of words YetThere is nothing comparable to the absorption That perceives the vajralike nondual path The manifestation in due order of what is most desired The permanent accomplishment of the

measure up to a hundred thousandth of a single instance of the power that the thusgone ones have to understand what is true or false Indeed no analogy could be given for that powerThen she went west and north but in those places as well she encountered the Bodhisattva He was the son of the buddhas of the leaders of men Of the tathāgatas who have infinite wisdomVenerable one this is excellent Hero among humans this is excellentAt that point if one is going to be a man one sees oneself in the form of a manMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections see sentient beings lacking an excellent life spanhow could they teach without teaching the Dharma to the hearersIn Gaya not far from the seat of awakening an jīvika mendicant spotted him from afarThese are the branches of the noble eightfold pathAs he is approaching the time of his death he summons the poor manAnd they will fall away and wanderMerged fully with ones own awarenessThey make their nests everywhere As dwellings for their offspringOverwhelmed by greed they will not engage in activities of worship not even toward those who teach the DharmaTo the ones who possess this sūtra after my nirvāṇa In these later extremely dreadful timesThe kings five hundred daughters were being carried in precious palanquins in frontPreceptor why do you sit here thus so unhappyNoble one the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara gives freedom from fear to beings who are afraidMoreover āradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings engage in union with the emptiness of the eyes they are said to engage in union with the transcendent perfection of wisdomOf the merit from possessing Just one verse of this samādhi Bhagavān even for us bodhisattvas on the level of irreversibility this

always be pleasant to see And offerings wil be made to them as if they were tathāgatasāradvatīputra do you think that the five psychophysical aggregates can in a dreamlike manner train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom and attain emancipation in omniscienceI have utterly reversed With the rosaries of the branches of awakeningdisplaying the form of a buddha to sentient beings who are

morality tolerance effort meditation and wisdom for the sake of omniscienceThey are the reason why you cannot obtain the great resultReverend Saṅgharakṣita we were disciples of the perfectly awakened Buddha KāśyapaNothing material has any essenceit is called mundane because it does not transcend the worldAlas Right here in my presence you should put an end to sufferingCompared to them someone who writes this Dharma teaching down commissions it to be writtenand in their hands they brandished swords bows arrows darts lances axes tridents clubs staffs bludgeons lassos cudgels discuses vajras and spearsBecause of the nature of the four bodiesNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities are experts on the ultimateIf I were to teach all of their modes of conductThey called out loudly to the guhyakasJust like a well during the end of summer where the reflection of the stars has sunk and is hard to notice my eyeballs had sunk into my head and become barely visibleThis is an obscuration and that is without obscurationIf you ask Subhūti how great bodhisattva beings embark sentient beings for the wellbeing of the worldsSimilarly Subhūti this Great Vehicle too is endowed neither with the fruit of having entered the streamThey will all eliminate becoming and ceasing AndMonks at that time akra lord of the gods and Brahmā lord of the Sahā World appeared before the BodhisattvaDistinguishing between words and having the insight of wisdom Having developed compassion he teaches that Dharma Subhūti when certain great bodhisattva beings lacking the transcendent perfection of wisdom over eons equal in number to the sands of the River Ganges enter into union with the four applications of mindfulness the four correct exertions the four supports for miraculous ability the five faculties the five powers the seven branches of enlightenment the noble eightfold path and the three gateways to liberationThe tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha ākyamuni now manifested places for the bodies of the tathāgatas who were coming and arriving In all ten directions there were two hundred thousand million buddha realms made of beryland similarly those who attend in an apprehending manner to the notions that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are the emptiness of internal phenomenaThey do overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its gods humans and antigodsGreat hero compassionate one Whose wish is to bring benefit give us the prophecyMaitreya how do such bodhisattvas have excellent intentionall are mastered for practitionerswithout dwellingAnd the universal monarch and the lion have no armythey praise and rejoice in others who dispense the gift of the sacred doctrine and worldly giftsSince Mount Meru and the surrounding ranges The sun the moon akra BrahmāHis shot was so powerful that the arrow went right through the targets set up by nanda Devadatta Sundarananda and Daṇḍapāṇidie among spirits only to be reborn among animalsAnd if each of them were to have heads As numerous as the grains of sand in the oceanIlluminates all these worlds with its lightFor a mind that stands nowhere there will be nonarisingone will be successful If one can arrest the movements of the mindHowever relatively the vinaya of the bodhisattva great beings is like gold and silver which can be mended when brokenthere will not be the word ignorancethese include the renunciation of all afflicted mental states and of all propensities and impulses toward involuntary reincarnationThere are also one billion surrounding mountain ranges and one billion outer rangesOn that moon again is the seedsyllable From which emanate rays of lightIt is necessary to know and to understand this fact of the ultimate inactivity of all thingsThese and all other women Possess my formGreat bliss being pure devoid of nature Is the sixth pertaining to the lower doorAt the Deer Park by the Hill of the Fallen Sages outside of VārāṇasīDid they carry their belongings or did they lack uniformityexperiencing the unfathomable sufferings of amputation of the hands and feet and decapitationMonks the Bodhisattva continued to thinkNever again shall he see his parents wife or children He must abandon his possessions his house his friends and his relativesare attentive to it in the correct mannerthose who seek the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth cultivate the path in order to abandon the five fetters associated with the lower realmsMoreover by means of the three vehicles such a bodhisattva will deliver a limitless countless and boundless number of sentient beings from the three realms Mañjuśrī this thought brings me to despairhe now sits at the seat of awakeningThe environments and sentient beings The elements and their derivatives Have been declared to be mind only By those who possess the undefiled special visionAll those things Mahauṣadhi are unstable and lowly liable to dissolve quickly and be destroyed If that man were to lose the precious wishfulfilling jewel his pleasant possessions would also vanishand in the same vein that that one will be reborn among the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realmThe one for whom this phenomenon arises is dependently arisenIf those seeds are flawlessThe monk informant asks the preceptor Have you inquired into the confidential mattersfencingUpasena asked the Blessed Buddha Reverend the Blessed One has saidTheir desires will be very powerfulThey are the ground where the mind of awakening has been engendered as well as the grounds of the Joyous the Stainless the Radiant the Flaming the Hard to Conquer the Manifest the Far Reaching the Unshakable the Excellent Intelligence the Cloud of Dharma and the buddhas ground of Universal Illumination These are the twelve groundsnot to speak Bhagavān of establishing them in the higher state of arhathoodNor did he see him when he looked among humans animals and spiritsAfter they explained the situation at length he saidin the same way SubhūtiHis wealth was inexhaustible for the purpose of sustaining the poor and the helplessI spoke duplicitously and fraudulently in which case it is only excessive prideWhat are those ten They are as follows Without any attachment to beds they neither prepare one for themselves nor make others prepare one nor make any gestures for a bed to be preparedLapsed discipline will torment one at the time of deathThey who have wicked minds Will reject the Buddhas teachinglike an optical aberrationThus have I heard at one timeThis person offered the prince his own saffroncolored clothes and the prince in return gave him these silken garmentsthis supreme vehicle the Great Vehicle does overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its gods humans and antigodsAnd when that protector has passed into nirvāṇa His Dharma will remain for twice as longIn order to overthrow such beingsSleep can never cause them harm They eliminate the various subsidiary kleśasLamp of the World you are now seen After a long time you have comeno additionThey do not maintain discipline out of fear of becoming a hell beingFrom formations that lead to meritorious states comes consciousness that leads to meritorious states From formations that lead to unmeritorious states comes consciousness that leads to unmeritorious states And from formations that lead to immovable states comes consciousness that leads to immovable states This is what is meant by formations cause consciousnessMay I never lean toward nor perform wrong nonvirtuous actionsThey swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentThe domains of your verbal and mental activity are also unfathomableThen the Bhagavān said a second time to Brother āriputraThus in the presence of some he will manifest in an ordinary form and teach the Dharmaas are the auguries of allknowing beings and the two forms of wealthmaterial wealth and the wealth of Dharmaare to be hadWhat sort of miraculous power does a bodhisattva great being possessneither long nor shortWhen the asura king Bali saw Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara approaching from the distanceSince the thusgone ones are active in this way throughout the lifespan of the body in which they transcended sufferingthey are all now present living and remainingyou should ask You have not fallen by committing any of the four acts leading to defeat have youIt is from the union of the vajra and the lotus That true pleasure is derivedFurthermore reverend āriputra there are beings who become disciplined after an immense period of evolutionNoble son I also wandered through many hundreds of thousands of millions of tens of millions of worlds and thenToday the compassionate guide Of those who need guidance has left this noble cityThis memorial is still known today as the Memorial of Receiving the SaffronColored ClothAlas Those who inhabit the worlds are in error and enter dreadful mistaken pathsYou developed compassion for all sentient beings And made offerings to billions of buddhasgaining accomplishment on the path traveled by the thusgone onesVimalatejā what does the true meaning eliminateThose who have correct conduct will have good qualities They will always remain loving and be skilled in patienceThey will also achieve and maintain loving kindness compassion empathetic joy and equanimity alongside the formless absorptions from the sense field of infinite consciousness up to and including the sense field of neither perception nor nonperceptionIn all regards he is the same free from concepts and free from distinctionsWith conviction in that teaching they avoid all unvirtuous qualitiesAnd savor the supreme tasteNanda and Upananda this retired devotee has no obvious source of income nor any obvious record of allocationsThese are the spiritual mentors to great bodhisattva beingsThey went to Upatiṣya who saw them off in the distance and askedand similarly that the priestly class and particularly those who stand out like mighty sāl trees will emerge in the worldThey will not construe the notion that omniscience is signless and that signlessness is omniscienceWhat are those ten They are expertise in investigating origination expertise in examining all phenomena comprehension of the sameness of all phenomena comprehension that all phenomena are characterized by illusion expertise in the knowledge of all phenomena expertise in the profound dependent origination that is hard to fathom expertise regarding inconceivable karmic action knowledge of the meaning taught full realization of the exact meaning and expertise concerning realityKauśika whenever great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomand then through insight into the knowledge of liberation will forsake the three fettersHowever Venerable āradvatīputra are these five transcendent perfections not designated as transcendent perfections when they are acquired by means of the transcendent perfection of generosityThey have transcended the level of desire the level of form the level of formlessnessThe consecration of a king with flowers Great ones bestow that upon meThose nonhuman beings quickly departed for other placesShe goes to the river and happily sits on the banks of the NairañjanāAccordingly nanda this transcendent perfection of wisdom like a precious gemstone is the source of all positive attributes andSometimes I am the Buddha sometimes a siddhaThe sixth meditative absorption ensues when the sense field of infinite space has been completely transcended in all respects and when one achieves and abides in the sense field of infinite consciousness thinking Consciousness is infiniteThus bodhisattvas endowed with patience will attain freedom from obscurationsThis is wisdomThe words they hear will be beautiful delightful and profoundTranscendent perfection is endowed with all enlightened attributes Transcendent perfection is a state of uncrushabilityThey do not consider whether physical forms are with signs or signlessand so on up to These will be reborn among the gods and humans in the world systems of the happy exalted realms This is known by wise bodhisattvas Just as taught by the Lord of DharmaThen King uddhodana arranged a great naming ceremony and announced This childs name is SarvārthasiddhaOne should place a diadem on ones headHe later went forth into the perfectly awakened and blessed Buddha Kāśyapas teachings anddie among gods only to be reborn among spiritsThey will not save me from going to hellIn order to help living beings They always become chieftains Captains priests and ministers Or even prime ministersThe eighth aspect of liberation ensues when the sense field of neither perception nor nonperception has been completely transcended in all respects and one achieves and abides in the cessation of all perceptions and feelingsThe Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra Entitled Teaching the Four Factorsand every last one of them comes to an endThey know how to teach the entire Dharma They are skilled in etymologies teaching and the meaning of wordsThey will not fall away from attaining swift superknowledge and perfecting the wisdom of omniscienceThe space should be adorned with various parasols victory banners and flagsThe multitudinous six quintillion men Who with the king had heard the DharmaPlease bless this Dharma robe as a lower robethe tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha named MeghasvararājaNoble ones though there is some good to your teaching you too have faultsThe earth he sees dug outJust as in the case of the conception of self so the conception of thing is also a misunderstandingSo long will the god realms be enhanced and the antigod realms be diminishedBut noble son would the people thereby personally know how the fruit tastesNārāyaṇa which quantity of merit would be greaterthat of the gift or Great Brahmās loveBecause they are terrified they turn back from attaining unsurpassable perfectly complete enlightenment and aspire to the vehicle of the śrāvakasThen the gods reflected The Bodhisattva is having a heartwarming conversation with us And each one of them thought The Bodhisattva is speaking directly to me to me alone he extends a friendly welcomeAfter rinsing them with warm waterSubhūti the more those roots of virtue of great bodhisattva beings increaseThe earth with its forests shook in six waysIf they sit down for just a moment where the Dharma of the sūtra is being taught and listen to this Dharma teaching or make another person sit down or share their seat with another beingIt cleared away all disturbing emotions and brought joy happiness trust and supreme enjoyment to all sentient beingsthe sensory element of the bodyYou bring relief and devas and humans make offerings to you And today we also Lord have been made contentthose places Become filled with the brilliant light Given off by her dedication to virtuous deedsIn the same vein why do you say that the remaining designations made with respect to the sensory element of the eyes the sensory element of sights and the sensory element of visual consciousness up to and including their designation as entities or nonentities do not constitute a bodhisattvaThey teach the Dharma for the abandonment of the afflictions yet they do not observe any abandonment of the afflictionsthe activities of the garland mantra Of retention and of fire offerings are all omittedāradvatīputra the nine contemplations of impurity are merely conceptualized I have had the road swept and covered with cloth Banners of flowers have been arranged on the right And other beautiful images on the leftyou should consider how you could possibly attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentIt is far removed from the understanding of all phenomena from the understanding of the aspects of the path and from omnisciencelikewise it is the understanding that the ears nose tongue body mental faculty sights sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena are all impermanentHe looked with divine vision over the ten directions mountains earth and oceansOwing to the fact that sentient beings are nonexistentthe inconceivably numerous kinds of action concerning teaching the compositeThey have attained perfection in the supreme trainingWhen I claim I am one whose contaminants have ceased if some virtuous ascetic brāhmin god demon Brahmā or anyone else should say that these particular contaminants of mine have not ceased I would correctly disregard that reason for contradicting me based on their worldly doctrinesWhen they who have very poor conduct See those who are maintaining correct conductso he remained silent After a time their rage passed and when it did he went to them One should not take delight in saṃsāra through an inauthentic conceptual understanding saṃsāra being like a magical illusion or dreamNoble one if those who possess the name of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara were to fall into a great mass of flamesThis completes The Sūtra on the Threefold TrainingAll attained happiness through the majesty Of the Guide the supreme human Son of noble family there are five root transgressions for śrāvakaskeeps his mind well disposed toward the Sugatas teachingand marital unions between individuals who are purethey still would not reach the extent or limit of the thusgone ones meditative absorptions and their respective fields of activityThey have fallen into bewildermentThey are not attached to the pleasures of sleep or of restingit is the understanding that the eye is impermanent andencouraging sentient beings to maintain them authentically as well and establishing them securely thereinthey displease those who have entered negative paths and are savage childish possessed of misguided intelligence fond of cyclic existence or turn away from the transcendence of sufferingDuring that time he was despised And his bhikṣus became few in numberThey should abandon the noble truth of the origin of sufferingthat is to say the aggregate of ethical discipline the aggregate of meditative stability the aggregate of wisdom the aggregate of liberation and the aggregate of the perception of liberating pristine cognitionThey who possess this supreme samādhi Will when the time of their death comesAruṇa Aruṇa endowed with great compassionWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas expertise concerning the continuity of cyclic existence consist inin the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities the five eyes are nonapprehensiblewho were without kleśas who had mastered themselvesThis great tantra is the ultimate secret Which without doubt is victorious among the three vehicles And supreme among all protective intentionsThe light then returned and circled around the Blessed One three times before it entered his mouthThen the poor of the city having seen that miracle and having heard that teaching conceived the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenmentIf you ask why it is because they do not consider the nature of these sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of visual consciousnessSimilarly when the moonlike bodhisattvas rise they are praised by the world with its gods humans demigods and gandharvasSeeing the tree the prince was disturbed by the suffering he had just understood And remarked Conditioned things are no good They bring a lot of sufferingAfter Jñāneśvara there was a buddha A jina who was named Tejeśvaraat the foot of a tree in the open airTheir abdomen is slenderthe lord of nāgas the lord of yakṣas the lord of gandharvasTo Tagaraśikhin you offered your kingdom and to Durjaya much incenseThey are ordained into those who stare at the sun the followers of Maheśvaraconditioned or unconditionedBy letting go of everythingThey will realize the profound Dharma of the BuddhaIgnorance does not think I produce formationsarising from that equipoise in the sense field of neither perception nor nonperceptionand a corresponding circumference very imposing This was indeed a magnificent and beautiful treecontinuing in the same vein as far as the designation of the sensory element of mental consciousness as with signs or signless constitute a bodhisattvaYoung Candraprabha adorned the road with many different precious arrangementsSimilarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are not one thing and illusions anothersaid these words to the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha

body assume feeling and volitionAs he retracted his hand there was no harm done to his motherfor the sake of a limited number of sentient beings thinkingAnd therefore I obtained this unfavorable rebirth It is not easy to know the Dharma of the Jina Great bodhisattva beings who train in these three gateways to liberationJust as when the ripe fruit of the tāla tree is nipped off its stem the severed area immediately becomes yellow bright and perfectly pureprayerThey do not lose their miraculous powers These are distinctive qualities of the second patience Māras mind was confused and his thoughts befuddledAt that time I was Prince Mati I was tormented by the pain of an illnessReverend Subhūti do not fear these words and pick up your bowlpurifying your intentions and understanding the definitive expressions of the Dharmablazing like this in complexion magnificence splendor marks of buddhahood and with clear brilliant radiance may the Tathāgata touch me with his footfor those afflicted beings entangled in latent tendencies he is like a vajra because he overcomesThe aroma of wisdom will arise so that they Will become buddhas with the aroma of supreme conduct He prophesied to each of them their separate names their identical lifespans and the individual buddha realms whereSimilarly the transcendent perfection of generosity has been taught without apprehending anything the application of mindfulness which with regard to the mind observes the mindthe earth element does not think I provide the solidity of the body by assemblingwill enter into the way of the tathāgatasif for just a brief moment Another teaches others this sūtraSimilarly they neither associate the eyes with the limit of future time nor do they disassociate them therefromYet Senior āradvatīputra attainment and clear realization refer to worldly conventionsand he listened as the Blessed One had instructed him Then the Blessed One saidThis very tathāgata will spread light in that world systemThe Bhagavān knows the enlightenment of buddhahood In which there are there no words or letters to be found Will see and make offerings To the buddhas of the past present and future And all those in the ten directions Always maintaining a sense of modesty and selfrespect Speaking reverently to the guru and rising to greet himIt is precisely in the sense that they are empty that they are to be relied onGrahas born from yakṣasThis being is not in our controlAnd another six trillion And said to the guide of the world Has been severed by the blade of wisdomThe bodhisattva mahāsattva Pradānaśūra thenIf a person approaches a monk wishing to go forthVenerable Lord If the fruit is not established by eradicating conditioned or unconditioned elementsVenerable Lord When they hold and are attentive to the transcendent perfection of wisdomNow comes the ritual involving the third root mantraHe first practiced austerities and hardships Before going to the center of the earthNoble son it is like this As a comparison I can count the number of leaves in a forest of agarwood trees butIt is also called appropriating desire because one appropriates the desire for formthey explain those causes those causal factors that Dharma to other beings just as they have heard it just as they remember it to the extent of their ability whether it be to their father mother or relative and to anyone else who will be pleased with whom they are acquaintedHow can such a huge multitude eat such a small amount of food Just as when a wise man rebuilds A stūpa that has fallen into ruinassemblies of bhūtas in the southAnd finally after so long Saw the transcendence of all resentment and fearThe beings who were born there could see each other andExcellent noble ones excellent Noble ones your praise of the Tathāgata is excellent excellentthere emanated many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of bodhisattvas whose bodies were the color of gold who possessed the thirtytwo signs of a great being and were seated upon lion thrones in the center of lotusesI have taught many kings of sūtras I have established many beings in the state of awakeningGenerosity discipline and patience are my witnessesFurthermore the great sages those who know the thoughts of others Just as echoes are created through conditions In caves mountains and canyonsI shall teach a fitting dharmaMāṭhara Your MajestySeven dust particles on a cow is one louse eggDo not prevent this girl from listening to the DharmaDo not put rotten food into a jeweled bowlAt the quarters of the consorts he directed everyone to continuously sing and play music and not to stop for even a moment You must apply all your skills in pleasure and games he told themMoreover they have no limitless store of wealth and treasures Hence this is not a worthy place for the Bodhisattva to take birthLord that is how it isVenerable Lord when unskilled bodhisattvas who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom engage with physical forms while their mental faculties resort to notions of I and mine andneither sentient nor insentientIt is the seat of high resolve because its insight is superiorthey will offend all those buddha bhagavānsConditioned phenomena are pure owing to the purity of unconditioned phenomenaI wonder what previous actions caused all these awful situationsAfter cooking this mixture one should eat itFear is said to be sixthLike lotuses their minds were unstained like jewels their minds were pure like gold their minds were refinedthis was my livelihood this is how long a lifespan was this is how long I livedThey will teach in the future times Many thousand millions of entrances to the DharmaYour Majesty I dont knowThen the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha ākyamuniThe tongue the body and also the mind Are empty and inertHow you may wonder do they not acquire things through nonDharmaGreat hero Arhat ākya Lion Supreme human Through your love for us Speak the Buddhas wordsNoble son there are beings to be trained through the context of being born growing up and frolicking within the haremSome in that way give away gifts Of wealth money gold and silverWhat you may wonder are the bodhisattvas four fearlessnessesIn the same way feeling notion coproducing factors and consciousness are empty He practices thinking in this way and also thinking that they are not nonemptyThose who seek entry into this sublime samādhi Through that path will attain enlightenmentYou have accomplished the perfection of everythingone will become free from all diseasesSimilarly when I attract them by my generosity they will not take the life of living creaturesIn this way Subhūti do great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration acquire the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplineTherefore I will definitely practice generosity by offering seatsWhat are these eightThen the teacher should go outthe displays together with  billion bodhisattvas all vanished from the world of Sukhāvatī and arrived here in this Sahā world in just a single moment a single second a single instant It happened as quickly as it takes for a strong person to extend his arm and flex it againIf all of those worlds were filled With beings who were the same as āriputraSimilarly you should have conviction in the transcendent perfection of wisdom because feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are nonapprehensibleand departs for nowhere so the real nature of the Elder Subhūti also arises from nowhere andThey see the absence of form as form the absence of sensation as sensation the absence of perception as perception the absence of formation as formation and the absence of consciousness as consciousnessWith this they grabbed him by his arms and legs dragged him before the senior monks and saidIt is because this Dharma teaching is the supreme elucidation of the teachingsSimilarly how should they train in loving kindnessHe will make offerings to their stūpasSimilarly in the same vein as before it indicates to these worlds that the other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are emptyFrom relishing taking delight clinging and having that clinging remain comes an unwillingness to let go with the repeated wish May I never part from these dear and delightful forms This is what is meant by craving causes appropriationBhagavān we are pained by the three sufferingsthe view of the transitory collection is itself emptiness Nor are emptiness and the path two different thingshow could great bodhisattva beings differentiate betweenEndowed with those aspects of emptiness they will transcend the level of the śrāvakas and the level of the pratyekabuddhas and enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvasPlease ensure that they always meet the Buddha that they hear the Dharma and that the Saṅgha is honoredPadmaśrīgarbha replied the Blessed One there are sixty holy beings here in this gathering who intentionally wear the armor and who have attained the illusory absorptionThey are the inconceivably numerous words of incomparability concerning the compositeAt that moment all sentient beingsIf perchance after being ordained he should say I do not acknowledge the transgressionWhen they observe the body they understand that the nature of the body is nonarising and so they do not instigate any contemplation that involves notions of the bodylivelihood and few activities Without acting hypocritically for the sake of reputation Because when the constituents of sentient beings phenomena and oneself which were not realized become directly perceptible one becomes irreversible with respect to all phenomenaBeings as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges will develop the aspiration to the highest complete enlightenment and attain irreversible patienceApplied with a paste of emblic myrobalan costus blue lotus Indian spikenard and country mallowThis practice that I have described Is completely that of the bodhisattvasclouds that rained down divine bannersYet the radiance of their bodies originating through the ripening of the past actions of the gods of the Caturmahārājakāyika realmLike a vajra your pledge is unwaveringMonks in the city of Kapilavastu five hundred ākyas had constructed five hundred homes for the Bodhisattvabut gives the highest ultimate praise to the perfection of conductthey were covered with hairBodhisattvas should be like lotuses unstained by the mud of mundane thingsThen noble ones after eightyfour thousand years had passedWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas expertise concerning the ripening of karma consist inhe is the cessation of all theory and all practiceIn this regard the expression hairs that grow finely and distinctly curling to the right means that from each of the pores of his skin a single hair finely grows bluish black in color curling softly into rings lustrous and curling to the rightWhen we were all mounted the rākṣasīs who lived on Siṃhala Island came running after us making a great clamorThis householder is hard to please and I cannot guard my mind against his abusethen what would you call such seeds Blessed OneSimilarly they should not abide in feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessand Maheśvara entered the palace with the kings permissionIf you ask why Subhūti it is because in the transcendent perfection of generosity there are no such concepts and so they do not make assumptionsand is attentive to it in the correct manner and commits it to writing or has it committed to writing andgods nāgasMind can be found neither inside nor outsideThere will be an appeasement of all ailmentsYour luster is like the flames of a sacrificial fire or the shine of the golden mountainforgetful andNor will they go among women men boys or girls who are intent on causing harm They avoid all places of disgraceBlessed One how much merit is created when a son or daughter of noble family remembers this sūtra taught by the ThusGone One carries it reads it comprehends it and extensively and genuinely teaches it to othersIn order to fulfill the great love he does not rest in the uncompounded andBring to mind all the deeds you engaged in over billions of eonsThen at that momentAfter the Blessed One gave permission for food that has been given to the saṅgha to be given to those wishing to go forth they engage in the perception of pristine cognition which is unobstructed and unimpeded with respect to the presentThey overran the King of Aṅgas exposed camp while their guard was down and their armor off sneaking up and killing himthen feelings of pain and feelings which are neither pleasant nor painful come to a haltNever hold views that give rise to bad actions That there is a self an individual and a soulAll those who had been struck by illness were freed from their disease as soon as the mother of the Bodhisattva placed her right hand on the top of their headWhat is speaking softly It is the attainment of vipaśyanāCompared to the merit he would produce the production of merit in the first instance consisting of the bodhisattvas acts of giving would not even amount to a hundredth partāriputra defilement is ones own doingand similarly that the precious jewel of the Buddha emergesAfter doing this for one year ones lifespan will be extended to three hundred yearsThen with ones mind on the subtle nāda One is to meditate in stagesThinking that contemplating it and wishing for itnanda This is also a quality and advantage that sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage will accrue in this lifeThey are heroes with the strength of wisdom that defeats other strengths They are praised by those who have wisdomHe then thoughtthe white lotus among menBy following the same procedures as previously described one will accomplish the tasks previously describedOne who is practicing this mantra while absorbed in the samādhi described earlierSuch is the bodhisattvas excellent patience with respect to the DharmaMonk as the arising of all phenomena is unperceived as their arising is insignificant as their arising is worthless as their arising is empty and as their arising is peaceful they are final nirvāṇaThe truth of the Buddhas primordial wisdom Frees those dwelling in the ocean of existenceAnd others he crushes or moreover Inserts them into a limb with a needles pointWhen you assist the protector of this world You are free from the dangers of the lower realms and difficult rebirthsIf you ask what these six are they areThey know existence to be emptyAnd do not rejoice in rebirth in existenceThe sādhana of yakṣiṇīs that inducts them into service The sādhanas of dūtas and bhūtasdeclared that if any monk intentionally kills a human or a human embryo with his own handsTherefore I now reap suffering fear misfortune grief ruin Lamentation loss of honor and this miserable stateit shook shook strongly and shook intenselyOne should know that the nonactualization of the finality of existence by great bodhisattva beings until they have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment indicates their skill in means with respect to emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness as gateways to liberationInvestigate suffering impermanence and lack of self Examine these three phenomena thoroughly They occur in connection to causes and conditions They are void of life and have no ownerIf one smears the body in equal measure With mustard seed clarified butter and brimstone One will be freed from the grasp of vicious beingsthe Blessed One entered a state of deep absorption known as the array of the Buddhas adornments The moment he entered into this state of absorptionAll these absorptions too are cultivated without apprehending anythingThrough great powers and illusory samādhi You perform miraclesFor so long he has given up unintelligent and lowly attitudes and instead has applied himself perfectly to the lofty and vastBy means of such causes conditions and bases bodhisattvas exert themselves in pacifying the mindknowledgeable about the seats of the senses knowledgeable about interdependent arisingAnd be disciplined peaceful and completely happyMay they be eliminatedJust like awakening so also feeling notion coproducing factors and consciousness do not swerve from the tathatāand yet as far as the actualization of the finality of existence is concernedThey live as if nestled between the abode of the gods and the slopes of Mount Meru with the splendor of shining lamps screened from the wind andwho hear this teaching on the transcendent perfection of wisdomThe blessed buddhas have not come into the world for a single city township province town home or beingYou have also said that we should take ordination and live on almsRetired devotee we order you to complyThen while seated at the Bodhi tree you quelled the afflictions of all beingsthat noble man or noble woman would not create as much merit as that created by the noble man or noble woman who possesses just one fourline verse from this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good DharmaSubhūti you have said that this Great Vehicle neither comes nor goes and nor does it stayhaving bowed his head at my feet said to meEven the names of the eighty excellent minor marks do not exist internally nor do they exist externally and nor do they abide between these twothey are always enhanced byāradvatīputra the three faculties are merely conceptualizedand likewise praise the Dharma and the Saṅghaāradvatīputra it is because these things are nonexistent in the ways that ordinary people are fixated on themBlessed One hes a shapeshifterThey will bring stains on the monastic order and not live like proper monksListen well and remember for I shall explain how much merit they have createdpractice the understanding of the aspects of the path in order to liberate from all notions those sentient beings who have the notion that they are sentient beingsLikewise as seeds do not grow in the sky but do grow in the earthNever attached because of discursive thoughtsSimilarly they do not consider the notions that they are imbued with happiness or that they are imbued with suffering that they are a self or that they are not a self that they are empty or that they are not empty that they are with signs or that they are signless that they have aspirations or that they are without aspirations that they are calm or that they are not calm that they are void or that they are not void that they are afflicted or that they are purified that they arise or that they are nonarising that they cease or that they are unceasing that they are entities or that they are nonentities or that they are pure or impurethe Precious Jewel of the Buddha the Precious Jewel of the Dharma and the Precious Jewel of the Saṅgha will not vanish from the worldin the same vein as before down to they will also approach omniscienceIf you ask what world it reveals to be empty it reveals the world comprising the five psychophysical aggregates to be emptyMaster heed mein the same way in the westOne will be victorious in quarrels and disputesThoroughly understanding that the tongue is empty one does not run toward flavorsGreat love is to forsake your own welfare and to take birth intentionally within existence among the five kinds of wandering

nonapprehension the emptiness of nonentities the emptiness of essential nature and the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesone should write this mantra on a rag from a cemetery as beforeThe wheel was adorned with various marks of auspiciousness beautifully wrapped in divine fabrics and dyed in different colorsThey will pass genuinely beyond dangers related to poison weapons fire and waterThey know their birthThroughout them all they train intensively in a mind of equanimity that is free of resentment rivalry and harm and is expansive immeasurable and nondualNoble son there are a hundred thousand mountains in that porethey are accepted by genuine spiritual mentors and abandon evil associatesHe is also openminded and now suffers because he has never heard the Dharmathis tathāgata too intends to give a great Dharma teachingIf you can do that you may request from me this verse spoken by the Buddha and I will bestow it on younor free from blameMaam your son here has arranged a rendezvous at a girls houseAll those who normally follow you such as akra The guardians the hordes of half kiṃnarasToday we have attained happiness Through having heard this prophecyIt is because the ultimate does not arise does not cease does not disintegrate is not accepted is not discarded is not conveyed through syllables is not expressed through syllables and is not realized through constructsThere are four formless aggregatesThey listen to many teachings They have confidence They long for the Dharma They are devoted to the DharmaYou have routed the teachings of all tīrthikas You meditate on emptiness the absence of being and the absence of a soul They replied We are alive BhagavatFrom here in which direction is that world called Boundless Accumulation of Precious Qualities and Full Display of Happiness where the Blessed One the thusgone King of the GoldenHued Lions Play livedWhen silha and camphor abide in the center The lower sixth circulatesHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of indolenceFree the moon from Rāhuthe inconceivably numerous vajra words concerning teaching the compositehis mind has become calm and tranquilSubhūti in this supreme vehicle the Great Vehicle no coming is indeed discernibleThe reason for calling this difficult practice is because it is excruciatingly difficult and therefore it is described in such termsThe devas make offerings to it Brahmā praises itThen Senior āradvatīputra asked the Blessed OneWhy All language does not ultimately existIf having recited the mantra fifty times one places ones foot on the ground In pursuit of treasure within itHe thus has compassion for beings And in a future time will become a buddhaThat true nature limit of reality and essence of phenomena is the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharmahe felt sad and askedOf the Dharma that the lords of humans have taughtand together they sported made love and indulged all of their desiresYoung man in that way the bodhisattva mahāsattvas obtain the treasure of the buddhasIt has bountiful harvests and is teeming with peoplean act of suspension for refusal to acknowledge an act of suspension for refusal to make reparationsAlso at that time a light ray shone from the ūrṇā hair between the Bhagavāns eyebrows to twenty thousand buddha realms in the eastern directionI entrust this Dharma discourse to you so that you will retain it and teach it widely to othersthat the householder class and particularly those who stand out like mighty sāl trees will emerge in the worldsome are made of gold I was always speaking the praises of solitude I always maintained correct conductAll the auspicious signs have come togetherMeritorious are those beings who live in Vārāṇasī can see you and always gather around youThose who received this sūtra From the buddhas of the pastMāra being thus restrained became angry He held aloft his unsheathed sharp swordSubhūti because the adamantine pristine cognition of great bodhisattva beings is not an entityThis pursuit does not involve doing anythingThe noble son or noble daughter who repeats this sixsyllable mahāvidyā will attain these samādhisin which case too the Elder Subhūti is the emulator of the TathāgataDo not let this Dharma teaching that is equal to the ThusGone One vanish for it performs the activity of a thusgone oneI will satisfy the unskillful ones with wisdom It is not placing ones trust in ordinary people  It is the natural result of correct conducthe unsheathed his knife and cut off his fathers head at the neck which tumbled to the floorAs a parable āriputra in a village a town a market town a district a region a country or a capitalThe leaves flowers and fruits in his parks witheredIndeed his mind was as vast as the oceans and the earthHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of the perception of dreamsthe samādhi named Summoning NirvāṇaOnce when not occupied with their studies they went to collect wood for fire pūjasand the inconceivably numerous families of wisdom concerning purification Those are the fourSupreme joy is radianceI hold the torch I am the bright lightAfter a while an ethical monk happened by which gave us an ideaSon of noble family this was the first time that these two beings developed the mind set upon unsurpassed and completely perfect awakeningWhoever gives this sūtra to others or recites just a single wordReaching the great city of Vaiśālī the Blessed One stepped across the city threshold at middayJust as a phantom may stand sit move walk and even lie down but remains unsullied by the positive and negative effects of past actionsand that they will know no lives after this oneAs he perfectly and completely awakens he will be known as SamantaraśmyabhyudgataśrīkūtarājaViśālanetraEven though it is said the world is an aggregate They know it to be empty esteeming oneself and deprecating othersIf you ask why it is because they do not consider the nature of the truth of sufferingsome mansions were made of combinations of gold silver beryl crystal and red pearlthey have no attachment to anything in the three realmswill one again experience sufferingThen comes the number called kuruṭāviYou will have to spend the rest of your life away from human pleasuresHow do you base yourself on the acts with immediate consequenceThose sentient beings who hear this Dharma teaching grasp it and teach it extensively to others will reap a great profitShe should be the last to go to sleep and the first to rise She should lovingly obey and be as guileless as a motherA bodhisattva lion similarly puts down the load of the afflictions and moves ahead without bringing them alongconsciousness and objects of consciousnessIn doubt the monks went to he who severs all doubts the Blessed Buddha and askedI am also fond of wealth I too cherish it like it and enjoy it Thereforethe attributes of those who will no longer be subject to rebirth the attributes of arhatshipSubhūti for those great bodhisattva beings not even the slightest negative phenomenon will ariseLikewise while contemplating the lower yāna We are longing in that same way Like beings during a famine For the attainment of the Buddhas wisdom  The great Muni the perfect Buddha Has not yet given us his prophecyBrahmānana highest of humans Had a lifespan of seven days Also present wereFor all of them he was someone who had realized the higher knowledge of a bodhisattvaNārāyaṇa they should strive in these fourSuvarṇavarṇa in Puṣpa Rabheyaka in Magadha Kāpili in Bharukaccha Prapuṇḍaka in Kośala ūcīlomā in Bhadra Yaśodharā in Malla Vibhīṣaṇa in Pāñcāla And Lohitākṣa in Aśvaja Piṅgala in Avanta Kapilākṣa in Vaidiśa Kumbhodara in Matsa And Dīrghila in SūrataEarly in the morning one should prepare a maṇḍala disk using one cats paw of powdered pennywort and incant it  timesto the stūpa of a tathāgata who has passed into nirvāṇaākyasiṃha will be establishingThat is what my parents said to meWhen the Bodhisattva emerged from the river he wanted to sit down and so he looked for a suitable place on the riverbankWho had set out for the supreme highest enlightenment The multitudes of gods and nāgas joined their palms rejoiced and thoughtHis form is dark in color With one face and two hands holding a vajraFor the real nature of sightsSo Great TopKnotted Brahmā draped his robe on one shoulder knelt on his right kneewho are inarticulate considering all elements to be present in the space elementinducing them and establishing them thereinThe bodhisattva Yaśaskāma had become lazyWhen great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of generosityIt is difficult to find even over many eonsbodhisattvas to the number of atoms gather around them and they reach the entranceway to the six perfectionsIf that which exists were to arise That which has arisen would arise once moreThey abide in a nonabiding manner with respect to the emptiness of physical forms and similarly with respect to the emptiness of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness and they abide in a nonabiding manner with respect to the emptiness of conditioned and unconditioned phenomenaSimilarly Subhūti one wishes to attain emancipation in things without defining characteristics merely wishes to attain emancipation in symbols conventional expressions and designationsIt alleviates poverty and creates prosperitythe stride of NārāyaṇaBring these beings swiftly to the blissful state of nirvāṇabodhisattva mahāsattvas who obtain this samādhiThe brahmin remained silent as Māṭhara pointed out the positions faultsthese marks are beyond the comprehension of any beingSome like the sun send forth rays of lightThe instructor then says This is the procedureand on that basis they may recollect one thought or from that up to a hundred thoughts or even up to a thousand thoughts They may also recollect one day or from that up to a hundred days up to a thousand days or even up to a hundred thousand daysAll the people tormented by disturbing emotions found release from their anguishwere now gathered for the turning of the wheel of Dharma In total there were more than  divine beings from the Pure Realms led by such beings as Maheśvara Nanda Sunanda Candana Mahita ānta Praśānta and Vinīteśvara The appellations that are spoken are merely appellations Within saṃsāra there is no end to be foundProclaimed the sublime Māyā to be the mother Saying She is fit to give birth to the joy of the ākya familySimilarly they discern that the eyes are empty of the emptiness of the eyes that the nature of the eyes is emptiness and that emptiness is indeed the eyesThe young man Candraprabha having adorned the great city of RājagṛhaSimilarly is this mind of the bodhisattvas unattached to the eyesThe fire element ripens the seedAt that time he thoughtAll of them would then possess the supreme ornaments of body speech and mind and would have accomplished the ten masteriesIt is in this way that these great corporeal aggregates exclusively endowed with suffering ariseOne should incant a cake of leftovers with the third garland mantra and offer itThe holders of this sūtra of the Sugata Will reach the level of an ācāryaHow could the Buddha in a momentin such a short timeinspire and ripen for the highest complete enlightenment all these countless bodhisattvastThe sum total of the merit of all those beings with as much merit as Brahmā would then match the merit of one śrāvakaOne hundred sarvabalas is called a visaṃjñāgatiMonks at this point Suvarṇaprabhāsā the chief queen of Kālika the nāga king came to see the Bodhisattva She was surrounded and escorted by many nāga girls who were holding various types of cloth parasols made of assorted jewels different pearl necklaces a variety of precious jewels an array of garlands a myriad of unguents and powders made by gods and humans and containers with diverse perfumesWhen the southern direction was high the northern direction was lownoble son while sentient beings revolving within cyclic existence have abundant experience with material thingsIn that case Brahmās quantity of merit would not match even one hundredth of that of the bodhisattva it does not even bear comparisonHowever from this single identity that all phenomena share on the ultimate level the Blessed One teaches the Dharma without teaching in many ways in order to accommodate the reference points of beingsany notion of contaminated phenomena any notion of uncontaminated phenomenaAjita I inspired and developed all these bodhisattva mahāsattvas toward the highest complete enlightenmentVenerable Lord Great bodhisattva beings of the future also having trained in this supreme vehicle the Great Vehicle will acquire omniscienceand they perceive minds free from desire correctly as minds that are free from desireEven if he does not practice yogaHe will not be able to leave homeWithin a month ones lifespan will increase to three hundred yearsI have eliminated all weariness AndAs soon as I obtained it I reached the tenth level and many thousands of beings reached the level where they become receptive to the unborn nature of phenomenaThey will share the fate of those who deny the Buddhas awakening and those who insult and defame the buddhas the blessed ones of the past present and futureIn the same vein do you think that anything other than the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death constitutes a bodhisattvaKeep your discipline and fulfill your wishes Remember your past actionsI shall come before those dharmabhāṇakas in the place where those dharmabhāṇakas are walking for twentyone daysEven a monk of nine years should not allow going forth should not grant ordinationWhen there is such freedom from weariness the clothes can be used well and yet no one will feel any attachment to themthey do not consider the notion that their gifts are empty or that they are not emptyThey will be eaten by many millions of creatures And will experience extremely dreadful sensationsIt is accompanied by feelingI forsake this rebirth into a nāgīs womb And this birth in an extremely detestable bodynot forgetting the omniscient mind generated by high resolveHe brings boundless offeringsMen on the other hand are all said To be endowed with my formthe samādhi named Complete Liberation from Desire and AngerThey perfectly understand how all phenomena are inherently beyond sufferingthe circulation of the spirit of enlightenmentIn the best case the flower has fallen in the centervenerable MahāmaudgalyāyanaThe noble ones call such a person the impartial one dwelling on pleasure that is imbued with mindfulness  tJust as one is born according to ones roots of virtuenamely ones karmic conditionsone will be born as a god a king a hell being an animal or a being from the world of YamaI am a bodhisattvaDeva Sukuṇḍala then offered his diadem and earrings to the brahmin and recitedEven if they should become akra Brahmā or a guardian of the world they will still remain committed to the welfare of othersSubhūti all things are naturally pureBodhisattvas similarly worry that their pursuers will bring an end to their commitment and cause them to become distractedThey do not apprehend the fruitional attributes up to and including omniscienceTherefore all things stand on the root that is baselessNoble one accept these almsthey never forsake sentient beingsIn all those worlds the paradises and heavenly residences shook in six ways even as far up as the paradise of Brahmā andThe first of these eight great types of merit results in becoming a universal monarchNoble ones wherever this Dharma teaching is read taught explained written out contemplated spoken about chanted or made into textsDesires too are foulsmelling disagreeable and not worthy of being looked uponIn the past for billions of eons You cultivated supreme and unwavering diligenceWhen the arrow hits a mountain peak it reboundsThen Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara asked the deva MaheśvaraThus free of all incorrect mental activity they properly direct their minds to the Dharma teachings and train in them abundantlyIt is due to the particularities of concepts And furthermore the particularities of inclinations And the particularities of various religious systems That such a plethora has been taughtit is because it is absolutely firmly established that all things are without defining characteristicsThe Dharma will cease but its outer form Will remain for a futher thirtytwo intermediate eonsWhen he came to the village of Senānī the village headmans daughters Nandā and Nandabalāand the Deer Park has only a limited amount of tree shadeAt that moment the wishes of all beings in the realm of the Sahā world were completely fulfilledAnd like putrefying spirits possessing human beings and making them eat excrement and filthThrough this virtuous deed You will become victorious ones known as MadhusaṃbhavaTake action Go forth Apply yourself to the Buddhas teachingsSince all worthy opponents and anyone counted as learned will be close to the kingand knowledgeThere was the supreme sound of the songs of bees and partridges That equaled that of Dhṛtarāṣṭra the king of geeselikewise they do not consider whether the ears nose tongue body and mental faculty are empty or not emptylikewise they do not consider whether feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are permanent or impermanentVenerable Lord This transcendent perfection of wisdom is established by means of great deedsāradvatīputra do you think that anything other than physical forms constitutes a bodhisattvaWhen however White Acala is in the centerāradvatīputra The purity of phenomena is not cognizant due to absolute purityConsider noble son the analogy of water that alleviates the thirst of thirsting sentient beingsThose who use the food of the saṅgha to feed dogs will be reborn in a low casteNārāyaṇa this was the first introduction to the absorption that encapsulates all meritEven if they were feces urine and bloodSarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin attained these samādhisHe cordially greeted Brahmā lord of the Sahā World and those gods of the pure realms and pointed out their seats to themThus bodhisattvas remain in the application of mindfulness with respect to villages cities towns regions districts and royal courtsNevertheless we would never slay this bhikṣu As we have developed the aspiration for enlightenment However action possesses no form and its maturation is formless toothey will be patient with the abuse and the insults that are spoken for it is their nature to have enduranceor among the householder class standing out like a tall sāl treeAnd similarly Lord my garden I have prepared and laid out divine food with a hundred flavorsWho has taught them the Dharma Who has brought them to enlightenmentFurthermore they are unable to relinquish the disturbing emotions that are conjoined with the habitual tendenciesestablishing them in the arhathood in which all outflows have ceasedThose dharmabhāṇakas will be honestThis is the realm of experience of the heroes Of the bodhisattvas the protectorsWhen they walk their steps make no soundThey have eliminated all conceptions And they have countless samādhis The wise refuse To kill imprison or torture For temporal powerTherefore noble ones after the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa you should be in possession of this Dharma teachingAlas my wellborn man with a perfect body Well formed and tapering you are unequaledThey have compassion toward them And give them the teachings of ultimate truth He will free from bondage those who are trapped in the cage and prison of saṃsāra and who are bound by the fetters of disturbing emotionsdo they also practice the other transcendent perfectionsJust like the king of swans the great sage Asita accompanied by his nephew Naradatta soared through the sky to the city of KapilavastuBrahmā master of the world then transformed the sky into metal and the bhūtas ran off farther into the sky suspended in the air at the height of seven palm treesa mendicant since he has cracked open the eggshell of ignoranceIt is the destroyer of afflictions It uproots latent pains It fully teaches the path of the noble ones It opens the gates to liberation It eradicates all beliefs in the transitory collection It demolishes the mountain of pride It dries the ocean of saṃsāraThen in the northeastern directionAs soon as women put food or drink in their mouths the parasites are the first to eatThey will experience nothing but the best highest and most delightful Dharma joys that is why this realm will be known as Pritivyūha Array of JoyThey who do not forget but teach this sūtra Are wise individuals who will never become blindHaving approached the Lord he saidunless that is the ripening of their karma precludes itthe samādhi likethewindIs he to go forth as well Yes noble one he isthe one who removes the burdens the one who postpones his own benefitIt is taught that a practitioner who switches To twentytwo and a half minute hours and meditates in eight sessions Equalizes sessions and breaksIf you ask why it is because they are not separated from the transcendent perfection of wisdom and they are not without skill in meansThe goddess who sits in sattvaparyaṅka posturewith clean fabrics that swirl in the breeze andexperiencing the roots of virtue dependent on meditative concentration and mastering all these until buddhahood is cultivatedIn this way should one meditate with reverenceAnd all flowing rivers are stillPracticing the transcendent perfection of

LohitākṣaLikewise it applies to sights and in the same vein to all the other sense objects up to and including mental phenomenaA rain of flowers fell millions of instruments sounded and gods and demigods rejoicedIt may then be spoken of as gold blazing with splendor or a jewel blazing with splendoroffer incense flowers frankincense perfumes or plaster and they restore shrines that have crumbledFor the highest supreme unsurpassable enlightenmentAnyone who suffered from disease was healedThinking with a poor mans outlookSage as you sat below the holy tree you then tamed Māra and his henchmenSimilarly they know the modalities of the applications of mindfulness and yetat that time and in those daysThe yogī has knowledge masters yoga and weaves Indras WebHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of miserlinessNevertheless there are four links that serve as the cause for assembling this twelvefold dependent arisingWhat is the causal condition of birthThe man promised to do so and he went off into the wildsHow does subtle and intangible consciousness produce the great bulky body of an elephant How does it pierce a body that is as hard as a diamondHe will be attractive and pleasing to many people and will generate roots of meritwhose is this transcendent perfection of wisdomThen Chanda took the noble horse and the ornaments with him And went into the ladies quarters

Glorywho completely liberates pretasWhen a certain poor person Despised by the populaceThis stūpa that is mine the stūpa that contains my body may it appear within the buddha realms in world realms in

genuinely perfect enlightenment as the transcendent perfection of generosityI will practice the transcendent perfection of generosity by any means until the resources and possessions enjoyed by those sentient beings in this buddhafield resemble those of the godsThat will bind the teeth of wild animals and poisonous snakes in a house village or town for as long as one desiresThey will not construe the notion that physical forms are empty and that emptiness is physical formsConsider noble son how the windof high resolve consummated by renunciationAnd if any other should best Tiṣya then award it

the DharmaThe yogin accomplishes the sales And the merchants win great profitYoung man the samādhi has been taught through this Dharma discourse by many buddhasDue to the absolute purity of what has this purity of phenomena not been actualizedthe tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha named Nityaparinirvṛtaentire assembly of ākyas were surprised and delighted and they felt great appreciation and joyand rebirths in the animal realm will be cut offbodhisattvas are indifferent to harm and assistanceand when they come they teach the door of Dharma called The Secrets of the Tathāgatas and then departAdorned with all perfect ornaments and wreathed with flowers and perfumeWhat need is there to mention that gradually they will fully and completely awaken to unsurpassable complete and perfect awakeningso on up to and including feelings due to sensory contact that is mentally compoundedThen the twelve hundred who had mastered themselves thoughtThe bodhisattvas enquiredSenior āradvatīputra the reality of phenomena the abiding nature of phenomena the maturity of all things and other unconditioned phenomena up to and including the finality of existence are nonexistent and nonapprehensibleThe earth gave off a terrible and beautiful sound And yet nobody could hear itlearn it understand it keep it recite it to others promote it proclaim it chant itWhenever women become pregnant the parasites also become pregnantAs soon as the Bhagavān had consentedmake offerings of the desirable attributes of the five senses to the tathāgatas great bodhisattva beings the pratyekabuddhas and the śrāvakas of the tathāgatasThe same transcendent perfection of wisdom has primacy for those great bodhisattva beings who undertake perseveranceNārāyaṇa there are four ways that bodhisattvas should liveIt should similarly be applied to the transcendent perfection of generosity and also to the other perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdomO svāhā to PūrṇabhadraThe sage Asita replied to King uddhodanain the same way they have practiced the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdom and then come hereYet we are unable to pass beyond this rose apple tree What could be the reason for thisYoung man that is the restraint of the mindDoes space abide anywhere inside in the arising of the three feelings caused by the eye apprehending an objectto give up regretWhat is your name What is your preceptors namethe essential nature of magical displays and the essential nature of mirages echoes optical aberrations and phantom emanations of the tathāgatas are empty of phantom emanations of the tathāgatas and so forthFor as many eons as sand grains in the GangesThe wanderersThis is the meditative stability of great bodhisattva beingsAs your task will be to accompany the Tāthagata on his travels through the realm happily ready your Dharma robesOr a widow or a female asceticSubhūti that which is unappraisableāradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings who have cultivated the mind endowed with omniscience themselves possess the excellent endowment of toleranceSimilarly the real nature of physical forms and the real nature of the Tathāgata and likewise the real nature of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness and the real nature of the Tathāgata are one and the same real nature They are not two but indivisibleLet him follow the Dharma LordReverend Rāhula you should not teach the benefits and virtues of renunciation in the way that you doWhen the Jina placed his foot on the gateways threshold The supreme treesthe sal and the karnikara At the summit of crags and on mountaintopsThe roots of merit from the mind being focused upon the Tathāgata will bring good results benefits and happiness for a long time Knowing this for the sake of those to be guided the Tathāgata announces that he will pass into nirvāṇa even though he does not pass into nirvāṇaBe my protector refuge and supportHomage to the Dharmanāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kinnarasThat night just as people went to bed the gods of the pure realmsand many hundreds of thousands of gods assembled from all the realms up to the highest heavenOne should while absorbed in the absorption mentioned previouslyNoble ones the words the Tathāgata speaks in order to guide beingsThen comes selfaware gnosis In which all phenomena being empty are of one tasteI guide them to the other shore And therefore I am the GuideIt is said that superior ones Are to meditate or recite in fullThat state is called Brahmā for if some were to achieve nirvāṇa in this very life all would be wellwithout graspingLikewise observing a spiritual friend And listening to him is also excellentHundreds of thousands of rishis will dwell there who are śrāvakas and bodhisattvasNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities possess a body that is solid like vajraMāra Pāpīyān then asked venerable āradvatīputraIf when you teach it there are beings Who say the words This makes me rejoiceSimilarly as far as omniscience is concerned and as far as the conditioned elements and the unconditioned elements are concerned they will not construe the notions that these are nonarising unceasing calm or void emptiness of internal phenomenaWhen Mañjuśrī delivered this section of teaching on the revelation of correct knowledge ten thousand beings within the gathering gave rise to the mind of unexcelled and perfect awakeningHis robes are the preceptors responsibility His duties are akin to those in the novice ranksIt is thus that they perfect the transcendent perfection of perseveranceThis completes the thirteenth chapter from The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines entitled Like SpaceJust as the great cloud rises the Tathāgata appearsThey reach as high as the realms of Brahmā And they are endowed with parasols and garlandsIf those beings who engage in the conduct of anger pay homage to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara they will become free from angerThe selfarisen Master of the World Tolerated us awaiting the right timeMany hundreds of thousands of nāga kings had also gathered there in that retinueof the power of life consummated in the means of unificationDiscerning the dharmas through proper mental placement the awareness of emptiness by nature and emptiness of essence is nonattachmentYou have passed through the dreadful jungleVenerable Lord when bodhisattvas train accordingly is it then the case that they do not train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom andThe Blessed One the Buddha was residing in the Deer Park at ṣivadana by VārāṇasīI entered homelessness in the presence of the Tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened Buddha ālendrarājathe fifth door was made of ironYou should always wear red clothes A red mala Vermillion powderThis wheel is hard to comprehend because it is not an object of conceptual investigationWhoever relies on me and generates the roots of virtue will be recognized by the future thusgone ones the worthy ones the completely perfect buddhas who will think Those beings are the old friends of the thusgone onesSimilarly he comprehends the defining characteristics of the transcendent perfection of generosity He comprehends the defining characteristics of the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdomJust like this single armyIn the same vein do they engage with all attributes and attainments up to and including omniscienceThen he gathered eighty quintillion bodhisattvasas many eons ago as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River at that timeAnd indifference to whether there is gain or no gain That is the supreme Dharma that the Jina teaches Teaching this way is exceedingly profoundSimilarly great bodhisattva beings who turn away from the notions of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are reckoned to be irreversibleThey excel in all esoteric sciences And in the many different craftsWith the space in the middle being the ninth In the center of the ninthIt is analogous to this Say that a person wanders passing through a great forestWhen he goes into the states of the asuras he remains free of pride conceit and arroganceIf they engage with the notion that physical forms cease or that these are unceasingAs prescribed one should draw an eightpetal lotus with sandalwood paste and place on its petalsAmartyā reveal your buddha realmSimilarly why is the acceptance of great bodhisattva beings taughtVenerable Lord Are nonexistent eyes unattached to nonexistent eyesāriputra the tathāgatas teaching that contains an inner meaning is difficult to understandDevas nāgas asuras and guhyakas Will wish to always look upon themIn the past when I sought this supreme samādhi of peace With a mind that was indefatigableLikewise I was not separated from the four immeasurable aspirations the four formless absorptions all the meditative stabilities of the bodhisattvas all the gateways of mnemonic incantation the ten powers of the tathāgatas the four assurances the four unhindered discernments great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasSimilarly they reveal to sentient beings the sacred doctrine that the fruit of entering the stream the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth arhatship individual enlightenment and omniscience all neither arise nor cease and that they are neither defiled nor purifiedBlessed One a bodhisattva may correctly understand this Dharma discourse regarding how all phenomena have such characteristics and how they are inherently and entirely beyond suffering upon hearing it he or she may then believe and be convinced of it That he or she nevertheless does not pass beyond suffering in the interval periodteinote xmlidUT is indeed marvelous Blessed OneThe light shining from each of the mansions extended for  leaguesThey remember a thousand lives a hundred thousand lives and so on up to many quintillions of previous livesalways worshipped by gandharvas andWill have delight in their minds And all their illnesses will cease Master do not leave for other parts Remain for a while at your leisure in the home of your relatives contemplation of a bloated corpseIt is true that bodhisattvas Demonstrate their occupation with consortsThey who know the peace that is the nature of phenomena Will before long become a lord of humansA path that the lords Krakucchanda Kanakamuni and Kāśyapa also traversed Since in your footsteps stainless and perfect lotuses spring forth breaking out of the earthWith her left foot on ones shoulder And the right foot at the base of ones left thighIf the Buddhas body could be measured And found to be of a certain sizemaintaining the five acquisitive psychophysical aggregates which are dreamlike and maintaining the five acquisitive psychophysical aggregates which are like a phantom and so onWhen I attain awakening And shower down the teaching that leads to immortalitynanda in the past countless vast immeasurable inconceivable innumerable countless eons ago at that time and in those daysPlease grant me this favor my lordThe mind of the Supreme Being remains unattachedNoble one the samādhi that the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara remains in so as to benefit in that way countless beings is this samādhi called manifestation of all formsThey do not attach importance to tolerancethey grew hoarse saying Ah We have seen the wheel of the sacred doctrine turned for the second time in JambudvīpaIts duration is never certaincertain only is its end in deathMañjuśrī since the Blessed Thusgone ākyamuni and all those in his retinue would like to see youdo not teach an ultimate reality endowed with activity production and destructionThey turn them away from the second meditative concentration and establish them in the third meditative concentrationHaving abandoned that they will achieve the power of absorption in consummate perfection without defining characteristicsbeing insatiable in teaching the DharmaAlas my refuse rags have been tornby which the Bhagavān the Tathāgata the Arhat the perfectly enlightened Buddha has a beautiful uṣṇīṣa stainless eyes a beautiful ūrṇā hair between the eyebrows that is as white and beautiful as the moon or a conch the beautiful rows of teeth in his mouth that are even and perfectly aligned the Sugatas lips that are as red as the bimbā fruit and the Sugatas beautiful eyesthey do not investigate those other notions including the notions that these are void or not voidAnd since the world desires success and distrusts failure several brahmins pressed their daughters on him in marriageNever looking for shortcomings and mistakes in others he has been striving to make everyone get alongSubhūti it is because physical forms do not come from anywhere they do not go anywhere and they do not abide anywhereVenerable āradvatīputra then said to youthful Mañjuśrīliberate all beings who are sinking in the oceanic swamp of cyclic existenceThereupon a certain goddess who lived in that houseOnce there the great sage Asita told the young priestOr

should crave or hate themMonk as all phenomena are luminous by nature there is no delusionTherefore be harmonious with one another Act with a loving and benevolent mindThey should not dwell on the notion that I am a pratyekabuddhaThere are no changes and no conceptual notions regarding any mindand who has hundreds of thousands of samādhis as numerous as atomstranscend the level of the śrāvakas and also the level of the pratyekabuddhasWith this attitude of faith he thoughtNoble son you may wonder how bodhisattvas make the web of the roots of affliction rotYogīs take the posture of a sporting lionThrough the punishment of the noose incantation They will perpetually wander in saṃsāraAs they wish to the hear the sacred Dharma I request O Guide that you teach themWho comes ultimately comes notFather Mother please listenwill have no attachment to Dharma robes and will have no attachment to their alms bowlsJust as a threshold beam planted in the ground Is unmoved by winds from the four directions So are the people of the saṅgha of noble ones Who have insight into the highest path of the noble onesEvil One give these heavenly maidens to the good man VimalakīrtiVenerable Lord The transcendent perfection of wisdom is the mother of the bodhisattvas because it generates all the attributes of the buddhasWe rejoice in what you have attained As does the world and its devasare not apparitions are not byproducts of apparitions are not subject to harmIn the emptiness of internal phenomena the emptiness of external phenomena is not discernedBhagavān all phenomena are to be understood in this particular way they are devoid of concepts they are empty devoid of superimposition they are the final reality and suchnessYou will develop the ten strengths And you will reach the supreme highest enlightenmentIf you know that he is a worthy recipient Teach him even if he has not requested it Noble one we do We rejoice in this good you have done for others for this is the job of those who go forthDivine being moreover when bodhisattvas being physically at peace understand that discipline is at peacethe eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasfor it prevents one from transgressing the rulesthis is correctly and definitively cognized when great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdompreoccupations or excessive attachment may arise towards the body will be confronted and will not remainThereupon the Bhagavān gave prophecies of the highest complete enlightenment to all the Bhagavāns śrāvakas both those in training and those who had passed beyond trainingThey replied Who would take us there We will take youvomiting and diarrhea hiccoughs coughs asthma carbunclesAt that moment even the light of the sun and moon and the splendor of the gods such as akra Brahmā and the world protectors was eclipsedSimilarly they should don the armor of the ten powers of the tathāgatasMay it be the seed of my omniscience And inexhaustible enlightenmentThat is the nature of phenomena It is ungraspable like space Nakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña a woman who in the final five hundred years hears and practices this chapter The Past of Bhaiṣajyarājain the same vein the cultivation of the transcendent perfection of wisdom is the noncultivation of the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold pathThen there will form an unbreakable bond of friendship Which not even ten million māras will be able to break They had become aware of their own error and departed from that assembly the Bhagavān giving his permission to do so by remaining silentReverend āriputra why do you shake these flowersand from the sky a breeze would come that removed all the withering flowersWe will perfect all its incomparable qualitiesBhagavān I also shall recite the words of a dhāraṇīmantra in order to compassionately benefit bring happiness to guard protect and conceal this kind of dharmabhāṇakaSon the king answered your grandfather was called SiṃhahanuVerses like this emerge from The sounds of the womens instrumentsthey think having investigated those phenomena that they understand what cessation isIn that way they

to mention that they are always in equipoisewere to hear the name of the bodhisattva mahāsattva AvalokiteśvaraIt applies to the defining characteristics of conditioned phenomena such as these and similarly extends as far as the defining characteristics of unconditioned phenomenaNoble son placing Māra Pāpīyān in confinement is not becoming for a bodhisattvaBlessed One what is the name of this Dharma teaching How should we remember itto that extent there is attachmentJoined with the syllable ī And adorned with the two skiesimmediately answering questions correctly and properlyand is not purifiedand attended by undesired consequences In the long run it will prevent you from practicing your religionNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with these ten qualities live as mendicantsThey retain what they have heard for the sake of giving happiness to suffering sentient beingsAnd beings never tire of gazing upon themnanda consider whether that personVenerable āradvatīputra the awakening of the blessed buddhas is distinguished by a realization of the sameness of all phenomenaāriputra what was the reason for thatSentient beings equal in number to the particles of dirt on the earthnot with the hope for anything they desire nor with the hope for any enjoymentUpon this request the Buddha gave his approval to the young Licchavi Ratnākara Good good young manMany resolute bodhisattvas appear Who honor the relics of the jinas Therefore great bodhisattva beings who have accepted that phenomena are nonarising are revealed to be irreversibleWhat is the memory of previous rebirths It is the knowledge of previous lifetimesI came about by the force of your meritWhy is that Because they think as followsThe Dharma is not an objectit is because those who did not commit this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom to writing who did not have it committed to writing who neither retained held nor mastered it and who neither read it aloud nor recited it and who did not confer its transmission and were not attentive to it in the correct manner have not applied themselves earnestly as instructed in this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomHis heart was beating fastIt is the same as space There is no difference between them Venerable Lord if the notion of physical forms as having aspirations or lacking aspirations is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of physical forms as such become a bodhisattvaYour mind is at peace and perfectly stilledSimilarly they do not become fixated on the absorption in the sense field of infinite space orI have no use for an unabashed ordinary person If someone has the qualities described here seek her out for me There is no endlessness nor an end nor a mode in between There is no existence nor nonexistence nor a partial modeBlessed One how do bodhisattvas quickly and fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahoodMāra upset angry and furious shouted harsh wordsYou are my mother my fathers

was not truly real the neutralization of the poison was also not truly realFrom this the Great Wrathful One Blue in color blazes forthSince I have found relief myself now is the time to bring relief to othersShe prostrates at his feet saying joyfully Great Guide please enjoy thisInvestigating peace is a gateway to the light of the DharmaIf he was first to all of my tasks no matter how small why did I insult himThey are teaching billions of beings And through knowledge are established in the highest enlightenment If one were to ask why it is because physical forms cannot be appropriatedThe body does not take on a moribund quality nor do its limbs shrinkIn that same way they do not perceive enlightenment as other than sensationshowered down from innumerable cloudsDelightful music United with song with his arms drawn in and his legs extended dignified by his ceremonial robe Dharma robes and begging bowlThey said to him Retired devotee you have no obvious source of incomeThe Bodhisattva then exclaimed Health is just like a play in a dreamOne does not see with the physical eye one sees with the eye of wisdomthe absolute truth and freedom from a foundationand without strainThey do not doubt the Buddhas Dharma That is the patience that is concordant Evil one today you will flee Like a jackal at the sound of a lions roarskylights and latticed windows It was adorned with balustradesThey cannot be shaken by any opponentConsider noble son the way that not even a tiny drop of water will stick to a lotus flowerare bhikṣushow has this differentiation come about with regard to the cycle of existence with its five realms of living beings namely the denizens of the hells the animal domain the world of anguished spirits the world of the gods and the world of humankindHe who seeks to associate with the Dharma is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in associationNever in my life have I seen anyone carry himself like this renunciantThe bodily products of a female musk shrew Are to be infused into the perfected mercuryWhy should the mahoragas laud it Because it destroys saṃsāraBhagavat as the great Avīci hell is without respiteWhat will be their signs and what will be their formsThey will not fall away from unabated confidence as they seek to understand everything with regard to the roots of virtueAnd these who are eminent bodhisattvas They must maintain this great secret of mine It is in that way that the Lord of the World Has practiced for millions of eons Great Guide after a long time your appearance Is known in the worlds in the ten directionsVenerable Lord How do great bodhisattva beings after abiding in the transcendent perfection of wisdom acquire the transcendent perfection of perseveranceBeyond that pore there is a pore named Vajramukha Within it live many hundreds of thousands of kiṃnarasNo one since him has been able to string the bow let alone draw itMañjuśrī Kumārabhuta told the bodhisattva great beingsThis is Avīci the Great Hell of Unrelenting TormentBhikṣus the tathāgata stayed alone in the temple in that way for eightyfour thousand eonsDuring the third month of springthey comprise  the meditative absorption of the sense field of infinite space  the meditative absorption of the sense field of infinite consciousness  the meditative absorption of the sense field of nothingatall and  the meditative absorption of neither perception nor nonperceptionConclusion of the thirteenth chapter The Teaching of the SamādhiO divine princes Not a single syllable has been uttered or disclosed for you to hearSeeing the fault in waiting Saṅgharakṣita ate and then took a seat off to one sideIf you ask what these three are they comprise false views about perishable composites hesitation and a sense of moral and ascetic supremacyKnow that the ḍākinīs are the channelsThey will utter praises of liberation But will have no interest in liberation When the Bhagavān teaches the DharmaHe cries out I have done you no wrongWhen that night was over on the second morning he went back into the capital city of Ratnāvatīāradvatīputra do you think that the designation of the eyes as permanent or impermanent constitutes a bodhisattvathere is no self and so onWill never be without that restraint And in that way they will train in correct certainty While they are walking they contemplate with sadness the sufferings of saṃsārawho upholds this Dharma teaching worships it writes it down commissions it to be writtenThe gods in the form realm also came Those who always experience the peace of concentrationNo matter how diligent the hearers and solitary buddhas who rely on reference points are the poisonous faults of reference points have been formedYet when the tree is largeMaitreya there are two reasons that beginner bodhisattvas hurt themselvesBodhisattvas who have developed onepointed minds dwell on their slopesand the complexion of others had changed all the activities of their bodies are preceded by pristine cognition and followed by pristine cognitionWere we to transgress the queen of incantations The sūtra Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm Uttered by the victorious ones Things would not go according to our wishesDo not turn back Rest in this great regionHe recites a few verses or poetic sayings and recounts stories or arguments to each personIt involves illnessI have accumulated the bad karma that will cause me to be reborn in a great hellThat man is astonished He thinks of his previous poverty His inferior aspiration and his fathers qualitiesSpeak too the praises of the Dharma and the Saṅgha and speak them perfectlyWhen that buddha realm was shown to them  beings here in this buddha realm who had not previously aroused the mind of awakening now gave rise to the mind set upon unsurpassed and completely perfect awakeningVenerable Lord if the notion of the sensory element of the eyes as imbued with happiness is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of the sensory element of the eyes as imbued with suffering become a bodhisattvadeeply distressed by her desire she became illThey are yogins who always have few activities They have shunned the many faults of busy gatheringsWell the phrase dependent arising means that something arises because something else already exists something is born because something else was already bornThe Bodhisattva who saw them coming from a distanceAnd yet they should have conviction that all merit has a connection with all sentient beingsand if on the other handThey never make criticisms of the wise And thus their conduct is completely pure In this regard broad heels means that the bases of his two heels are broad unlike those of other human beingsThis is because of selflessness because of the absence of defining characteristics and because of the absence of any knowerOne should heat up a dogs tooth above a smoky fire add to it milk and clarified butter and rub it on Hair will grow even where it doesnt normally growThe Blessed One replied It is the prayers he madeMoreover Subhūti physical forms are pure and similarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are pure owing to the purity of desire hatred and delusionWe clearly see all the activities of beings as they areSome of the girls partially covered their facesEven if those who were as wise as you Were to fill all the ten directionsand they should be attentive to nonconditioning and noncessationTheir bodies will be covered with blisters rashes sores abscesses and itching spotswhatever Dharma teachings the Tathāgata has taught all are the truth that is spoken by the TathāgataOr the yellow one or the red oneFor Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa himself Dwells herethe great blissThe redness in the cardinal directions is the great affectionMonks while the ThusGone One was being praised by the gods after he had reached perfect and complete awakeningwhen they teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings in order that they might abandon their view of the ten powers of the tathāgatasEven those of your sons who are wiseAnd the crown prince Mañjuśrī surrounded and followed by these bodhisattvas disciples akras Brahmās Lokapālas gods and goddesses entered the great city of VaiśālīThey will no longer continue to be in saṃsāraThen he decreed In the light of thisthe asura rulers Bali and Rāhu each with his retinueQuick stand up and enjoy the prime of youthWithout perfecting the transcendent perfection of wisdom they will not attain emancipation in omniscienceThe Blessed Awakened One is free of poisons Poison is eradicated by the majesty of the Awakened OneThe precious minister of a king who has been properly consecrated by sprinkling his head appears just as beforeIt is like how the orb of the moon travels at a distance of fortytwo thousand yojanas above earth and yet its reflection nonetheless appears in small vessels filled with water It is not that the moon moves from its position and enters the small vessels filled with waterBhagavat where can the sixsyllable mahāvidyā be obtainedMonks the ripened fruits of wholly negative actions are wholly negativeThe best of beings throughout the ten directions extended their armsif the follower of this other order becomes upset disturbed or angryThe gods repliedThey cannot cultivate the attainments up to and including omniscienceIt was a yojana wide and a yojana highThis completes the second instruction on the practice of The Great Vidyā Queen of the YoginīsMonks at that time all sorts of negative inauspicious opinions started to circulate among the people of MagadhaBhadrapāla the Blessed One continued the puppet is animated by actionLike the moon you are replete with the best of all qualitiesand also the genuinely perfect buddhas are all nonconceptualIt is as you have said great kingIf failing to be patient and accepting I should instead become aggressive toward anyoneFor that reason Subhūti you should know that all things are undifferentiated without defining characteristics and they neither arise nor ceaseFilled with curiosityThey who do not wish for the pleasures of a king Will know this kind of restraint of the body Middling dullness is when one engages in negative acts but with rapid subsequent remorse they attain illumination regarding all engagement with the compositeand having entered therein they neither associate anything with nor disassociate anything from physical formsAnd teaching that follows practicing the teaching That is the nature of the Jinas teaching Why is it fame for those who wish for renown Because it brings the attainment of vast qualitiesverbally practice the four modes of excellent conduct andIf you ask how they correctly perceive physical formsDivine being moreover when bodhisattvas observe the body and apply mindfulness they know that the body of the past was unbornwhich means that without any doubt this bhikṣu was irreversibly progressing to the highest complete buddhahoodLesser desire is when one adheres to desire yet one is satisfied merely by contact through smelling rubbing or other bodily contact or merely by talking or seeingin order to eliminate the karma of their negative deeds to liberate them from the lower realms to place them in the higher realmsThe Blessed One repliedthis doctrine is profound hard to discern and hard to realize it cannot be scrutinized Their gait is that of a lion  Their gait is that of a mighty elephant  Their gait is that of a swanGlowing red in colorSimilarly motion nonmotion resting and arising are nonapprehensible owing to their utter purityOne should recite the mantra  times for each syllableKnowing that I am their protector I teach them of the distress that is in thereAt this time these beings will be joyful and delighted by the sound of those words that bring the Buddha to mind Then they will die and be reborn in a buddhafield unsullied and pure in which a buddha bhagavān dwells lives and resides and where he teaches the DharmaIn that realm there was a bodhisattva great being known as SarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhinSeven dust particles on a hare is one dust particle on a sheepSon of noble family for the benefit of beginner bodhisattvas the bodhisattva kāśagarbha is born and appears in the places where such bodhisattvas dwellThe postulant then turns to the monk who will inform the saṅgha of his desire to go forthYou must not kill living beings Not speak what is not truewho told me my condition is hard to cureIt renders them devoid of grey hair and destroys conceptualityThey will never develop thoughts of degenerate morality thoughts of indolence thoughts of distraction and thoughts of stupidityThey will not be protected by dhyāna or by solitude Nor by generosity or offering to buddhasMañjuśrī that is the bodhisattva mahāsattvas field of activityYou perceive sense fields when there are no sense fieldsThey have not attained the nondifferentiation of perception which works toward the maturity of the bodhisattvasIt is a wheel that genuinely subsumes the realm of phenomena This wheel is immeasurable because it transcends all limitsKauśika they are incapable of dedicating the nature of physical forms andHis Dharma will remain for twenty intermediate eonsO gods The mind of the tathāgatas who genuinely consider this objective is one that is inclined toward carefree inaction and not toward the teaching of the sacred doctrineAs soon as they die they will all fall into the great Hell of Ultimate TormentIt is the seat of learning because it makes practice of the essenceThey do not apprehend the emptiness of all things as the emptiness of all thingsAs I stood there bent over with my left leg stretched out and my right hand reaching down in order to pick up the ragThe supreme airborne palaces of the Brahmās Have become endowed with extreme brillianceThat the mindconsciousness does not perceive is signlessnessThe Tathāgata was the principal human A hero for the three worlds the sole friend of beingsin that respect there is no dualityThis is the rite of enthrallmentA domain essentially without undertaking yet where all the roots of virtue are undertaken without interruption such is the domain of the bodhisattvaSimilarly when sitting down at the seat of awakening a bodhisattva lion conquers the hordes of demons through their own diligence strength and power tāriputra this body is very harmful and troublesomeFlowers fell and the sound of hundreds of musical instruments was heardDākṣāyaṇī Daughter of DakṣaThis shows that the bodhisattva mahāsattva kāśagarbha possesses determination and good qualities that are inconceivable and that he brings all sentient beings to complete maturationThe beings in those great hells are my taskhe or she will keep supplying perfect provisions for as long as the party is on the road and so all will be happy and free from weariness while journeying across the wildernessThis is the practice of the tantra of the desire familyShe is white like the rays of the autumn moon anointed with cream of white sandalwood and beautifully adorned with flowersEven if it is explained for ten million eons That they are unproduced and unceasingtheir development and liberation of living beingsHe did not lower his bannerHe replied This is owing to the reality divulged as such in all languagesMy good man what do you needTheir karma will come they will be under the power of their karma Their tongues will become vast and a hundred thousand plows will plow themBlazing lightning bolts sprang forth from their eyesSubhūti it is because the expanse of reality owing to its utter purity has not been is not and will not be apprehended by anyoneThe same refrain should also be extensively applied to the sensory elements exactly as has been indicated here in the context of the psychophysical aggregatesVenerable Lord Since the Tathāgata has said that all things are unknowable and invisibleSon do you think I dont know where you want to go I cannot open the door for youāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving the six transcendent perfections and in the same vein all the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighty minor marks as entities and nonentitiesPrecisely NārāyaṇaSince they illumine all dense forests everywhere with an inconceivable web of light they beautify infinite realmsSimilarly they know the modalities of the sensory elements and yetthe emptiness of nonapprehension the emptiness of nonentities the emptiness of essential nature and the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesIt will be far more difficult For someone to uphold this sūtra To have faith in and aspiration for it And teach it again and againwhere the movements of sentient beings unfoldWhen I was practicing under hardships they helped meThey teach the Dharma for the attainment of the result of a worthy one yet they observe neither worthy ones nor any result of a worthy oneThis tīrthika tīrthikas name wishes to renounce this identity and go forthWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas fearless aspiration consist in And one should refrain from deprecating the law of cause and effectIn what way you may wonder do bodhisattvas bring down a continuous and delightful flower rain of the true and

This sacred doctrine which the Elder Subhūti has explained described and taught through the power of the tathāgatas through the blessing of the tathāgatas through the potent force of the tathāgatas has indeed been eloquently explainedHow should we properly understand the irreversible great bodhisattva beingsOne should cook clarified butter of a cow with peacocks bile and the juice of false

how all the lord buddhas who understand the equality of all things manifest all sorts of buddhafields in order to develop living beingsNoble son the socalled relative therefore refers to names designations and conventionsand creating food that had a hundred flavorsYoung man in that way bodhisattva mahāsattvas should constantly seek for kalyāṇamitras as if their head or clothing were on fireTerribly sad in body and mind the sage shed tears and sighed deeplyKnowing this being was certain to become one of the fortunate the venerable āriputraAs soon as the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana was bornThe names of their worlds were the same And they all appeared in a time of degeneration They hold up sickles brandish discuses roll their eyesRecruiting all the godscultivates the five powersThey do not apprehend the emptiness of emptiness as the emptiness of emptinessWhen they had arrived they bowed their head to the Bhagavāns feetWhich brings an end to old

of birth old age sickness and death And be free from the shackles of cyclic existence And enjoy purity equal to limitless spaceWhen they practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom accordingly they do not consider whether or not they engage in union with the transcendent perfection of wisdomWhen the Bhagavān was young he had had sixteen sons of his own and they immediately knew that he had attained buddhahoodSprinkling the Bodhisattva with māndārava flowers she circumambulated him three timesDivine son similarly the hearers meditation on the truths is observed for just a short period of

svāhāThere at present resides the thusgone worthy perfect buddha PadmanetraExcellent Candrabhūtiupon the Bhagavān they tossed and scattered flowers from their baskets the size of SumeruBecause of this women are completely ablaze with afflictionsYes Venerable Lord it is so Venerable Sugata it is soThey will make unsurpassable offerings To Buddha MaitreyaThe five monks Kauṇḍinya and the rest Along with sixty million gods Purified their eye of DharmaYou will be liberated from the noose of saṃsāraSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who train in the expanse of reality have trained in all phenomenaNonotion is nondivisionAnd also because of the light that shines from the tuft of hair on his foreheadWhatever buddha realm they are born into they will be born miraculously in front of the Tathāgata from within a lotus made of the seven precious materialsThey should praise the actualization of individual enlightenmentUnder that king there were many other bhikṣus Who desired gain and who entered homesIf Subhūti you appreciate that the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas lack the wonderful and marvelous attributes of great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomwill be guarded protected looked after and brought peace and wellbeing by themNor does the space element think I create hollow spaces inside the bodyThey will know if the woman is going to be free of suffering And will give birth to a meritorious boyHe does not emulate unconditioned phenomenaThey will be given protection by the kings And those princes who listen to the DharmaThey should not even dwell on the notion In this my buddhafield may the term transcendent perfection of generosity exist and similarly may the terms indicative of the other transcendent perfections starting from the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom exclusively existHonor them without being disheartened In order to attain the highest enlightenment What could be the cause what could be the reason for thisMay they especially protect you With health and wellbeing There is the meditative stability named Seal of Retention  There is the meditative stability named Unimpairedthe Blessed Buddha asked the monksdisappears in the atmosphere itselfWhen all sounds and words are abandonedThere will be meditation without pride These are called the four correct exertionshad attained retention remained in great eloquenceAt that point some of the other boys who were carrying their seats made a commotionCould it become controlled by afflictions or cleansed Stainless Light replied Bhagavān no it could not The Bhagavān asked Monk what do you thinkThe completion of the thousandfold universe can be compared to the perfections of the solitary buddhasKāśyapa the blind man represents the beings who dwell in the saṃsāra of the five kinds of existencesSome wore fine transparent clothes that revealed their hips and their girdlesso it is that they correctly perceive the cessation of formative predispositionsBy that truth and those true words may the person person named suchandsuch be guarded protected embraced brought peace and wellbeing and granted pardonA fire is born in dependence on conditions It is born fulfills its purpose and quickly ceases In this way some scholars investigate Where does this come from and where does it proceeddisplaying the form of akra to sentient beings who are to be trained by the form of akraI shall not hide shall not conceal and shall not fail to acknowledge themThis is the reality of all thingsrub it into a wound caused by a venomous spider a monkey or skin eruptionsSimilarly feelings too are not one thing perceptions are not one thing formative predispositions are not one thing consciousness is not one thing and nonarising another distinct from theseThey will not lose their recollection of the Buddha And it will not be stolen away by the experience of suffering nonmentalplacementUnequaled impossible to describe And they brought many millions of beings to buddha wisdom Having abandoned their training in loving kindness great compassion and the perfection of wisdom as well as their training in skillful means and the trainings taught in other sūtrasSimilarly Senior Pūrṇa the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdom are also neither fettered nor liberatedLord when I heard these words of the Licchavi Vimalakīrti I wondered what I should saywho do not read it aloud or recite it confer its transmission or be attentive to it in the correct mannerAs the new monks preceptor was a hermit living in the forest the monk took the nāga disguised as a brahmin to see him and saidserved him the food with divine perfect flavors andGive us that which you have described Those three delightful cartsJust as one is so are allHow are they developedVenerable Lord When great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomand they intend to induce others also to degenerate from the pathways to the higher realms and to liberation from cyclic existenceBhagavān do not be concernedHaving immersed it in sesame oil he set it alightI do not hold that the unsurpassed genuinely perfect buddhas are found in nonarisingWhen a bodhisattva comprehends that the nature of all beings is the complete transcendence of suffering such a bodhisattva will have departed by means of the perfection of insightAt that time I made the following aspiration When I become perfectly enlightened I will seek the DharmaHowever if the nāgas do not send rain leprosy will break outThen the nāga king atamukha comes from his residence and burns the grass the bushes the herbs and the forestspure meditative absorption is the saṃbhogakāyaYou develop kindness you increase joy You teach wisdom you eliminate ignoranceThose who have these major marks of a superior man which the tathāgatas possessO O thousandarmed one called Grey Monkey please release suchandsuch from bondage SvāhāThis samādhi is not difficult to attain For those who are not agitated who have a welltamed mind Who remain within the conduct of mendicants and bodhisattvas And who are predisposed toward generosity and are without miserliness When all the devas nāgas yakṣas rākṣasas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kiṃnaras mahoragas and humans had gathered togetherI applied myself nanda with burning diligence and quickly realized supreme perfect enlightenment and became a buddhaIt is the profound meaning of dependent origination In connection with the secret initiationThinking about it again and again one falls into depressionscattered with various flowers it resounded with the sound of divine musicHe offered clothes to those who needed clothingand can proceed with a compassionate outlookAnd thus their minds neither dwell on virtue nor on sinas well as misery lamentationsBhaiṣajyarāja in that way while bodhisattva mahāsattvas do not hear do not possess do not comprehend do not practice and do not contemplate this Dharma teaching those bodhisattva mahāsattvas are far from the highest complete enlightenmentwhat did he do that it should lead him to be reborn among the denizens of AvīciWhen they repeat it bhagavats and buddhas to the number of sand grains in ninetynine Ganges Rivers gather around themthe stride that leaves an impression of a thousandspoked wheel on the groundLikewise there are one billion Mount Merus the kings of mountainsThey who possess this supreme samādhi Whatever subtle Dharma teachings they hear They attain perfect mastery of them all And gain their power and detailed reasoning Noble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities rest in equanimityAt that time noble disciples experience only feelings of painHer mind let alone her body desires no one other than the universal monarchHe dispatches some messengers after him Saying Bring me this poor manThe hair of their heads is not dishevelledSimilarly they establish them in all the causal and fruitional attributes up to and including omnisciencegenerosity is an obscurationwhich praises Sukhāvatīs inconceivable qualitiesWhat do you think about this āriputra why is this Dharma discourse called Complete Embrace by All BuddhasThe learned sage held the child and gazed upon him deep in thoughtHave no regrets When this Dharma teaching was taught this world wobbled and rockedthis is the time to stay within royal circlesThrough patience you are forbearing selfcontrolled and at easeand are always attentive to it in the correct mannerthose individuals who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas will exclusively pass away among humankind and be reborn among humankindSubhūti the emptiness of internal phenomena is neither fettered nor liberatedTherefore Samantabhadra one should stand up for bhikṣus who hold this Dharma teaching even when they are far awayShould we go after the prince Will we be able to make him returnand then said Sir game does not eat other gameSome said She is very loving toward meMonks as the Bodhisattva was walking toward the Bodhi treeOne who does not abide in mind mentality and consciousness does not form mental constructs or conceptsI shall indeed abstain from killing living creatures andthey went to see him and askedHe may manifest to living beings the ways of the sick and the unhappy yet he has entirely conquered and transcended the fear of deathHe outshines akra and Brahmāhe gave medicine to the sickIn the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities the emptiness of essential nature is not discernedHe then came into the presence of the compassionate Jina Accompanied by eighty quintillion others Whoever casts off all conceptual identification Brings to an end the identification of existenceThe nāgas yakṣas garuḍas gandharvasThey learn the teachings of the vinaya for the sake of beingsIs thus resolvedThus the understanding of fools Is a conceptualization of empty phenomenaI salute you guide for the exhausted worldThrough this merit may I also swiftly Turn the wheel of Dharma most sublimeThe bhagavān tathāgata ākyamuni then asked the fourfold assemblyIn this way the Bodhisattva spent six years during which time his body became increasingly feeble weak and emaciatedhandsomeIt is made of bones teeth and hair and is covered by a hairy skinThen while heating up the effigy over the embers of cutch tree wood at the three junctions of the dayIt has no coming It has no going No one makes it arise It is not stopped by anybodyThey who know that phenomena are always empty Are heroes who give away their sons daughters and slaveshe placed in their center a lion throne of divine materials that surpassed the work of devas and humanswhen a person standing on the bank of a lotus pond sees some lotuses submerged in the water some lotuses at water level and some lotuses above the waterThat which is without a state of being self and a state of being other does not burnO Yellow Acala hū phaṭThe instructor then says This is the procedure At which point the lay devotee says It is excellentwithout joyto the one who has perfect liberationAttaining great compassion andMonks such were the miraculous marvels that occurred while the Bodhisattva remained in his mothers wombBhikṣus the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū then gave to the sixteen mendicants the prophecy of their complete enlightenmentfor they enable one to relinquish all nonvirtuous qualities and to perfect all virtuous qualitiesThe buddhas replied In the past for hundreds of lives this Buddha strove diligently toward awakening and did better than many hundreds of thousands of bodhisattvasBodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara then left the island of SiṃhalaWhat is nondualityThe ācārya should not give it to those who are inappropriateTo this Vimalatejā answeredProstrations to the tathāgata Buddha KanakamuniThere are others who long for wisdom selfcontrol and tranquility without having a teacherThose attributes of the lower fruits are indeed subsumed within itDue to Mañjuśrīs power Māra Pāpīyān repliedFor so long he has regarded sentient beings with his unhindered vision as his mothers fathers and children Looking at beggars as if they were his only children he has been filled with love and compassion and has never disappointed themsome words could be heard in my realm From all my palaces with their windows and archways from our jewel trees and from all our delightful and enjoyable places the following words rang outwho are continuously playing musicA woman from the priestly warrior or merchant casteRecall the power of your vast store of merit And the illuminating knowledge of your boundless intelligenceThey are the masters the leaders of merchant caravans Who are dedicated to protecting beings from misfortuneAct like that and all will be accomplished Karmic torment will come to an endIt is impossible that they should be reborn among frontier tribesmen who do not engage in virtuous acts or among barbarous human beings orMy aim is fulfilled and goodness accomplishedAnd conduct that is without arroganceor the features of a donkeys physical form the power of recollectionjust as the element of space cannot be perceivedSubhūti it is because ordinary people lack the noble eightfold pathSubhūti in the same manner great bodhisattva beings establish sentient beings many hundreds of billion trillions in number on the path of the ten virtuous actionsThey descended and settled on the ground Where they saw the Bodhisattva the Son of the ākyas As he sat crosslegged at the trunk of the rose apple tree practicing concentration Shining and brilliant like the glow of gold from the Jāmbū RiverThe Blessed One replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of all thingsIt is being wise concerning the skandhas It is being wise concerning the dhātusseven great abysses seven hundred abyssesHe continued My lord the light of the sun causes trees and walls to cast shadowsBodhisattvas know the absorptions of the hearers they know the absorptions of the solitary buddhas they know the absorptions of the bodhisattvas and they know all absorptions of the thusgone onesListening to them as they teach the Dharma Please therefore reveal this supreme Dharma to the worldmight allow me to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four monthsSimilarly they have a view concerning sightsSon of noble family at that time at that point the world of Sukhāvatī in the west was that world called Boundless Accumulation of Precious Qualities and Full Display of HappinessDivine being frightened by the levels of the hearers and solitary buddhas beginner bodhisattvas turn back from stinginess flawed discipline hostility laziness distraction and misguided intelligencealong with the sounds of the vīṇā ektara balari mahāti and the sughoṣak The two boys exclaimedTheir minds always remain like a mountain These are distinctive qualities of the third patience Subhūti it is because the natural expression of their future limits though without entity is still omniscience and the restMoreover He who is proud and ignorant does not have much acumenThen noble ones in the middle of the sky King ubhavyūhaThen he asked Venerable Lord What is the refined eye of clairvoyance possessed by great bodhisattva beingsIn the same way āriputra those among monks and nuns and male and female lay devotees who do not correctly know the shortcomings of the sense pleasures are tormented by lustand liberates them from great sufferingOnce he is seated upon the Bodhimaṇḍa All his conceptions are eliminated correct livelihood  correct effort  correct recollection and  correct meditative stabilityThis thought is a great thought It is the unsurpassable thought of the Dharmathe pains of anger the pains of dullness the pains of any afflictionYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of meditation on the path What are the four kinds of meditation on the pathFor many thousand quintillions Of eons my eyes were gouged outThe numerous yakṣas devour Those that are placed here and thereWe are amazed to have seen such a sign As this which is marvelous and immeasurablethe meditative stability free from ideation and merely endowed with scrutinyThe quantity of merit that a bodhisattva who arouses the mind of awakening for the first time comes to possess is far greater still immeasurably greaterThese people who do not follow the training Why will they have shaved their heads They teach them the Dharma in accordance with their inclinationsand valuable than the single dropthe sensory element of odorsThey defeat the māras And are greatly famed buddhas and should offer divine food made of white flourIn the past when we have gone out on rounds many hundreds of thousands of creatures would follow after usan unsurpassed charioteer who trained beingsThe bodhisattvas who possess this sūtraThis tree had supported the mothers of previous victorious onesNext the god Dharmacārin saidFather grant me leave I wish to go forth in the wellproclaimed Dharma and Vinaya May we get along and not disagreeand in the same vein just as the light of the gods of the Trayastriṃśa Yāma Tuṣita Nirmāṇarata and Paranirmitavaśavartin realmsThis concludes Samantabhadras Encouragement the twentysixth chapter of the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good DharmaMonks this is how a benighted man acts who turns his back on such a fine and wellproclaimed Dharma and Vinayaārisuta I have truly taught to you This very meaning that I seewho cried out from being cut sliced crushed and hacked to piecesSome had ugly eyes rolling and blazingKoṣṭhila who had taken the name Dīrghanakha when he became a wanderer went to see the Blessed Oneextending from those of the Caturmahārājakāyika realm as far as the Bṛhatphala realmMaster where do you liveThey will not develop a covetous or greedy attitude toward others valuableswho has a form like a mountain of goldShe adheres to what is true controlled in body and mindSo it is Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom will perfect the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline that is without defining characteristicsthe gods will flourish and the demigods will be on the waneor it is crystal or is crystalcolored or is like crystal or shines with crystal lightSimilarly they are fixated on the sensory elementsSon of noble family some may be able to apprehend the expanse of the whole of the infinite limitless space in the ten directions butthen prostrated at the feet of the Bhagavān and supplicated him with these wordsThe supreme king became afraid and asked Why does the priest weepBhaiṣajyarāja if a bodhisattva is frightened of this Dharma teaching is afraid and terrified of itIf he should ask Is the afterlife like that or not like thatThe tathāgatas who are present in other world realms will see them and bless themThey who desiring liberation possess this stainless samādhi Do not quarrel or cause conflict when they speakThe three buddha bodies and the five gnosesBut those who seek liberationSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who possess such attributes indications and signsThey made the pledge and set out on their journey Going ForthYou may hold a spear in each of your hands And use them all yet that will bring you nothingthat being will look at the three worldsAuntie I must train in the great precepts prescribed by the Buddhananda when some beings hear sūtras like this one they become joyful elated and full of faith Those beings obtain something wonderfulThus they reside at trees that are agreeable to the body and delightful to the mindThe bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha declared to the Blessed OneIt will form a boundarywhat is present is very little like that of volitionA pregnant woman will also give birth easilyThose who have engaged in and accrued deeds that obscure wisdomIf you ask how they correctly perceive formative predispositionsNakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña that bodhisattva mahāsattva having attained receptivity to the birthlessness of phenomenaWhat is being wise concerning the skandhas wise concerning the dhātus and wise concerning the āyatanasin the same way aboveHe had no harmful wishes never did any damageIn order to listen to the elucidation from the great being Dear boy Kolita Come home There is pleasure to be had while living here tooFree from attachment and anger he lives from almsFuture thusgone ones who have not yet arrived will also attain complete awakening and go entirely beyond suffering through this very trainingand please keep the bodhisattva great beings in your protection they have no hypocrisy or boasting  they do not praise themselves  they do not criticize othersSon do you wish to go forthO King the boys eyes lingered upon the daughter of Daṇḍapāṇi ākya the ākya girl named Gopā and there was a brief conversation between themThis is an offering to all the buddhas An inconceivable offering of the Dharma Son of noble family is there a system according to which relying on the true meaning is to rely on all phenomenaThose who have incorrect conduct should not dwell among those who receive offeringsSimilarly there are great bodhisattva beings who perceive all within range of the clairvoyance of the gods from the Trayastriṃśa Yāma Tuṣita Nirmāṇarata and Paranirmitavaśavartin realms as far as the Akaniṣṭha realmSimilarly the world with its god realms will rejoice in themIn accordance with the aspirations expressed and taught by the thusgone ones through this generosity of relinquishing my male and female slaves staff and workers may I cause all beings to perfect their freedom independence and selfarisen wisdomfor that is a brahmins dutyI have attained the qualities of a monk which is my second crossingConsider noble son how the shining sun clearly reveals both the equal and the unequal to the people of JambudvīpaWill overcome and defeat Tens of millions of māras There is only unhappiness and suffering thereIt was also named The Very Extensive Sūtra And he taught it to billions of beings Blow the great conch of the DharmaConclusion of the twentieth chapter IndraketudhvajarājaThe properties of virtue and nonvirtue should be viewed in a similar wayThey will speak no ill of other individuals of the Bodhisattvayāna They will not malign them and will not criticize themI rejoice in all meritorious actsVenerable Lord The nonarising of what is without foundationNoble son there are beings who must be trained by means of taking rebirthmeansthe way they are their characteristics and their nature just as those dharmas are the way those dharmas arewhenever they do not engage with the notions that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness arise or that they are nonarisingThe same refrain should be extensively applied here as beforeThe fine city of Kapilavastu trembled in six waysNoble son there is no one to be seen within the realms of sentient beings who can break the command of a bodhisattva except when that would serve as a skillful meansLikewise you turned the wheel of the sacred doctrine that is equal to the unequaledOn a piece of birch bark or rind Draw a wheel With twentyone sectionsWhat is preserving the teaching It is the determined seeking of the Dharma and practicing the Dharma in accord with the DharmaBut they will be uncontrolled untrained And disrespectful to each other a hundred thousand eons I have experienced all these unbearable horrible painful sensationsAnd bees also seek out flowers because of suffering from hunger and thirstIt arises from the afflictions that result from unreal mental constructions and hence ultimately nothing is perceived which can be said to be sicknot perceiving touchable things the bodyconsciousness has no ground to stand uponSimilarly the nonarising nonaffliction and nonpurification of the sensory element of the eyes are without foundationI know the nature of the mind So that henceforth wisdom will arise No my lord it is still the middle of the nightheart spleen lungs liver stomachIf you ask why it is because they attain the unsurpassed statewith seething throngs of thousands of merchantsAt the time of the bodhisattvas complete buddhahood The mind has no object Is also itself a conceptand who was to take his last body died and passed from the lofty heights of a god and entered ārikās wombnanda it is because the genuinely perfect buddhas of the past indeed attained omniscience having trained in this transcendent perfection of wisdomSimilarly you should not misconstrue it as feelings perceptions formative predispositions or consciousnessThe strength of ten bodhisattvas who have been definitively emerged for one hundred million eons is the same as the strength of one bodhisattva who has been definitively emerged for one billion eonsowing to the emptiness of all thingsOrdinary sentient beings however became very disheartened so he then showed a great display created on the level of relative truth in order to bring all sentient beings to complete maturityWhat devas son has been born today Through whose power has there appeared Today this kind of unprecedented eventpowdersUltimate truth is like this Divine son the Thusgone worthy perfect Buddha also says that ultimately all phenomenaBut you are neither proud nor overwhelmedthat the ripened fruit of his action has led the Blessed One to declare him as the greatest and most powerful miracle workerIn the middle of great battles They remain impartial to both sidesBecause of those roots of merit They all saw ten thousand million buddhaswho desires the abundant resources of gods and humans should behave in conformity with the path of ten virtuous actionsHaving heard such Dharma as this The wise ones will at that time protect it wellWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas aspiration free of weariness consist inMindfulness of the body is a gateway to the light of the DharmaTo those who have taken refuge in and revere Nārāyaṇa akra a cakravartin the sun the moon Dhṛtarāṣṭra Virūḍhaka Virupākṣa or Vaiśravaṇa or who have taken refuge in various objects such as devas mountains trees fountains ponds and pools he will show himself accordinglyLikewise five thousand maidens carrying fans made of peacock feathers walked aheadThis is the tantra on essenceextractionThen he decreed That being the case monks should not allow persons under fifteen years old to go forthsunrise an eighth of the suns passageThey who are thus trained in the restraint of the body Have become liberated from all misfortune There are hundreds of diseases and being struck by sickness Brings torment to beings like deer tormented by forest fireWhat are those ten They are the excellent power of not being subjugated the excellent power of invincibility the excellent power of merit the excellent power of insight the
