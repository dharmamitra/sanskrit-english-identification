of measurement hate is a maker of measurement delusion is a maker of measurementMA explains anidassana as meaning invisible because it does not come within range of eyeconsciousness but again this is a trite explanationMA explains coming back and not coming back as referring to rebirth thus suggesting that gods who do not come back are nonreturners while those who do come back are still worldlingsMA explains that the arising nature of the body can be observed in its conditioned origination through ignorance craving kamma and food as well as in the momentbymoment origination of material phenomena in the bodyMA explains that the king asked this question with reference to the case involving the female wanderer Sundar which was pending investigation at the timeMA gives prolific

identifies with serenity and insight thus in its paraphrase of the text I teach bhikkhus even the abandoning of desire and attachment to such peaceful and sublime states as serenity and insight how much more so to that low vulgar contemptible coarse and impure thing that this foolish Ariṭṭha sees as harmless when he says that there is no obstruction in desire and lust for the five cords of

itconstrues or discriminates itthrough the gross proliferating tendencies of craving conceit and views which are here called conceivingsHe apprehends it in diverse ways contraryMA says that he obtains the equanimity of insight but from  it seems that the equanimity of the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception is also intendedMA says that the abandoning spoken of here should be understood as

and brahmins see in sensual pleasures when they speak of abandoning sensual pleasures and describe the full understanding of sensual pleasuresThey say Let us live on beansLet us live on sesamumLet us live on rice and they eat rice they eat rice powder they drink rice water and they make many kinds of rice concoctionsThey say Let us live on kolafruits and they eat kolafruits they eat kolafruit powder they drink kolafruit water and they make many kinds of kolafruit concoctionsThey smell dung from a distance and run to it thinking We can eat we can eat Just as brahmins run to the smell of a sacrifice thinking We can eat here we can eat here so too these animals that feed on dung smell dung from a distance and run to it thinking We can eat here we can eat here And what animals feed on dungThey take food once a day once every two daysonce every seven days thus even up to once every fortnight they dwell pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervalsThey take to gulping down sensual pleasures and divert themselves with women wanderers who wear their hair bound in a topknotThey then rose from their seats and after paying homage to him they departed keeping him on their rightThey understand a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust they understand a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate they understand a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion they understand a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted they understand an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted they understand a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed they understand a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated they understand a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberatedThey understand how beings pass on according to their actions thus These worthy beings who were ill conducted in body speech and mind revilers of noble ones wrong in their views giving effect to wrong view in their actions on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared in a state of deprivation in a bad destination in perdition even in hell but these worthy beings who were well conducted in body speech and mind not revilers of noble ones right in their views giving effect to right view in their actions on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared in a good destination even in the heavenly worldThey went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him stood at one sideThey were seen entering into this hill once gone in they were no longer seenThinking about this the first brahmin might become angry and displeasedThinking it would be troublesome O Brahmā I did not speak the Dhamma subtle and sublimeThinking that no trace was left behind he would say Good man the arrow has been pulled out from you the poisonous humour has been expelled with no trace left behind and it is incapable of harming youThinking to discredit the Tathāgata he actually praises him for it is praise of the Tathāgata to say of him When he teaches the Dhamma to anyone it leads him when he practises it to the complete destruction of sufferingThinking I am a speaker of truth he gains inspiration in the meaning gains inspiration in the Dhamma gains gladness connected with the DhammaThinking I am one who engages in generosity he gains inspiration in the meaning gains inspiration in the Dhamma gains gladness connected with the DhammaThis beautiful beryl gem of purest water eightfaceted well cut lying on red brocade which glows radiates and shines or a glowworm in the thick
