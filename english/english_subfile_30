MA explains anidassana as meaning invisible because it does not come within range of eyeconsciousness but again this is a trite explanation
MA explains coming back and not coming back as referring to rebirth thus suggesting that gods who do not come back are nonreturners while those who do come back are still worldlings
MA explains that the arising nature of the body can be observed in its conditioned origination through ignorance craving kamma and food as well as in the momentbymoment origination of material phenomena in the body
MA explains that the king asked this question with reference to the case involving the female wanderer Sundar which was pending investigation at the time
MA gives prolific examples illustrating all the different modes of conceiving and these clearly establish that the intended object of conceiving is the misplaced sense of egoity
MA glosses sankha by koṭṭhāsa portion and says that sañña is either perception associated with papañca or papañca itself
MA glosses If the round of kamma had not been accumulated by me now there would not be for me the round of results if the round of kamma is not accumulated by me now in the future there will not be the round of results What exists what has come to be are the five aggregates
MA interprets it as meaning good states which it identifies with serenity and insight thus in its paraphrase of the text I teach bhikkhus even the abandoning of desire and attachment to such peaceful and sublime states as serenity and insight how much more so to that low vulgar contemptible coarse and impure thing that this foolish Ariṭṭha sees as harmless when he says that there is no obstruction in desire and lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure
MA maintains by reference to an ancient exegetical source that in this passage the path of the nonreturner is being described
MA merely says A singleexcellentnighter is one with a single night who is excellent because of possessing application to insight
MA offers three explanations of sabbato pabha completely possessed of luminosity possessing being everywhere and a ford accessible from all sides ie through any of the thirtyeight meditation objects
MA paraphrases this text thus Having perceived earth with a perverted perception the ordinary person afterwards conceives itconstrues or discriminates itthrough the gross proliferating tendencies of craving conceit and views which are here called conceivingsHe apprehends it in diverse ways contrary
MA says that he obtains the equanimity of insight but from  it seems that the equanimity of the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception is also intended
MA says that the abandoning spoken of here should be understood as abandonment by eradication that is complete uprooting by the supramundane path
MA takes the subject of the sentence to be Nibbana called consciousness in the sense that it can be cognized
MA Although this declaration was made while Channa was still a worldling as his attainment of final Nibbana followed immediately the Buddha answered by referring to that very declaration
