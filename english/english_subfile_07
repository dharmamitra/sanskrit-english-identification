good wishesjtb The daily schedule at Metta Forest Monastery includes a group interview in the late afternoon and a chanting session followed by a group meditation period later in the eveningThe Dhamma talks included in this volume were given during the evening meditation sessions and in many cases covered issues raised at the interviews  either in the questions asked or lurking behind the questionsOften these issues touched on a variety of topics on a variety of different levels in the practiceThis explains the range of topics covered in individual talksI have edited the talks with an eye to making them readable while at the same time trying to preserve some of the flavor of the spoken wordIn a few instances I have added passages or rearranged the talks to make the treatment of specific topics more coherent and complete but for the most part I have kept the editing to a minimumDont expect polished essaysThe people listening to these talks were familiar with the meditation instructions included in Method  in Keeping the Breath in Mind by Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo and my own essay A Guided Meditation If you are not familiar with these instructions you might want to read through them before reading the talks in this bookAlso further Dhamma talks are available at dhammatalksorgI would like to thank Bok Lim Kim for making the recording of these talks possibleShe more than anyone else is responsible for overcoming my initial reluctance to have the talks recordedI would also like to thank the following people for transcribing the talks andor helping to edit the transcriptions Paul and Debra Breger John Bullitt Richard Heiman Walter Schwidetzky Craig Swogger Jane Yudelman Balaggo Bhikkhu Gunaddho Bhikkhu Khematto Bhikkhu and Susuddho BhikkhuMay they all be happyWhatever merit there may be to these talks comes from the training I received from my teachers Ajaan Fuang Jotiko and Ajaan Suwat SuvacoThis book is dedicated to their memory with utmost gratitudeOkay time to practiceThere are times when talk about practice is helpful and times when it gets in the wayThe best way to solve that problem is simply to do the practiceWhen you talk about the practice you can start getting lost in abstract spaceYou forget that the whole purpose of the Dhamma is to point into our heartsThe big issues that we carry around inside us  our fears our sufferings our whole sense of what life is all about To the extent that talking about the practice helps to get perspective on these things then its usefulBut the talk has to be part of a larger doing  doing something about those problemsSometimes the doing may seem strangeHere we are sitting watching our breathWhat does that doIt brings us close to the heart very close to our mindsOf all the things we can know outside of our minds the breath is the closestAs were oneonone with the breath that changes our perspective on thingsWe let go of the outside distractions and ultimately turn our attention to the other part of the oneonone which is the mind aware of whats going on in hereBack when I was first ordained Ajaan Fuang had me memorize the Divine Mantra which I must admit struck me as kind of strange as it centered on the six elements a way of looking at things that felt very foreignHe had me chant it every eveningI was living alone up on the hill in Rayong and would chant the Divine Mantra every evening just after duskAfter doing this for a while it became less of a weird aspect of Thai Buddhism and more of a friend as I sat there through the night all by myselfFinally one evening it really hit meI was going through the six elements and when I finally got to the chant on consciousness I realized that I wasnt chanting about some foreign abstract idea of consciousnessI was chanting about my own awareness my own mind my own heart right here right nowI felt as if a huge block of ice inside me just shatteredI was able to open up and realize that the meditation wasnt some strange foreign thing I was doing to myselfI hadnt consciously thought that it was but subconsciously deep down inside there was a feeling that it was alien something from another cultureThat night it became mine my awareness of my mind my awareness of things really deep insideThe Dhamma was no longer a foreign mold that I was trying to impose on the mindIt became a message pointing to my deepest awarenessAnd I became aware of a real tenderness deep down  a tenderness not in the sense of being nice or fuzzy but in the sense of having been wounded of needing some helpThere was a need for some healing there and the meditation was what it neededI wouldnt say that I hadnt gained anything from the practice up to that point but the quality of what I gained changed that nightThis is what were working on as were practicingThe term patipat in Thai means to practice as when were practicing the Dhamma but it also means to look after somebodySometimes the Thai ajaans say Were not here to patipat the Buddhas teachings were here to patipat our own minds to look after our own minds our own heartsSo although the words may seem foreign and the process of meditation mechanical  youre focusing on the breath youre dealing with the mechanics of the breathing how the breathing relates to the pains in the body  ultimately these things start getting closer and closer to your heartAs you learn to treat your heart with more sensitivity using the breath using the understanding you gain from the Dhamma after a while the heart begins to open upIt opens up and allows you to heal itWithout that opening up theres going to be a resistanceNow this opening may happen suddenly or gradually but the important point is that as you get to know the breath get close to the breath youre also getting closer and closer to your own mind closer to the more sensitive parts of your mindAs you deal with the breath more precisely with more sensitivity you find that the mind is finally willing to open up to itselfPrior to that point it was used to being abused and misused and so it shut itself in shut itself up even against youOne part of the mind shut up against another part and so the healing couldnt take placeYour conscious awareness has to learn to be a healing awareness so that the parts of the mind that need to be healed will be willing to open upSo an important part of the practice is sensitivityStart out by getting very sensitive to the breathGet to know how it feels in the different parts of the body how different rhythms of breathing feelIts not so much that you want to become a breath mechanic although thats one of the side benefitsIts more that you try to develop your sensitivity to the present moment your sensitivity to the least little bit of stress the least little bit of harshness youre adding unnecessarily to the present momentYou gain more finesse with smoothing it out evaporating it dissolving it awayYou begin to see that even the simple process of breathing can be done well or poorlyIf you pay attention to it it can be done wellThat way the simple fact that youve got a breath becomes more than just a means for keeping the body aliveIt can actually be used to heal the body to deal with different types of pain in the bodyAt the same time it gets more and more healing for the mindAs you become more sensitive to precisely how you approach the present moment how you deal with the present moment all those parts of the mind that shut themselves off because they didnt want to be mistreated seem to realize instinctively that theres better treatment in the offingYour conscious awareness is more of a healing awareness than it was beforeThis allows the rest of your awareness to begin opening upThose parts of the body that you often have trouble accessing even with the breath There comes a time where your sensitivity reaches the point where they begin to open up tooYou may have noticed when you really look at your inner sense of the body that certain parts seem to be missingTheres a holding in a tension that blocks things offBut as your sensitivity to the breath begins to get more and more subtle the blockages dissolve and you realize that what seemed to be a physical blockage had its mental side as wellIts opening up now that you have the physical and mental tools to deal with it along with the sensitivity to use those tools wellSo your sensitivity to the present moment is a very important part of developing concentration developing insight and dealing with the whole problem of suffering the burdens that the mind carries aroundIt gives you the tools you need to deal with all the unskillful mental states that seem to get lodged in the mind and do their damage in both body and mind and yet that were often afraid to deal withWhen youre given the tools of not only the breath but also other perspectives of the Dhamma  and this is why talking about the Dhamma can be helpful at times to gain a clear and precise sense of your tools  then youre ready to handle themWhen I was staying with Ajaan Fuang the lessons didnt just come from the meditation techniqueThey also came from being around him getting his perspective on thingsI found myself learning a lot just by living with someone from a totally different backgroundId come up with a problem and mention it to him and hed look at me as though Id come from the other side of the world  which of course I hadMy way of looking at the problem seemed very natural to me but to him it was extremely strangeLearning to see the strangeness of some of my problems was a useful exercise in getting outside of the problems for a while  sometimes for goodSo if our discussions help in that way then theyre useful discussionsThey can give us a new perspective on our problemsThe real work though is something thats done inside and often its hardly even verbal at allThis is why the breath is such a good way of getting around a lot of our internal blockagesInstead of attacking the problem verbally you come at it from the nonverbal side  the energy in the body  becoming sensitive to the side that gets around the minds automatic nonverbal defensesThese patterns of blockage in the mind are what ignorance is all aboutHiding behind that ignorance are all the causes of sufferingThis is one of the scary parts of being born into any realm especially the human realm and the realms below thatAs you come into this life you immediately meet with suffering  whamimmediately  and theres nobody to explain it to youYoure facing it headonOther people can comfort you but they cant show you how to deal with itSo the mind comes up with all sorts of jerryrigged approaches improvised approaches to keep the suffering at bayThen even after we learn language we carry those preverbal approaches toward suffering into our adult lives without realizing itOften those approaches involve blocking denial and its not just a mental blockingIts a physical blocking as wellSo as were working with the breath and getting around some of these blockages dont be surprised when the sleeping dogs  the things that seemed to be lying very peacefully in the mind  suddenly get stirred upThats because the barrier behind which they were hiding has suddenly dissolved awayWhen that happens you can use the sensitivity youve developed in the meditation  along with the understanding of the Dhamma youve developed by reading and listening gaining a perspective on the whole issue of suffering and the end of suffering  and apply them directly to your own immediate sufferingsThe Buddha wasnt talking about suffering in the abstract he was talking about the sufferings lodged right here in each persons heart right here in your heart right nowAnd the tools he offered are meant to come here into the heart to the particular sufferings in the heart where they can make all the differenceThe Buddhas teachings on skillful qualities of mind come in clusters five this seven thatEven the one quality thats always appropriate  mindfulness  is always taught in the context of clustersTo begin with its paired with alertness Mindfulness means keeping something in mind as when we keep reminding ourselves to stay with the breath as we meditate alertness means noticing whats going on being alert to what you do and to the results of what youre doingFor mindfulness to be effective in training the mind it always has to be paired with alertnessAnd both of them have to play a role in larger clusters as wellTheyre part of the five strengths the seven factors of Awakening and the noble eightfold pathThe reason the Buddha teaches skillful qualities in clusters is because unskillful qualities come in clusters tooThe three roots of unskillfulness  greed aversion and delusion  can branch out into five hindrances seven obsessions ten fetters forms of cravingThey grow exponentiallyNo one skillful quality can take them all onEach skillful quality has to be strengthened by others to be effective to play its part in the training of the whole mindAt the same time each has to be balanced by others to make sure it doesnt go overboard and end up as a tool for the opposing forcesThis is why the Buddha left teachings like the four bases of success the seven factors for Awakening and the four sublime attitudes armies of skillful qualities to do battle with the armies of MaraWhen you see the various lists placed down  one two three four five six whatever  it gives the impression that you start with one skillful quality and then drop it to move on to the nextActually the process is more a question of gathering all the qualities together and then leaning in the direction of one or another as is appropriate so that the mind can maintain its balanceThis is the principle that applies to the sublime attitudes immeasurable goodwill immeasurable compassion immeasurable appreciation and immeasurable equanimityWe start out with goodwill not because its the least advanced of the qualities but because its the most essential the most basicOn top of that you build the others compassion appreciation or sympathetic joy and finally equanimityA balanced mind is one that knows when to emphasize which of the fourIts not that you abandon number one to move to number two or number four youre trying to keep all four of them on hand so that you can use whichever one is appropriate for the occasionGoodwill lies at the basis of everythingIn fact you could say that it lies at the basis of the whole practiceIf we didnt have goodwill for ourselves and the people around us the four noble truths wouldnt make any sense as an important teachingIts because we would like to see suffering end not only for ourselves but for the people around us that we want to follow the path to the end of sufferingWere concerned to find out what suffering is how we can abandon its causes and help to realize its cessationSo goodwill is where everything startsThink about it Why would you want anyone else to sufferYou might think about the evil or cruel things theyve done in the past but even then why would you want them to sufferTo learn a lessonWell theyre going to learn their lesson because the principle of karma is going to take care of that  thats why the teaching on equanimity is there  so you dont have to go out and be Gods vengeful sword to make sure that everyone gets their just punishmentsYour only job is to make sure there are no limits on your goodwillWhen people have done horrible things you dont have to like them you dont have to condone their behaviorThats not what goodwill meansGoodwill means that you dont wish anyone harmIf theyre doing horrible things you have every right to stop them if you can  after all in doing horrible things theyre creating bad karma more suffering for themselvesJust make sure that you dont harm them in trying to stop themSo try to make your goodwill limitless  or as the texts say immeasurableTake this as a challengeWhen you spread thoughts of goodwill test to see where the limits areDont just pretend that your goodwill is immeasurableEveryones goodwill starts out with limitsWhat are the limits of yoursAfter spreading goodwill to people you already feel it for  your friends your family  start spreading it to people for whom you dont spontaneously feel itDoes your heart object when you try spreading goodwill to people you dislikeStop and ask it WhyWhat would you gain from seeing them sufferLook at the little voice inside that resents their happinessIs that a voice you want to identify withCan you drop that attitudeThis is where the practice of developing goodwill really makes a difference in the mind When it forces you to challenge any smallness or narrowness in your heartIf you think of goodwill as a billowing pink cloud of cotton candy covering the world in all directions what youre really doing is covering up your actual attitudes which is of no help at all in gaining insight into the mindGoodwill is meant as a challenge as a way of searching out and working through your smallhearted attitudes one by one so that you can examine them uproot them and really let them goOnly when you work through the particulars like this can goodwill become more and more limitlessThats when your compassion can become limitless as wellIf you feel goodwill for people then when theyre suffering the ill effects of their bad karma you cant help but have compassion for themYou want them not only to stop experiencing whatever pain or suffering theyre undergoing at the time but also to stop doing whatevers going to cause them to continue to sufferThis is an important part of compassionIts not simply a soft spot in your heart for people who are sufferingIt also means also trying to find some way to help them to stop doing the things that are causing them to suffer to begin withWhen you can help them you appreciate their happinessYou feel sympathy for the happiness they encounterEven in cases where people are experiencing happiness that has nothing to do with you at all you appreciate the fact that theyre experiencing the results of their past good actions or present good actionsYou dont resent their happinessEven if youre in a contest and they come in first and you come in second and you felt that you really deserved to come in first this is where you have to practice sympathetic joyTheres a larger framework for things than the one youre probably aware ofNotice in all these cases that there comes a point where you have to leave things for what they are cases where you want to help someone and you cant or you would rather see yourself gain the happiness that somebody else hasThis is where you have to develop equanimityNotice that the teaching on equanimity is a reflection on the principle of karmaOf the four chants we have for the sublime attitudes its the only one thats simply a statement of factThe others sayThe first three are wishes attitudes things you would like to see happenMay May May The fourth one is simply a reflection on the way things areThis reflection actually turns up in lots of different contextsIn the five reflections the reflection on karma is the one that gives hopeYou realize that youre in charge of your actionsYoure not simply a victim of fate or of the stars or of some other being acting through youYoure the one whos making the choicesThats what gives you hopeBut its hope coupled with heedfulnessYouve got the power to do good with your actions but also the power to cause harmThe principle of karma is a doubleedged swordIf youre not careful you can use it to cut your own throatThis is why the Buddha recommends reflecting on the principle of karma as a way of inspiring heedfulnessTaken a little further the universality of the principle of karma is a reflection for developing equanimity both toward yourself and toward other peopleIn other words you come across incidents in your life where you cant gain the happiness youd likeTheres a karmic block thereSo you learn to accept it with equanimityThat doesnt mean that you give up and become totally passive and indifferentYou look for the areas where your actions can make a differenceDont waste your time and energy butting your head against the wall in areas where you cant make any changeFocus on the areas where you canSo equanimity is not hopelessness its not passive indifferenceIts there to redirect your energies in the proper direction to the areas where you can act for your own wellbeing and for the wellbeing of othersThe reflections on karma are also used as a basis for developing wisdom and insightThey form the background for all the teachings on discernmentThe central insight of the Buddhas Awakening was that pain and pleasure come from your actionsThere are actions that bring pain actions that bring pleasure actions that bring both and then special actions that put an end to action an end to suffering and bring total happinessThats the essence of the Buddhas discernmentSo its an interesting combination equanimity hope heedfulness discernmentThese things all go togetherThey hover around that same reflectionIn other words all beings are responsible for what they doAjaan Suwat once gave a Dhamma talk on this reflection focusing on the difference between the anatta teaching and this one statementForm feeling perceptions thoughtconstructs consciousness These are not selfBut we are the owners of our actionsThink about that he saidIn other words dont latch on to the results of your actions latch on to the fact that youre making the decisions right now all the timeOnce a decision has been made its been put into a larger circle of cause and effect beyond your control but you do have a chance to make a decision again the next moment and the next moment and then the nextFocus on thatDont get caught up in the results of past actionsFocus on what you can do now to make the present actions skillfulThats the focus of the teaching Were the owners of our actionsWere going to be receiving the results of these actionsSo act in a way whose results youd like to receiveBe concerned about that Thats whats meant by the Pali word ottappaIt can be translated either as fear of the results of your actions or concern for the results of your actionsHowever you translate it it means that youre not apathetic you know that whatever you do is going to bear resultsHere again the quality of discernment comes inThere are lots of things we like to do that will give bad results and things we dont like to do that will give good resultsThe Buddha said the measure of whether were a fool or a wise person lies in how we handle situations like thatIn other words this is where the quality of discernment really shows its worthYou can talk about discernment you can describe the three characteristics the five khandhas the six sensespheres dependent coarising emptiness all these wonderful concepts you can talk about them but if they cant help you make the right decision when youre faced with a hard decision your discernments uselessUseful discernment is the type that enables you to talk yourself out of doing things you would like to do but that you know would give bad results or to talk yourself into doing things you dont like to do but would give good resultsThats where discernment shows its stuffOur actions are the source of everything we experienceIf you want experiences to be good focus on the sourceIf you dont like the kind of experiences youre having turn back and focus again on the sourceIts constantly right here right here in the present momentThe Buddhas teachings on time are interesting in that even though they do talk about time they dont talk about a beginning point in timeThe beginning point for your experience is right here in the present momentIt all comes springing out of right here so instead of trying to trace things back to first causes someplace way back in the past the Buddha has you look for first causes right here and right nowDig down deep inside into the area of the mind where intention and attention and perception play against each other for thats the point from which all things are bornThe connections we have in life with different people are created by our actions things that weve done together with other people or to other people or for other peopleThese create the connections that we have with the people around usInterconnectedness is a very popular teaching in Buddhism especially nowadays but its funny that people like to talk about interconnectedness without the teaching on karmaThey turn to dependent coarising as a model for interconnectedness this web of connections where one factor cant exist without a whole lot of other factors but they neglect to realize that dependent coarising is a teaching on how ignorance is connected with suffering how craving is connected with sufferingIts the kind of connectedness you want to cut not the kind you want to celebrateConnectedness through karma can go either way  the connections can be good or they can be badSo you want to foster the good onesAnd again where do you lookYou look at what youre doing right here and right nowHow are you behaving with other peopleHow are you treating themThese create the relationships youre going to be able to enjoy or youre going to be stuck with now and on into the futureSo choose your actions carefullyOur actions decide our livesIn other words theres no judge up there someplace in the sky sitting on a big throne passing judgment on usWere passing judgment on what kind of life we want to have by the way we act  which is both empowering and also a little scaryThink of how many times youve acted on unskillful motivesThink of the unskillful motives you still have lurking around in your mind that could form the basis for future unskillful actionsThink hard about thatIt means theres work to be done  not just to escape unskillful actions but also to foster skillful onesThis is where the hope comes inEven though we may be suffering in our lives theres a way out through our own actionsWe dont have to sit around waiting for somebody else to come and save usWere not victims of fateWe can make the choices we can order our priorities so that we can reshape our lives in a positive direction through our thoughts words and deedsThis is why we meditate because meditation creates good qualities skillful qualities in the mind mindfulness alertness concentration discernment persistence truthfulness perseveranceAs we work at these qualities as we put them into action they get strengthened and become more and more the wise arbitrators of our lives pointing our lives in the direction we really want to goThen the final reflection builds on thatThis is a reminder to be heedful that we really want to act on our good impulses our skillful intentionsWe want to develop the qualities in our minds that will foster these skillful intentions because these are the things that really make a differenceThese teachings foster equanimity in reminding us to be equanimous toward our past actions toward the results from past actionsCertain things we cant change because theyve already been doneWe cant turn back the clockBut the teachings foster hope in that we can make a difference in what were doing right here and right nowTheres that opening for us to design our lives to point them in a better directionIn that balance among equanimity heedfulness and hope learning how to make proper use of this principle of karma Thats where the discernment comes inThe teachings on karma have gotten a bad rap largely because theyve been mangled turned into a simplistic caricature either fatalistic or tit for tatBut if you understand the complexity and also the purpose of the teaching you begin to realize that its not what we thought it wasIts not an excuse to justify the suffering that people are going through or for our being indifferent to that sufferingWhen you really understand the workings of karma you see other peoples suffering as an opportunity to help themYou dont know how much longer their karma for suffering is going to lastWouldnt it be a good thing if you could be the agent to help bring their suffering to an endPut yourself in their place Wouldnt you like to have somebody come and helpAnd someday you may actually be in their place tooAfter all as the Buddha said youve already been there before and if you dont get out of the cycle of rebirth youll probably be there againKarma is not a teaching meant to make us feel superior to other peopleYou never know Maybe the results of their past bad karma are simply coming faster than the results of your past bad karma and you may someday be in a similar place to where they are  or even worseSo you cant be complacentAnd the teaching on karma is not designed to make you complacentIf anything just the opposite Its meant to make you uncomplacentI once read someone saying that September th burst his complacent Buddhist bubbleWell thats an oxymoron complacent Buddhist The whole purpose in following the Dhamma is that it teaches you not to be complacentAs long as theres suffering in your heart theres work to be doneSo on the one hand the principle of karma makes you heedful reminding you that youve got work to doBut it also means that theres a way to work with suffering so that you can go beyond it Thats where the hope liesIf you understand how to use the teaching on karma you see how really useful it is how relevant it is to the meditation were doing right nowThe prime factor you want to dig down and find in your meditation is just that the karma the factor of intentionWatch to see how it movesSee how you can make it more skillfulSee how you can perfect that factor so that it takes you not only into more pleasant places in space and time but also  when you get really skillful  outside of space and time to the end of karma to the point where theres no more work to be doneThats one of the descriptions of an arahant katam karaniyam someone whos done the task done what had to be doneThe burden is laid downUnderstanding the principle of karma and using it the right way is what makes all that possibleThe first step when you meditate is to get your body into position your right leg on top of your left your hands in your lap your right hand on top of your leftSit up straight look straight ahead of you and then close your eyesThats the body in positionThe next step is to get the mind in positionStart with thoughts of goodwill because thats why were hereGoodwill is the wish for happiness  both for your own happiness and for the happiness of everybody elseThis is what were working on as we meditate Were taking that wish and were working on it looking for a way to bring true happiness to ourselves and to the people around usSpread thoughts of goodwill first to yourself and then out in everwidening circles to people who are close to your heart people you know well and like people youre more neutral about and even people you dont likeDont let there be any limitation on your goodwill because thats a limitation on your own mind on your own happinessAt the same time think about it If everyone in the world could find true happiness the world would be a much better placeNo one would have any reason to harm anyone elseWith that thought spread thoughts of goodwill to people you dont even know  and not just people all living beings of all kinds east west north south above and below out to infinityMay we all find true happinessThe next step is to bring your awareness back to the present momentWhat have you got hereYouve got the body sitting here breathing and youve got the mind thinking and awareSo bring all those things togetherThink about the breath and then be alert to the breath Whats the breath doing right nowIs it coming inIs it going outWhere do you sense it coming inWhere do you sense it going outFor the time being put aside any preconceived notions you may have about where the breath comes in and where it goes outJust notice how it actually feels  because breathing is not just air coming in and out of the lungs its the whole process the whole energy flow by which the body brings the air in and expels itAnd thats not just a matter of the nose and lungsThe entire nervous system can be involvedDifferent parts of the body expand and contract to bring in the airThats all counted as part of the breathing processSo wherever youre most aware of the breathing process focus your attention thereTry to make that spot comfortableYou can do this by adjusting the length of the breath the width the depth of the breath  whether its fast or slow heavy or light  whatever ways you have of adjusting the rhythm and texture of the breath so that your sensation of the breathing feels goodThats getting the mind in positionNow the problem with both the mind and the body in position is how to keep them thereIts not that difficult to get them into position but to keep them there That takes effortAnd particularly the mind because the mind is so used to running aroundThe body can sit here perfectly still yet in the course of five minutes the mind could have gone around the world many many timesSo this is the point you have to focus on mostIn fact all the real issues are in the mindEven when theres pain in the body the body itself doesnt really object to the pain it doesnt mindThe mind is what gets upset by the painSo you have to work mainly with the mind hereIf it wanders off just bring it right backIf it wanders off again bring it back againTry not to get frustrated with it try not to get discouragedIts used to wandering so you have to accept it as normal that the mind is going to wanderYour duty right now is to catch it as quickly as you can and to bring it back without a lot of recrimination  just gently but firmly bring it back to the breathAnd let the breath be as comfortable as possibleThe more comfortable it is the less likely the mind will be to wander offIn fact if you get the breath really comfortable it becomes really absorbingExplore where in the body you feel the different parts of the breathing sensations the breathing processWhich parts of the body feel tenseIf you want you can survey the whole body starting from the top of the head on down or starting at the navel and going up the front of the body then down the back and out the legs and beginning again at the back of the neck to go out the armsNotice how the different parts of the body are or are not involved in the breathing processNotice where you feel tension related to the breathIf you feel any tension anywhere let it relax let it dissolve away so that no new tension builds up with the inbreath and you dont hang on to any tension with the outThis way you make the breathing a lot more interestingThen choose whichever part of the body you find congenial and settle down thereAs for pains at this stage of the game you dont have to focus on themIf theres a pain in the leg just let it be in the legYou dont have to be down there in the leg with itYou can stay in any other part of the body where the breathing feels comfortable  thats your choiceAnd be careful not to tense up around the painRemember that the breath is a wholebody processWhen the breathing is comfortable the breath energy can go through all the nerves and right through any pain there may be so that you dont compound the pain by tensing up around itTry to develop a sense of wanting to be here of liking to be hereTry to make the breath your friendOften when youre meditating and things dont seem to be going well the object of your meditation seems to become your adversaryIts the hardest thing to focus on and it seems to keep wanting to slip awayBut thats not the case at allThats your own misperceptionIf you make friends with the breath its a lot easier to stay hereBeing friends means first trying to sense as precisely as possible what it really feels like as opposed to your preconceived notions of what it should feel like or where you should feel itIn other words listen to the breathAnd then second allow the breath to get more comfortableThese are basic principles in establishing any kind of friendship Listen to the other person allow the other person to feel at ease and at home and soon the other person will start opening upThe same with the breath The breath energy in the body has lots to offerOn the physical side it can relieve a lot of stress a lot of diseases associated with stressOn the mental side it can create a sense of ease and belonging here in the present moment so that you enjoy being right here just breathing in and breathing outWhen you get on more friendly terms with the breath and the breath becomes your friend then youre more inclined to want to stay to see what you can learn from the breathThats the first step in having the meditation go wellThere are actually four steps altogether  although maybe its better not to think of them as stepsThere are four component factors in the mental attitude you should bring to the meditation to make it go wellTheyre called bases of successThe first one is simply the desire to do the meditation wanting to do it being inclined to do itIf you find that your mind isnt inclined step back and reason with itThink of the importance of training the mindHere it is the major factor in your life and if its untrained its like giving your car over to a wild crazy person to driveYou have no idea where the crazy person is going to take that car whether hes going to run off the road and into somebody because you have no control over himIts the same with your mind  the mind that shapes your lifeIf you have no control over it you dont know where its going to take youSo as were meditating were trying to develop a measure of controlNot the sort of control of control freaks but the control of someone whos intelligent in knowing how to administer and manage things so that the mind feels happy to do what really should be doneThat requires mindfulness it requires alertnessAnd those are precisely the qualities were developing as we meditateThe mind is the chief producer of all the happiness and suffering we experience in the worldThats why when the Buddha gave his first sermon started out with the issue of sufferingThat he said is the big problem in lifeAnd its to be solved right here in the mind in the present moment because the suffering isnt something coming from outsideThe real problem in life is the suffering that comes from cravingAnd you cant work on craving until youre really mindful and alert and have the steady concentration that allows you to look at it calmly to see it in actionSo those are the qualities were developing as we meditate mindfulness alertness concentration the ability to see things clearly as the mind grows more stillSo even though we havent quite gotten there yet in our meditation at least were working in that directionAnd the more you sense the importance of these qualities the more you strengthen your desire to meditateOnce that desire is in place the next step is just to stick with itPersistence is the second base of successJust keep at your taskIf the mind slips off bring it backIf it slips off again just bring it back againIf it slips off ten times a hundred times bring it back ten times a hundred timesDont give upDont get discouragedRemember that this is a task that nobody else can do for youWe suffer in life because of our own lack of skill in dealing with sights and sounds and smells and tastes and ideas that come our wayAnd because its our own lack of skill were the ones who have to overcome that lack by developing more skillfulness in how we manage our mindsIf we dont do it nobody can do it for usAnd if we dont do it now when is it going to get doneAre you going to wait until youre olderThat doesnt helpOn the one hand even if you do live to a ripe old age the mind gets more and more difficult to train the older you getAnd then of course theres the question of whether or not youre going to live that longYouve got the opportunity to meditate now so go ahead and do itMake the most of it each moment you have the chanceThats persistenceThe third base of success is intentness You really focus on what youre doing you give it your full attentionIn the case of the breath this means noticing when its too long when its too short when its too heavy when its too lightThe more careful your attention the more sensitive you are  and the more you start to see hereYou also try to be attentive to the mindPay attention to what kind of breathing really helps the mind to settle down what kind of breathing doesntOnce you notice that you can make changesIn other words be observantWatch carefully whats happening and make adjustmentsThe more sensitive you are to whats going on the more youre going to see and at the same time the more the mind will be willing to settle downThe fourth base of success is vimamsa the one thats most difficult to translateIt covers the minds ability to discern its ability to be ingenious  in other words all the qualities of active intelligenceIf you see that something is not working in your meditation use your imagination to figure out another approach thatll get better resultsYou can make the breath deeper you can make it more shallow you can make it come in and out different spots in the bodyTheres a lot to play around with hereSometimes you have to use auxiliary meditation topics to help youIf youre having a problem with anger work on goodwill and equanimityThere are meditation topics that help foster those qualitiesIf youre having a problem with lust and desire contemplate the body in terms of its partsNotice that when youre attracted to a body its not the whole body youre attracted toIts only certain partsIf you took the whole body into your mind inside and out youd find it really difficult to get attracted to itIf youre feeling lazy you can start thinking about deathAs I said earlier you have no idea how much longer youre going to liveThe only thing thats for sure is that youve got this opportunity right now so take advantage of itThese are ways of thinking that get the mind directed back to its workTheyre ways of using your powers of intelligence your powers of ingenuity to see what works to bring the mind to the present momentOnce youve got it there you can focus on the breath againTreat the breath as home base and other topics simply as means of bringing you home when youve wandered off courseWhen youve got all these qualities together  your desire to meditate your persistence intentness and your powers of ingenuity and intelligence  you find that the meditation grows it developsIt starts showing resultsNotice that desire does have a role in thisSometimes people say that when you meditate you shouldnt have any desires  you should just be in the present moment allowing whatever comes up to come without any idea of progress at allThe Buddha never taught meditation that wayAt allThe whole point of the practice is that it is a path it goes someplaceThat someplace is right here into the present moment but there is progress in terms of what you see develop and abandon here in the present momentAnd desire does play a role in that seeing developing and abandoning  as do all the other qualities intentness persistence ingenuity the minds ability to see what works and what doesnt workIts simply a matter of learning how to use these mental qualities in a way thats helpfulLike desire Weve all had the experience of focusing on the goals we want in our meditation and then discovering that our desire gets in the wayWell the solution is not to drop the desire its to learn how to focus the desire in a way thats more usefulFocus on the causes that are going to get you thereThink of yourself as driving to a mountain on the horizonIf you spend all your time focusing on the mountain youre going to drive off the roadSo what do you doYou dont give up your desire to go to the mountainYou stay focused on the roadEvery now and then you glance up to make sure that youre headed in the direction of the mountain and that the mountain hasnt appeared in your rearview mirrorBut your main focus should be on what youre doing right nowOnce you focus your desire here make your desire more mindful more alert  not in a general sense but more precisely mindful right now more precisely alert right nowAnd then the next moment and then the nextTry to focus your desire on making the practice continuousAs I said the problem is not getting in position its staying in positionThats what youve got to work with hereAnd you do that by being mindful of the breath alert to the breath more continuallyOnce you focus your desire properly it becomes an aid to the meditation and not an obstacleThe same goes for the other qualitiesSometimes your effort can push push push so hard that it gets in the way of any kind of progressSo step backThen it doesnt become a matter of not pushing you just learn where to push  what things to push what things to let beIn other words you take these four bases for success and refine themYou learn through experience how to master them as aids to the meditationSometimes ingenuity or thinking processes can get carried away as you get too abstract in analyzing thingsWhen that happens step back and be ingenious about what youre doing right nowAnalyze what youre doing right now what the results areDont go beyond whats happening right now what youre doing right nowThat way these qualities become focused they become a part of the meditationThey help your meditation succeedOrdinarily we dont like to think in terms of success in meditationTheres so much pressure to succeed in the material area that we dont want to hear about standards for success in the area of the DhammaBut if youre serious about putting an end to suffering the issue of success is something you cant avoidWhen you approach the meditation skillfully you get resultsYour efforts have succeededTheyre actually accomplished somethingThats the whole pointSo if you find that things arent working in the meditation its because one of these qualities isnt properly focusedEither your desire to be with the breath is flagging or youre not being as consistently persistent breath after breath after breath or youre not really paying attention  youre just going through the motions or youre not using your analytical powers to see whats wrong what could be changed if something has to be changed or see where youre trying to push change too muchUse your powers of analysis to watch over all four of these qualities  to see whats unbalanced whats unfocused  and then figure out how to put things into shapeOnce youve got these qualities working together on the meditation there will have to be progressThere are no two ways about itIn Thailand they like to take these qualities as a guide to how you progress in anything how you succeed in anythingTo succeed in school to succeed in business you need the desire to succeed you need to be persistent to be intent to use your powers of analysis and ingenuityIf you apply those qualities to any task youre sure to succeedAnd what do you succeed in hereYou succeed in putting an end to the suffering youve been causing yourself unnecessarilyYou succeed in realizing the DeathlessAnd you do it by developing more alertness developing more mindfulnessYou do it with this simple process of focusing on the breath being sensitive to the breath exploring the way the breath is moving in the present momentAll the good things in the mind build on thisFocus on your breathAnd as for whats going to happen when you focus on the breath put that thought asideAnd where the meditation is going to take you and how its going to take you there Put those thoughts aside as wellBe careful not to anticipate too much because when you know too much in advance its not really knowingA lot of it is guessworkA lot of our preconceived notions come from ignoranceThats precisely what were trying to get rid of and yet our ignorance shapes the way we practiceSo when you meditate its important to clear away as many of those expectations as possibleJust be with the breath When the breath comes in know its going in when its going out know its going outThats all you really have to know right nowAs for whats going to happen with the next breath or the one after that wait until those breaths comeAjaan Fuang once noted that we now have lots of books on meditation lots of explanations and in some ways its a help but in other ways its a hindrance  a hindrance in that many of our perceptions and memories picked up from books and Dhamma talks clutter up the present momentThey actually get in the way of seeing whats going onAnd this gets compounded with our general impatience We want to see results fast and in order to make them happen fast we squeeze them too much in the direction we think theyre supposed to goBut a lot of the genuine results of the meditation have to come from simply allowing the causes to do their work to develop on their own without your having to push them too much in any particular directionSo if you see your thoughts leaning into the next moment or whats going to happen further on in the future just pull back to stay balanced right here right nowLook after the causes and the results will take care of themselvesAs Ajaan Lee often advises in his talks start out smallNotice where you feel the breath and then watch itIf it doesnt seem comfortable you can nudge it into what seems to be a more comfortable directionDont be in too great of a hurry to go on to the next step because we want to come from a position of strength of real knowledge as we meditateTheres a passage in the Canon where the Buddha says that a person who doesnt have a basic level of happiness and inner goodness simply cannot do goodnessSounds like a Catch but thats not the pointThe point is we all have a certain amount of goodness in our minds and so we should tap into that firstThe goodness here not only means good intentions but also a goodnatured attitude toward what youre doing a goodnatured attitude toward the people around youThats why we recite that chant on goodwill every nightYou have to bring a certain level of humor to the practice the humor that allows you to laugh at your mistakes without getting bitterWhen you get bitter you start lashing out at people around youYou start criticizing the techniques  there are all kinds of things you can criticizeBut if you can sit back for a minute and tap into your own basic goodnatured attitude  and its there inside all of us  try to bring that to the fore and then work from thatIt may be a small thing but youve got to start smallStart with what you knowThe breath is coming inYou know thatYes you know thatIts going outYou know thatYes you doOkay know just that muchDont forget thatIs it comfortable or notWell you may not be sureCould it be more comfortableExperiment and seeTry to sensitize yourself to how the breathing feelsWithout this level of sensitivity the meditation becomes mechanicalWhen its mechanical it becomes a choreAnd when its a chore the mind will rebelSo ask yourself What really feels good when youre breathing right nowIf you cant figure out what really feels good hold your breath for a while until the mind comes to the point where its screaming at you BreatheYouve got to breathe Then when you breathe notice what feels really good as you breathe inTake that as a guideWe in the West seem to be especially cut off from our own bodiesWere so much in our heads that the area of the body becomes unexplored territory like those old maps from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that would show distorted coastlines of continents with big blank spaces in the middleHere be tygers they would sayWho knew what was in thereIts the same with the body We know a little bit about it but there are huge unexplored areas insideSo take as your beachhead this one point where you know the breath is coming inYou know the breath is coming outYou know whether its comfortable or not and you begin to get a sense of what adjustments can be made to make it more comfortable  so that it feels really good just breathing in and out right thereAs for the other steps in the meditation put them aside for the time beingMake sure youve got this step well under controlThe people who try to take on too much at once are the ones who end up not mastering anything at allEven if your progress is incremental at least its progressYoure building solidly on a solid foundationThats what mattersOtherwise the meditation is like a ladder that you lean up against an unstable wall You may be able to climb very high but when the wall falls down youre going to be in really bad straitsTry to build step by step on a solid staircaseBuild on what you really knowAs for what youve heard about how the meditation is supposed to develop  even if youve had experiences in the past when its developed in interesting ways  put all that aside for the time beingDont let it clutter up your mind because any progress in the meditation has to come from being very solidly focused on the present moment fully intent on what youve got right hereIf a lot of expectations are cluttering up your view youre not going to see what youve got right hereWhatever progress you make wont be genuineSo as Ajaan Lee says be willing to be dumb about the meditationSometimes this is called beginners mind but for me its always been more effective to think Be dumb about it The dumb person is the one who sees when the emperor isnt wearing any clothesYou may have heard a lot about meditation but how much do you really knowYou do know right now that the breath is coming in you know its going outYou know if your mind is with the breath or if its wandered offFocus on being really clear about what you know what youre directly experiencing as continuously as possibleThe continual clarity is what actually creates the state of concentration youre looking for the developed mindfulness youre hoping forIt starts with these incremental stepsSo whether the results come fast or slow be sure that at least youre getting the causes rightAnd theyre simple Be with the breath all the way in all the way outJust this breathAnd if the breath is uncomfortable you can adjust itYoure not required to breathe in a particular way and youre not required to refrain from influencing the breathThe mind is always going to have some influence on the breath whether its conscious or not so it might as well be consciousIf you pretend that youre not influencing the breath the influence goes undergroundIts better to learn how to be open about the fact to be sensitive to whats going onAnd this simple exercise if you allow it to do its work will bring the results you wantIn fact it will bring results better than you might expectIf you clutter up your meditation with your expectations thats all youll get things that seem to fit in with your expectationsBut if you allow it to be a little bit more openended you create possibilities for other things to happen as well  often better things more genuineSo have faith in the processIf youve got the causes right the results have to comeEven though what youre doing right here may seem a small thing remember All the great things in the world had to start out smallCoastal redwoods the tallest trees in the world come from the tiniest imaginable seedsSo even though the seed may be small dont underestimate its potentialThis spot where youre with the breath may seem to be a small thing but as you get down into it you find that theres a lot thereIn fact the Buddhas whole teachings on causality have one big consistent point that whatevers happening in the universe the basic pattern is something you can discern right here in the present momentIn chaos theory they call this scale invariance the patterns on the large scale on the macro scale are the same things happening on the micro scaleAnd youve got the micro scale right hereOn the macro scale you see that even scientific theories keep changing  sometimes very fastTheyre not anything you can directly observe for theyre based on so many assumptionsBut on the micro scale right here in the present moment with your mind on the breath all the basic processes youre going to have to know for Awakening are occurring right hereIts simply a matter of getting more and more sensitive right hereSo even though it may seem like a small spot its got a lot of potentialIts like those seeds they have in Thailand  Ive forgotten the name of the plant but it has a seed with the diameter of a quarterIf you break the shell and stick it into about three or four gallons of water and come back a few hours later it turns out that these little noodlelike strands inside the seed which were sitting there waiting to soak up water now fill your entire three or fourgallon containerThis small spot in the present moment is like that Theres a lot to tease out in hereSo dont be disdainful of its potentialLearn to start out small and those small things are going to reward youLike the old fable of the mouse and the lion The lion saved the mouses life and later on the mouse was able to save the lions life even though the lion originally was pretty disdainful of what the mouse claimed it would be able to doBut it could it could eat right through the net in which the lion was trappedAnd so this little present moment youve got here Dont step up on it hoping that youre going to get someplace higherFocus right hereReally give it a chance to open upWhether it opens up fast or slow  thats not the issueThe issue is that you give it the space you give it the time youre patient enough and watchful enough to allow it to openAnd someday it will eat through the net in which you keep catching yourselfWhen we say that big things grow from small things its not that they have to grow in such a way that other people might noticeIts just that whats there in the present moment becomes a lot clearerThe intricacies of what are going on right here play out in a much larger perspective  if you give them the time to developSo start out smallIf you have to be small for a long time that doesnt matterWhat matters is that the progress when it comes is solidThe breath is where the mind and the body meetWe often have a sense that the solid part of our bodies is the part we know best the part we inhabit and the breath is something that just comes in and goes out through the solid part were inhabitingBut when you close your eyes what do you actually sense of the bodyTheres a shape defined by the area where theres energy flowing back and forthAnd that energy is actually our most direct perception of the bodyWe tend to overlook it and focus on other things but our primary sensation is right hereIts breathAs we meditate were learning to get back in touch with that primary sensation so that eventually we can use it as a mirror for the mindBecause as I said its where the mind and the body meetIts the part of the body the mind is most sensitive to the part most immediately responsive to the mindThe way you breathe is very much affected by the states of your mindWhen youre worried you breathe in a certain wayWhen youre happy you breathe in another wayWhen theres anger theres still another way of breathingIf you keep at certain ways of breathing its going to have an effect on other aspects of the body as wellCertain ways you hold your body are really shaped by the breathAnd its through the breath that so many mental states can cause physical disease particularly diseases related to stressSo one of the first things you have to do as you meditate is to work through the breath energy in the bodyFind a spot where the breathing feels comfortableIt might be at the tip of the nose the middle of the chest around the abdomen the base of the throatActually it can be anywhere in the body where you feel that the sensation of inbreathing feels good and the sensation of outbreathing feels goodThen you train yourself to stay with that sensationIn the beginning the sensation may not be all that impressive  just a simple comfortable feeling sometimes a neutral feeling  but you find that if you stick with it it gets more and more relaxing more and more comfortableLike a fireIn the beginning a fire starts as just a tiny little spark that you have to shelter against the windIt takes a long time for the fuel to catch fire but once it does the fire begins to spread to the different parts of the fuelIts the same with the body and the breathYou find one spot that seems small and not all that impressive but it feels okayThen you stay with it and the consistency of your attention  as you keep that spot relaxed without pushing it or pulling it or putting any pressure on it  is what allows it to develop a sense of fullnessThe longer you stick with it the more the fullness gains strengthOnce its more solidly established you can start allowing it to spread to different parts of the bodyThe word jhana or concentrated mental absorption is related to a verb jhayati that means to burn Pali has lots of different words for the word burning and jhayati is used to describe a steady flame like the flame of an oil lampThe words for burning used for other types of fire  like a raging bonfire a wood fire or a forest fire  are something else entirelyThe word for a steady constant flame Thats jhayati which relates to jhanaAnd as we practice concentration thats the kind of consistency and steadiness were trying to developOur focus starts as a small steady flame and then you try to allow the steadiness to flow through the bodyBut first you have to establish that comfortable spotIf you go around the body adjusting the breath here adjusting the breath there without a real sense of comfort then you can make things worseYoure just messing things upSo its important that you get this sense of ease first and then allow things to spread from there so that your awareness fills the whole body and your sense of comfortable breath energy fills the whole body as wellThink of it as a healing processMany times as soon as the mind gets a little bit still and the breath gets comfortable you think Well whats next But before you can move to whats next a lot of healing has to be done in the body  all the areas of tension and tightness and discomfort that youve allowed to take hold in the bodyThe breath has to very gently massage them very gently heal them and sometimes this takes timeJust like a woundYou cant just say Poof and its goneYou have to put the medicine on and let it stay there for hoursIn the same way the process of healing your inner energy field takes time so be patient with the breathWhen things get still stay with itAnd even though things may not seem to be happening theres a slow steady process of healing going on in the bodyThis is why patience is such an important part of this skillWhen they talk about putting an effort into the meditation the word for effort really means persistenceIts this sticktoittivedness thats going to make all the differenceThe continuity of your focus the steadiness of your persistence Those are the qualities that make the breath a solid foundation for the mindOne of the problems in teaching meditation to people in America is that very few of us have learned any skills requiring that kind of steadiness that kind of patienceHere when you sharpen a knife you just run it through the knife sharpener  zip zip  and its doneOver in Thailand though when I had to sharpen a knife I was given a big stone and a knife and told Okay be very careful not to be in too great of a hurry because if you get impatient you may ruin the blade So you have to be very consistent very steady and very patient as you work the blade over the whetstoneAs you do this you learn all the mental skills that go along with being patient how not to get bored how not to give up the kind of conversation in the mind that helps keep it goingIf you have any skills like that think back on how youve talked yourself into being patient consistent persistent and then apply those skills to the breathSo work with a sense of comfortable breathAllow the breath to get comfortable allow it to be easeful and then allow it to spread through the bodyWhen it begins to spread through the body and it starts working through patterns of tension you come to a more intense sense of absorptionStay with thatLearn the skills required to stay right at that point of balance where youre not pushing it too hard and not being too lazy or lax  just the right amount of interest the right amount of attention and intention to keep things going  so that the breath can have a chance to heal the wounds in the body soothe the mind and bring both the body and the mind to the stages of practice where the concentration gets stronger and the insights sharper more subtleThis all depends on the groundworkAs for the question of how soon you can move on to the next step Dont askJust keep on doing the workThings will developIts like waiting for a plant to grow You cant sit there and pull it up up up to make it grow fasterIf you do that you uproot it and thats the end of the plantWhat you have to do is just keep watering it applying fertilizer removing the weeds as they come and your patient effort will pay off as long as you focus that effort in the right spot which is the persistence the attention and the intention youre bringing to the breathAs long as these are consistent you can expect resultsWhether those results are fast or slow doesnt matterWhat matters is that theyre solidSo stick with itWeve got a whole hour right now to be with the breath  and dont stop with the end of the hourTry to maintain that sense of ease and comfort that sense of being centered inside as you bow down get up and leave go back to your meditation spot and continue meditating until its time to go to bedWhen you wake up tomorrow morning try to be right here again right here at the breathThis consistency is what makes all the differenceGetting into position to meditate isnt all that hardFirst you get your body into position your back straight your head facing straight forward your eyes closed your hands in your lapThen you get your mind into position Just focus it on the breathThe breath is right hereYou dont have to search around too much to find itThe difficult part lies in keeping the mind in position trying to maintain a steady awarenessThat takes some doing because the mind is used to not being steadyIts used to jumping aroundIt has a sense of there being some entertainment value in jumping aroundYou get bored with one thing so you jump to something newAnd for a lot of people thats where their freedom lies in their ability to think about anything they want toBut when you come right down to it how much happiness comes from jumping around like thatOnce you jump from one thing you know youre going to have to jump to another thing and then to anotherSo no matter where you land you start finding yourself immediately tensing up ready to jump again which leaves the mind constantly in a state of tensionSo when we meditate we give it a good solid place to stay and then we remind it You can stay thereYou dont have to jumpThat way the mind can begin to relax a lot of its tension and can actually dissolve into the object of the meditationWhen you focus on the breath you want to become one with the breathWhen you focus on the body let your awareness become one with the body  not an awareness ready to jump someplace else but an awareness that seeps into the body saturating everything down to your fingers and toesThe steadiness of your gaze is whats going to help things seep into one another to come together here in the present momentSo as you stay with the breath try to keep your gaze  your focus on the breath  as steady as you can as continuous as you canThe more continual your focus the more you see how things are actually connected actually related to one anotherIf your gaze isnt steady you end up connecting things in your imaginationIts like playing connectthedots with your mindTheres a little bit of awareness here and another little bit of awareness there and then someplace else and as for what was happening in between youre not really sureBut you can guess so you draw your own lines to turn the dots into a duck or an airplaneAnd whether those lines actually correspond to reality or not whether the dots were parts of a duck or an airplane or something else entirely you dont really know because you werent thereYou were off someplace elseThis is the way most peoples knowledge of the world gets built up Its a game of connectthedots with very few dots and a lot of linesSo when we meditate we try to erase all the imaginary lines and make the awareness itself the line that connects thingsThe Buddha gained Awakening because he saw cause and effect and how they are connectedWhen this is that isFrom the arising of this comes the arising of thatThats how he described one of the central insights in his AwakeningHe directly saw these things as they were connected and that was because his awareness was connectedSo we stay with the breath as a way of developing this continuous connected steady awarenessIf you find yourself letting up in your focus just come right backIn the beginning our awareness is like the phrases in music Theres a phrase and then a pause another phrase and then a pauseBut what you want to do as you meditate is to develop an awareness that doesnt come in phrases and pauses that just keeps going going going just as the breath keeps goingThere may be a rhythm to the breathing but underneath the inandout breath is another level of breath energy thats continually thereIts like a background noise in the bodyAnd to make your awareness continuous thats what you want to focus on this background energySometimes you notice it as the energy in the body during the pauses between the inbreath and the outbreath and between the outbreath and the inbreathTheres a slight pause in the breathing and yet theres still energy in the body that lets you know that the bodys sitting hereIt doesnt totally dissolve awayThe more you tune in to this more subtle level of energy the less you need the inandout breath as your focusThe inandout breath becomes just one aspect of a larger field of breath energy that begins to grow more and more calm more and more calm because youre down on another levelYouve tuned in to another level thats more continuous that can be used as a basis for insightWhen your awareness is continuous and the breath is continuous you just stay there togetherThats what were working towardSo try to be sensitive to even the slightest lapse in your awarenessDont wait until the mind has already left the breath before you register whats happenedSometimes you feel a stirring in your awarenessSomething wants to moveThings arent as interesting as they were or for some reason or another the mind begins to let up a little bit before it actually moves on to something elseLearn how to detect thatThen work with the breath work with your focus in a way that can get around that tendency to stir a little bit and move onThis is why its so important that the breath be comfortableThe more comfortable it is the easier it is to stay with itOnce its comfortable then you have to watch out for the minds tendency to lose its focus lose its sharpnessThats why we work with spreading the breath energy through the body being aware of the different parts of the body as a way of keeping ourselves awake and alert even though things are getting comfortable  because when we meditate were here to do work not just to zone out or have a little stress reductionThe reason weve reduced the stress and made the mind more comfortable in the present moment is because its got work to do in the present momentThere are things its got to figure outIts got to figure out why its causing suffering exactly where its causing sufferingThe Buddha emphasized the issue of karma and intention so we look to see What intentions are there in the mind that make us sufferWhy dont we see themWhy do we feel that those choices are so necessary that we even forget theyre choicesThese are some of the big questions weve got to figure outAnd the only way to figure them out is to stay right here continually because those choices are usually made in the gaps in the seams in our awareness when were off someplace elseIn fact when theres a seam or a gap in your awareness its usually a sign that a choice is going to be made in the mindIts the minds way of fooling itself of hiding all of its choices behind the curtainsSo when you sense that tendency to want to leave remember Something importants coming upIf youre not here to see it youre going to miss itDont follow the same old pattern that youve followed who knows how many times letting the mind hide important things from itselfWhy is it hidingWell look into itWhat is it embarrassed aboutWhat is it ashamed to show itselfWhat is it trying to denyWhen youre operating from a sense of steady comfort then its easier to look into those issues and not run awaySo this issue of steadiness is very importantIt allows you to see things that you otherwise wouldnt seeIt plows right through the gaps in your awareness in which the mind hides things from itself and it zeros in on the big issues in the mind Why is the mind causing itself sufferingWhy is it causing itself stress in ways that dont have to be thereIn the context of the Three Characteristics the Buddha does point out that anything fabricated is stressful but in the Four Noble Truths he focuses more on the issue of the stress of clinging and cravingThe craving causes the clinging and the clinging to the five aggregates is his basic definition of stress and sufferingThats what weve go to work on because thats the part of stress and suffering thats not necessaryOnce its taken care of then the other stresses in the world are not an issue at allSo what is this clingingWhat is this cravingHow and why do we hide it from ourselvesHow can we learn to see through itIgnorance is what allows these things to happen in the mind and the only way to combat ignorance is to be as steady and consistent as possible in maintaining your awarenessWhat this means is that being steady in your awareness is not just a matter of concentration practiceIts the basis for allowing discernment to arise  because youre right here and when youre right here watching whats happening you cant help but seeThe problem is were all too often not hereOur gaze has been divertedOur attention has slipped off someplace elseSo keep zeroing in on the breath zeroing in on the breathDont let anything else pull your attention awayTry to stay with each breathIf its too much to think about staying here for the full hour stay with this breath and then this breathIn fact if you start thinking too far ahead youre going to miss this breath and youre going to miss the point where the mind slips offBut if you keep things small keep things manageable you do a lot better jobSo this breath this breath this breathAnd as for your past breaths  well for one thing theyre not here anymore and whether you were able to stay with them or not doesnt matter any moreWhat matters right now is this breathSimilarly breaths in the future are not here for you to look at eitherYou cant be responsible now for whether youre going to stay with them thenYou will be responsible then if you learn how to be responsible nowSo take it one step at a timeEven when the meditation is not especially easy or pleasant taking it one step at a time makes it a lot more manageableIn other words if the breath doesnt seem all that enthralling or absorbing and theres a pain here or a pain there its a lot easier to take it one step at a timeBack when I was in Thailand I had a fairly long alms round and there were days when the rain was just pouring down in bucketsThere was no way I was not going to get wet even though I had a big umbrellaThe wind would blow the rain would come from all sidesAnd when I thought about the whole hour and a half I was going to be out there slogging through mud it was difficult to get up the energy just to take the first stepBut then I realized of course that if I didnt go on my alms round I wouldnt get to eat that daySo I took it one step at a time this step this step this stepYoud be surprised how quickly  when you take it one step at a time  that hour and a half goes how manageable it is even when its raining hardYoure not weighing yourself down with the past or future with how many steps youve taken or how many minutes youve been out on the road and how much longer its going to be before you get back to a place thats dryYoure right here right here right hereAnd you find that right here is okay its manageableIt may not be the most wonderful moment but at least its manageableThis principle can help carry you through a lotWhen youre dealing with pain often the pain gets really bad  not so much because the actual physical sensation is bad but because youre weighing yourself down with thoughts about how long the pain has been going on and how much longer its going to go on in the futureAnd so all that past and all that future weigh down this one little moment here in the present No wonder the present buckles under the weightBut if all the present has to support is just this one moment you find that its capableIt can stand up to whatever weight there is in the momentSo the ability to focus exclusively on whats happening right here right now is a very useful skillBut its not the only skill we have to develop while meditatingSome people want to make the whole meditation just that being in the present momentBut thats only one of the skills we need to developTheres also the skill of how to make the present moment a pleasant place to beAnd that requires some memory of the past whats worked in the past what hasnt worked in the pastThats called the skillful use of the pastJust as theres a skillful use of the future  having a sense that this practice is going someplace theres a direction to it its going to take you to total freedomAnd as you work on your skills its not always going to be a story of stumbling along and falling down having to pick yourself up dust yourself off walk a few more steps and stumble againIts not always going to be that wayThere comes a time when you really get into the breath and you begin to notice patternsIf you had no memory of the past and no sense of the future you wouldnt be able to see patterns  the patterns in what youve done the results that come when you do itThat requires using the past skillfullySome of your actions will have results in the immediate present but some of them will take time to show their resultsIf you dont have that sense of mindfulness  which is what this memory of the past is mindfulness  if you dont have that mindfulness you cant learn any lessonsAnd although each present moment may be a wonderful new beginners moment still you dont learn anything from itYour progress gets shortcircuited right thereSo an important skill in the meditation is how to make skillful use of the past skillful use of the futureThe Buddha outlined this in his teachings to the Kalamas and also in his teachings to his son RahulaNotice the intention behind what you do watch what youre doing while youre doing it and then watch for the resultsSee the connections between the type of intention and the type of results you get either immediately or over timeThats the skillful use of the pastUnskillful use of the past is when you run back to either getting happy or sad about how things were in the pastUnskillful use of the future is when you start anticipating either with desire or aversion or fear whats going to happen in the futureThe one fear that is useful is the fear of the consequences of unskillful actionsThats what keeps you on the path in the presentAnother skillful use of the future is your anticipation of how good its going to be when you finally master thisBut still theres no way youre going to get there unless you follow the stepsSo learn to recognize when your mind is referring you to the past or the future What are skillful ways of bringing in the past or the future and what are unskillful waysSometimes a skillful recollection say of the future could be Death could come at any timeAre you ready to goIf youre not  well what are you doing right now to prepare yourself Thats using the future as a spurSo when you realize that the past and the future do have their uses you give more dimension to the practiceIf this were just a practice of staying in the present moment we could all go out and have frontal lobotomies and that would take care of itBut it doesnt work that wayYou need some sense of the pastYou have to be observant and remember what worked and didnt work in the past and then see how those lessons apply to the present momentSometimes you have to relearn a lesson or adjust a past lesson because what seemed to work in the past may not be working this timeThat simply means you have to be even more observant of whats going onIt doesnt mean you totally throw out the pastIt means you take your knowledge and adjust it you make it more refinedAnd this is how the practice develops as you build on your past mistakes  and on your past successes as wellSo remember that theres more dimension to the practice than just simply the present momentBut the skill of staying in the present moment is one of the more difficult ones to learn which is why we emphasize it so muchAfter all where are you going to observe things if youre not really observant of the present momentIf the lessons you learned in the past arent working maybe you werent really observant thenThis is a chance to get more observant more precise with each and every breathLearn at which part of the breath cycle you tend to lose your focusFor some people its between the inbreath and the outbreath or between the outbreath and the inSometimes its when a particular breath is uncomfortable You dont like it you move offSo learn to watch for any tightness or tension that may appear in the breathWatch out for the tendency to lose focus in between the breathsSee what you can do to counteract those tendenciesAsk yourself how you recognize the point where the outbreath turns into an inbreathIn some cases its very subtleAnd we have a tendency when were trying to create a boundary line like that to make it more clearly drawn than it really has to beSo watch for that tendency as well because it creates a lot of unnecessary blockage and tensionTry to be with the whole cycle of each breath all the way through as precisely as you canThen at the end of the meditation you can stop and reflect on what you did what lessons you learnedSome lessons are immediately obviousYou do something you immediately get good or bad resultsWith those lessons you dont have to reflect too much on the past theyre right thereOther lessons you learn by reflecting on say a bad session What are you doingWhy isnt it going wellWhen you have good sessions reflect on those after youre done What did you doHow did you focus the mindTake that lesson and file it away for future referenceYou may when you pull it out from your mental filing cabinet discover that it wasnt quite as precisely observed as you might wantBut you have lots of breaths to watch lots of opportunities to relearn your lessonsSo this is an incremental path a gradual one but theres nothing wrong with thatFortunately Theravada never had a Shenhui the Rush Limbaugh of the Chan tradition with his sudden Awakening buzz saw who viciously ridiculed every hint of a gradual path every hint of a developing skill as being an obstacle to AwakeningIt got so that nobody in the Chan tradition after that dared talk about methods or progressFortunately Theravada doesnt have that problemIn fact its problem goes the other wayTheres a passage in the Udana where the Buddha compares the practice to the continental shelf off of India a gradual slope and then a sudden dropThe commentaries reinterpreted that to mean totally gradual without any sudden dropBut the Pali obviously says there is a sudden dropSo the gradual slope does take you in the right directionWithout the gradual slope you wouldnt get to the sudden dropWithout the sudden drop the gradual slope wouldnt have any real meaning in terms of opening up to something really newBut the way causality works there is the opportunity for making gradual very precise observations about your breath getting more and more skillful as you learn over timeThen you finally hit the point where it all breaks open in unexpected waysIn this way the path is both gradual and suddenSo as youre working on each breath each breath each breath remember that youre on a path that can take a long time but every journey requires individual stepsThis is why the Buddha called it a pathIf it werent a path it wouldnt have any directionBut it does have a direction and the gradual steps are good steps to takeNot all the good things are saved to the endBut ultimately  as you get more and more precisely in the present moment with more skill the skill that youve learned from the past  those gradual steps suddenly open up to something totally OtherAnd its all found by looking right here you dont have to look anywhere elseThis is one of the amazing things about the Buddhas teachings All the great lessons we have to learn are right hereWe dont have to speculate about some event way back at the beginning of the universe  thats not relevantWe dont have to pin our hopes on a judgment day at the end of the universe  thats not relevant eitherThe relevant things are what we can see for ourselves right here right nowThings change Well how do they changeIs there a pattern to their changeWatch right here and youll find outWatch in a way that grows more precise over time by learning how to make skillful use not only of the present but also of your memories and your anticipation of where you want this to lead you in futureLearn to use these things properly and they all become part of the pathConcentration practice involves workWe often think of it as a place for the mind to rest and it is but its even more a place for the mind to recharge its batteriesThat requires energy requires effort requires workIn Thailand the idiom for meditation is to make an effort And in meditating there very definitely are things we have to doIts not just a letting go of the tension a letting go of the stresses of daily lifeTheres also work to be done to keep mindfulness continuous to keep your alertness continuous and allaround to keep both mindfulness and alertness spinning around inside here like a generatorA generator sits in one place but it has to spin around to create electric powerIf the generator simply sits still it cant create anythingThere has to be some activity for the electrons to run in a currentThe same is true with concentrationThe two causes for gaining a sense of ease and wellbeing are directed thought and evaluationDirected thought grows out of mindfulness evaluation out of alertnessYou have to keep directing your thoughts to the breath keep evaluating it noticing when its comfortable noticing when its notAnd then theres singleness of preoccupation You try to keep the mind at one with its object make it become one with its objectAll of this takes effort and sometimes people will sit in meditation put a lot of effort into it and at the end of the period say Well the meditation didnt get any resultsIt was just constant effort However its a normal principle in practicing concentration that it requires effort before it can start giving resultsThe effort is never wastedOver time you begin to get a sense of how much effort is too much how much is too littleWhen you get a sense of just right the results you want start appearingAt that point the payoff comes as youre doing the workYou dont have to wait until the end of the year before your paycheck arrivesYou receive installments all along the waySo as youre doing the meditation work keep this point in mind It is work but as you get more precise at it more subtle at it the results youre looking for will start to appearAjaan Lee talks about concentration work being basically three activities  directed thought evaluation and singleness of preoccupation  with all three spinning around in one placeWhen you start being very precise in doing them they start showing their resultsIn other words you keep reminding yourself to stay with the breathIf you notice that the mind is wandering off you immediately get it back on trackTry to sense when the mind is preparing to go even before it actually goesThat way you can nip the distractions in the budAnd try to be as alert as possible to how the breathing feelsTry to make it feel refreshingThis way the work becomes something you can easily keep on doing because you feel refreshed in doing your workSitting here it feels good breathing in feels good breathing outOrdinarily large areas of the body are starved for breathing energy so give them a chance to drink it in to bathe in itThink of the energy going to the different parts of the body  Who wants this breathWho wants the next one  until youve got the whole body nourishedIf it feels good do it againNext time around try to be even more perceptive as to whats going on whats needed whereAs for singleness of preoccupation make sure the mind doesnt lose itself doesnt start wandering off in other directions getting distractedAnd watch out for the hindrances because they drain your energyEven though you may be generating a lot of power here if the hindrances get in the way everything gets drained awayLike the solar electric system here at Wat Metta When we were first setting up the batteries we were careless and put them on a couple of boards on the groundWell sure enough a rain storm cameOne of the wires shorted and by the next day the batteries were totally deadEven though the solar panels were pumping out energy the batteries were so dead you couldnt revive themThe same holds true in the meditation If you keep coming back to the breath but then allow the mind to go wandering off in other directions then all the power all the recharging in your batteries just gets drained awaySo youve got to be careful not to go thinking about anything else while youre here with the breathingWhen thoughts about other things do come passing through you dont want to get involved in themJust let them go let them goPart of the problem is that you get curious Whats this thought aboutWhats that thought aboutMaybe its something important maybe its something entertaining Watch out for those attitudes because thats like opening the door for thieves to come into your house or like scraping away the insulation on your wires before the rats doSo as soon as a thought thats not related to the breath comes into the mind just let it goAnd there are certain ways of thinking about the breath or the meditation that actually get in the way of the meditation too so youve got to watch out for them as wellThe big troublemakers are restlessness and anxietyRestlessness is wanting to push for results before the mind is really ready to give them trying to figure out things beforehand before youve actually done the concentration workYouve got to do the work first and let the results develop on their ownAjaan Lee gives the example of getting gold out of a rockYou cant just go to the mountain and use a pick to extract the goldYouve got to take the rock and subject it to heatThe fire will take time getting hot enough so that it can melt the gold but when it reaches the melting point the gold will all come out on its ownIn other words when your powers of concentration are strong enough when they reach the point where theyre ready then the work of discernment gets a lot easierThings separate out right before your very eyes without your having to do an awful lot of analysisWhen the mind has been concentrated long enough and solidly enough you just pose a question and things will appear very clearly for youve created the environment in which they can appear clearly in that the mind is solid and stillAs for anxiety one of the standard definitions is concern about what other people thinkWhats this person going to thinkWhats that person going to thinkIf what I know is right offends people what am I going to doDo I dare do it That kind of anxiety really gets in the way of your goodnessIf you let yourself get led astray by those thoughts in your daily life its very hard not to get led astray while youre meditatingOne of the things I really appreciated about Ajaan Fuang was that he really didnt care what other people thoughtIf he knew that what he was doing was right then even if it was unpopular he went ahead with it because he realized that theres no way you can control other peoples attitudes toward youIf they want to think ill of you well thats their rightAnd ultimately where does popularity get youNot very farIt certainly doesnt get you very far on the pathI also noticed that Ajaan Fuang didnt trust people who were concerned about being popularThere was an interesting exchange once when he was going to appoint one of the merchants in town to be the monastery treasurerThe first question he asked the man was In your future life would you rather be popular or wealthy And the man said WealthyIf youre wealthy you can buy popularity So Ajaan Fuang appointed him treasurerHe liked the idea that the man was not all that concerned about being popularIf the treasurer was concerned about being popular you couldnt trust himHe might be afraid to do the right thing when push came to shove and certain people wanted to get their hands on the monastery fundsSo its important to keep this attitude in mind when you know that something is right Dont worry about whether its popular dont let yourself be swayed by public opinionOf course this means that you have to be very careful about what you see as rightIn other words you let yourself be swayed by advice from wise people from people you respectBut as for people in general whose opinions dont have any real principles you dont have to worry about what they thinkNo matter what they can do to you they cant touch the most important part of you which is your own inner integrityThis is how the practice requires courageConviction in the principle of karma requires that you make a commitment not to hedge your betsYoure going to depend totally on the skillfulness of your own intentions to whatever extent you can develop that skillfulnessThats the principle to which you have to devote yourselfAs for other principles or lack of principles let them goSometimes this feels a little scaryYoure so used to hedging your bets so that at least youre popular at least youve got connections so that if the principle of karma doesnt work out youve got something else to fall back onBut to be really committed to the principle of karma to get the best results from it you have to be committedAnd to be really committed requires repeated acts of commitmentThis is why in the Forest tradition so much emphasis is placed on the virtue of courageNot foolhardiness but courageIt takes a certain amount of courage to keep the mind centered and still because otherwise were always trying to plan ahead second guess things anticipate thingsBut for the mind to have really strong powers of concentration you basically have to tell yourself I dont careIm going to focus on doing what needs to be done right now and Im not going to try to provide for alternative things to fall back on In other words when the time comes to be focused and concentrated thats all you doGive yourself to it totallyHave a sense of conviction a sense of confidence in the practice and dont try to second guess thingsWhen the concentration has developed to a proper level itll start showing its results on its ownIn terms of that simile I often use about the unripe mango You dont keep yellow paint on hand just in case to make the mango nice and yellow if watering the tree doesnt work outIf youre convinced that your mango is going to become yellow by pouring water and fertilizer on the roots of the tree thats all you focus onYou dont worry about when its going to get yellowYou realize that if you stick with the watering long enough the mango will have to ripenThats all you have to doWhen you have this kind of singlemindedness then concentration gets more and more powerfulIt really recharges youIts not just a relaxation techniqueIt contains an element of commitment an element of applied energyAt the same time youre making sure that nothing is draining your battery awayThat way you gain more and more strength from the concentration so that when the time comes to leave the concentration  even though it involved some work  you feel refreshed energized chargedThats not simply because youve been able to let go of patterns of tension in the bodyThe different channels of breath energy in the body have also been able to reinforce one anotherAt the same time the good qualities of the mind get reinforced and strengthenedTheyve been allowed to nourish one another tooThis is how the work of concentration starts showing its results with a sense of wellbeing a sense of inner strength a sense of being energizedAfter all concentration is one of the five strengthsAnd if our discernment is going to have the strength it needs to penetrate all the veils of delusion weve put up in the mind its going to require good strong concentration good committed concentration to do the work that leads to releaseTry to be alert to the breath what its doing right now and what youre doing with it right nowSometimes you may notice that youre putting too little or too much pressure on itToo little means that the mind keeps slipping offToo much means that the breath feels confinedIts constricted placed in a box and cant get outAjaan Lee once compared alertness to a rope over a pulley that you can pull in two directionsYou pull it toward the breath to see what the breath is doing then you pull it back to the mind to see how the mind is relating to the breath to see that things are going well that things are workingIf theyre not you can make adjustments Pull back a little on the pressure youre placing on the breath change the breath change your focal pointOr you can think of the breath in other waysIf you find that the way you breathe is building up tension in the neck think of the breath coming in from the back of the neck to reverse that processSee what that doesTell yourself that everything you experience in the body right now is an aspect of breath energyWhen you look at the body in that way you can gauge whether the sensations you feel are breath energy flowing smoothly or breath energy thats constricted or blockedThen make adjustments so that everything can open up and flowThis simple exercise of being very clear about what youre doing and checking the results of what youre doing is basic to the whole practiceIts how you develop sensitivityIts how you break down barriers in the mindOften were sensitive to what were doing but not to the results or we notice the results but not what were doing to cause themThis applies to all areas of our livesSometimes our ignorance is simply a matter of not pointing our attention in the right directionOther times its more willfulThere are certain things we dont want to see and so we erect firewalls in our mindsWe put up stage sets to hide from ourselvesPart of us knows that were doing this and yet part of the minds agreement is to pretend that we dontThis way we block off unpleasant things most of which are things weve done in the past that caused harmEspecially when they were things we knew would cause harm but we went ahead and did them anyway Thats where we try to block things thoroughlyIf this is a habit with us those firewalls get thicker and thicker and our willful ignorance becomes a bigger and bigger problem in our mindsWe tend to think of ignorance or avijja in very abstract terms  not knowing the four noble truths not knowing dependent coarising not knowing the Deathless  but you cant chip away at those forms of ignorance until youve chipped away at the more blatant immediate ones the minds habit of disassociating of leaving gaps in its inner conversationSay you decide to do something unskillfulIf you had a sense of the Buddha watching over your shoulder all the time it would be harder to do it so you erect a barrier in the mind as if there were no Buddha in the world never had been a Buddha no arahant disciplesThen all kinds of unskillful actions are possible in the world remaining in your mindBut those walls cant stay foreverThey have to come downAnd then you expend a lot of energy into putting them back up againWe develop alertness in the meditation for the purpose of drilling through those walls tearing them down letting them collapseThen when theyre down and we can really see we use equanimity to gauge for ourselves where we actually have been skillful and where we haventThat way we can learn from our mistakesAs the Buddha once said One of the signs of wisdom is in seeing your own foolishness At least thats the beginning of your quest for knowledge your quest to overcome ignoranceAnd the foolishness here is not that you dont know a particular Buddhist teaching its simply that you arent sensitive to what youre doing or to the results of what youre doingWe have the power to shape our experience and yet for the most part we use it in ways that cause unnecessary sufferingThis according to the Buddha is the biggest danger in our lives not what other people may do to us but what we can do through our actions to ourselvesThis is why he focuses the Four Noble Truths on the suffering that comes from craving and ignoranceTheres a natural stress in the fact that things change but our real problem is that we create extra suffering through our craving and ignoranceAs long as we have the habit of putting up walls in the mind were in a position where we cant even trust ourselves to do the right thing not even for our own goodThats scaryDecades ago an Alaskan shaman was interviewed by an anthropologist about his tribes religious beliefsThe shaman went along with the anthropologists questions for a while but then finally noted Its not what we believe that matters he saidIts what we fearThats what matters And a lot of the Buddhas teachings come right down to this What is there to fearWhat should we fearOur own misuse of our power to shape our lives thats whatHis teachings are designed to help us learn and use that power more wiselyAnd that means breaking down those firewalls those closedoff compartments in our mind that allow us to do unskillful thingsSo we work with mindfulness and alertness trying to be as continuously aware of the breath as possible without any gaps  because the gaps are what give ignorance the space to create walls to create little dark corners where it might seem right to act on anger on lust on fear passion and greedThese things seem right because we block off our sense of shame and conscience block off our knowledge of whats really rightAnd if this becomes a habit we cant trust ourselvesWe end up doing things that will harm ourselves will harm other people because we create these false little worlds where karma doesnt seem to have a role where we think we can get away with thingsIt wont matter we tell ourselvesBut inevitably those walls will come crashing down those worlds will come crashing downThe principle of cause and effect will assert itself and what weve done will matterA lotSo this world of makebelieve in which we build these walls in which we lie to ourselves and agree to be deceived by our own lies Thats where we have to start our workAnd we do that through developing mindfulness and alertness by working on the meditation working on being sensitive to the breath all the time as continuously as possibleWhen we learn to be true to ourselves then the truth holds no dangers no fearBut when we create makebelieve worlds for ourselves and work hard to keep them shored up we know deep down inside that eventually theyre going to come tumbling downOur work will be in vainSo in the back of the mind we fear the truth because we havent been true to ourselvesBut when you learn to be true to yourself the truth holds no danger the truth holds no fear because youre right there with the truth all the timeIts like a person who holds to the precept of not lying You dont lie at all so you dont have to remember what lie you said to this person or what lie you said to that person because youve been saying the truth all the timeThe same principle works on the inner level as wellIf youve been with the truth all the time nothing that the truth will serve up will cause you any fear any danger because over time youve become more and more skillful in how you relate to the truthEven the suffering that comes from past actions the pain that comes from past actions You learn how to relate to that skillfully without trying to pretend its not there without trying to make too big or too little an issue out of itYou simply look for exactly what it is and learn to understand itWhen you understand it you can get past itYou can transcend itThis kind of understanding requires seeing cause and effect seeing your actions the results of what youve done and learning to finetune your sensitivity so you become more and more skillful in relating to the truthThis in turn allows you to stay with the truth more and more steadily so that you dont go running off into makebelieve worldsSo the causes of suffering  craving and ignorance  are not abstract things theyre habits of the mind often willful habits of the mindCraving comes from ignorance but ignorance can also come from cravingWe set up walls in our minds to get away with the things we want to do but we cant really get away which is why craving and ignorance cause sufferingSo staying with the breath is not a technical exercise that allows us to bypass a lot of the necessary work in our livesIt actually gives us the tools we need in order to do the real workBut the tools need to be supplemented with the knowledge of what the Buddha taughtYou cant simply do a technique and hope that the technique will reveal everything to youYou have to reflect on what the Buddha taught about the principle of action the principle of its resultsGenerosity virtue All the teachings form a coherent wholeEven the teachings that we tend to regard more as the religious trappings around Buddhism are really integral to the practiceFor instance the act of taking refuge What does it mean to take the Buddha as your guide in lifeFor one thing it means that you keep remembering himThe word sarana or refuge is actually the same word for something to remember You try to remember the Buddha all the timeIts as if hes looking over your shoulderHis example is always there for you to reflect on This is how true happiness is found through the way he did itAnd the qualities he developed  truthfulness compassion wisdom and purity  were the way to the end of sufferingHe left us the Dhamma as his guide in how to develop those qualitiesAnd he always based his approach in developing compassion wisdom and purity on the idea that we want happinessHe never assumed that were basically good or basically badHe builds all his teachings on the assumption that we basically want happinessNow our desire for happiness often seems to run counter to compassion but the Buddha uses that desire in such a way as to foster compassionThink about the fact that you truly want happinessAre you different from anyone else in thatNot reallyEverybody thinks the same way everybody feels the same wayEveryone wants happiness everyone strives for itWhen thats the case how can you create a lasting happiness for yourself that would be based on the suffering of other people when theyre going to be constantly working to subvert that happiness as they work toward their ownYour search for happiness has to include a desire for other people to be happy tooOtherwise it wont lastWhen you learn to think in that way then your desire for happiness doesnt require that you be uncompassionate or unsympatheticJust the oppositeIt becomes the basis for compassionThe same with wisdomThe Buddha once said Wisdom starts with asking the question What when I do it will lead to my longterm welfare and happiness Here the emphasis is on the longterm and it builds on the realization that you are responsible for the actions that will lead to that happiness that you have to be careful not to go running off after shortterm happiness that leads to longterm painThis is something we all sincerely desireThe Buddhas simply asking us to reflect on it in a way that leads to wisdom leads to discernmentAnd its embodied in his teachings to Rahula his son reflecting on what youre going to do your intention before you do something Will it lead to harmWill it lead to happiness If it leads to harm dont do itIf it looks like its going to be harmless then go ahead and do itWhile youre doing it however check to see if any unexpected results are showing upIf the action leads to any unexpected harm stop change do something elseIf it seems to cause no harm continue with it to the endEven when its done youre not really done for you have to reflect on the longterm resultsIf the action caused unexpected harm talk it over with someone else on the path and resolve not to make that same mistake againIf it didnt cause harm take joy in the fact that youre on the path and keep on practicingIn other words you dont focus on whether or not youre a good or bad person which could tie you all up in knotsYou focus simply on the actions and their results and on learning from them which is a lot more manageableThese principles apply not only to your physical actions but also to your words and thoughtsThey also apply to your meditationYou intend to stay with the breath to breathe and to focus on the breath in a certain wayCheck to see the results Is it going to cause harmIs it causing harm is it causing pain or stress right now If it is changeIf its not keep goingWhen you come out of meditation keep noticing the results of your actionsThats your meditation in daily lifeOne interesting thing about these instructions to Rahula is how they begin and how they concludeThe Buddha started with the principle of truthfulness If you cant be truthful about your actions and their results you cant do this training at allAfter giving these instructions he concluded with the observation This is the way to purity This is how you purify your thoughts words and deeds through looking at your actions in terms of their intentions and the quality of the resultsIf you see that youve made a mistake then resolve not to make it againThis is where the purity comes inPurity requires not having firewalls in your mindIt means seeing the connections between what you intend to do and the results you get realizing that you can change your ways if youve made a mistakeSo this is how compassion wisdom and purity  the virtues of the Buddha  are fostered by taking our desire for happiness and learning to work with it truthfully in a skillful wayAnd this is the DhammaThis is how we take refuge in the Dhamma remembering these principles and actually putting them into practice so that the qualities of the Buddha appear within us become embodied within usBy following the examples of the Noble Disciples the third member of the Triple Refuge we become Noble Disciples as wellThats when the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha become a totally internalized refugeAnd thats where the refuge is really secure where they all become one with no dividing lines among them because at that point the mind becomes one with no dividing lines insideWisdom compassion and purity all come together and become one at that pointSo when we talk about divisions or a lack of oneness in the mind its not an abstract conceptual thingWe cant overcome those divisions simply by dissolving them in a feeling of onenessThey dont dissolve that way because they were created with a purposeWeve created them through our willful ignoranceWeve put up firewalls in our minds to deny that weve done certain things or that certain results have come from what weve doneSo we need to learn how to take down these walls and divisions through our relentless honesty relentless mindfulness relentless alertnessThe compartments of the mind that would allow us to do unskillful things  which would mean that we cant trust ourselves  get torn downThe mind thats truly one is the mind that can trust itself totallyThere are no hidden cornersEverything is wide open in a mind like thatWe gain release from the barriers we create for ourselves release from the suffering we create for ourselvesWhen those barriers and that suffering are gone theres nothing to confine the mind nothing to weigh it downAnd when youve made your mind trustworthy like that you become a member of the Noble Sangha a refuge for others for they find that they can trust your exampleThis is how oneness inside leads to oneness outside not a sentimental oceanic feeling of oneness but the oneness that comes when the barriers that lead to mistrust are torn downIts through tearing down those barriers that the Dhamma of compassion wisdom and purity can spread throughout the worldWhen you gain your internal refuge of trust you become an external refuge of trust for othersBut the work has to start hereSo when were looking for the freedom and release that the Buddha talks about this is where we look learning to see through the barriers we create for ourselvesThe release is right here to be seen simply that we need to learn how to stop creating the barriers that get in the wayIts a demanding path but at least its a path of possibilityYou dont have to depend on anyone elseYou dont have to be afraid that other people are not going to do the work for you because all the work is for you to doAnd the more you tear those barriers down the more you can trust yourself to do the work properlyMany ancient tribes marked the line between childhood and adulthood by sending the person off into the wilds to be aloneSome of the tribes called it a vision questThe person could be alone for days to see what kind of vision would come up from within the mind from within the heart independent of the training he or she had received as a childThat was supposed to mark the persons entry into adulthood to give a sense of what the adulthood would be all aboutFrom that point on the person would drop whatever childish things didnt fit in with the vision and embark on adult life with a clear sense of directionEven in modern cultures thats what the line between childhood and adulthood is the point where we step back from the training weve received step back from all the influences received as children and find a place within where we can decide what our own ideas are what our own sense of our direction in life isIts a shame though that in modern culture the line is a fuzzy lineA fractured lineWe dont have a formally recognized time of quietude to make the break in a clear and socially recognized wayBut thats what we do when we meditate We step back from all the influences inside our mind  ideas that this is good thats bad you should do this you shouldnt do thatYou have to stop and really take stock of these things find a place within where you can be really really quiet and then look clearly at these voices to see what they areInstead of identifying with them you watch themYou watch to see what theyre coming from where theyre going seeing them as part of a causal processWhat kind of mind state do they come from what kind of mind state do they encourageAre those the kind of mind states you want to identify withThis is essentially how the Buddhas teaching on notself works seeing the things that have control over our lives that have power over our minds and in the course of the meditation stepping back a bit from them gaining enough independence from them that we can look at them simply as events and see if we really want to identify with themAs the Buddha pointed out in one of his discourses you cant really look at these things as long as youre identifying with themYouve got to step backThis applies not only to ideas in the mind but also to the body this form were sitting with hereThe same principle also applies to feelings of pleasure and pain as they come and go to perceptions to thoughtconstructs even to our consciousness of thingsMeditation gives us a place where we can step back from these things and watch them to see the influence they have over the mind to decide whether thats an influence wed like them to continue havingSo as we practice its important to create this space where you can step backThe quietude and seclusion are importantThere are actually three kinds of seclusionThe first is physical seclusion getting away from peopleIts hard to get the random voices out of your mind when people are constantly feeding them into your earsIts hard to focus on your own mind when youre running up against the contents of other peoples minds all the timeYouve got to get awayYouve got to get out  which is what were doing as we come here finding a place of seclusionWere not totally cut off from other people here but at least were in a place where the values of the practice are honored where the bottom line is not the profit margin where the bottom line is how youre training your mind  a place where we try to give space to one another to show respect for on anothers need for quietude for concentrationBut theres still the problem that when we come out to a place like this we dont leave our thoughts behindEven though we may be surrounded by physical seclusion theres still a lot of companionship in our minds as we go and sit out under the treesThoughts of the past come along thoughts of the future come alongAs long as were tied up in these thoughts were not really aloneThis is why we take the body in and of itself sitting here as our frame of referenceThats a way of developing mental seclusion dropping unskillful mental statesWe drop thoughts of past and future and try to be right here with the body in the present momentWe drop thoughts of how much wed like to see this thing or hear that thing or taste or touch the things we likeWere willing to let the mind be here secluded from all thatOur culture is a funny one It tends to distrust people who try to get away from sensual attachments  partly because the economy would collapse and partly because of the old JudaicProtestant prejudice that people who try to abandon sensual attachments must be weirdThe truth of the matter though is that theres a part of the mind that flourishes when its not burdened with sensual attachmentsWhen its really secluded from sensual attachments it blossomsAnd part of the practice is learning to appreciate that very still center of the mind the sense of wellbeing that comes from dropping all those attachmentsEven though were not yet letting go of them for good we at least drop them for the time beingSimply be with the sense of the breath coming in going out allowing it to fill the bodyAllow it to find its own right rhythmYou nudge it a little bit here nudge it a little bit there to make it feel good and this makes it easier to get pulled into the present moment rather than into the future or the pastYou develop a greater and greater sense of mental seclusion by just dropping those distractions dropping all those voices and attitudes that pull you back or pull you forwardYou allow yourself simply to be right here absorbed in working with the breath settled down with a sense of wellbeing settled down with a sense of familiarityIt takes time of course to get familiar with the present moment because for the most part were just running throughWere like a little kid who runs home  Hi Mom  grabs a sandwich and runs out again Thats dinner We have a fragmentary sense of the present moment as we rush through from the past to the future and from the future to the pastThe only time we really take notice of the present is when pain transfixes us hereWell during the meditation get a sense of pleasure and allow that to transfix you in here insteadThis is what creates true mental seclusionThe past and the future drop away and all youve got left is the body sitting here breathing  right here right nowYouve got mindfulness reminding you to stay right here alertness keeping watch over whats going on and discernment absorbed in trying to understand itThats a much deeper and more satisfying sense of seclusionUltimately it forms the basis for the third one seclusion from cravingAs the Buddha said craving is our constant companion even when the mind is in the presentTo cut through this craving we have to call into question the things weve been identifying withIn his second sermon the Buddha pointed out to the monks that if you let go of your attachment to form feeling perception thoughtconstructs and consciousness what happensIn their case they attained AwakeningIn other words they became secluded even from their sense of who they were in the present moment  because our sense of who we are is composed of those five kinds of things coupled with craving and clingingForm the form of the bodyFeelings You may identify with a pain saying This is my pain or you may identify with a more metaphysical feeling a larger sense of light or wellbeing a sense of blissYou may think that thats who your true self isThen theres the label that says This is my self Thats a perceptionThoughtconstructs You identify with your thinking or the ThinkerOr you identify with the momenttomoment consciousness of thingsAs long as you identify with these things you crave themYoure still not secluded from themYou still have companionsBut when you create that still center inside and allow yourself simply to watch these things you step back and realize that you dont have to identify with themSelfidentification is an actOur sense of who we are is something we createAs you step back from these things and allow that activity of repeatedly creating your sense of who you are to fall away see what happensThen learn to drop your sense of identification even with the still center insideSee what happens thenThe Buddha says that an even greater sense of freedom comesSee if hes rightWhen you taste that freedom youre no longer a slave to these thingsInstead they become your toolsYou can use them for good purposesSo this process of gaining seclusion is a process not only of growing up but also of gaining freedomWe look at all the influences rushing around in our minds and we come to realize that we have the ability to choose which ideas are useful and which ones are not which of the phenomena were aware of are useful and which ones are notWe dont have to be driven around by them all the timeFor most of us life is a story of just that being driven aroundAnd this involves a lot of conflict because there are so many conflicting voices in our mindsThis or that person gets under our skin and all of a sudden we start identifying with their particular way of thinking another way of thinking gets under our skin and that gets incorporated tooWe never really have a chance to sit back and sort things through to see where theyre harmonious and where theyre notA group of people called the Kalamas once asked the Buddha How do we know which of the many different teachings coming our way are trueOne teacher comes and says x is trueAnother person comes and says Any person who says x is true is crazyY is true How do we know whos telling the truthWell the Buddha said You cant go by outside teachers you cant go by old texts you cant go by received wisdom Thats the part of the teaching everybody remembersBut at the same time he also said that you cant go by your own sense of what you like what seems logical or what fits in with your preconceived notionsThat doesnt give you any proof of truth eitherYou have to look and see When you do something what are the resultsIf you act on particular mental qualities which ones give happy results harmless results and which ones give harmful resultsIn other words you have to look at cause and effectThis principle applies not only to outside teachers but also to the voices we tend to identify with in our mindsYou have to step back and see what happens if you follow a particular way of perceiving thingsSay youve got a pain in your leg and you perceive or label the pain in a certain way What happensIs that a skillful way of labeling the painCould you label it some other wayCan you label it simply as sensation insteadCan you step back and simply watch the pain and the perception as a series of events part of a causal chainWhat kind of freedom comes when you do thatThis is how the teaching that the Buddha gave to the Kalamas applies not only outside but inside as wellEven if we dont have the seclusion of vision quests any more in our culture we do have a chance to find an even more thorough seclusion when we meditateMeditation trains us in the ability to look and see whats in our minds to decide what we really want to identify with and what we dontSo its through the meditation that we learn to grow up we learn to gain independence we learn to stand on our own two feetAjaan Lee once made the comment that people who are still attached  still a slave to their thoughts their bodies and their feelings  are still children even if theyre years oldOn the other hand if youre the wise person whos no longer a slave to these things then even if youre only seven years old youre already an adultSo think of the meditation as giving you a chance to step back and draw the line between childhood and adulthoodDraw the line make it sharp and then step over into adulthood by giving yourself that space that sense of seclusion inside where you have time to sit down and watch things for what they really doWhen you realize that you have the freedom to choose  and you take advantage of that freedom  thats when youve grown into an adultThe Dhamma strips things down to their essentials with the realization that if you try to take on too many things all at once you end up not doing anything very wellThis is what the principle of renunciation is all about realizing that some problems are more important than others and some solutions more important than others as wellSome forms of happiness last longer than others doSo we have to look at ourselves with the realization that we have only so much energyIf our energy gets scattered around or spread too thin we end up not succeeding at anything at allGiven the fact that we have limitations in our time and energy we want to make the best use of themFocus them on the issues that really do make a difference and be willing to give up other issues that are not so importantItd be nice if we could cover all of our bases to have our cake and eat it too but it just doesnt work that wayWe dont have the time we dont have the energyWe can think of renunciation as a process of simplificationThats a word with a nicer ring to it nowadays You want to simplify your life to cut away the unnecessary clutterBut either way whether you call it simplification or renunciation there are hard choices you have to makeAnd so its best to look at it as a tradeoffYou can spend your time on activities that give immediate results that dont last very long or on activities that give more longlasting results but take more effort more time more patience require more precisionUltimately you realize that the best trade is the one where you give up lesser forms of happiness for more longlasting ones ones that speak to the really deep issues in lifeWhat are those issuesWell theres the fact that were active creaturesWere constantly acting constantly putting forth an effort of some kind or anotherSo the question is Whats the best use of that effortAs long as were putting forth an effort in some direction we want to get results that last even though the effort itself might not lastWith all the energy that goes into the effort  and sometimes the suffering and stress that go into the effort  we want good results to show for what weve done so we can look back at our lives and say yes that was a life well spentA life well worth the effort involvedAt the very end of life its all going to seem so short  just that little bit of time we have here as human beingsWe want to make sure that we dont fritter it awayLook at your life in the same way youd look through an attic deciding what youre going to keep what youre going to throw outYoure moving from a house with a large attic but youve got only a small trailer to make the moveSome things need to be thrown out so that you have space in the trailer for the things that really mean a lot to youIn other words there are things youve got to give up in order to have the time for the things that really matter really make a difference really do give substantial resultsThats the underlying insight that informs the teachings on renunciationWhen you think about it you realize that the time best spent is the time spent developing good qualities in the mind because those are things that can help you in any situationYou have to devote a certain amount of time to keeping the body strong but with the body you reach a point of diminishing returnsUltimately there comes a point where no matter how much youve looked after the body its going to leave youAnd sometimes it doesnt leave you nicelySometimes theres a messy partingAnd in cases like that youll be glad for the time you spent working on the mind because you realize that thats much closer to homeAt the same time the strength of the mind when really developed doesnt have to depend on the strength of the bodyIt doesnt end when the body diesThis is one of the things you discover as you meditateOrdinarily when people are tired they get in a bad moodThey feel overwhelmed really put uponBut when you learn how to develop a greater sense of spaciousness in the mind a greater sense of wellbeing in the mind after a while you begin to realize it doesnt depend on the level of energy in the body at allThe mind begins to have its own internal nourishment its own internal place to rechargeThis is why we spend so much time sitting here with our eyes closed working on mindfulness concentration and discernment because these are the qualities that will see the mind through any situationWhen you see people really losing it this is what theyve lostTheyve lost their mindfulness theyve lost their concentration theyve lost their discernmentSo you want to work on strengthening these qualitiesWhatever time is spent making them stronger is time well spentThis is whats meant by taking refuge in the Dhamma realizing that if you focus on these few things you dont have to worry about other thingsYou can really trust the practice to see you throughOften our desire to cover all the bases is a fear that if one thing doesnt work out something else willAnd we hesitate to commit ourselves to a particular path of action for fear that it may not see us all the way throughWe hedge our betsYet instead of providing us real protection this attitude ends up giving us a life of nothing but bits and pieces a little bit of this fragments of that a little bit of peace a little bit of wealth a little bit of health nothing in any really solid measureBut by taking refuge in the Dhamma were taking refuge in the conviction that developing the mind will cover all contingenciesAnd because the practice of virtue concentration and discernment  all the seeds for happiness  lie right here that simplifies mattersIt also allows us to give our full energy to the things that matter mostSo even if from the outside it may look as if the life of practicing the Dhamma has a lot of hardships a lot of renunciation a lot of doing without its not an impoverished lifeYou find that real wealth develops insideOne of the first things that attracted me to the Dhamma was seeing my teacher Ajaan Fuang living a very simple life  a little tiny monastery out in the hills of Rayong just a couple of huts not that many people  but he was happyYou could feel a very strong sense of wellbeing just emanating from himAnd you realized that it didnt depend on his being wealthy it didnt depend on his being famous or having a lot of students or friends or anythingIt was simply because he had worked on his mindAs he said he wasnt born that wayWhatever sense of wellbeing he had developed in the mind came through the practiceAnd as you come to know the practice come to know the Dhamma you realize exactly how allencompassing it isOnce these qualities are developed in the mind they take care of all kinds of situationsQualities of mindfulness discernment and concentration are basic to any skill basic to our ability to deal with any situationSo by focusing on these few things we really do cover all of our basesThey encompass everythingOne of the good things about the Dhamma is that its so bigYou can give your whole life to itIts something worth giving your life to because it teaches you what you need to know teaches you the skills you need to handle whatever life throws at you  and moreSo even though a life of renunciation may seem like a life of getting pared down and narrowed down its not really that way at allIt broadens out because youre not confining the mind with narrow petty issuesYoure dealing with the few really big essential issues in life that cover everythingYears back when I was a young monk I had to take the Dhamma exams  the exams they give to the monks in Thailand once a year  and part of each exam involved writing a short Dhamma talkTheyd give you a phrase from the Pali Canon or a couple of verses from the Dhammapada or Sutta Nipata and youd have to develop that particular theme bringing in another related Dhamma quote before you finishedThe first year you had to bring in one quote the second year two and for the final year threeTo prepare you for this part of the exam they gave you a book with Dhamma quotes to memorizeAnd being your typical American I hadnt had that much memorization practice in schoolThe little novices would memorize pages and pages of these Dhamma quotes but I realized that in my own case it would be wise just to pick a couple of quotes that would be useful in all circumstancesThe one I found useful every year was a passage from the Dhammapada If when you see that theres a greater happiness that comes from abandoning a lesser happiness be willing to abandon that lesser happiness for the sake of the greater oneThats a principle that covers all situations and its the one underlying the teachings on renunciationIn fact it underlies the whole practice realizing that as long as were putting forth effort into our lives we might as well put forth effort that will leave us something to show for itThink of the number of people you know who have lived very active lives but then toward the end look back and say they have nothing to show for all that activity for all that effort for all that sufferingBut you wont find in that group of people anyone whos been practicing the DhammaThe effort that goes into the Dhamma gives longterm benefits in terms of developing the qualities of the mind opening us up to new dimensions that we wouldnt have even imagined otherwiseSo when the Dhamma requires that you give things up remember that its a tradeoff in giving up a lesser happiness for a greater oneYoure giving up the habit of scattering your energy around in exchange for a better habit one of focusing on the qualities of the mind that will see you through every situation and take you beyond situationsThis is why its so important to strip things down to the essentials and stay with the essentialsThe essentials cover everythingThey take care of everythingThey can provide you with all of the refuge you needSo even though it may seem simpleminded were sitting here focusing on whatThe breath coming in and outIt may not seem all that profound or intellectually stimulating but its one of the essentialsNot only the breath in and of itself but the habits we develop as we keep the mind focused on the breath mindfulness alertness persistence clarity of mindThese skills are basic to all skills in life so make sure that you really have them masteredWhatever you have to give up in terms of time devoted to other things in order to master these skills its a wise trade a trade that leaves you with something far more valuable than whatever has been abandonedThats something you can depend on because these are qualities that teach you how to depend on yourselfTheres that passage The self is its own refuge It means that ultimately you have to be your own refuge and that you can be your own refuge only if you develop these qualities that make you dependableIf you depend on them ultimately you find that they allow you to depend on yourselfThats a promise that comes with a year old guaranteeWhen you come to practice the Dhamma there are a lot of times when you experience culture shockIts not a question of going from a Western culture to an Asian cultureIts going from a culture of ordinary people with defilements  Asian or Western  to the culture of the Noble OnesTheir culture involves a radically different set of values a different etiquette a different purposeThe culture of ordinary people  no matter where in the world  is just to keep families going to keep the human race surviving to keep people clothed and fed to try to sort out a balance among different peoples greed anger and delusion in such a way that things are relatively peacefulBut this always takes place within the context of whats possible in a world where when you have gain loss status loss of status praise criticism pleasure painThese things all come in pairs so you dont get anything thats totally wholeThe purpose of the customs of the Noble Ones however is to lead to something that as Luang Pu Dune once said is one single thing all the way throughTheres no concern about keeping the human race going or keeping your appetites going but there is a focused concern on finding a true happinessThat one point that one focus trumps everything elseAnd it affects everything within the culture  from the way we walk the way we talk what we wear what we eat the kind of shelter we look for the medicine we use everything from the very basics all the way up to how we comprehend our own mindsSo as you shift from one culture to the next there are bound to be periods of culture shockBut you have to keep reminding yourself that the purpose of all this is to take seriously the deep desire that everyone has for true happinessIf you think about it youll see that the Buddha was a very demanding person He wanted nothing less than absolute happiness a happiness that was one single thing all the way through that didnt have other things nibbling away at the edgesSo even though he had wealth status all of what they call the good things of the world they werent good enough for himHis totally overwhelming motivation was a desire for true happiness a happiness with no drawbacks  in other words a happiness that wasnt going to cause suffering for other people eitherIt would have to be a happiness built on developing his inner resources one that wouldnt have to take anything away from anyone elseInstead of taking things he lived off of what people offered him as a way of making that happiness more pureHe also realized that that happiness was not going to come from owning or having thingsHe was going to have to teach his mind to be more selfreliant and by developing that selfreliance he found that theres a lot more to the mind than he originally expectedSo as you come to the Dhamma try to keep that same purpose in mind a true happiness that doesnt have to depend on anything a happiness thats one thing all the way throughAnd of course there will be culture shock when your ordinary old desires your old habits are thwarted screaming for attentionBut you have to look Exactly where are they going to take youThey take you back to that world of opposites the world where theres nothing in a really pure formIf youre nurturing your desires in that context youre simply learning to put up with second bestThere was an article recently in Tricycle where a psychologist was arguing that the true Buddhist attitude toward craving is that craving or desire is really a problem only if you want the objects of your craving to be total to be with you foreverAs long as youre realistic and realize that nothing lasts forever he said then desire is no problemJust learn not to cling to the object of your desireJust be content with being with the desire itselfThats his idea of being realistic and of course that has nothing to do with what the Buddha taughtAs the Buddha taught its not so much that we cling to the objects of our desire we cling to the desire itself we crave desire itselfIts something we enjoyAnd if desire without latching on to the expectation of permanent objects for the desire were okay then why is there so much trouble from sexual predators or war mongers who dont really care to hold on to their conquests but want to keep going on for more and more and moreThey like the processThey like the thrill of the chaseAnd this is the real problem with human desireIn its quest for enough in terms of the things of the world it never can find satisfaction so it always keeps wanting more and moreIn this way it wrecks the world and also wrecks the mind So we have to find something that will put the mind in a state where it doesnt need to desire anything anymorePart of this quest means learning to temper your desires but it also means refocusing themInstead of having scattered desires for all things in all different directions you focus it on one big desire the desire for total freedomNow whats radical about the Buddhas teachings is that that desire is realistic too  that desire for total freedom ultimate happinessAfter all isnt that why we desire thingsWe hope that theyll give us happiness and they end up not giving itPsychologists have done studies showing that people are very unrealistic about the amount of happiness theyre going to get out of thingsRelationships advancement at work a new car These things are painted in all kinds of beautiful colors in the mind and yet when we actually get them the colors fadeThis sets you up for wanting something elseYou keep going in that direction and theres no end to itBut even though weve been disappointed before even though weve seen the colors fade right before our eyes we start imagining Well the next one the next person the next thing the next position in life  thatll have colors that are colorfast But it doesnt work out that wayIts like the old story of the person eating peppers and crying because the peppers were hotAnd the people said to him Why do you keep on eating peppers And he said Well I hope to find the sweet one in here someplace Thats the way most people are about their happinessAccording to the Buddha though there is one thing that doesnt disappointWhen you pursue Awakening when you pursue nibbana its not going to lead to disappointmentQuite the contrary it goes wildly beyond your expectations wildly beyond your hopesEven just the first taste of the Deathless stream entry is enough to produce a seismic shift in your whole awareness your whole understanding in what you think you are and whats possible in life and in the importance of your own actionsOnce you reach that state your conviction in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha is unshakeableYour standards for what counts as true happiness get ratcheted up immeasurablyBut in the meantime until you reach that state youre going to have shakable convictionIts part of the gameIts only to be expected because you havent seen the results really turn into something earthshaking yetThis is why you have to work at your sense of convictionYour drive for true happiness your belief that such a thing is possible is whats going to see you over the hurdles placed in your wayYour conviction that there is a way out is whats going to help find that way outLike someone lost in the forest If youre not really convinced that theres a way out you give up very easilyYou run into a thicket here a steep cliff there and it just seems way too muchIt stops youBut if youre convinced theres got to be a way out youve heard of other people whove made their way out you think Its got to be in here someplace You keep looking looking lookingAnd finally you see how the other people made their way out OhThat was the path they tookSo conviction plays an important role in the pathThe Buddha cites it as the first strength of mind that leads to Awakening conviction in the Buddhas Awakening conviction in the principle of kammaThe Buddha was a human being he did it through his own actionsYoure a human being you can do it through yoursThis also requires having a singleminded focus a singleminded respect for your desire for a really single totally unadulterated happiness  a happiness that doesnt keep corroding at the edges doesnt have other stains mixed inIts something totalDeep down inside thats what we all want but part of us doesnt believe its realWeve been taught so much  this culture that were trying to outgrow has been teaching us all along  that total happiness isnt possibleContent yourself with what we have to offerWe have nice jobs we have nice cars nice familiesIf you dont like a family you can have an affair All the legal and illegal pleasures that worldly cultures promise They teach you to settle for these thingsAnd people have been settling for them for how many lifetimesBut the Buddha tells you Dont settle for thatAim higherAim at the hearts true desire unmitigated happiness total freedom Because its here that effort is well spentThe Buddha saw that our experience of the world  these four dimensions of space and time  depends on our own karmic inputA constant effort is required to keep it going keep it going keep it goingAnd the question is Is it worth it If you look at the world of conditioned things if those are your goals theyre not worth it at all because they come only to fade fade fade awayBut the Buddha realized that conditioned things are also conditioning thingsIn other words these fabricated things if you learn how to use them skillfully lead someplaceEven if you dont learn how to use them skillfully they still lead places random places miserable placesThe question is Do you really want to go where theyre taking you If you make the effort to get skillful at fashioning conditioned things they can lead you to a happiness thats worthwhile that can be taken as a goal in and of itselfSo were living in the same world of conditioned things as everyone else but were approaching them in a different wayThis is what makes the culture of the Noble Ones so specialThe cultures of the world teach us to delight in gaining conditioned things  thrills people power possessions  thinking that we can stop thereThe culture of the Noble Ones though teaches us to delight in developing skillful mental states to delight in abandoning unskillful mental states for the purpose of a happiness thats unconditionedYou do this by developing the conviction that there is a releaseAs the Buddha saw the laws of causality are such that there are points of resonance as in chaos theory where the laws of your causal experience lead you to an opening that takes you out of this system entirelyThats possibleThat effort he says is worth itAnd its up to usAs the Buddha said this opportunity is hereWe have this human lifeWhat are we going to do with itAre we going to explore that possibilityAre we going to test it to see if what hes saying is trueAre we going to stick with the limited possibilities offered by our old culture or are we going to try the possibilities promised in the culture of the Noble OnesThe nature of what the Buddha promises is really inviting even though its challengingAnd it seems a shame that people dont take him up on that challenge  but we cant make the choice for other peopleIts a choice that each of us has to make for himself or herself aloneBut you find that if you stick with that desire for a dependable happiness if you stick with the conviction that its possible the results really are greater than anything you can imagineThe mind has a habit of loading itself down with all sorts of unnecessary garbageIts like a phrase they have in Thai the old woman loading herself down with straw The story goes that she thought that someday she might find herself in need of some straw so everywhere she went she carried a huge load of straw on her backOf course she was always bent over and at the same time could never pick up anything that was any betterWhen she got home thats all she had this big load of strawShe had been all over the place carrying her big load of straw and yet had nothing to show for itIts like a person on a camping trip who tries to prepare for all the possible contingencies and as a result loads his pack so heavily that he can hardly walkHe wont get very farIf he wants to get anywhere hes got to learn how to minimize his loadIn the same way we have to learn how to get rid of all the unnecessary things we carry aroundEven though were out here in an extremely peaceful place we keep finding things to weigh the mind downSo its important to have techniques for letting go for putting down those burdensThe four sublime attitudes that we chant every night are good tools for putting down your loadStart out with thoughts of goodwill May I be happy may all living beings be happy Think about it for a while Why would you want anyone to sufferDo you want anyone to sufferLook down be very honest with yourself because with all the conflicts in life you may have a residual grudge against some peopleYoud really like to see them get theirsAnd yet whos being weighed down by that desireYou are all for no purposeYou dont have to make sure that just punishments are meted outThe law of karma is going to take care of everything sooner or laterOf course often wed like to see it sooner but the desire for sooner is right there an unnecessary load on the mindSo think about goodwill for a while until you can really see why youd genuinely want to see everybody happyAfter all if everybody had true happiness welling up from within nobody would harm anyone else no one would cheat anyone else no one would take advantage of anyone elseIf everybody had true happiness there would be no reason for all the wars and cruelties in the worldThe possibility for peace and wellbeing in the world has to come from everyones being happy from withinSo you wish that happiness for everyone whether theyre people you like or people you dont likeDont make your likes and dislikes a big issueDig into each person a little deeper than that to see the part where you can sympathize with his or her desire for happinessThe next two sublime attitudes follow immediately on goodwillIf you see people who are suffering you feel compassion for them youd like to see them gain release from that sufferingAs for those who are already happy you wish them to continue in that happinessIts funny that this last attitude appreciation or sympathetic joy is the harder of the twoSometimes compassion is easy because we can view ourselves in a position of being over somebody looking down on that poor suffering person whereas with sympathetic joy sometimes the people who are happier than we are are in a higher position than we areThey have a happiness we dont yet haveIn situations like this thoughts of envy or resentment can easily come up so if they do look at themDo you really want to think those thoughtsDo you really want to identify with those thoughtsThese sublime attitudes are measuring sticks against which you can measure whats actually going on in your mindIn other words youre not just smothering all the unskillful thoughts in your mind with these nice warm fuzzy clouds of goodwillYoure using these skillful thoughts as measuring sticksThese are the attitudes that put people into jhanaThese are the attitudes that brahmas who live in jhana actually dwell inThis is why theyre able to stay in jhanaSo how do your attitudes measure up against theirsIf you find that your attitudes dont measure up try to reason with yourself until they doYou cant force yourself without reasoningThe same with compassion Can you feel compassion for someone without a sense of your superiority getting involvedJust simply seeing someone suffer hurts your heartDont make an issue of whether you like that person or notIf someone is happy again it doesnt matter whether you like or dont like that personTry to make your heart as fair as possible with regard to all beingsOnce youve developed these attitudes then when thoughts that go against these principles come into the mind youll catch them more quickly see them more easily and in this way these attitudes become a basis for good concentration a basis for developing stillness within the mindOf course there are cases where people are suffering and you cant do anything to put an end to their suffering or when happy people are going to have to lose their happinessThis applies to you as well as to other peopleThis is why equanimity has to be the safety net for all these sublime attitudesRealizing that there are some cases you just cant help you have to reflect on the principle of karmaThis again is a very useful principle for preparing yourself to meditateRealize that you dont have to straighten out the world before youre going to be able to gain Awakening or before youre going to be able to sit down and meditateThe principle of karma is at work hereOften when people have made up their minds to straighten out the world the things they do to straighten out the world tend to get very unskillful and they end up making things worseThey dont like other peoples greed anger and delusion yet in the course of trying to straighten them out they inflict them with their own greed anger and delusionThey simply compound the problemSo your only responsibility to the world is to focus on doing whats skillfulThats all you have to take care ofAs for the working out of everybody elses karma that will work out on its own without your having to get involvedJust make sure that your own present karma is skillfulOne thing you can do thats skillful right now is to allow the mind to settle down with the breathTheres no unfinished business with other people that youve got to take care of right nowYour unfinished business is to see how skillful you can be in the way you direct your mind for if you want true happiness this is what youve got to doYoure not going to find true happiness by straightening out the world but you can find true happiness by straightening out the mindDoing skillful things saying skillful things thinking skillful things This is how your world is going to become a better worldAnd this is not a small or narrow minded ideaYou may have read that these poor Hinayanists all they can think about is their own individual liberation while other Buddhists have nobler broader aspirations They want to save all sentient beings from sufferingNow if suffering were a thing  like a house  that you could clean up then it would be possible to go around cleaning up other peoples houses for themBut its not a thingIts a pattern of unskillful behaviorEach person is suffering because of his or her own lack of skillSo each person has to clean up his or her own actYou cant make other people more skillfulYou cant force them to choose to be more skillfulYou cant clean up their act for themYou can show them by example by cleaning up your own actYou can recommend that they clean up theirs but your recommendations carry weight only if you can speak from experience in how you cleaned up your act and you can show the actual example of your own behaviorBut the actual cleaning is something that each person has to do for him or herselfNobody can save anyone elseTheres no other way that the world will get cleanAnd regardless of whether the world will actually ever get clean  which is pretty open to doubt  theres no doubt that youve got issues coming up in your mind right nowThose are the ones you have to deal with thats your field for skillful work right nowWhen you have this perspective it helps you focus on your meditation and do the work that has to be doneTheres a passage in the Anguttara describing two kinds of fools in the world those who take on work thats not their own work and those who neglect the work that is their ownSo look at the work your mind has to doIts right here in front of you in terms of your thoughts your words your deedsWhen you focus on this youre doing what has to be done what should be done the best thing you can doSo these four Sublime Attitudes are not there just to give a warm fuzzy feeling to the mindThey help you gain perspective on what youre doingWhen you have the right perspective its a lot easier to keep focused on the pathTonight Id like us to dedicate our meditation for the people whove died in the events of the past weekThis is a traditional practice in Thailand and in all Buddhist countriesIts based on the realization that when people have passed over the only way you can get in touch with them is through the power of the mind what Ajaan Lee calls the current of the mindAnd the best thing you can do for them is to send them a current of peace a current of goodwill hoping that they find a good rebirthA lot of people have been asking recently about how karma has played out in recent eventsThe Buddha generally discourages trying to trace back exactly what people did that caused them to die in this or that wayHe said that if you tried to trace that back youd go crazy for the issues of karma are so complexThe basic principle is simple Whatever was done with a skillful intention gets a pleasant result whatever was done with an unskillful intention gives an unpleasant resultAnd theres a correspondence between a particular type of unskillful action and a particular type of unskillful resultBut the precise details  What exactly did these people doDid they do it all togetherDid they do it separately  no one can trace those backWhat the Buddha did teach though is to focus on whats the most skillful thing we can do now given the situationThats where the emphasis should lieAnd one thing we can do is to help the world through our meditationMany people think that to sit with your eyes closed like this is irresponsible that were running away from the worldBut when you think about the unhealthy energies people are putting out in the world all day everyday through their thoughts words and deeds the world really needs people who are putting out peaceful energyThats where meditation has a lot to offerThe mind is like a broadcast stationIt sends out currentsIf we create a peaceful steady calming current that has an effect on the world in ways that are hard to trace but theyre thereSo reflect on the fact that all who are born into the human race have unskillful karmaTheres no need to wish ill on anyone no matter whatThe best you can do in difficult circumstances is to figure out the most skillful thing to do right nowYou try not to give in to your emotions not to give in to your fears but to create within your mind as skillful a state as possible as calm and steady and mindful a state as you can and then offer that to other peopleThats one way of helpingAnd when the people are far away its probably the best thing to do right nowSo as youre meditating realize that youre not doing this just for yourselfYoure doing it for the good of the worldAnd you want to do it well do it truly so that it can truly be helpful to others as wellSometimes that thought can give you an extra incentive to be more careful with your meditation to put in more effort than you might feel inclined toWe can all get sloppy thinking Well its just me and Im perfectly content with a sloppy meditation tonight so I can get over with it and get on to something else But what does that kind of meditation do for those who are what the Thais call our companions in aging illness and deathNothing much at allThe general current of energy in the world requires as much calm steady input as possibleSo if this is what youre broadcasting right now make sure youre broadcasting it wellAjaan Mun once said that the only true goodness in the world is goodness without any drawbacks without any harmThere are so many things that are good in one way but harmful in anotherYet the practice of meditation the practice of training the mind is good all around good for ourselves and for the people around usI was talking on the phone this evening to a woman in lower Manhattan who was saying its been very heartwarming to see how New Yorkers  and we know the reputation of New Yorkers  have come out of their usual shells showing kindness in all sorts of ways she would never have imaginedThats the proper response to a disaster to realize one that disasters keep happening all over the world and two when a disaster strikes near home it gives you an opportunity to do your bestThe shame is that when opportunities like this pass we usually get back to our normal ways and tend not to think about doing our best doing the most skillful thingsBut actually thats whats really demanded of us all the timeThis is one of the reasons we develop mindfulness not to be nonreactive but to be mindful of what were doing of what situation were in and of the most skillful thing to be doing right nowKeep that in mind because the principles of karma the laws of karma are not traffic laws that apply only in certain places only at certain times on the south side of the street from to pmon Tuesdays and Thursdays that kind of thingKarma is a law that applies to all of our actions So be skillful at all timesNo matter what the situation no matter how minor or major it may seem weve got the opportunity to do good to act on skillful intentions  not just good intentions but intentions that are skillful as wellThat requires workIt requires trainingThis is what were doing right hereIts important always to keep that in mind no matter how ordinary or extraordinary the situationIts a teaching that applies everywhere What youre doing right now is important so be careful to do your bestOften we like to think that simply by adding meditation to our daily schedule the effects of the meditation will permeate everything without our having to do much of anything elseSimply add the meditation to the mix of your life and it will transform all the other ingredients Thats what wed like to think but it doesnt really work that wayYou have to remake your life to make it a good place for the meditation to seep through because some activities some states of mind arent like fertile soilTheyre like rocksTheyre really resistant to receiving any influence from the meditationThis is why when youre a meditator you also have to look at the way you live your life your daytoday activitiesSee if youre creating a conducive environment for the meditation to thrive and spreadOtherwise the meditation just gets squeezed into the cracks between the rocks here and there and never gets to permeate much of anything at allTheres a teaching in the Canon on five principles that a new monk should keep in mindThese principles apply not only to new monks but to anyone who wants to live a life where the meditation can seep through and permeate everythingThe first principle is virtueMake sure you stick to your preceptsIn the case of monks of course this refers to the PatimokkhaIn the case of lay people it refers to the five precepts and on occasion the eightWhen youre holding to the precepts youre holding to firm principles in your lifeThe Buddha described observing the precepts as a gift both to yourself and to the people around youYou give protection to other peoples lives their property their knowledge of the truthYou protect them from your being drunk you protect them from your engaging in illicit sexAnd when these principles become precepts  in other words promises to yourself that you keep in all circumstances  the Buddha says that youre giving unlimited protection unlimited safety to other beings and you have a share in that safety a share in that protection yourselfSo the precepts create an environment where theres more protectionWhen theres more protection its easier to meditateAt the same time the precepts foster an attitude of givingYou realize that for the sake of your own happiness you have to giveWhen you hold to that attitude you find it easier to meditate because all too often people come to the meditation with a question of What can I get out of this But if youre used to giving and seeing the good results that come from giving youre more likely to ask What can I give to the meditationWhat needs to be given for the good results to come With that attitude youre more willing to give of your time and energy in ways that you might not have been willing to beforeThe second principle for creating a good environment for meditation is restraint of the sensesIn other words youre not only careful about what comes out of your mind youre also careful about what comes in in terms of the things you look at the things you listen to smell taste touch and think aboutBe careful not to focus on things that will give rise to greed anger or delusionIf youre careless in your looking careless in your listening its very difficult to be careful about your thoughts because thoughts are so much more subtleThis doesnt mean that you go around with blinders on your eyes or plugs in your ears it simply means that youre skillful in how you look at things skillful in how you listenIf you know that something tends to arouse lust or anger learn to look at it in a way that counteracts the lust counteracts the angerIn other words if something seems attractive you look for its unattractive sideIf something seems unattractive you look for its attractive sideAs Ajaan Lee says be a person with two eyes not just oneThis is why we chant that passage for the contemplation of the bodyIt doesnt tell us not to look at the body it says to look more carefully at the bodyLook at the parts that arent attractive to balance out the onesided view that simply focuses on a few attractive details here and there and tends to blot out everything else in order to give rise to lustAfter all the body is not what produces lustThe mind produces lustThe mind starts hankering to feel lust and so it goes out looking for something to incite the lust and grabs hold of whatever little details it can find even when those details are surrounded by all sorts of unclean thingsSo keep watch on what comes out of the mind and what comes inFor lay people this means being careful about the friends you associate with the magazines you read the TV you watch the music you listen toBe very careful about how you look at these things how you listen to these thingsAfter a while you find that this is not a case of restricting yourself so much as it is learning to see things more carefully more fully because youre seeing both sides of what used to seem solely attractive or solely repulsiveThis takes some effortYou have to be more energetic in watching out for how you look and listenBut the reward is that the mind is put in much better shape to meditate because youre not filling it up with all sorts of garbage poison or junk food thats going to harm it weaken it or get in the waySo when you sit down to meditate if youve been careless about whats been coming in and out of your mind you find that its like cleaning out a shed after a year of neglectTheres just so much garbage in there that you spend almost the whole hour cleaning it out and then realize that you have only five minutes for any real stillness at the endSo keep the mind clean from the beginning all the timeDont let any garbage in the door or in the windowsIf garbage does come in let it go right outDont collect itThat way you find that you have a much nicer place to sit down and settle in quickly when you create your meditation homeThe third principle for creating a good environment for meditation is restraint in your conversationWhen I first went to stay with Ajaan Fuang he said that lesson number one in meditation is keeping control of your mouthIn other words before you say anything ask yourself Is this necessaryIs this beneficialIs there a good reason to say this If there is then go ahead and say itIf not then keep quietAs he said if you cant control your mouth theres no way youre going to control your mindAnd when you make a habit of asking yourself these questions you find that very little conversation is really necessaryIf youre at work and you need to talk to your fellow workers to create a good atmosphere in the workplace that counts as necessary speechBut often socialgrease speech goes beyond thatYou start getting careless running off with your mouth and that turns into idle chatter which is not only a waste of energy but also a source of dangerTheres so much grease that it gums up the worksOften the things people say that cause the most harm are when theyre just allowing whatever comes in their mind to go right out their mouth without any restraint at allNow if observing this principle means that you gain a reputation for being a quiet person well thats fineYou find that your words if youre more careful about doling them out start taking on more worthAt the same time youre creating a better atmosphere for your mindAfter all if youre constantly chattering all day long how are you going to stop the mental chatter when you sit down to meditateBut if you develop this habit of watching over your mouth the same habit then comes to apply to the meditationAll those mouths in your mind start going stillThe fourth principle is for the monks to frequent wilderness spots to get out of society to find a quiet place to be by yourself so that you can gain perspective on your life perspective on your mind so that whats going on in your mind can stand out in bolder reliefThis principle applies to lay people tooTry to find as much solitude as you canIts good for youWhen people have trouble living in solitude it shows that theres lots of unfinished business insideSo make a little wilderness place in your homeTurn off the TV turn out the lights allow yourself to be alone without a lot of distractionsTell everyone in the house that you need a little time alone on a regular basisWhen you do this you find that things submerged in the depths of your mind come up to the surfaceOnly when they come up to the surface can you deal with themWhen youre alone in this way without a lot of outside input its natural that the mind will tend to stay with the breath more easilyThere may be a lot of mental chatter at first but after a while you get fed up with itYou prefer just to be quietAt the same time you get away from the influence of everybody elses thoughts and opinionsYou have to ask yourself What do you really believeWhat are your opinionsWhats important to you when youre not swayed by the opinions of othersWhich leads to the fifth principle to develop Right ViewRight View has two levelsFirst theres belief in the principle of karma that what you do really does have results  and you really are the one doing itIts not some outside force acting through you not the stars or some god or some force of fateYoure making the decisions and you have the ability to make them skillfully or not depending on your intentionIts important to believe in this principle because this is what gives more power to your lifeIts an empowering belief  but it also involves responsibilitiesThis is why you have to be careful in what you do why you cant be heedlessWhen youre careful about your actions its easier to be careful about your mind when the time comes to meditateAs for the second level of Right View the transcendent level that means seeing things in terms of the four noble truths stress and suffering the cause of stress and suffering the cessation of stress and suffering and the path of practice to that cessationJust look at the whole range of your experience Instead of dividing it up into its usual patterns of me and not me simply look to see Where is there sufferingWhere is there stressWhat goes along with itWhat are you doing that gives rise to that stressCan you let go of that activityAnd what qualities do you need to develop what things do you need to let go of in order to let go of the craving the ignorance underlying the stressWhen you drop craving can you be aware of whats happening All too often when we drop one craving we simply pick up another oneCan you make yourself more and more aware of that space in between the cravings and expand that spaceWhats it like to have a mind without cravingAccording to the Buddha its important to see things in this way because if you identify everything in terms of your self how can you possibly understand anything for what it actually isIf you hold on to suffering as your self how can you understand sufferingIf you look at it simply as suffering without putting this label of me or mine on it you can start seeing it for what it is and learn how to let it goIf its your self if you hold to that belief that its your self you cant let go of itBut looking at things in terms of the four noble truths allows you to solve the problem of suffering once and for allSo start looking at your whole life in this lightInstead of blaming your sufferings on people outside look at what youre doing to contribute to that suffering and focus on dealing with that firstWhen you develop this attitude in everyday life its a lot easier to apply it to the meditationYou create an environment where sticking to the noble path makes more and more senseSo these are the factors that create the environment for the meditation whether youre a new monk living here in the monastery or a lay person living outside the monastery You want to stick to the precepts exercise restraint over the senses practice restraint over your conversation create quiet secluded places for yourself and develop Right ViewWhen you follow these principles they create a more conducive environment for allowing concentration to develop to thriveAt the same time they create a more receptive environment for allowing the results of concentration to permeate out in every directionThis way your practice instead of being forced into the cracks of a hostile alien environment has room to put down roots to grow and to transform everything around itOne of the first things you notice as you try to quiet the mind is the lack of quiet  all the chattering going on all the discussions the dialogs the committee discussions going on up in your head and sometimes all over your bodyThere seems to be neverending chatterOften our first thought as we start to meditate is How can I stop the chatterHow can I just quiet all those voices so things can be perfectly quiet inside But as you practice you begin to realize that you just cant put a stop to things that wayIt requires a more gradual process learning to bring that conversation under controlWhen you start out there are lots unskillful voices in there and frequently the discussion is not being run according to Roberts Rules of OrderThis voice comes barging in that voice yells at you this voice whispers in your earAnd all the subterfuge and techniques of a political meeting are nothing compared with what goes on in the mind  all the tricks the mind plays on itself how the different voices try to get their way  because many of them are not just aimless voices saying random thingsThey have a purpose in saying their thingTheres an urging on to action in one direction or another so they try all kinds of tricks to get their wayThe mind has countless ways of getting a particular idea or a particular motion through the committeeSo to begin with when we work with the mind we want to make that discussion more skillfulAs you start meditating try to gain some detachment from the voices so that youre watching them from outside instead of joining in with the conversation taking on the voices as your ownThis is one of the lessons of the teaching on notself Its not you talking in thereThere are voices in there and youve tended to identify with them but you can begin to disidentify with them as wellTell yourself Im not necessarily responsible for things that come bursting into the mindI dont have to act on the firing of every nerve endI dont have to get involved If a voice comes and urges action just let it urge urge urge and then itll stop after a whileYou can just keep on watchingJust the act of wanting to make that conversation more skillful That in and of itself begins to distance you from itPractice concentrating on the breath as a way of giving you a good firm basis on which to stand so that you can stay outside of the discussionBut simply watching the discussion isnt going to make it go away on its ownYouve also got to learn how to make it more skillfulSometimes that means introducing new voices  like the meditating voice that says Hey stay with the breath stay with the breath make the breath comfortable allow the breath to be comfortableGive us some room hereThis is why the Buddha didnt encourage his monks to take a vow of silenceTheres a story in the Vinaya of a group of monks who began the Rains retreat with a vow Okay were not going to talk to each otherEach person just maintain silence throughout the Rains At the end of the retreat they went to see the Buddha very proud of the fact that they had succeeded in not talking to each other for the entire three monthsBut he didnt praise themInstead he said Youve been living like sheep like dumb animals This inner conversation doesnt become more skillful just by stopping your talkingTo improve your inner conversation you get a lot of help by learning good examples of outer conversationThe first thing to learn as you live together is how to talk to each other in skillful ways  which may mean talking less than you might normally doBut it also means that when something has to be said you figure out the best way to say it the best time the best place the best words to couch your commentsAs you get more skillful with the use of your mouth it forces the mind to get more skillful in the way it thinks and you begin to notice the effects of your wordsIf theres something negative you have to talk about whens the best time to bring it upWhats the most effective way of saying itWhat way of saying it does the least damage to the groupAs you get more skilled in using your mouth this way you find the conversation in your mind will begin to mature as wellOn top of that there are Dhamma tapes you can listen to Dhamma books you can read to introduce new and better voices into the conversationThis is also why we have the chantingSome of the phrases of the chant keep coming back into your head at odd hours of the day and theyre designed to be skillful additions to that conversationYoull notice as you try pulling out of your inner conversations that some conversations are easier to pull out of than othersThe ones filled with recriminations and negative thoughts harmful thoughts Those are the hardest to extract yourself fromBut the conversations in your mind dealing with issues of true happiness issues of being skillful issues of reflecting on whats really important in life Those are a lot easier to pull out of because they tend toward quietude they tend toward concentrationSo as were training the mind its not just an issue of immediately stopping the thinkingIts learning how to think more skillfully and that starts with learning how to use your mouth more skillfullyAs Ajaan Lee once said You should bow down to your mouth every day You have a human mouth and the human mouth has a lot of powerIts not like the mouths of dogs and cats with very limited vocabularies just barks and meowsWe can say all kinds of things and these things can have an enormous effect on our livesIf you start paying attention to what you say in the course of the day and try to make it more skillful you begin to see that it does have an effect on how you relate to other people how other people relate to youThe whole context of your life is strongly affected by your speechAs you work on that fact the act of working on your external speech connects with the issue of working on your own mindThe care you use in framing what you say the thought and circumspection you use as you notice the right time to say it deciding whats worth saying whats not worth saying These things develop mindfulness they develop alertness  all the good qualities you need in the meditationYou learn how to gauge whats worth thinking whats the right time to think whats the wrong time to thinkYour inner speech turns into Right Speech another factor of the pathAt the same time as youve got these better voices in your head its a lot easier to pull out of them and watch them so that you can see When a thought forms how does it formBeneficial thoughts are a lot easier to take apart in this wayThoughts filled with selfrecrimination and regret are very hard to take apart because its so easy to get caught up in their storiesThe more skillful the thinking the easier it is to take apartYou can simply watch the thought calmly as it comes and goes because it doesnt hold any poison for the mindAs you work with the meditation you get quicker and quicker in seeing how the thought forms how it disbands how it can deceive you and how you dont have to be deceivedWhen we talk about making progress in the meditation many of us think that it means very strong experiences of say rapture oneness or lightAnd these things are not to be sneered atTheyre importantThey give a sense of lubrication a sense of refreshment to the practiceBut the real progress is measured in how quickly you notice whats going on in the mindFor example when the mind begins to slip off the faster you catch it and can bring it back Thats a sign of progressAs you get quicker and quicker this way you begin to see the process of thought formation in and of itself  exactly whats happening in thereWhen do you start participating in a thoughtAll too often were aware of a thought only when its fully formed but how did it get formed that wayDid it just happen on its own or was there some subliminal participation on your partAs you watch more and more carefully you begin to find answers to these questions for you can catch the process in actionEach thought starts out as just a little stirring and its hard to say whether its a stirring in the body or a stirring in the mindIts on the borderline between the twoThen theres the act of getting interested paying attention to it followed by the question Whats this thought about Then the mind labels Oh this is a thought about x this is a thought about y And that turns it into a full fledged thoughtSo the question is Can you watch the stirring that would normally lead to a thought and then not participate in labeling it not participate in trying to figure it outWhen you can do this you see that these stirrings come and  if you dont participate in them  they goThey come again and if you still dont participate they goThis way you begin to realize the extent to which thought formation is really an intentional process on your partThe desire to figure out a thought the desire to get into the thought Whats the basis of that desireIs it boredomAre you tired of just being very stillDo you want some entertainmentIts dangerous you knowSome of those thoughts once they get formed take over the mind and turn into nightmaresSo you try to get quicker and quicker in seeing these voices as they form  where theyre coming from exactly how much youre putting into them right now how much of this activity is just the result of past karma bubbling up in the mindYou gain more and more control over the conversations so that when you need to talk about things to yourself you canWhen you dont need to you can keep things quiet and the only conversation that goes on at that time is the part of the mind in control of the concentration saying Stay here stay here spread the awareness here Thats the skillful conversation you want to place in chargeOnce the concentration gets really solid then you can start turning your spotlight on those voices the control center for your concentrationBut dont be in too great a hurry to do thatYou want the concentration really solid before you take those voices apartSo the training of the mind is not a process of stamping out all the mental chatter in the mindIts learning first how to make the chatter more skillful  starting from the outside being more skillful in what you sayThis is why Right Speech is such an important part of the practiceBecause where does speech come fromThe Buddha says it comes from directed thought and evaluation which  when well trained  will turn into factors in your concentrationYou direct your thoughts to the breath you evaluate the breathThat helps get you into the first jhanaBut to get to the point where you can really be effective in using directed thought and evaluation with the breath you have to be more skillful in the way you direct your thoughts and evaluate what you want to say to other people the way you use those powers of directed thought and evaluation to create words both the words you address to other people and the conversation in your own mindThen when that inner conversation gets more skillful you can start taking it apart in even more refined waysFinally when all other conversation is stilled you can turn to question the more subtle voice of the perception in charge of your concentration Whos talking hereWhos it labeling for Thats when things really open up in the mindOf course we all want to jump to that spot where you find the transcendent but to get there it takes skill it takes time it takes perseveranceThats the way it is with any good thing in lifeThings of lasting value take time to masterSo right now weve got an hourDo what you can within the hourAt the very least bring some control into the ongoing committee conversation to make it easier and easier for the chatter to settle downOnce it can settle down you can see it more clearlyThats why the Buddha said that concentration and discernment go togetherYou cant do just insight practice or just concentration practiceThe two of them go hand in handAnd its right here at this issue  these mental voices and how skillful you are in relating to them  thats where the real meat of the practice liesThe mind is always workingIf it were doing just one or two jobs at a time that would be no big problemBut its usually juggling several jobs at onceNo wonder its tiredRelationships responsibilities jobs issues Lots of things are going on in the mind all at onceOften when we start meditating it seems like the meditation is just one more ball to keep in the air one more thing youve got to juggleSo theres no wonder that when people leave the monastery and start trying to juggle the meditation along with everything else they drop some of the ballsAnd usually its the meditation ball that gets droppedThe alternative is to think of the meditation as a way of cutting down on the jobs of the mindThe practice as a whole is a way of cutting down on the jobs and the meditation gives you a place to stand and do your more focused workSo instead of making the breath a job you make it the place where the mind standsIts good to get practice in thisThis is why you need to have time away from your daily life so that you can get used to taking the breath as your foundation lowering your center of gravity so that you stay with the breath at all timesIn Pali the word for the object of the meditation arammana literally means support Its the support for the mindIts what the mind sits on where the mind standsSo at first you have to put some work into getting that foundation solidOnce its solid though you can stand on it it gives you supportThen you can take on the other issues in lifeOne of the purposes of meditation is to put you in a position where you can see which issues are really worth taking on and which ones are notBeing with the breath helps here in that it makes you more and more sensitive to the movements of the mind more sensitive to what youre doing to where theres wasted energyAt the same time the breath gives you a place where you stand apart a bit from the activities of the world so that you see them in a new lightAgain this is one of the reasons why you have to come out and take some time away from those activities to get used to looking at things in that light from the point of view of an outsider someone whos not totally involved not totally taken inThe Buddha recommended that his monks go off into the wilderness places where they could get away from people so they could have a chance to evaluate whats really worthwhile in lifeYou try to develop what might be called a deathbed perspective Suppose youre lying on your deathbed looking back on your lifeWhat things are you going to wish you had doneWhat things are you going to wish you hadntLearn to look at your life as a whole in that way choosing your priorities instead of just taking on whatever little bits and pieces are thrown up at you in daytodaytoday activitiesOtherwise your life gets frittered away in meaningless things trivial pursuits and the important issues get pushed to the sideBut when you step out for a while you begin to get a sense of your life as a wholeWhat do you want to do with itWhats a worthwhile use of your timeOften you hear of people who are told by the doctor that they have say two or three months left to live and suddenly they start dropping a lot of unimportant activities to focus on the things they find really important in lifeIts good that theyre getting focused in this way the shame is that they had to wait until the last three months of their livesOne of the purposes of meditation is to let you step back from your life while you still have time so its not just three months that are lived wisely with a sense of their importanceYou can live your whole life with a sense of its importance with a sense of directionEven if you decide that you want to stay involved in your ordinary activities still youre doing it from a different perspective  youve got that foundation from the time you spent separatelyYou carry that perspective with you as a foundation developed with the breath as your supportAs a result you dont have to juggle so much and you have a more solid place to stand when you do have to juggle the affairs of daily lifeYou can see which balls are worth dropping which are not really worth trying to keep in the air so that you can focus on whats really importantSo even though the meditation is work  and thats what the word kammatthana means its our work as meditators the object were focusing on  dont think of it as one more burden to add to the mindIts a new more secure place for the mind to stand a place where it can get a better sense of its prioritiesThat way when you leave the monastery and go back into everyday activities youve got a foundation to take with youSo get to know the breathLearn to be on good terms with itIf youre not on good terms with the breath if you seem to be fighting it all the time its not going to become a good foundationThis means giving it some time to show itself for what it isYou can nudge it a little bit here or thereIf it seems too long you can make it a little bit shorterIf it seems too short make it a little bit longerIf it needs to be deeper more shallow heavier lighter  whatever  you can nudge it in those directionsBut then give it some time to show its results once its been nudgedIf you want it to be your friend you have to be friends with itYou have to give it a chance to speak for itselfYou have to listenListen carefully to what the breath energy in the body is telling you right nowWhat kind of energy feels good for the bodySometimes when youre tired you want good long inbreaths to energize the bodyWhen youre feeling tense you might try long outbreaths to let the tension dissolve awayYou may find that certain parts of the body that havent been involved in the breathing process really would like to get involved or it would feel good for them to get involvedBut if you learn to read the sensations from your body you can tell which parts of the body are lacking breath energyThink of the breath going to them for the next breath and then the next until that part of the body feels fullThen search for any other parts of the body that could use some good breath energyLet them get involved in the breathing tooSo even though this is work its work in establishing a foundationAnd while youre here its the only thing you have to worry aboutYou have no other responsibilities just be in touch with the breath the way the breath feelsHow far does the sensation of the breath go down into the bodyExamine it Is there any line in the body where you say This part is breath and this part is not breathOr do you have a sense that the whole body could be involved in the breathing processExplore this so as to get to know the breath to listen to the breathThe more carefully you listen to it the more you learn about itAnd the more you learn about it the more it can be your friend to help you with all the various jobs the mind has to undertakeSo while youre here you dont have to listen to the Dhamma talk  just listen to your breathWhat kind of breathing feels good right nowUse your imaginationSay Well how about breathing like thatHow about breathing like this and then see what happensThis way you get to know the breath in ways you might not have otherwiseIf you dont experiment theres no knowledge gainedYou dont know why things happenBut if you know that if you change the breath in this way you got those results you change the breath in that way you got these results Thats knowledgeIt comes from participatingIt comes from actingIt comes from doingAt the same time there has to be a part of the mind that just watches just evaluates observesSo youre learning from a combination of two factors your improvisation using your ingenuity in adjusting the breath to make it feel better and then your powers of observation to see what works and what doesntWhen I was staying with Ajaan Fuang these were the two words he used more than any others when giving meditation instructions to improvise and to be observant  to see what works what doesntThis way you develop a friendship with the breathWhen youre friends with the breath you feel at home with it its a good place to stayWhen you get used to staying here then it really can become your foundationWhen you leave the monastery and go back out to your daily life youve got a solid place to standYoure not constantly buffeted around by what other people are saying or doingYouve got your inner foundation your inner refugeAs long as youre on good terms with the breath thats the best relationship you can haveOther relationships come and goEven our family comes and goesAs long as youre alive the mind has to be on good terms with the body the body should be on good terms with the mindAll our relationships in life are based on how well the body and mind relate to each otherWhen youre on good terms with your breath its easier to be on good terms with other peopleWhen you have goodwill for the breath it teaches you how to have goodwill for othersAt the same time when the body and mind are working together they get their work doneThey arent fighting at crosspurposesIn this way they validate each otherYou dont have to go looking for outside validation youve got your inner validation as to what feels right what feels good because youre really observantAs you develop your powers of observation they get more and more reliableSo try to be sensitive to whats going on here in the body going on in here in the breathIt may require work it may be a job that youre not used to but as you get more and more used to it it becomes more and more secondnatureThen you find that it really is a helper it really is an assistant in whatever other work youve got to doIn other words when youre driving the car youre standing in the breath driving the carWhen talking to other people youre staying in the breath talking to other peopleAll your activities get brought into the breath in this wayThe breath becomes the foundation that underlies them all  the solid floor on which you stand so can you can juggle your activities with skillAnd with a continuous foundation like this your life isnt chopped up into little bits a little time for this a little for thatIt all becomes time to be with the breath and then to work from the breath on whatever else you need to do in the course of the dayThe word sati in Pali has lots of meaningsThe basic one is to keep something in mindWere often told it means alertness or awareness but thats not the caseAlertness and awareness come under the Pali word sampajaññaSati means keeping something in mind like remembering to stay with the breath remembering the various things that help in the training of the mindIt functions a lot of ways in the practiceFirst off there are the recollections a series of themes to remember to think about to keep in mind when you find your meditation wandering off course in the direction of doubt laziness discouragement or just general hopelessnessThat chant we had just now about aging illness separation and death Those are important things to keep in mind so that you dont get complacentBut notice that the Buddha didnt stop at aging illness separation and deathHe went on to the principle of karma because if all you think about is aging illness and death it gets pretty discouragingThe potential for happiness lies in our actionsIn other words the Buddha didnt teach fatalismHe didnt teach that our actions are insignificantTheyre importantOur happiness our lack of happiness depends on our actionsSo thats where we focus our attentionThats what we should keep in mindThis is called dhammanussati keeping the Dhamma in mindThis is why the Buddha has us listen to the Dhamma read the Dhamma because the Dhamma contains all sorts of useful and encouraging ideasFor instance theres the passage where the Buddha is talking to his son and says that when you make a mistake resolve not to make it againIf you see that your actions have gone off course resolve not to do them againWhen theyve been on course develop a sense of happiness and joyOften we mistrust that joyWe think somehow that the critical thoughts in our mind are more real and that the more selfcongratulatory thoughts are deludedWell thats not the caseWhen you do something right you should congratulate yourself on it as a means of encouragement to give some juice to the pathOtherwise its very easy for things to get dryIf you criticize yourself about your actions all the time you find yourself totally hemmed inRemember that you do do some things rightFocus on those to put the mind in a good moodIn Thai they use the word arom to mean both mood and objectWhen were meditating were looking for a good arom both a good mood and good objectSo thats an important thing to keep in mind as wellThats another function of sati mindfulnessIf youre feeling discouraged about yourself focus on two of the recollections silanussati caganussati thinking about the times when you did hold to your principles when you were generousCall those to mind as a way of giving yourself energy on the pathThis doesnt mean that you have to reflect on examples of perfect virtue or perfect generosityReflect on what youve been able to do as a means of encouragementSo there are topics of recollection to deal with just about every direction the mind can go when it falls off the path topics of recollection to bring it back onto the pathOnce youre on the path its important to reflect again on what sati or mindfulness means Youre keeping something in mindSay for instance that youre keeping the breath in mindYoure tuning in to that part of your experienceOur experience has many layersYou might think of it as many frequencies like the radio waves going through the air right now lots of different frequencies coming right through this building from Los Angeles San Diego Tuscon TijuanaIf you bring a shortwave radio in here you can tune in to lots of different stations from all over the worldIts simply a matter of choosing which frequency to tune in to which layer to tune in toThe same holds true when youre keeping the breath in mindWhen you create a frame of reference here in the present moment there are lots of things you can tune in toYou can choose the body in and of itselfYou can choose feelings mental states mental qualities in and of themselvesThose frequencies are on the pathOther frequencies are off the path  there is such a thing as Wrong Mindfulness you knowOur meditation consists of choosing the frequencies most beneficial for the mindSo try tuning in to the breath in and of itselfBe aware of the breath making it your point of reference in relationship to everything you do while youre sitting here quietly with your eyes closedEven when you get up and walk away try to stay tuned in to the breathWhen you do work stay with the breath when you rest stay with the breathIf youre going to change your frame of reference try to be deliberate about itIn the sutta on the frames of reference the Buddha talks about being aware of the body in and of itself either internally or externallyExternally means how the body relates to the world outsideIn other words you dont have to be only inside the body for it to count as Right MindfulnessWhen youre dealing with other people you need to have a frame of reference that includes the outside world but doesnt grab hold of itYou can stay tuned in to the body even as youre involved in dealing with other people being sensitive to how those dealings register with the bodyThen when youre sitting again with your eyes closed you can make your frame of reference totally internal if you likeOr you can tune in to the sense of space that permeates the body and extends out in all directionsSo there are a lot of different things to tune in to that would qualify as the body in and of itselfIts important to realize this because sometimes we fall into an ironclad notion that only certain kinds of awareness count as mindfulnessWe feel that were strapped there and cant functionThere are reports of people who go for long retreats where theyve been working on only one kind of mindfulness for three months and when they come out they cant functionIt takes them a couple of days to readjust to being in the outside worldWell the Buddha didnt have us practice so that we couldnt function couldnt adjust couldnt adaptHe simply wants you to be conscious and deliberate about the way you adapt the different levels the different layers the different frequencies youre tuning in toIf you can shift levels mindfully youre okayTheres an old science fiction story about a spaceship that didnt have to use fuelIt moved by changing its frame of referenceIf its frame of reference was here on earth it would stay still on earthIf it switched its frame of reference to the sun it would suddenly zip out into space away from the direction the earth is revolving around the sunIf it switched its frame of reference to the center of the galaxy it would shoot way out there to other arms of the Milky WayAnd the plot of the story revolved around the fact that when the ship changed its frame of reference everybody in the ship would go unconscious for a whileWell this is exactly how our minds workNormally we change our frame of reference who knows how many times in the course of a day and we blank out for a moment in betweenAjaan Lee even said that we pass out for just a brief moment and then find ourselves in another frame of referenceThe purpose of the practice were doing right now is to be able to change our frames of references without blanking out so that were clear about what were doingThats what alertness is all aboutIn this way we can function appropriatelyWhen youre dealing with people you choose the proper frame of reference that includes them that includes that level of reality that level of experienceWhen youre sitting here with your eyes closed you can drop that frame of referenceYou dont have to think about there being anyone else here in the room at allInstead you can focus totally on the breath in and of itselfIn this way you see how much your frames of reference really do depend on memory another meaning of satiWhat are you going to remember in order to deal skillfully with the reality before youYou can be selectiveIn fact you have to beYears back when I was a young monk in Thailand the monastery where I was ordained had a rotating roster of monks to give the evening Dhamma talksOut of the fourteen monks on the roster maybe two could give good talksThe rest I found really irritatingAfter a while I realized that rather than giving in to my irritation I could use the talk as a meditation exercise how to be aware of the sound of the Dhamma talk without registering the meaning  in other words deliberately forgetting the meaning of each word and remembering only to be with the level of the soundThats a function of sati or mindfulness too deciding what youre going to remember and what youre not going to remember what youre going to apply to your experience and what youre notI found that after a while I could just listen to the sound word by word by word consciously forgetting the last word to be present only with the sound of the current wordIt worked fairly easily because Thai wasnt my native language but you might want to try the skill out yourselfIf you dont like the Dhamma talks you hear around here you can just be with the soundYou dont have to listen to the meaningBe selectively forgetfulTo be consciously forgetful in that way requires an act of mindfulness  in other words deciding which level youre going to tune in to while you let everything else go for the time beingIf youre going to work on concentration youll want to stay on one level as consistently as possibleThis is why concentration practice is best done alone or in areas where you dont have to interact much with other peopleBut you also need to learn how to balance it with interactions with other people in a peaceful way so you can get skilled at consciously changing your frame of reference as appropriateThis is why we live in a communityOur ability to live together is an important skill in the meditation for its in the changing of our frame of reference that a lot of the machinations of the mind become clearWe tend not to see them if we let our awareness blank out during the switch but if we can learn to be conscious as we switch from one frame to the next we begin to see the way the mind creates a reality for itself out of all the whole buzzing confusion of our senses to use William James termOf all the sensory input that comes in at any one particular moment you make a choice of what youre going to pay attention to what memories what frame of reference youre going to bring to that particular momentAnd its an important mental skill to be able to shift your frame of reference as necessarySo remember that thats all part of the practiceIts not the case that were really being mindful only when were on the level of pure sensationWere also mindful as we shift our frame of reference to be appropriate to whatever is neededIf you go into the kitchen and youre totally on the level of pure sensation youre going to forget how to fix the foodYou have to remember enough to fix the foodWhen youre dealing with other people you have to remember enough about common courtesy remember enough about the English language in order to deal with themBut you can be selectively forgetful while youre sitting here with your eyes closed so that you can give your full attention to the task at handYou can take this skill and apply it to all sorts of situationsMindfulness is not just one level of awareness one level of experienceIt means being very deliberate and clear about what you bring to whatever youre doing what youre going to remember what youre not going to remember what youre going to recollect what youre going to let go which things are useful to recollect right nowIf you wanted to you could sit here and spend the whole hour thinking about facts that would make you totally miserable but what does that accomplishWere sitting here to think about things that are useful for the mind so remember the things that are useful for the mind that will help it developAs for the other voices coming in and out of the mind listen to the ones that are helpful and ignore the ones that are notYou can be selectiveThis way mindfulness becomes a quality we can apply to everything we doAnd instead of making us unable to function it actually heightens our ability to function because we understand the process that the mind goes through as it shifts its frame of reference from pure sensation to remembering language remembering customs whatever needs to be applied to your current situation to your current taskSo try to keep these points in mind whenever you find them usefulOne of Ajaan Muns favorite topics for a Dhamma talk was the theme of practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma  in other words in accordance with what the Dhamma demands not in accordance with what our likes and dislikes demandAs the Dhamma comes to the West this is probably one of the hardest things for Westerners to appreciateEverywhere you look the Dhamma is being remade recast so that people will like itThings that people dont like are quietly cut away and if things that people like are missing theyre added onAnd so the creature that comes out is like the old cartoon of a committee designing a bird The bird looks pretty good to begin with but then after the committees done with it it looks like an ostrich with no legsIt cant walk and it cant fly but it sellsIn this country of ours where democracy and the marketplace are allpowerful the question of what sells determines whats Dhamma even if it cant walk or flyAnd who loses outWe lose outThe Dhamma doesnt lose out its always what it isBut we like to add a little here take away a little there and as a result we end up with nothing but things we already like and already dislikeThe Buddha pointed out the four ways that people get led off courseTwo of them are following your likes and dislikes the other two are giving in to delusion and fearThese things pull people off the pathWe go wandering into the underbrush and then off to whoknowswhere simply because we like to follow what we like and to avoid what we dislike  even though the things we dislike are often the things weve got to really look at carefullyWhy do we have such a dislike for themAnd as for the things that we like why do we like themExactly what do they do for usIts easy to doubt other peopleIts easy to doubt the teachingsBut for some reason we find it very hard to doubt our defilements  all these convictions and preconceived notions were unwilling to give upOnly when were willing to put them aside and open ourselves to the possibility Okay maybe theyre wrong can we open ourselves to the DhammaWhat this comes down to is respectThe Buddha says that the reason were suffering is because of the craving in our minds and yet we like to hold on to our cravingWere attached to itOf all the things were attached to in life thats probably the hardest thing to let go our attachment to our cravingsAnd its precisely here that the Buddha says Thats the problemSo its a question of how much were willing to suffer before we say Maybe hes right and give some respect to his teachings  to take our respect for our likes and our dislikes our preconceived notions of whats right and wrong whats good and bad to put them aside for the time being and give some respect to what the Buddha has to sayFor all of us this is very hardIts not hard just for AmericansIts hard for everybodyBut given our culture these days it seems especially hard for us so we have to be especially careful about this issue  of taking only what we like and avoiding what we dislike in the practiceWhat do we miss out on when we do that given that so much of the practice goes against the grainWe like to create little worlds for ourselves  this is called the effluent of becoming that comes fermenting up in the mind  and were really good at itWe can create all kinds of worlds beautiful worlds ugly worlds delightful worlds horrible worldsThe movies that play in the theatres are nothing compared to the productions we can create in our minds over and over and over againWere really good at itWe get our entertainment that wayIts a game we like to playThere are two parts of the mind the part that likes to fool itself and the part that likes to be fooledIts like little kids playing togetherOkay Ill be the doctor you be the patient or Ill be the doctor you be the nurse or whateverThe two parts of the mind say Okay lets play along and then they dive into the makebelieveThis is something we do so well day after day after dayWhen we come to the practice we want it to be another fun thing to do we want to be entertained so when were told to deconstruct these things its very difficultWere very good at putting together at creating these worlds but deliberately stepping out of them is hardIts only when we begin to realize that the more we keep creating these trains of thought that we love to follow backwards and forwards the more we create suffering for ourselvesThats when we begin to wonder Maybe theres a way out maybe theres something betterThe Buddha has a teaching on whats called transcendent dependent coarisingIt starts with the regular chain of dependent coarising up to suffering and then adds But based on suffering comes conviction At some point you have to suffer enough to say There must be a way out And youre going to look for that way outYoure serious about it this timeYoure willing to make whatever sacrifices are needed even if it means sacrificing your pride sacrificing your attachment to your craving sacrificing all these little worlds you create for yourself to fill up the dayYou want to see through that processIts not easy but the results are more than you can imagine better than you can imagineUp to now youve been living in imaginary worlds and look at where theyve gotten you not all that farBut if you learn to step outside them you find that things are much wider open than you could have imaginedEven after just the first stages when the mind settles down into states of concentration you find that whatever presents itself as an object of discussion or elaboration of the mind you can just say No no no not interested You can shoot it down shoot it down zap it out of your range of awarenessThis yields a great sense of spaciousnessEven on just this level you begin to realize about this process weve been following for so long Maybe the Buddhas right maybe there is a way outEvery now and then we chant about having respect for concentrationLearn how to have respect for that quiet spot in the mind the spot thats not creating any interesting ideas not creating any interesting conversationIts just a very quiet still spot in the mind that hasnt yet settled down anywhereAllow it to settle down on the breath and just stay right thereCatch it if it seems to be moving off in any other directionBring it backLearn how to freeze the mind at that spotIn other words as soon as it seems to move to pick up something just stop it stop it stop it and then allow it to relax in that stopped position and stay thereThe mind may complain Well theres nothing interesting going on here this is pretty dumb Okay just let it complain but dont listen to itAfter a while as you train yourself to grow comfortable with this quiet spot you wont need to freeze yourself thereYou find it natural simply to plug into it for its a good place to beLearn how to develop this skill  and it really is an important skill  this willingness to give up on your normal inner conversations and try something really newIt requires some imagination to try itAnd it requires a lot of mindfulness and a lot of alertness to stay there because were so good at creating little worlds right away letting these things bubble up and flow outThe problem is they keep bubbling up and flowing out until they overwhelm you in a floodThe word asava or outflows effluents fermentations The list for these  sensuality becoming views and ignorance  is the same as the list for the ogha or floods when the things that bubble out are allowed to drown the mindLearn how to keep your head above waterLearn how to keep these fermentations in checkIf youre going to create something in the mind then create this sense of stillness this sense of centeredness this sense of expansive awarenessWork at this because what youre doing is taking those raw materials taking your tendencies to create things and turning them in the right directionYoure bringing those tendencies in line with the Dhamma with the Dhamma that points outwardIt says LookFreedom lies in this directionYouve tried lots of other things why dont you really give this a serious tryAjaan Suwat often mentioned that one of Ajaan Muns two favorite Dhamma talk topics was the customs of the noble ones the ariyavamsa in PaliOne of his reasons for focusing on this teaching was something that we tend to miss when we look at the forest tradition from an American perspectiveFrom our perspective its a very Thai traditionBut Ajaan Mun got a lot of flack in his day for going against Thai customs Laotian customs  following the dhutanga practices eating only one meal a day eating out of his bowl living out in the forestPeople criticized him for this saying that he was breaking with Thai customHis response was that he wasnt interested in Thai customs or Lao customs or anybodys customs aside from the customs of the Noble OnesHe said If theyre not the customs of the Noble Ones then theyre the customs of people with defilementThat applies to American customs European customs customs all over the worldOnly the customs of the Noble Ones he said can keep you on track to the Noble Attainments So its good to keep those customs in mind as were practicingThere are four all together but the one immediately relevant to what were doing right here as were meditating is the fourthThe first three have to do with the use of the requisites You make do with whatever food clothing or shelter you haveIf you dont get good food clothing or shelter youre not upsetYoure content with what youve gotIf you do get good things you dont get carried away you dont get carelessAt the same time you dont pride yourself over the fact that youre more content with these things than other people areYou use the requisites without doing harm to yourself or to anyone elseThose are the first threeYoud think listening to the first three that the fourth would deal with medicines but it doesntThe fourth has to do with delighting in developing delighting in letting go  in other words delighting in developing good qualities in the mind delighting in letting bad qualities goIn fact the word bhavana developing here is the same word for meditation but it means specifically developing whatever good qualities are needed in the mindNo matter how much effort needs to be invested in developing mindfulness and alertness youre happy to put in the effortYou see the benefits that come from training the mindThe same with delighting in letting go Many things that we really should let go of are things we hold onto dearlyIn terms of the customs of the Noble Ones though you have to learn to delight in letting go to delight in renunciation to delight in giving those things up for you see the benefits that come when you give them upAs long as you have these two attitudes youre on the pathIn other words you realize that theres always room for improvement either in terms of developing good qualities or letting go of bad onesThe question often comes Is my practice good enough Well are you an arahant yetIf not its not yet good enoughTheres more to be doneThats setting a very high standardMany people dont like living with high standards but remember what happens when you set a target for archery You never hit higher than you aimIf you wish for true happiness aim high and then try to live with high standardsThis means on the one hand not being complacentOn the other hand it means not browbeating yourself over the fact that you havent reached the goal not getting discouraged in ways that will actually get in the way of your reaching the goalYou need to have the right attitude toward making progress along the path focusing on what needs to be done rather than on your image of what or where you areWhat this means is that you dont get down on yourself but you realize that theres always a better way to do thingsYou learn how to focus cheerfully on where to improveThis is why so much of the practice lies in focusing on the present moment because this is where the improvements can be madeIt also involves learning where to focus in the present moment  realizing that a lot of the big abstract issues in the mind come down to events very specific patterns of eventsThis is a lot of what discernment is seeing the processes of the mind as they give rise to greed anger and delusion or to mindfulness concentration and discernmentEven though these things have abstract names theyre specific eventsChoices are made each time you breathe in each time you breathe outLook for the specific choice look for the specific movement of intention that heads either in a skillful or an unskillful directionTry to notice the trigger points that set off anger set off delusion set off greed or fearAlso look for the trigger points that help develop mindfulness that remind you of what you should be doingIn other words learn to break down the big job facing you into specific events in the mind specific choices in the mindSee where you can make a difference with the specifics right here right nowThis is a constant learning processIf you want to gain a sense of confidence in the practice gain it from the fact that youre always willing to learn instead of talking about how good you already are  which is a very hollow sense of confidence because it always has to be shored up as its crumbling awayIf youre willing to learn all the time it can give you a solid basis for confidence on the pathI noticed that Ajaan Suwat even though hed gone very far on the path was always working on a little something here and thereSometimes hed take a volume of the Canon down to his hut read about things see if he could expand his knowledge of some of the details of the DhammaA year or two before he left America he asked me to come up with the English translations that we chant here in the eveningUp to that point wed been chanting in Pali and Thai during the morning and evening chantsOne day he said Its time we had some English translations around here So I worked them up and he memorized themIt took him quite a while because English was of course not his native language and he had never formally studied it but he memorized the chant in EnglishHe was always working at somethingWhat this attitude requires is humility realizing that theres room for improvement and that there are lessons to be learned all aroundIve been reading a book on tracking animals the physical and mental skills needed to go out into the wilderness and notice things that you wouldnt ordinarily noticeThe author says that one of the qualities needed in tracking is empathy empathy for the animals youre trying to follow realizing that you have something to learn from themEven though theyre common animals theyve got something to teachYou empathize with them and you have humilityAs he says those are two qualities sorely lacking in our societyWe reward people who come on with a really strong sense of selfconfidence a sense of selfesteem a strong sense of prideAnd yet those attitudes get in the way of learning a lot of subtle important thingsSo remember were here to learn  not only from the obvious places such as Dhamma books and Dhamma talks but also from all the specific things around usTheyre teaching us lessons in terms of cause and effectLast week someone came with the question of how to welcome difficult events in lifeWell look on them with humilityTheres a lesson to be learnedWhen youre open to learning that lesson you gain in knowledgeThat way theres hopeWhen you close off your willingness to learn theres no hope for you on the pathSo even with little things like sitting here with the breath You watch one breath and you can ask yourself How can this breath be more comfortable than the one before it Look and see what your sense of the body has to tell you that wayIt might be a part of the body youve been ignoring all alongGive it some good breath energyThen when the next breath comes in heres another chance to learn from the breathAnd the lesson might be Dont mess with meJust sit and watch But whatever the lesson try to watch carefullyTry to empathize with each breathAnd try not to be mechanical in the way you breathe thinking that if you can somehow get through a thousand breaths youre going to gain AwakeningIts best to take each breath one at a time because thats all youve got one breath at a timeWere not just trying to get through the breathing to the end of the hourWe want to open up and appreciate each breath for what it has to teach usIt teaches us about the processes of breathing it teaches us about where our blind spots have beenSo approach the breath with an attitude of humility and empathyDelight in the opportunity it gives you  each time you breathe in each time you breathe out  to abandon unskillful mental qualities and develop skillful ones more mindfulness more alertness more consistency in the way you make an effort in the meditationSeveral skills are involved hereIn addition to the attitude of empathy with the breath and humility in learning the Dhamma theres also an ability to break down the larger issues in this recalcitrant mind of ours into smaller onesWe have to learn how to break down all of its unskillful qualities into manageable bits so that we can really observe how they take controlThat way we can see how specific skillful qualities can be strengthened to fend them offYou can read the books and learn all about the names for these skillful and unskillful qualities but to get results you really have to be alert and sensitive to each individual movement of the mindThis is where the humility lies because a lot of time the lessons were going to learn are the lessons that come from little thingsA few days ago I was in a Dhamma discussion in Laguna Beach and we got into the first precept dealing with ants and termitesAfter a while someone made a sarcastic comment Gee what a profound Dhamma discussion were having here talking about ants and termites Well that comment misses the whole pointThe way we treat ants and termites is very important in our practiceIts in how we deal with the little things that spreads out and influences how we deal with the larger issuesIf you learn to show respect for ants and termites it means you can learn how to show respect for other things as well little things that you wouldnt anticipateTheres that classic story about the Buddha during his quest for AwakeningHe had attained all the states the teachers of his time recommended but he still wasnt satisfiedHe had tried years of selftorture but hadnt gotten anywhereHe was at an impasseThen he came across the simile of the lute that was strung too tight the lute that was strung too looseOne version of the story says that a woman happened to pass by in the forest singing a song on this topicHe learned something from her that he hadnt learned from all the highly respected teachers of those timesThats whats meant by an attitude of humility a willingness to learn from the little things no matter where they show themselvesHumility requires being attentive watchful not assuming that you already know that youre already good realizing that theres always room for improvementYou have to delight in that fact to delight in actually making the improvements letting go of the unskillful qualities in the mind developing the skillful onesThis is how we follow the customs of the Noble OnesAnd that way we open ourselves to the opportunity of experiencing the attainments that the Noble Ones have attainedAn important part of learning how to meditate lies in learning how to play with your meditationFor example when youre focusing on your breath you want to learn how to play with your breathTo understand why look at what you do when youre playingYoure trying out new things youre enjoying the fact that the mind can create something and can think of new ways of doing thingsLook also at the different approaches to playingSome games are played without rules but a lot of games have rulesIn fact the more rules the more fun the game is the more of a challengeWhen youre playing with the breath there are certain rulesThe satisfaction comes in learning how to master the rules play within the rules and yet still play wellWhen you win at this game youre winning out over your defilementsYoure winning out over greed anger and delusionBut in the meantime the important thing about playing is that what youre doing isnt drudgeryIts funResearchers have found that people whose work doesnt challenge them doesnt inspire them are the ones most likely to get Alzheimers because the brain isnt engagedPlaying requires intelligenceIt develops a certain kind of intelligence precisely the kind of intelligence that we want to develop in the practiceIts not the intelligence that simply memorizes things and as one of my professors used to say vomits them back out on an examIts the intelligence that sees problems and can work with themIt sees problems that other people didnt see and can also see connections that other people didnt see  how a lesson you learned in this part of the practice can be applied to that part of the practice  and it can test to see if the connection has any practical valueThats the kind of intelligence the kind of playing were talking aboutAfter all what is the DhammaIts a set of strategies  strategies for gaining happiness given the fact that there are certain laws governing the way action gives resultsThe laws are a little complex like the laws governing turbulence in waterTheyre complex but not mechanicalThats what makes them challenging like taking a boat through rapidsAnd the purpose of the practice is what makes you want to rise to the challengeAfter all it is your happiness at stake hereWhen you come to the practice you already have certain strategies for becoming happyOur whole sense of self is just that a strategyYou learn to identify which things are worth looking after to see that the wellbeing of certain things is more productive of happiness than the wellbeing of other thingsHaving a sense of self also teaches you to deny yourself certain things now so that you get better results in the futureIt inspires you to practiceIt inspires you to get skillfulThats a positive side of the sense of selfIt also reminds you that youre responsible for your happiness that you cant sit around and simply expect it to come to youThats another positive side to the sense of selfAnd in the practice were encouraged to think in that wayThis is why we chant the passage on being subject to aging illness death and separation for thats the predicament in which we find ourselvesIf you didnt have a sense of self you wouldnt see it as a problem if you have an immature sense of self you wouldnt have any idea of how to go about solving the problemSo your sense of self is an important strategy but remember Its just that a strategyIf you dig around to find anything of lasting value thats worth identifying as Yes this is my self  if you look at it carefully it starts dissolving awayYou can use that sense of self as a strategy when its useful but after a certain point you have to start taking that strategy apart because theres a more subtle strategy the notself strategy that leads to a more subtle happinessBut in both cases if you can learn to play with these concepts to see exactly how far theyre useful and where theyre no longer useful thats when the practice really seeps into you because the things you play with are really close to your heartWhat is your heartOn the one hand its the ability to fabricate and on the other hand its the ability to experience the pleasure or lack of pleasure that comes from the fabricationAnd right there is where youre going to look for AwakeningRight there is where youre going to look for the Deathless right in this ability to fabricate and in your sensitivity to how much your fabrication is leading to happinessThe path is something you fabricate so learn how to play well with the path within the strictures the rules formed by the laws of causalityAs with any game youve got to stay within the rules but within the rules you find that theres a lot of latitudeWhat kind of meditation object works best for youThats something youve got to find out by playing with the different objects of meditation and learning to see which object you enjoy playing with most  the one you keep coming back to coming back to because it sparks your imaginationAjaan Fuang once told the story of Ajaan Kongmaa complaining to Ajaan Lee How can you meditate on the breathIts just in and out in and outThats all there is to it And Ajaan Lee said to him If thats all you see in it then thats all youll get from it Ajaan Lee saw a lot of other things thereIf you read his Dhamma talks youll see that he continued exploring the breath all the way up to the end of his lifeHe was always finding new ways of looking at the breath new ways of playing with the breath energy new strategies of conceiving the breath energy to help the mind settle down quickly and comfortably and have it stay there for long periods of timeTo play this game you have to see the wandering mind the curious mind that wanders around getting itself in trouble as a problem but youve also got to see the curiosity as a potential for helping you with the pathYou can use it to explore the breath to work with the breath in different ways to get the mind to settle down to get it engrossed in the present momentAnd whats more engrossing than playingWith some things you can play with them for a while and you lose interest for youve taken them as far as they can provide entertainmentBut with the breath you can keep exploring here exploring there and then as you get more intimate with the breath you finally get more intimate with the processes of the mindThe thinking  the directed thought and evaluation Play with those see how subtle they can get see what level of wellbeing they can give what level of gratification they can give in the present momentTo begin with try different ways of adjusting the breathSometimes all you need to do is think and the breath will changeThink Comfortable breath Think Full breath You dont have to do anything else  just think that thought maintain that thought and see what happens to the process of breathing in the bodyOr if you want you can play with your focusInstead of focusing on just one spot try to focus on two spots at onceI personally always find that rivetingOne spot can be in the middle of the head the other spot can be down in the body  say at the base of the spine  and think of a line connecting the twoTry to be aware of both spots all at once all the timeWhen you can maintain that double focus the mind doesnt have any other hands to latch onto thingsOne hand is holding on to one spot the other hand is holding on to the other Your hands are fullSo theres a lot to play with a lot to work with here in the present momentAjaan Fuang would often say Try this approachIf it doesnt work try something else in the same way a coach would say Well if that way doesnt work try this to encourage you to experiment to judge the results to start thinking on your ownIf you try one approach and it doesnt work there may be other approaches you can think of that will workIts important that you engage the inventive side of your mind as you meditate learning how to use it so that its not just wandering off in abstract imagination but so that its actually applied to whats going on right here right nowPut it into play as part of your practiceWhat were doing is learning where true happiness comes fromTrue happiness is not going to be dull so keep your interest up keep your expectations upAnd this requires a sense of playThere are certain challenges that youre bound to run up against and the element of play provides the side of you thats up for the challenge How about thisHow do you get around this problemHow do you get around that problem Play wouldnt be fun if there werent rules you run up against certain facts of life you run up against and you find them challengingSo youve got this mind thats creating suffering for itselfIts busy concocting things all day longSee that as a challengeHow can you take that process of concoction the way the mind randomly fabricates this that and the other thing and turn it to better uses so that it can concoct the path that leads to true happinessThats the challenge weve got hereWe use the breath  the inandout breath the breath in the nerves the breath in the blood vessels the breath energy that goes up as we breathe in the energy that goes down as we breathe in the energy thats always coming up the spine  as tools in responding to that challengeWe use the things we learn about the mind as we stay with the breath as ways of responding to that challengeWe get directions from the books we get directions from teachers but a lot of the insight thats actually going to liberate us comes from experimenting with this approach playing with this idea experimenting with that strategy on our own seeing what works what doesnt workIf its not working what can you do to adjust it so it doesThe curious inquisitive side of your mind is whats going to lead to discernmentThe people who arent inquisitive are the ones who get stuck in concentration and dont want to moveOr they blindly want to follow a method where everything is spelled out for them but all they get is prepackaged meditation product  like the packaged foods that contain so little actual food that they have to be labeled as food product But if youre naturally inquisitive if you can make a game out of learning how to bring the mind to settle down then once the mind is settled down itll naturally want to understand this understand that understand the processes of what youre doingThats insightSo these are qualities you want to bring to your meditation the ability to play to respond to challenges to be inquisitive to find something here in the present moment that engages your imaginationAnd then you apply your imagination to a genuine problem the fact that youre causing yourself suffering right here and nowThis means one being able to imagine yourself not causing suffering and two imagining approaches that might get you to that goalExperimenting with different ways of breathing different ways of conceiving the breathing different ways of focusing the mind different ways of asking questions Theres a lot to play with hereAnd as long as youre fully engaged youre bound to make discoveriesThis is called the quality of citta or intentness the intentness that comes when youre really absorbed in something when youre really engrossed in something when you find that what youre doing gives you satisfaction the satisfaction of learning how to master a problemYouve got this very creative mind so how can you use it so that it doesnt create problemsHow can you use it to find those areas of experience where theres no creating going onNot out of dullnessI mean even dull people create things all the time  this is what the mind does it fabricates things  but they dont get engaged in trying to do it wellWhat were looking for instead is to see if theres a dimension where theres no creation and yet there is total happinessHow do you find thatTo some extent you follow instructions but youve also got to have the attitude of Give this a try give that a try If you dont learn how to try things youve never tried before never imagined before youre never going to find anything new that you havent experienced beforeThats why the element of play is so importantIf you dont think the idea of rebirth is scary think of having to go through adolescence all over again  all the awkwardness the embarrassment all the problems of adolescence high school dating asserting your independenceWere always glad that weve gotten past those thingsBut when you come to meditate its like going through adolescence all over againWhen you start out youre given a set of rules to followThats like being a child Dont do this dont do that do this do thatAnd for a while the rules workBut then there comes a time when if youre going to make the meditation your own youve got to test the rulesThats adolescence which is why its difficult because sometimes the rules are good rules that can carry you all the way through adulthood while other rules are best put away now that youre no longer a childSometimes the problem is that you had a childish understanding of the rules and as you grow up youve got to change that understandingSo youve got to sort that all outNo wonder its an awkward timeThe same goes with meditationYoure told Focus on the breath And in the beginning youre often told Dont meddle with the breathJust let it come in and go out at its own rate You may get the basic idea that the less you interfere in the present moment the better the more passive you become the betterBut that makes it difficult to integrate meditation with your lifeAre you going to go through life totally passive in every situationThat doesnt workIts like a walking deathSo youve got to test the rule to see whether its the kind of rule that says Before you cross the road hold onto somebodys hand or the type that says Before you cross the road look both waysCheck the oncoming traffic first Holding somebodys hand is a rule specifically for children when you grow up you dont need to follow it anymoreBut the rule about looking both ways is a good rule to follow whether youre a child or an adultSo the rule about not meddling with your breath Which kind of rule is thatIts a holdingthehand kind of ruleMeditation teachers often feel that people brand new to meditation will probably mess up their breath if they try to control it too muchIn order to avoid that they tell you not to get involved to be as passive as possibleBut as you gain more experience with the breath you dont need to hold onto the teachers hand anymoreYou have to look for yourselfYou have to experiment with the breathOtherwise youll never get a sense of how much subconscious molding of the breath is still going on down under the surface of your consciousnessYoull never get a sense of what input youre putting into the present momentThats crucial to the meditation for only when you see it are you in a position where you can try to refine itSo you have to go through that awkward stage of messing with the breath too much making it too long making it too short using too much pressure to change the breath to fit it into what you think might be a good moldOr when you find something good you tend to hold onto it well past the time when its really worth holding ontoOr you force the breath into different parts of the body where its best not to force itThese are issues you have to learn through experience through making mistakesYou have to go through the adolescence of your meditation to get a sense of whats just rightThats where you begin to reach maturity to develop finesse in your meditationBut to gain that finesse that sense of just right you have to go through the awkward stages  doing it wrong learning how to recognize it for wrong  and because of the awkwardness we tend to avoid themBut theres no way youre going to get out of your childhood and into your adulthood as a meditator unless you go through these stagesSo when you work with the breath keep two things in mindOne is that youre going to experiment with the breath to see what feels good right nowThe other is that you also have to look at the way youre experimentingYou watch both the breath and the mind as its dealing with the breathAnd there are no hard and fast rules hereYou have to feel your wayThis is why the path is a gradual pathThe Buddha once compared the path of practice to the continental shelf off of IndiaTheres a gradual slope and then a sudden drop like the continental shelf off the east coast of the United StatesWe all look forward to that sudden drop but as the Buddha says you first have to go through the gradual slope before you get thereSometimes our approach to meditation is simply hoping for the sudden drop to come thinking that if we can make ourselves as still and passive as we can in the present moment that will open a space for grace to drop on usIn other words were waiting for the accident of Awakening to happen but it doesnt happen that wayYou reach the drop by taking the gradual slopeIn other words as you get more and more sensitive to what youre doing in the present moment your input into the present gets more refined until you finally get to the point where you really can let it stopBut you have to go through many many layers of intention first for its only through gradually developing skill in this area that you can really sense the most subtle forms of intentionThis is why the activity of developing skill in the way you deal with the breath is not a distraction from vast openness of AwakeningThats not the case at allTrue Awakening comes through the process of getting more and more sensitive to what youre doing doing it with more and more refinement until the ultimate layers of refinement can be seen and abandonedSo this focus on being skillful is a preparationIts what gets us to the sudden drop of AwakeningOtherwise how are you going to develop your sensitivityIf you dont develop your sensitivity where are you going to get the discernment that leads to AwakeningIt has to come through this process of being willing to make mistakes of being patient with the gradual processWere an impatient nationWe want things to happen right awayWe look at the past and say Oh those people didnt know anythingThey had to go through this long involved process because they didnt understand the quick and easy way to get things done And yet so often the quick way to get things done may yield quick results but not lasting results  results that might not be good over the long term that might actually go badAnd meditation is one of those areas where time is requiredPatience is requiredYouve got to invest the time and attention needed to develop a skillYoure getting to know the breathIts like getting to know a personAs the Buddha said with regard to that kind of knowledge you have to be observant and willing to put in a fair amount of timeOnly then can you gain a sense of familiarityThink of yourself as becoming friends with the breathIn any friendship theres got to be give and takeThere are going to be awkward momentsUps and downsBut if you stick with it with the goodheartedness needed to weather the downs and the powers of observation to know when youve made a mistake to admit your mistakes then the friendship can growThats when your friend can start revealing all of his or her secretsAnd the breath has lots of fascinating secretsThere are lots of interesting things to find out in the energy flow of the breathingYou can start seeing how the breath affects your feelings exactly which experience is a breath experience and which experience is a feeling experience  feeling pleasure or painAs you really look into these things you begin to see that youve often drawn the lines in your body and mind in the wrong placesFor instance the aggregates of form and feeling the actual movement of the energy is form the sense of pleasure or pain that goes along with it is the feeling and it can be extremely fleetingWhen you see how fleeting feelings are  much more fleeting than even subtle sensations of breath  that rearranges your notion about how youve been living your lifeYou realize how much of your life youve spent chasing after pleasant feelings and only to see more and more clearly how fleeting they areSo as you really look into this process of breathing theres an awful lot to seeIf youre willing to stick with the ups and downs of that gradual slope you find that theres always something to do something to learnIf youre sitting around waiting for Awakening to happen it gets pretty desensitizing after a while  putting yourself into a dead dull mood saying Well just wait here long enough and maybe itll come You get so that you no longer look at what youre doingSo the end result is that youre actually desensitizing yourself to a lot of the stuff going on in the mindYou try to hide it from yourself hoping that If I hide it well enough then the enlightenment will be fooled and itll come  like a child trying to fool Santa ClausBut if you work with the breath  each breath coming in noticing what kinds of feelings it gives rise to what you can do to make it a more pleasurable breath  youre engaged in a process that makes you more sensitiveAnd what is discernment but heightened sensitivityWe often think of discernment as trying to clone our minds into seeing things the way the Buddha tells us to see themBut that ends up just adding one more layer of conjecture to our ignoranceWhen he tells us to look for the inconstancy and the stress in things hes not telling us to come to the conclusion that theyre inconstant and stressfulHes telling us how to develop sensitivity Can you sense really refined levels of inconstancyCan you sense really refined levels of stressWhat happens when you doThis is what the meditation is designed to doAs you discover those more and more refined levels and take them apart to create a greater sense of stability a greater sense of wellbeing in the mind you finally get to the point of equilibrium where everything opens upYou fall into what they call the stream  the point where theres no input into the present momentYou know this for sure because youve thoroughly sensitized yourself to every kind of input the mind has had every little discussion every little agreement its made with itself even the sublinguistic communication going on in the mindYouve become more and more sensitive to that to the point where it stops and youre no longer doing anythingThis is where the path takes overThe path actually does the work from that point onIt opens you to the DeathlessThis is why its called the stream because theres a sense of current pulling you along without your having to do anything at allBut to get to that point youve got to do a lot of doing and be very sensitive to what youre doing so you can know for sure when theres really and truly no intention in the mind and when it only seems that waySo this little exercise here of adjusting the breath evaluating the breath Thats the beginning of discernment the beginning of insight into the three characteristic of inconstancy stress and not selfIts crucial to the practiceIts the stage where youre not just obeying the rules for childrenYoure actually getting a sense of how the rules really work and of which ones apply to you as a mature meditatorAnd even though it may be awkward going through this adolescence of testing things and tripping over your mistakes nobody else has to know about the mistakes youve madeThe important point is that you actually learn from themEven though it may be awkward thats how you grow upOur minds are pretty chaotic systems which is why following the middle way is so difficultIts so easy for a chaotic system to get knocked out of equilibrium to veer off to the left to veer off to the rightStaying in the middle is difficult it requires a lot of balanceSo its no wonder that when psychologists describe the workings of the mind they tend to use fluid mechanics as their main analogyIn other words the mind acts like water the way water swirls around and forms eddies the way it gets pushed down here goes underground and comes out over thereSometimes it builds up into huge wavesI was reading the other day about enormous waves called rogue waves that suddenly form out in the oceanThings come together just right  this little wave adds on to that little wave  and all of a sudden they build into enormous rogue waves that flow through the ocean and then after a while mysteriously dissipateIts the same with the mindSometimes rogue waves come crashing through the mind and you wonder where they came fromIts easy for tiny little things to set them offThis is why we have to be careful in our practiceDont regard the little details or little distractions as totally unimportantAjaan Mun used to say that its very rare that a whole tree gets into your eye but sometimes just a little sawdust can get into your eye and blind youSometimes the little things are the ones that set you off so you have to be carefulOn the other hand though you have to be confident that even if the mind does get knocked off balance you can bring it backOtherwise the practice would be full of fear all the time  afraid of tipping off too far to the left too far to the right toppling upside downTheres only one way of learning what the balance point is and thats through experimentingAnd you can experiment only when youre not afraidSo you have to develop the confidence that even when you do go far off the path to one side or the other you can pull yourself backTheres always that new opportunity in the mind to give yourself a fresh startIn this way you can experiment and gain a sense of where the balance is because you know that no mistakes are fatalYou come back and you put yourself on the path againYou fall off well you put yourself back on the path againAjaan Mun once said at another point Its normal for people to go off on the side You get stuck on the right side of the path looking at the flowers sniffing the breeze or on the left side on the path where youre stuck in the mudBut you can extract yourself from both sidesThis is why we have techniques in meditationThis is what theyre forThey assume that youre going to go off on either side and so they give you paths for bringing yourself backWhen the level of energy in your mind is too strong  your mind starts bouncing around like a pingpong ball  there are calming practicesWhen your energy level goes weak  you start getting bored nothing seems to interest you nothing seems to be worth doing  there are practices for energizing youThink about your motivation  why youre practicing  and that can help get you going againAnd then theres the factor the Buddha calls analysis of qualities which means really looking carefully at whats going onOften we get bored with the meditation because weve grown sloppy were not really paying careful attention and nothing new seems to be coming alongLook very carefully at what youre doingLook very carefully at each breath and youll begin to see things you didnt notice beforeThis is why mindfulness and alertness are qualities appropriate at all timesRemind yourself why of youre on the path and then be very careful to look at what youre doing be very precise in watching watching watching whats going onYou begin to see that theres a lot going on here in the present momentAfter all youre creating a world here in the present moment and thats not a simple activityTheres lots to observe lots to notice starting with the simple building blocks the breath and the mental qualities that are called directed thought and evaluation the ones that do all that chattering in your mindYou direct your thoughts to a particular topic and then you think about it you evaluate itYou say This is this and thats that and this is good and thats badSo you take those very basic building blocks and you put them together in a new wayInstead of chattering about things outside you direct your thoughts to the breath you evaluate the breathThen there are the final set of building blocks feelings and perceptions feelings of pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain and the labels you put on all these thingsYou apply all those to the breath as wellSo youve got all the building blocks for your experience right here and instead of building them into elaborate worlds you very consciously dontYou build them into something very simple a focused state of mindNow simple doesnt mean easy As I said there are all these other currents going on in the mindBut as you keep coming back coming back youre coming back to these building blocks on a simple levelKeep it basic but be very observantOne of the reasons things dont stay basic in the mind is that were so good at whipping things up out of these building blocksIts like a meringue or whipped cream You take a little tiny bit of cream and you whip it up into this big blob of whipped creamTheres a lot of air in there a lot of fabrication going onSo what you want to do is keep things basic but be very observant because youve got a lot of tricks up your sleeve for creating something out of nothing making mountains out of the tiniest molehillsSo keep it on the level of molehills very simple very basic and keep your eye out for those other tricksThats where things get fascinating realizing how you deceive yourself all the timeSometimes it comes down to a basic level of dishonesty in the mindOne part of the mind is very good at lying to another part of the mindSo you can start asking yourself Whos actually fooling whom here Wheres the curtain the window shade the wall that allows one part of the mind to fool another part of the mind Or Does it depend on the other part of the minds willingness to be fooled There are lots of interesting political maneuvers going on in the mind so watch out for thoseFortunately the best way of dealing with them is to keep things basicJust refuse to play alongWhen things do come up in the mind as youre trying to get it to settle down try to cut them off as quickly as possibleWhen a thought comes into the mind  you remember this person you actually see this or that persons face  just say Goodwill for that person and thats enoughYou dont have to get involved in the stories associated with those facesAnd in the beginning you dont have to trace those faces back How did that image come Just let it goThis principle of keeping things simple is what enables balance to come more and more easily to the mind for you can see the little movements that otherwise might set things offIts what they call the butterfly effectA butterfly flaps its wings in Hong Kong and a jetliner as a result of the change in the currents of air later crashes in TexasSo keep things simple so that youre aware of those little butterfly flutterings in the mindBut fortunately when the mind crashes its not like a Texas airplane it doesnt die unless you let it dieYou can always pick yourself up dust yourself off and move onThis is a good thing to remember in the practiceTheres the story of King AjatasattuHe killed his father and later felt a lot of regret but theres a tradition that hes going to become a Private Buddha someday even though hes got some really bad karma to pay off firstEven Mara whos the figure of temptation in the early Buddhist texts Theres a tradition that he too will someday become a Private BuddhaSo no matter how much your mind may seem ready to crash or if it has already crashed you can always take heart pick yourself up because theres always new karma always new things you can do with every momentNo mistakes are fatalWhen you have that confidence you can experiment in the mindFind out how much effort is too much how much effort is too little how too much activity in the mind gets you all stirred up how too low a level of energy starts you falling asleepThese are all questions of balance and they can be answered only by experimenting testing for yourself finding out for yourself  Whats too muchWhats too littleWhats too far to the rightWhats too far to the left with the confidence that no matter what your mistakes you can always correct them you can always learn from themThats the important thingDont view a mistake as a really bad thing that you have to make up for afterwardsUse it as a learning experienceWhen you approach everything as a learning experience then no meditation is wastedEvery meditation becomes an opportunity to learnIts just a question of whether you take that opportunity or notThe Buddha talks about the bases of success in meditation concentration based on desire and Right Effort concentration based on persistence or energy and Right Effort concentration based on intentness and Right Effort and concentration based on the minds powers of analysis and Right EffortAnd he talks about how important it is to reach a balance in all these factors because your desire can be too strong too weakYour persistence can be way overboard or way too laxThe same with intentness and your powers of analysis Sometimes they go way overboard and sometimes they dribble away into nothingTheres only one way to learn balance in all these things and thats through trial and errorYeah I knowWe here in America are all busy peopleWe want things to be packaged easily so we can get the most out of them and move on to our next whateverBut the practice isnt like thatThere isnt a next whatever to move on toThis is the most important issue facing the mind right now the fact that its creating suffering for itselfIts every action is aimed at happiness but its creating suffering for itselfThats the big problem in lifeOnly the practice can solve itAnd the practice is an activity that gives results only when youre willing to be patient and experiment and learn from your mistakesSo thats what youve got to doBut take heartEven the Buddha made mistakesBig mistakesSix years of selftortureAll the noble disciples have made mistakesIts just that they were willing to learn from them and they didnt let the mistakes get them downLet the mind settle down in the presentSometimes you can use the word let Other times you have to force it because the mind sometimes has its moods where its not willing to settle downIts got all kinds of other issues to think about all kinds of other agendas and now its got a whole hour when it can think of those things things that were suppressed in the course of the day because other things captured your attentionNow they can start popping up to the surface so you need tools to keep them from getting in the wayOne effective tool is simply the desire to be stillFor example when the mind is tired it really wants to restIn cases like that all you have to do is give it a good resting spotYour main concern then is to make sure it doesnt fall asleep or drift off into a zone where its not really aware of whats going onIf the bodys tired do some good deep inandout breathing to make sure theres enough oxygen in the brainThen gradually allow the breathing to settle down to a more comfortable rateOnce its comfortable spread that sense of comfort to fill the whole body and then try to stay very consciously aware of the whole bodyDont let your awareness shrinkThere are other times when the mind has more energy to think and in that case youve got to cut it off in other ways partly by explaining things to it partly by having values that will cut off the thoughtsAll too often our values go in the other direction  encouraging thought  especially with the idea we have that if we figure out things beforehand we dont have to do the workSo many of us come to the meditation with that attitude If you read enough books if you think things through reason things through ahead of time then you wont have to do all the workYou just settle down insights will pop into the mind and the job will be doneBut it doesnt work that way because a lot of the insights were trying to gain deal with the way the mind functions and you cant really see the functioning of the mind until you wrestle with it to know its insandouts to know where the tricks it plays on itself are coming fromAnd you also have to develop some good retortsSometimes theres a conversation an argument going on in the mindPart of the mind wants to think about this think about thatWell youve got to argue with it give it good reasons for not going thereAnd keep the reasons short and sharp for otherwise youll get drawn into endless conversationsRemind yourself that knowledge at least the knowledge that were looking for in the meditation isnt something that comes from thinking things throughAjaan Suwat had a good line on thisHe said Its like darknessYou dont like the darkness but you cant attack the darknessYou cant scratch a hole in it you cant rip it you cant tear itYou have to light a lightThe light will then take care of the darkness All of the other things we might do to try to grab hold of the darkness or rip it away just dont workIts the same with the mindWe cant think our way out of ignoranceWe have to watch so that we can give rise to discernmentThe discernment here is precisely that the awareness that comes when you really watch things carefully when you observe whats going on in the mindSo you have to set up the right circumstancesAgain its not a matter of thinking things throughThe proper preparation for the meditation the part that explains it beforehand simply tells you how to set up the right situation and then you just have to watchA good analogy is with a hunter The hunter does what he can to prepare to go out hunting to get all his weapons in the right orderThen he goes out and has to sit very stillHe cant decide beforehand that the rabbits going to come along at two pmso that he can come back at three and have dinner before darkThe hunter goes out and all he can do is sit there very quietly and yet at the same time be very watchfulWhether the rabbit comes at noon or two or four or if it doesnt come that day the hunter still has to be very watchful all the timeHe cant let his attention slip cant make a noise and cant schedule events beforehandHe cant through the force of his will make the rabbit come at a particular time or at a particular placeThe hunter just does the best he can to set up the right circumstances along the path where rabbits ordinarily come and then he sits still and watchesThe same with the meditation You get the mind as still as you can and then you have to watchThats the only way youre going to get any really new insights into whats going onActually as meditators were better off than hunters because the mind is constantly sending out little signalsIts always giving us something to catch as it deals with this deals with that makes this choice and thatThe problem is that were not still enough to notice these thingsWere not attentive enoughWe dont focus our attention in the right placesWe dont ask the right questionsAs a result we dont see even though everythings happening right here before our eyesSo you have to be very very careful very very still and then ask the right questionsThe Buddha gives instructions on this the questions that surround the four noble truthsWhere is there stressWhere is there cravingWhen is mindfulness presentWhen is it absentCan you see these thingsWhen mindfulness is present how can you keep it goingWhen its absent how can you give rise to itThese are the questions he has us ask about the present momentAside from that he tells us to put everything else aside  all your other concerns all the other distractions that come along  and focus on the real issue at hand which is how to deal with suffering how to deal with stressOnce that issue is dealt with everything else is taken care ofI recently received a letter from a doctor who was claiming that modern psychology has made an advance over Buddhism in that Buddhism deals only with the problem of suffering while modern psychology deals with suffering and also gives meaning to lifeI dont think he understands the depth of the problem of sufferingOnce you really eradicate suffering what remains to your life the meaning of what you want to do with it is very clearAnd it will vary from person to personBut the big issue facing everybody is digging out the roots of sufferingOnce those roots are dug out then the question of meaning is no longer a problemWhy does the question of meaning bother usThere must be some suffering there must be some stress surrounding itWe look into itWhy does there have to be a meaning to thingsWhats the suffering that comes from there not being a meaningDig into itLook into itAnd if thats too abstract or too subtle focus on where you do see the suffering where you do see the craving because developing your powers of observation is a process just like anything else You work from the crude to the subtle from the gross to the refinedYou dont sit there and say This issue is too crude for meIm going to wait until the subtle ones come You have to handle the crude ones first the blatant ones firstGet practice with them and then your sensitivity you awareness will grow more and more subtleYou have to start where you are and accept where you are as your starting placeYou cant say I wish my concentration were betterI wish it was the way it was years ago You have to put those thoughts aside and say Where is it right nowWhat are my abilities right nowWhat issues are presenting themselves right now If you get used to handling whats here right now youre focused on the right spotYoure developing the habits you needAfter all this is a skill were working onIts not an intellectual puzzle where you can just think things throughSkills require dedicationThey require timeThey require commitmentTheres an interesting story they tell about choosing candidates for the brain surgery program at a famous universityAs you can imagine everybody who applies to be a brain surgeon has to be smart but not everybody whos booksmart is going to succeed in the programSo the question is how to weed out the people who are not going to succeedThey found that one of the most useful questions to ask the applicants is Could you tell me about a recent mistake you made The candidates who say I cant think of any mistakes I made recently are immediately crossed outThe ones who say Oh yeah just the other day I made this mistake are the ones who pass the first questionThen the followup question is What would you do differently if you had another chance The ones who showed that they had already thought of this question and had come up with a few alternatives were the ones who were accepted into the schoolThe people who are going to succeed are not the ones who have everything figured out beforehand theyre the ones who keep learning all along the wayThe same principle applies to meditationYou have to learn to put your mind in a learning mood all the time because only then will you see the things that you didnt see before that will light the lamp that will drive away the darkness of ignoranceSo keep on watchingThe mind feeds on its moods and its objects so youve got to find something good for it to feed onWe have the choiceThere are all kinds of things you could focus on right nowIts up to you to choose the right place to focus the right place to feedSo look around in the bodyWhere is a comfortable placeAt what spot can you watch the breath clearly and comfortablyTry to stay in touch with that place  and stay in touch with that sense of comfort as wellAfter watching it for a while youll find that certain ways of breathing give rise to a feeling tone that feels good feels healingTry to maintain that feeling toneThis may require adjusting the breath now and then because the needs of the body as the mind begins to settle down begin to changeThe breath can grow more and more still more and more refinedThe less your mind jumps around thinking about this that and the other thing the less oxygen you needSo allow the rhythm of the breath to change as is necessaryThe important thing is learning to ride that feeling tone the way youd ride a wave with a surfboard getting a sense of when to lean a little to the left a little to the right steer here steer there to maintain your sense of balanceAs for whatever other issues may come up remember that youre choosing to feed right hereYou dont have to feed on anything elseThere may be a little voice in your mind saying Look at thatWatch thisYouve got to worry about that worry about this Just keep reminding yourself No not right now Your current priority is to develop a good strong foundation so that you can feel secure in the present moment  so that no matter what happens youve got a place where youre safeAs you feed here more and more often you find that the mind gets strongerWhen it gains a sense of nourishment and inner comfort you can spread that sense of comfort around the body so that it gets more encompassingIf there are parts of the body you cant spread it to thats okay You dont have to focus there yetFocus on the areas where you can spread that sense of comfort where it can seep through easilyAllow yourself to be bathed by it surrounded by it so that the mind has more and more good food to feed onAs it gets stronger it can begin to look at the other areas that are more problematic because now it doesnt have to feed on themThis is why pain for example has been such a big problemWe keep trying to feed on itIts as if you have a good kitchen with lots of good food stocked up but you go rooting around in the garbage pailSo get the mind well fed with this sense of ease this sense of wellbeing and then when you turn to look at pain you can see it in a different wayWhen you look at something as food as something to gain sustenance from youre going to see it in one wayWhen you look at pain as food its disappointingIts lousy food and yet when the mind is hungry it feeds on whatever it can findBut when the mind isnt hungry you can look at the pain with pure curiosity Lets look into thisWhat is thisLets try to understand it Your whole attitude toward it changesRemember The Buddha said Try to comprehend pain He doesnt say Snuff it outOne way of comprehending it is to see how much you can use the breath to deal with the painAnother is to see how much your different attitudes toward the pain will change the way you experience itExperiment around the pain to see what happens and particularly to get a sense of the difference between the physical pain and the mental painThe Buddha compares pain with being shot by arrowsPhysical pain is like being shot with one arrow but then on top of that you shoot yourself with another arrow the anguish you build up around the pain is totally optionalWhen youve got a body there are going to be painsEven the Buddha had physical pains after his Awakening but the difference is that he knew how not to shoot himself with those unnecessary second third fourth and fifth arrowsAnd as it turns out those are the ones that really hurtThose are the ones causing the problemsBut you cant just go marching in and say to yourself Okay youOutStopStop shooting arrows Youve got to learn to see where the dividing line is between the physical pain and the mental painYou do that by experimenting with the breath experimenting with the labels you put on the pain asking yourself questions about the pain  and sometimes the strange questions are the ones that ferret out the strange attitudes youve built up around the painFor instance you can you ask What shape does the pain have It sounds like a strange question but when you pursue it you find that your imagination has actually given the pain a shapeWhat happens when you dont give it a shapeHow does the pain move aroundIs it moving around on its own or is it moving around because youre pushing it aroundThese are things you have to learn through experimentIts only through experimentation that things begin to divide out on their ownIn other words if you go in with preconceived notions The dividing line has to be here or there it turns out that thats not the case at allYoure forcing your ignorance onto the pain which of course just makes it worseSo youve got to learn how to experimentHow do changes in the breathing change the painHow do changes in your concept of the pain change the painHow about changes in your concept of how the mind relates to the body Is the mind in the bodyIs the body in the mindWhere in the body is the mindThese may seem like strange questions but you begin to realize that the mind on an unarticulated level actually does think in those termsAnd a lot of our basic assumptions of where the center of our awareness is where the pain is in relation to that center and how it affects that center These play an important role in how we experience the pain and how we make ourselves suffer unnecessarily from itSo you have to experiment and test thingsBut first youve got to get the mind settled down with a sense of wellbeing for otherwise its going to be sneaking little bites of the pain feeding on the pain and then not liking what it eatsThat just complicates the issue makes it impossible to analyze things and separate them outTo gain this foundation of wellbeing takes timeYouve got to be patientKeep working at it again and again and againYou cant say Ive done this x number of days or x number of weeks or x number of years I should be beyond thatYou just keep working at it as long as necessaryThe concentration is the part of the meditation you can do the asking of the questions is something you can do but the insights that actually give you that Aha  those you cant doThose come as a result of the other actions but theyre not something you can intendYou can intend to get the mind to settle down you can intend to learn how to ask those questions but when the results come thats something you cant determine in advanceJust make sure that youve got the causes right in terms of the stability of your gaze the sense of wellbeing you can fall back on whenever you need it and the quality of appropriate attention  learning how to ask the right questionsThats what you do in the meditation thats what you intend in the meditation and when these things fall together just right the results will comeTo ferret out the difference between the physical pain  the pains of the khandhas the pains of the aggregates  as opposed to the pain of attachment craving and clinging Thats a distinction you see in the doingYou catch yourself in the doing you see how the doing affects thingsThis is something you cant figure out in advanceBut when the distinction becomes clear in the doing then youve cut the mind away from those attachments and cravingsWhen the Buddha said that his job was done this is what he meantThere were still pains in the body there were still issues in life but the mind no longer had to suffer because of themThats where Awakening makes a permanent difference once and for allWe hear over and over again that because of the principle of impermanence even Awakening must be impermanent but thats not trueThe Buddha didnt say that everything is impermanent only that conditioned things are impermanentAnd even on the conditioned level its possible to make irrevocable changesThis is why training the mind is so worthwhileWith practice we can cut through the fetters that keep us bound to suffering so that theyll never bind us ever againOne of the images they give in the texts is of a palm tree with its crown cut offItll never grow any furtherAnother image is of a carcass of a cowThe butchers take off the skin  cutting all the little tendons and all the connective tissue  but then no matter how they try to put the skin back on the cow its never connected in the same wayIts right next to the cow but there are no connections because the knife of discernment has cut them  once and for allWhen you meditate try to think of it as a process of explorationDont have a lot of preconceived notions about what youre going to findIf you go into it thinking that youre going to reprogram your mind well you could reprogram your mind into seeing almost anythingIf you believe firmly enough that if you saw iridescent clouds all around you that would be a good sign you could make yourself see iridescent cloudsIf you believe firmly enough that if you saw the whole world as blue youd find true happiness then you would make yourself see the whole world as blueBut thats no indication that the world really is blueSo instead youre asked to exploreThe Buddha doesnt give a lot of descriptions of the goal  although he does give a few hints  but he gives a lot of detail on how to find itIts like a treasure huntHe says that if you go into the next room and you look in this particular way youre going to uncover something of valueAnd he gives you a couple of tests for determining whether the object you find is the valuable object or not Is it subject to changeIs there any stressIs there any sense of possessionIf there is its not what youre looking forBut as to what precisely it is that youre looking for he gives only a few hintsSo what we should focus on is the process of what were doingThink back on his AwakeningThere were three knowledges that preceded his attainment of nibbana knowledge of previous lives knowledge of beings passing away and being reborn in line with their karma and then knowledge of the four noble truthsThose first two knowledges were not all that certain there was still an element of possible doubtVisions of previous lifetimes dont necessarily mean you actually had previous lifetimesYou can see people passing away and being reborn in line with their karma but does that mean that it really happensYou can see all kinds of things but it doesnt mean theyre trueThe Buddha realized that the way to test those visions lay in testing that issue of karma what people do in the present momentThis is one thing you can know directlyYou can know directly what youre doingWhen you focus the mind you know youre focusing the mindWhen the mind settles down you know its settling downWhen the mind wanders off you know its wandering offThese are things you really know here and nowWhen you experience suffering you knowWhen you experience a lack of suffering you knowSo those are the two issues the Buddha focused on the feelings of suffering and the knowledge of actionsThe second knowledge suggested that there was a connection between the two so the Buddha decided to see if this was trueThese two are very certain thingsWhen youre suffering no one can convincingly tell you Thats not really suffering youre not suffering Other things you might know can be shaped by the rules of the languages youve learned but your experience of suffering is prelinguisticYou know it more directly than anything elseAt the same time when you do something you know youre doing itSo the Buddha wanted to see if peoples experiences of pleasure and pain are related to their actionsFor his answer he looked in the immediate presentWhat are you doing right now he asked himselfIs there any relation between what youre doing right now and an experience of pain or lack of pain The next question when he saw that there was a connection was Is it possible not to do anythingWhat happens thenSo he worked to let go of the craving and ignorance that lead to action that are involved in action to see what happens thenIn this way he was dealing with realities that are immediately apparent immediately presentHe was running an experiment to see What happens when you do it this wayWhat happens when you do it that wayHe wasnt dealing in visions he wasnt dealing in mystical abstractionsHe was looking at very ordinary things  the actions of the mind  and seeing what they resulted inWere trying to do the same thing as we meditate hereThats where the focus should beWere not just sitting here waiting for enlightenment to plop on us out of the skyWere looking for an enlightenment into what were actually doing right nowIts amazing how much the mind can disguise that from itselfThis is a tendency weve had ever since we were little children to hide our intentions from ourselves because sometimes our intentions are not all that sociable not all that admirableWe can find ways of justifying almost anything to ourselves and in the process we learn how to be a little bit dishonest  sometimes not just a little bit sometimes outrageously dishonest  with ourselvesSo when were meditating we want to muster up some honesty and focus it on this issue hereLets really get truthful about whats going on right nowWe apply our honesty  this is not to say were by nature either honest or dishonest its just that weve developed both patterns  and we try to take advantage of our skillful habits to uproot the unskillful onesHow do we get honest and clear about our intentionsYou have to make the mind really stillThats why were focused on the breathWe give the mind an intention Stay with the breathDont moveDont go wandering off to other things And we give it a further intention Try to breathe as comfortably as possible That right there is an immediate exercise in the relationship between your actions and feelings of pleasure and painYou want to develop that particular sensitivity as much as you canWhats important is the particular combination of the stillness of your focus and the point where youre focused right at this issue of intention and its relationship to pleasure and painThis is why breath meditation opens things up in the mind for its focused on the real issuesThe Buddha once said that insight is knowledge of sankhara fabrication and fabrication comes in three forms physical fabrication  thats the breath verbal fabrication  the directed thought and evaluation that give rise to words and then mental fabrication  your feelings and perceptionsWhen youre focused on the breath properly all these things are brought togetherTheres the physical fabrication of the breath theres directed thought and evaluation directed to the breath and there are the perceptions of the breath and the feelings that arise from how you deal with the breathEverything you really need to know for Awakening is right hereAnd what is the process of fabricationTheres a lot of intention involved in it and thats what you want to focus on because intention lies at the essence of actionThe Buddhas genius was to realize that the things we need for Awakening the things we need to understand the problem of suffering in our lives all lie right hereIts simply a question of bringing them together and giving them a really steady look so you can clearly see whats going onWhat happens when you really focus your attention right here and dont let yourself get distractedWhat happens when you develop your sensitivities in this areaWhat do you findAjaan Maha Boowa talks about his time with Ajaan Mun saying that Ajaan Mun would give long Dhamma talks sketching out the whole path of the practice because at any one time there would often be lots of different people coming to study with him all at different stages of the practiceIn order to cover everybody he would start from the most basic levels of practice on up to the highestAnd Ajaan Maha Boowa noticed that as Ajaan Mun was giving his Dhamma talks hed get to some really crucial parts of the practice really important discoveries that would move you from one level to the next and he wouldnt describe them in detailHed just move on to the next levelHed set up the problem and then bypass around itThis had Ajaan Maha Boowa mystified  for a whileThen he began to realize that if you explain everything in a lot of detail beforehand people would come to those points bringing a lot of preconceived notionsThose notions would get in the waySo the important thing about listening to the Dhamma is that the Dhamma points youIn fact the word desana  the word they use for a Dhamma explanation  literally means pointing to It points you to the places where you should look gives you instructions on how to look and then its up to you to seeWhen the Buddha would give instructions for meditators he wouldnt say Go do insight hed say Go do jhana In the course of doing jhana youd have to develop tranquility and insight as wellThe insight would become your own because its something you discoveredYou noticed things that you didnt notice beforeWhat else do you think Awakening would beIts not that the skies open and some god comes down bearing a message or some light beam comes down from the outsideAnd its not something you can clone from what youve heard about other peoples AwakeningIts simply a matter of looking very carefully at whats already here looking to see what happens when you get your focus really well tuned when you get it steadyYou develop all the skills you need to see clearly  learning how to look learning where to look  but the actual seeing when it becomes clear seeing Thats something you cant willThe looking will point you thereIf you keep looking youll seeSo look carefullyTheres a lot to awaken to here  a lot to understand to explore to discoverIts simply up to us to want to discover it enough and to apply ourselves to what needs to be doneWhen you meditate youre exploringYoure not trying to program the mind in line with somebody elses notions of what it has to doYoure exploring possibilitiesCan you stay with the breathHow long can you stay with the breathCan you make yourself stay with the breath longer than you might have thought possibleWhere are the little gaps where mindfulness lapsesCan you bridge those gapsCan you relate to the breath in a friendly wayThese are the questions you set up and then you exploreThis is important to remember that even though the Buddha has explored this territory himself and all the noble disciples have explored it  theyve sent back reports on what can be found here  still for each of us its a process of explorationWere testing the Buddhas teachingsIs it possible as he said to find true happiness a happiness that doesnt changeAs we explore all the answers we arrive at then become questions we use to keep the mind pointed in the right directionAs you sit and meditate you often come up with interesting insights uncover things about the mind that you never noticed before possibilities that you had never realized were possibleOften a weight is lifted off the mindBut sometimes your tendency is to focus on the world outsideYou suddenly see the world in a new way The world is perfect as it is Or The world is illusory Those arent the insights the Buddha focused onHe focused more on what its possible for the mind to doCan it operate in a way that it doesnt create suffering for itselfAs you meditate you begin to catch sight of little moments in the mind where things seem a lot less weighty than they did beforeYou feel less burdened by different concerns longterm or shorttermBut its important in each case to turn around and look What did you just learn about how the mind can functionHow was it functioning in the pastHow about the new way of functioning youve suddenly discoveredHow is it betterSometimes it may be a general psychological issuePeople who have problems with guilt and blame suddenly find a moment without that guilt and blameIts possible to look at the world without the guilt and blameThats an important insight just to remind yourself that its possibleYou dont have to carry these things aroundBut as to what the insight says about the world  Is the world perfect as it isAre you perfect as you are thats a more controversial issueAnd its not what the Buddha said to focus onFocus on the fact that its possible for you not to be carrying this weight around continuallyThe next time you detect it coming up remember that you have the choice of putting it downJust the realization that youve been able to do it once Thats liberatingIt expands the range of your imaginationRemind yourself that there is that possibilitySometimes the insights are related more directly to the meditation itselfIts possible to relate to the breath in a particular wayIts possible to relate to your feelings in a particular wayIn other words you dont have to identify with themYou begin to see themAwareness really is separate from these thingsIt doesnt have to take on  lay claim  to these things as being yoursThat opens up a possibility in the mindYou see that for a moment the mind was totally without any sense of identification with these thingsIts possibleMany of the possibilities we uncover in the mind are skills weve already mastered in other areas just that we havent applied them consistentlyThere have been many times when feelings have come up in the mind and we dont identify with them but we dont notice the factWhat meditation does is to help us notice that we can apply that skill in areas where we hadnt applied it beforeSo when a particular state of mindful alertness or concentration arises in the mind its important that you try to maintain it in all sorts of different situations for this helps you gain just that sort of insight realizing that the habits youve found useful in one area of your life can be used in other areas as wellAfter all you dont go around holding on to all your cravings all of the time you have to let go of one craving in order to pick up another oneThe habit of letting go of craving is something we all have developed unconsciouslyThe problem is that when we let go of one craving its usually because another more compelling one has come alongWe let go of one craving only to pick up anotherBut we do have the ability to let go of a cravingThe drawback is that we do it unconsciously and as part of another process the process of picking up something elseWhat the Buddha teaches is a new process that you can let go let go let go let go without picking up anything elseIf something is causing you suffering if something is causing you pain you can let it goIt might still be hanging around but youre not holding onto itThat makes all the difference in the worldIts like living near fireAs long as youre not grasping the fire youre okayYou dont have to drive fire out of the worldIf you tried to of course it would be impossibleAnd even if you could youd create all sorts of hardships for yourself when you want to cook foodAll you have to do is let go of it and youre okayYou dont have to grab holdOur problem is that we learn how to let go of one fire but we find other kinds of fire and hold on to thoseAnd we think that somehow its differentThese are the fires you have to hold on toThat other fire you could let go of because its unimportantBut these ones are more important Or Its there in the mind so you have to grab on because you have to hold on to everything that comes into the mindAn important part of insight is realizing that you dont have to hold onThings can be there in the mind and you dont have to lay claim to them you dont have to let yourself be influenced by themIts possibleAnd you try to apply that possibility to other areas of your life that you wouldnt have thought of beforeBut as you try to develop these good habits expand their range you still run into old bad habits that youve carried around for who know how longJust focusing on the breath if you try it continually you run into all the issues that youre used to creating around any activity any job any responsibilityTheyre going to come in to mess up your focus to push and pull and mess up the breathWhich is why this is such a good place to take the mindAfter all the breath is going to come in its going to go out all on its ownYou dont have to do the pushing in the pulling outWhen you realize that you begin to see the pushing and pulling habits you picked up from other jobs other responsibilities that are totally irrelevant here and actually get in the wayWhen you see clearly how they get in the way remember that because they often get in the way in other activities in life as wellIn this way the breath is a good testing ground for learning about the habits of your mindYears back when I first went to stay with Ajaan Fuang he said Your only responsibility in all your activities is to stay with the breath He meant it in a way to unload my mind to clear away thoughts of other responsibilitiesWhat it did of course was to make the breath seem suddenly onerousIt was a weightIt was a responsibility something I had to worry about all the timeBut then as I worked with it one of the big lessons came in learning how to be with that responsibility and not make it a weight not make it a burdenAfter all why should the breath be a burdenIts what you do to stay aliveIts the basic process the basic force that keeps you aliveThat was a good lesson in seeing how the mind can create problems out of even the simplest things things that are in its own interestLearning how to be with the breath comfortably learning how to breathe comfortably You can make that a big issue a big weightBut if you step back a little bit you realize how ridiculous that isAnd that ability  to step back and look at things and say Wait a minute this isnt rightYoure creating unnecessary problems for yourself  is what opens you to new possibilitiesSeeing that your old unskillful habits are unnecessary is what allows you to let them goAnd noticing how you let them go is important as well because then you can take that insight and you apply it to other areas where youre making yourself miserable for no good reason at allYou realize that its possible to let goEven though there are problems in the world there are issues in the world things youve got to be responsible for still you dont have to weigh yourself down with them all the timeIts possibleThis is what the insights are all aboutYou see possibilities in the mind possibilities for letting go of old habits that create sufferingSo when anything new comes up in the mind keep reflecting back on that question What does this new mind state show about the minds possibilitiesWhat does it show about how the mind can relate to things in a way that involves less sufferingKeep your questions directed in this area and youll learn useful thingsWe were talking today about the insight of seeing the world as perfect just as it isThats directing your attention in the wrong directionYoure not supposed to think about the world as being perfect or imperfectInstead turn around and ask What did that just teach you about the mind It may have shown you how youve made the imperfection of the world into a burdenDo you feel personably responsible for itDo you carry guilt around about itIs it possible not to carry that guilt and still function skillfully helpfully in the worldThats the important question of the insight because it then becomes a skill you can apply to other thingsIf your attention gets directed out to the world as to whether the world is perfect or not you can argue for days and days and days and get nowhere at allPeople in a comfortable position might say that its perfect people starving in Africa would say that its notBut if you look at the insight as an opportunity to see that youve developed a new skill in the mind you can drop the way of thinking that wants to pass judgment on the worldThen you can remember the new skill and apply it to how you function in other areas as wellThis is why Ajaan Fuang was not interested in hearing about your meditation experiences unless you could keep them going for a whileIf you asked him about a meditative state hed ask Are you in there right now And youd say Well no Then hed say Go back and work on it In other words when youve gained a state of concentration gained an insight into the workings of the mind see if you can maintain it as a skillWhatever youve learned look at it as a skill that has shown you a new possibility in the mindThen see how much you can apply that skill to other areasThats the test of your insightSome skills are universally applicableOthers are useful only for specific problemsYou learn about your new skill by trying to apply it to everything and then seeing Well it doesnt work here it doesnt work here but it does work here As I said many of the skills you learn in the process of meditation are things that youve already been able to do in other areasIts simply a question of learning how to apply them right here in the context of the minds quest for true happiness in this area where you can really watch things carefully as they happen in the present momentSo were here to explore possibilities in the mindRemember the Buddhas own quest began with a desire that all of his friends told him was an impossibility the desire for a true happiness that doesnt changeHis friends all said Dont even botherIts impossibleNobody has ever attempted anything like thisAll the great people of the past have satisfied themselves with the ordinary everyday pleasures And Prince Siddharthas response was In that case theyre not so greatTheyre not worthy of respect He was determined to find if this was possible a true happiness where there was no suffering at all the total end of sufferingAnd he explored and explored and explored and found that it was possibleWere now in a world where weve heard that that possibility is thereIts been attempted and reliable people claim that it works that theyve found a true happinessSo we can follow their teachingsBut its interesting In following their teachings they never ask us to follow them simply by rote or accept them without proofThey ask us to explore as well because its only through exploration that youre going to learn these things for yourselfThey teach us how to explore our own mindsThats what the Buddhas instructions are all aboutHe says Try this try thatHeres a range of useful toolsSee what insights you gain into your own mindsLook for the workings of the mind that cause unnecessary sufferingSo as we practice its not an issue of being obedient or notIts a question of looking into our own minds using the tools the Buddha gave us to explore the possibilities that are hereThat way well be able to prove for ourselves if its really possibleCan you live without sufferingCan the mind function without causing sufferingCan you be more skillful in how you fashion your experience in the present momentCan you get to the point where you dont fashion anythingIs that a possibilityThe only way you can answer that question is to keep exploring on your ownIt requires work and dedication but the payoff is great even if you dont get all the way to full AwakeningYou find that you do learn ways of causing less and less and less suffering for yourself all the timeThat in and of itself is worth itThe insights you gain if theyre genuine carry their own rewardIve mentioned several times that Ajaan Fuang never certified whether you had attained a particular level of concentration or a particular level of insightHe had lots of reasons for doing this but one is that if the insight really is genuine its its own rewardYou dont need to be patted on the backYou know for yourself that theres less sufferingYou see something in the mind that you didnt see before and as a result youve learned a new skillYouve unburdened the mindIt doesnt suffer in the way it used toThats of great worth in and of itselfSo keep looking into the possibilitiesAlways be open to the idea that things you thought were impossible burdens you thought could never be laid down  in fact they seemed such a permanent part of the mind that you didnt even realize that youve been carrying them around  can be laid downExplore that possibilityThats what the meditation is all aboutTheres a constant dialogue going on in the mind This is this No its that This should be this That should be that you like this and you dont like that All kinds of voices  and in many cases the voices are totally untrainedTheyre just things weve picked up from here or there and we carry them aroundThis is the baggage in our mindThe Buddha said that the mind can be at peace only when its one but for most of us there are two three four five six voices going at it with all their preconceptions saying Youve got to do this youve got to do that And unless you examine them they can force you to suffer in a lot of waysWe hold onto so many things not so much because we like them but because were afraid that if we dont hold onto them something even worse is going to happenWere afraid that if we dont do things this way or that were going to get all screwed upSo we hold on and create suffering for ourselvesThis is why as the mind begins to settle down one of the big issues youve got to deal with is the range of different voices in the mind that get in the waySome of them are random others are more persistent more pervasive more persuasive more in controlYouve got to learn how to put a question mark next to themIf anything gets in the way of concentration put a question mark next to itDo you really believe thatIs that kind of thinking really rightIs it really usefulThats the main issue How useful is that kind of thinkingWhen you start asking this question you begin to see how much youve been holding onto things youve never really examined in the pastYou just accepted them because other people said they were true or they sounded right or maybe they worked once and then you held onto them as a habitSo you have to make it a rule within yourself An unexamined voice isnt worth listening toThats why the Buddha said that theres no jhana without discernment no discernment without jhana no solid concentration without understanding no understanding without solid concentrationThe two have to go togetherIn other words youve got to have at least some understanding of the workings of the mind before you can really settle downOtherwise youll fall for all the old tricks the minds been playing on itself saying Youve got to think about this youve got to get involved in that you cant neglect this youve got to look out for that You need to learn how to see through those voicesThats what they are just disembodied voices floating around there in the mindLearn how to put a question mark next to them saying I wonder if thats really trueMaybe I can look into it some other time Then put the issue aside and go back to work focusing on the breathAs the mind gets more and more quiet and still you begin to see these voices more clearly and other voices that have been hiding out of sight begin to come up to the surfaceThis is how these two processes  the stilling and the understanding  help each otherThe quieter you are the more you can see the more you can see the more youre able to cut through the subtle disturbances that keep the mind from being quietThis is why theres no such thing as a separate tranquility technique or a separate vipassana techniqueAny technique you follow anything you will the mind into focusing on or doing Thats a concentration techniqueYou can do concentration you cant do insightInsight is something that arises as the mind gets still and often its unexpectedYou cant map it out saying First youre going to gain insight into dependent coarising and then into notself These things vary from person to person  what you happen to notice and question as youre doing your workIts like the difference between an artisan and an artistAn artisan has a particular technique a particular craft that he uses and he may get very good at it but unless he develops the curiosity that advances his art he just stays as a craftsmanBut if you begin to exercise your ingenuity  Well how about trying thisHow about trying that questioning this questioning that trying this trying that Thats when you become an artistThats when the art becomes your ownAnd the same principle applies in the practiceCuriosity and ingenuity make all the difference  when you learn to question your old patterns and test new possibilitiesThis is why its so important to be able to come out to a quiet secluded place like this where you can get out of your ordinary ruts begin to air out the mind and start questioning the attitudes that seem to work in your daily lifeYou begin to take them apart and realize that they dont actually work so well that they create a lot of unnecessary sufferingAs the Buddha said simply living as a human being involves painTheres the pain of the body the pain of having to be dependent on thingsWe have this body that needs sustenance and in order to gain sustenance we have to workWe have to depend on the work of other peopleIts a real burden for a wide range of people and other living beings  a burden thats part and parcel with birth aging illness and deathAs long as youre alive this burden is unavoidableBut theres also a lot of suffering thats totally unnecessary the things we inflict on ourselves through our own lack of skill in managing our mindsThats something we can work on in the meditation learning how to deal more skillfully with issues as they arise recognizing which patterns of thought are skillful and dont lead to suffering which ones are unskillful and do lead to suffering learning how to stop acting thinking and speaking in unskillful waysThats what our practice is all aboutWhen we stop doing unskillful things the unnecessary suffering we inflict on ourselves will stopThere may be feelings of pain in the body but theres no suffering in the mindSo the practice is a matter of developing skillAncient cultures made a distinction between two types of knowledge scribe knowledge and warrior knowledgeScribe knowledge is the knowledge that can be defined in wordsWarrior knowledge is the knowledge that comes from acting from developing a skillAnd even though we need to depend to some extent on scribe knowledge as we meditate the meditation itself develops warrior knowledgeWe learn the words in the texts so that we can get a basic idea of what the problem is and what needs to be done but the actual knowledge were working on comes from developing the mindIn Pali its called bhavanamayapañña the discernment that comes from developingIn other words as you try to develop concentration in the mind you begin to realize things about the mind you didnt know beforeAs you develop mindfulness as you develop persistence  all these qualities that you work on cultivating  you begin to learn things about the mind that were previously hiddenObscureThats the kind of insight the kind of discernment thats really going to make a differenceSo as youre meditating think of yourself as a warrior doing battle with ignoranceYoure working on a warriors skill the survival of the mind with as little suffering as possibleThats what youre working towardBut you have to understand what it means to be an intelligent warriorPeople who arent warriors have picked up a lot of strange ideas about what warriors do thinking that you have to attack everything as soon as it arises that you cant give an inch to anyone at allThats a dumb warrior a warrior whos going to die youngAn intelligent warrior takes on battles only when he realizes he can win them and that theyre worth winningAt the same time a good warrior uses whatevers at handWe talked today about having to fall back on buddho as a primaryschool meditation techniqueWell if thats what you need dont be ashamed to use itA good warrior isnt ashamed to use any weapon that worksWhatever weapons are needed for the battle at hand those are the ones youve got to useThis is why a good meditator keeps lots of tools lots of weapons on hand  because when the defilements come they dont all come in one shape or formThey dont always attack from the same sideSometimes the mind feels lazy and is very ingenious in thinking of reasons for letting up in the practiceSometimes it turns on itself and starts browbeating itself for not working harder and harderWell that strictness that sternness can also be a defilement if its not helpful for the meditationThis is when it gets really tricky for often the voices of defilement can disguise themselves as the voice of the DhammaYouve got to watch out for thatWhen youre not quite sure whether what the mind is saying is true or false skillful or unskillful just go back to being an observerLook at the thinking in the mind simply as a process of arising and passing away in which you dont have to get involvedAt the very least youll survive whatevers coming through the mind oftentimes youll have a chance to understand itYoull begin to see that this goes with that that goes with this when you think in this way then this is going to happen when you think in that way then thats going to happenWhen youve seen these connections then the next time that kind of thinking comes around youre better armed better prepared for itSo as you meditate youve got lots of techniquesYouve got buddho youve got the breath youve got your ability to analyze things when analysis works youve got your ability to stay still when it doesntIn other words as a meditator youve got to be skilled in lots of approaches just as a warrior has to be skilled in lots of strategiesWhat this comes down to is that whatever works in clearing up the suffering of the mind whatever keeps the mind from creating burdens for itself whatever technique works That qualifies as the Dhamma whether or not its in the texts whether or not you heard it from the teacherAfter a while as you look back on the things that work youll find that they fall into patterns but dont be surprised if the patterns arent the ones you would have expected beforehandAfter all where do your expectations come fromThey come from your past ignorance combined with your past knowledge all mixed up togetherSo when all the things youve read in the books dont work just sit down and look at the problemStep out of itFlip it overUse your ingenuity to find some way around itIf your approach works in alleviating the unnecessary suffering the mind creates for itself youve found a new side to the DhammaAs you stop creating suffering for yourself youll find it easier to be skillful and helpful with other people as wellThis is why this is not a selfish practiceThe principle of goodwill is not just an idle wish saying May all living beings be happy and then leaving it at thatIt also means actually being kind to yourself not creating the unnecessary suffering that youve been piling on yourself all the timeWhen you find that your mind is less piledon like this its easier to feel sympathy for other people who are piling burdens on their minds tooWhen youre unburdened its easier to help them in a genuine wayThats why the benefits of the practice go not only inward but outward as wellStill the real work has to be done right here inside finding where those unnecessary burdens are  the burdensome ideas the burdensome notions the mind piles on itself saying that it has to react like this has to think like thatOnce you find them figure out how to let them goThats the kind of battle you want to take on the kind thats really worth winningAnd when you can win it your victory is a gift not only to yourself but also to everyone around youThere are many passages in the Canon where the Buddha  after explaining the path of practice or talking about the urgency of following the path  sends the monks back to meditateLook he saysOver there are roots of trees over there are empty dwellingsMeditateDont regret later that you didnt meditate that you didnt practice The word he uses for going to meditate is to go do jhana  jhayati is the verb in PaliIts a homonym with a verb for burning as when a flame burns steadilyThey have lots of different words for burning in Pali  words for raging fires words for smoldering fires  but the verb for a steady burn as in the flame of an oil lamp is jhayatiAnd the same verb is used for doing jhanaAs you practice concentration you try to make the mind burn steadily with a clean clear flameFlames that flicker up and down are hard to read by but a steady flame is one you can read by clearlyThats the quality youre trying to develop so that you can read the mindHow do you create that steady flameTwo qualities of mind are basicOne is directed thought the other is evaluationYou direct your thoughts to a particular topic like the breathKeep reminding yourself to stay with the breathThen you evaluate itHow is the breath goingWhere do you feel the breathWhen the breath comes in what are the sensations that let you know its coming inWhen it goes out what sensations let you know its going outAre those sensations comfortableIf they are let them beIf theyre not you can change themWhat this means is you can focus anywhere in the body where its clearly telling you Now the breath is coming in now the breath is going out And notice how youre maintaining that focusIs it a comfortable place to stay focusedAre the sensations themselves comfortable sensationsWhat can you do with the breath to change them if theyre notIf theyre comfortable can you make them even more comfortableThis is all part of evaluationThis is how you get started on jhana practiceSome people classify this as a samatha or tranquility practice but the Buddha himself said that you need two qualities to do jhana properlyOne is samatha or tranquilityThe other is vipassana or insightIn other words tranquility and insight together form the two sides of the practice were doing and the Buddha recommends that you get them balancedSo its not the case that you just do tranquility practice and then you drop it to do insight practiceA lot of people think that way though and so the question often comes up How much tranquility do you need before you can do insight Thats a question never addressed in the Canon because they didnt see things in those termsThey saw tranquility and insight as two sides of one practiceBoth sides are essentialSometimes you find that one side comes up before the other sometimes they arise together but ideally they foster each otherIf you have one without the other you have to strengthen the one thats lacking so that you can bring things into balanceThe samatha side is closely related to directed thoughtHow do you steady your directed thoughtHow do you steady the mindHow do you get it to settle down to gain confidence in its objectThats largely a question of making it comfortable yet at the same time maintaining enough alertness and awareness so that you dont blur outTo make it comfortable youve got to get sensitive to whats going on right nowThis is really importantWhen youre with the breath try to be as directly with the sensations as you can and notice how good they feelIs this something you can settle intoOnce youve settled in how do you stay thereWhat do you do to maintain itThis is evaluation  and its where the beginning of insight comes in for if you dont have any insight you start drifting offConcentration is not simply a matter of will power of forcing yourself to stay in placeThere has to be some understanding as wellYou develop it by evaluating the breath evaluating your focus to see what needs to be adjusted so that the mind can settle down and stay there stay there stay there consistently without wandering offAs the mind gets steadier you can then drop the evaluation and simply let the mind be one with the objectThats how it enters the higher levels of jhanaBut that doesnt mean youre totally done with evaluation simply that it gets more refinedYoure still going to have to deal with disturbances as you try to make your concentration more solid and continuous as you try to keep the mind centered at all timesYou get the mind into a good solid state of concentration and then when its firmly there step back to evaluate it in terms of the subtle disturbances still present within itThis is where your powers of evaluation take on the deeper questions of insight How should fabrications  these disturbances that come and go  be regardedHow should they be investigatedHow should they be seen with insightHow should they be regarded as stressfulWhen a thought comes into the mind can you look at it simply as an instance of stress rather than getting involved in the content of the thoughtThere are several steps hereFirst of all see that the thought is inconstantIt comes and it goesIts a disturbanceSecond see that this disturbance is stressfulKeep your analysis just at that level stress arising stress passing awayDont get involved in what the thought is aboutJust say Here comes some stressDo I want to get involved in thatWell no its stress That makes it easier to stay away from it easier to keep the mind focused easier to keep you from getting involvedWhen you see that its not self you dont have to get involved in itYou dont have to identify with itYou dont have to take it on  which also means you dont have to push it awayIf its there let it be in the backgroundThe more quickly you catch sight of it simply as an instance of stress the more easily you can tell yourself I dont have to go there As you get more skilled at this you hardly even give it time to form into a coherent thoughtWe have a tendency that once a thought arises we want to peer into it Whats this about And if it doesnt seem to make sense Well how can we make sense out of this We get more and more involved in taking it on making it an intelligible thought an intelligent thought making it a thought worth thinkingBut if you see it simply as an instance of stress and catch it more and more quickly you allow it to be a stupid thought and let it goThe next time around you allow it to be just a halfformed thought and you let it goYou allow yourself not to have to peer into and straighten out everything that comes into the mindThis makes it easier to stay focusedAs for the question of how to investigate these fabrications investigate them as skillful or unskillfulIts not the case that all thoughts are uselessSome are useful very useful but they have their time and placeThoughts related to the breath are useful for your purposes right nowThoughts related to other things  what you did yesterday what youre going to do tomorrow  are uselessTheyre unskillful at the momentBecause were so used to thinking so adept at thinking its skillful right now to focus on learning how to be adept at not thinking about anything except the breathSo think about the breathAfter all the breath itself is a fabrication a fabrication you want to hold on toSo its not the case that when you see how things are stressful and inconstant you let go of all of them right off the batYou first have to focus on maintaining the ones that are skillful and letting go of the unskillful onesIf you have trouble getting away from a particular type of unskillful thinking you can learn to analyze it to see how it leads where you dont really want to goLike that chant we had on the body just nowThats useful for lustWhen you find yourself focused on lust remind yourself What exactly is this object that youre getting so worked up aboutWhats in thereIs it something you really wantDo you really want to go where the lust will lead youIf you apply the perspective of that chant just now youre more inclined to say Well not really And the lust subsidesSo that kind of thinking is usefulWhen it has done its task you can put it asideGet back to the breathSo the questions that give rise to insight are questions one dealing with ways of not identifying with your thoughts and then two since you dont have to identify with them what do you do with themYou see when theyre useful and when theyre notThey can lead you in directions you want to go or in directions you dontYoure learning to look at thoughts not as sources of content but as parts of a causal chainTheyre important not so much for what they say as for what they doThis way you understand that even though you may not want to identify with any fabrications still there are the fabrications that form the pathThose are the ones you want to encourage because theyre skillfulUltimately they take you beyond fabricationThis is a part of insightThe fabrications that keep the mind still and steady that keep the mind engaged in the pursuit of whats skillful are the ones you want to encourageSo this practice of steadying the mind maintaining that still steady flame requires both tranquility and insightAnd of course once the mind settles down the insight gets more refinedThe tranquility gets strongerIn this way the practice of jhana depends both on tranquility and on insight and it creates the conditions for more refined tranquility and more refined insight step by stepThey all go togetherUnderstand them as different tendencies or qualities of mind but do your best not to see them as radically separateYou dont have to worry about When do I do insightWhen do I do concentration They all come togetherThe question then becomes If you begin to notice an imbalance in the mind how do you bring it back into balanceIf youre thinking too much and its snuffing out your concentration drop the thinking for a whileIf your concentration is getting too dull learn to probe it with a few questionsAnd in trying to find that balance you develop sensitivity to the mind  the basis for discernmentThis is the whole purpose of jhana practiceIts not a matter of showing off WellIve got the third jhana youve only got the second Or I jumped through all eight jhana hoops in eight daysHow about you Thats not the purposeThe purpose is to get the mind steady enough long enough so it can seeWhen it sees it can let goWhen it lets go its freeThats what this practice is all aboutThats what the Buddha meant when he said Go do jhana It encompasses all of the aspects of developing the mindAjaan Suwat used to say that settling into concentration is like falling asleep  except that you dont go to sleepAnd thats where it gets trickyIn other words how do you bring the mind to stillness and yet stay awakeIt basically happens in three stagesYou start with your ordinary everyday level of concentrationIts called momentary concentration the kind that allows you to listen to things to memorize things to read a book and remember what youve read so that it all makes senseThat kind of concentration is something we all have and it lasts for a moment or it lasts for a series of momentsYou might find yourself slipping off and coming back slipping off coming back but at least theres enough continuity so that you can rememberThats the kind of concentration you start out with when you focus on the breath or focus on buddho or whatever your meditation object isYou find the mind slipping off but you bring it backIt slips off and you bring it backTheres kind of a rhythm to it like music You play a musical phrase and then you pause another phrase and then a pauseBut theres enough continuity so that the phrases form a larger wholeThe same holds true when you start trying to stay with the breathYou may stay with a couple breaths and wander off say maybe between the inbreath and the outbreath or the outbreath and the inbreath and then start up againThis is normalThe important point is that you keep coming back coming back coming backAs you work with this kind of concentration you begin to realize why there are pausesThis level of concentration cant withstand displeasure boredom or pain  anything negative or unpleasantEven the slightest little bit of displeasure and it gets knocked offThe mind loses its focus because of thatThis is why the way to move on from this stage of concentration to the next one is to learn how to work precisely with the sense discomfortYou dont have to start with major pains just the slight discomfort you may sense in the breathMaybe its a little too long too short too shallow too deep  whateverYou learn to adjust it you learn to work with itThat gives you confidenceYou dont have to be afraid of these thingsA little bit of discomfort comes up and you can deal with itThis allows your concentration to get more continuousThis brings you to the next level which is called threshold access or neighborhood concentrationIts in the neighborhood of getting really settled down but its not quite there yetThis is where the mind grows fairly peaceful but at this stage it can easily lose its focusAs I said with momentary concentration the problem is that it cant withstand displeasureWell the problem with access concentration is that it cant withstand pleasureIt loses focus when it runs into real pleasureThis is the way the mind normally isIts so used to falling asleep when things get relaxed that it just lets goPeople who tend to have visions will have visions in this statePeople who dont still find that they drift off very easilyThey fall into what Ajaan Lee called delusionconcentration mohasamadhiThings are quiet pleasant still but you have no idea where you areSo the important thing in this stage is to give the mind work to do in the pleasureJust as with momentary concentration you focus directly on dealing with the problem  its weakness in the face of pain or displeasure  here the problem is the minds weakness in the face of pleasure so you focus on the pleasureThis is why Ajaan Lee has you spread the breath throughout the body both to give you work to do within the pleasure and to enlarge your frame of referenceNormally as you get more settled down and the breath gets softer more refined it gets harder and harder to keep track ofSo you need to expand your frame of reference to include the whole bodyThat you can keep track of even if the inandout movements of the breath grow stillThere are lots of ways of working with the breath in the bodyOne is to stay focused on the same spot youre always focused on and just broaden your sense of awareness  the range of your awareness  so that it encompasses the whole bodyThen you allow the breath to adjust so that it feels good as good as possible throughout the whole bodyAnother way is to go through the body section by section working on the breath energy in each section until it feels pleasant and then letting the pleasure in all the sections connectThis way you get used to working with your pleasureThis is one of the distinctive features of the Buddhas teachingsHe doesnt take pain or pleasure as an end in and of itselfEach of them has its usesWhen pain comes what do you do with itWhen pleasure comes what do you do with itInstead of simply suffering from the pain or enjoying the pleasure you learn how to work with these things so that they can take the mind to a deeper level of concentrationWhat happens when you work with that sense of pleasure and broaden your awareness is that the mind gets so totally involved as a whole that it cant do anything elseIts as if youve nailed its hands and its feet down to the floor so all it can do is just be thereOr you might make another comparison The mind that slips off to the past or the future has to be a very small mindIts almost as if it needed to go down a little tube to go to the future or to the pastBut when the mind is large like this it cant fit down the tubeIts stuckIf its going to go it has to shrinkSo as youre sitting here with this broadened awareness  centered in one spot but filling the whole body  youre really fixed in the present momentThis is why this third level of concentration is called fixed penetration And from that point on all you have to do is maintain that state learn to keep your balance thereThe breath will go still  sometimes it even seems to stopJust let it stopYou dont need the inandout breath anymore for the brain is using less oxygen and youre getting all the oxygen you need through your poresRemember the gold woman in GoldfingerRemember why she diedBecause the gold paint had covered her pores and she couldnt get the oxygen she needed through her skinThis shows that theres already a lot of oxygen coming through the skinSo when the breath stops coming in and out dont worryYouve got all the oxygen you needThe body can be still filled with awarenessAnd thats itThis is the state of concentration that doesnt get waylaid either by pleasure or by painIts the kind of concentration you wantYou get here by letting go of other thoughts but also by being very focused on the breathThis is where its different from falling asleepWhen you fall asleep things get still and then you just let go totally let go of all your mindfulness all your alertness and move off into another stage of becoming as the texts call itWhatever little dream world happens to appear in the mind as we fall asleep thats becoming in action and its usually in this state of threshold concentrationSo this is what you have to work pastLearn not to get carried off by the pleasure the sense of easeTell yourself Theres work to be doneIt requires skillIf youre not skillful working with the pleasure can create pain and the mind wont want to settle downBut keep working at it again and again and after a while youll develop skillYou do your work but you work in pleasureYou create an even more agreeable place to stay as you work with the sense of energy in the body in whatever way gives resultsAjaan Lee gives some recommendations but notice that in his Dhamma talks he talks about the breath energy in all kinds of waysTheres no one way of conceiving the breath thats going to work for everybodySo explore and work things out on your ownAfter all it is your body that youre settling intoYou listen to the instructions to gain pointers but you also have to use your own imagination your own ingenuity your own powers of observation to see exactly how the energy in the body is comfortable or not where you can maximize the comfortable spots and let everything spread so that the comfort all connectsThen you learn how to stay thereAnd dont think of the staying there as just waiting blankly until youre allowed to do insight practiceThe skill of learning how to stay in concentration develops precisely the mental qualities youre going to need for insight  because youre going to get more and more sensitive to even the slightest fabrications of thought in the mindYou learn to see right through them and not get carried off into their little worldsAnd thats precisely the skill youre going to need in order to see fabrication just as that  fabricationIts like taking the old Zen story of the finger pointing at the moon and turning it around You dont want to look at the moon you want to look at the finger  because the finger is whats fooling youIts pointing you away from what its doingYou dont want to look where your thoughts are pointing your attention you want to look at them simply as fabricationsSo all the important work in developing concentration and insight happens right here learning how to deal first with pain and then with pleasure so that the mind can settle down in a way thats still solid and very alert no matter whatRespect for concentrationIts interesting that of the factors of the path  virtue concentration and discernment  the Buddha singled out concentration as something worthy of respectAt one point he called it the heart of the pathAnd yet the reason he needs to remind us to respect it is because we tend to overlook it to step on itThose little moments of stillness in the mind We tend to ignore them we dont pay them much attentionWere so much more interested in running after things getting the mind all stirred up yet ignoring those little moments of stillness between what basically come down to moments of disturbance in the mindWe see the disturbance as interesting and the stillness as boring and so we keep running after whatever flashes in and looks interestingBut after we look at it for a while we see that theres not much thereSo we drop that the mind goes still for a moment and then we move to something elseThose little moments of stillness are pushed so far in the background that we hardly even see them  and yet these little moments of stillness are what the Buddha wants us to work with to respectWithout these little moments for one thing the mind would go crazyIt wouldnt have any rest at allAt the same time if youre going to develop stronger concentration youve got to start with these little momentsStart connecting them upResist the temptation to go running after any new flashy distraction that comes barging into the mindMake up your mind that youre not going to fall for the hypeYoure going to stay right here with the breathThe breath is not that colorful an object  at least on the surfaceYou find though as you get to know it that the more you spend time with it the more it has to offer the more absorbing it getsBut to reach that state of absorption you have to start out with small moments of concentration of stillnessPay attention to them look after themTo describe this process Ajaan Fuang often used the Thai word prakhawng which describes what you would do if a child was learning to walk and you were standing behind itYou want it to learn how to walk on its own but you dont want it to fallSo youre gently hovering around it to make sure it doesnt fall while at the same time not preventing it from walking on its ownThats the kind of attitude you should have toward your concentrationIn the beginning you need to have faith that the concentration is going to be a good thingThe passages youve read in the texts are there to give you inspiration a sense of rapture permeating the body The image they give is of a spring of water welling up permeating a lake or of lotuses saturated with water from the tip of their roots to the tip of their budsSounds goodSomething youd like to experienceThe images are attractive for a reasonOne Theyre really precise descriptions of the levels of concentrationTwo Theyre designed to make you want to go there to remind you that these little states of concentration that seem so unpromising on their own if you stitch them together develop a strength develop a depth provide a sense of intense gratification that they wouldnt if left on their ownWhen you take these lessons to heart and carry them through you find that the sense of peace space and stillness in the mind becomes more and more attractiveYou want to move into that sense of peace for goodThe Buddha calls this taking emptiness as your dwellingInstead of focusing on the figures in the foreground you focus on the still space around themYou realize that this space is an appealing spaceIts quiet undisturbedTheres only this modicum of disturbance the singleness of mind focused on the breath or whatever your topic of meditation isYou let go of all other concernsWhen you do that you realize how much weight youve been carrying around how many unnecessary burdens youve been creating for yourselfYou come to appreciate how good it is to have this still space in the mind surrounding everything elseYou want it to become more and more pervasiveIts so easy to lose though because youve still got that old habit of running after things you think are important or interesting things you think have a lot of value things youve got to look into to look after all the timeSo the Buddha gives you tools  the three characteristics  for undoing those habits to help you realize that those things arent really worth all that much worry worth all that much careTheyre not worth burdening the mindIts important to note though that he doesnt have you contemplate things radically in terms of the three characteristics until youve got this state of concentration and you appreciate itNow sometimes he does have you use the three characteristics in a less radical way to help you get into a state of concentration to help clear away the entanglements that keep the mind from settling down in the first placeBut for the really radical analysis he has you wait until concentration is solidSome people start analyzing things radically in terms of the three characteristics before they have sufficient skill in concentration and it can get pretty depressing pretty disorientingIt can shortcircuit the practiceYou manage a little bit of concentration and then you lose it so you console yourself by saying that youve gained all the insight you need from concentrationYouve seen that its impermanent so you dont have to do it anymoreAnd that shortcircuits the pathBut if you contemplate the three characteristics in the context of a wellmastered state of concentration it actually accomplishes somethingIt becomes liberatingYou begin to realize that these disturbances in the mind that tend to wipe out the emptiness create problems in the emptiness destroy the emptiness cut it up in little pieces are not worth all that much careTheyre not worth all that much worry or concernYou dont have to go flowing out after themThats the point in the practice where the Buddha has you think about the three characteristics in a radical way to see that the things that youve really worried about the things that youve really held on to tight are pretty empty tooThis is where their emptiness becomes a positive thing instead of being depressing or nihilisticIt means you dont have to burden yourself with themYou can live with them in such a way that they dont put any weight on the mindWhen the Buddha talks about emptiness in the Pali Canon he does so in two major contextsOne is this sense of dwelling in emptiness as the mind gets still and the emptiness begins to surround thingsThats the side of emptiness thats obviously positiveThen there are other passages where he talks about emptiness in the sense that things are empty of self or anything pertaining to selfIn other words theyre not you not yoursThey dont belong to youOut of context that sounds kind of negativeThe things you used to pin your hopes on are not really you or yours theyre not under your controlIf you take this teaching out of context it sounds like youre depriving yourself of something or that these things are negativeActually the things in and of themselves are not the problemThe problem is our attachment to them the attachment that keeps destroying our concentration destroying our stillness of mindWhen you see things as inconstant stressful and empty of self from the perspective of trying to maintain this dwelling in emptiness then the contemplation of their emptiness serves a positive purposeIt makes it easier not to get disturbed by themThe two different types of emptiness begin to connectYou can maintain this spacious sense of dwelling in emptiness and at the same time the things that used to bother you the things that used to weigh you down become empty too empty of selfBecause theyre empty they dont disturb the emptiness of your awarenessYou can live togetherYou can live with these things but not be weighed down by themThe emptiness of your mental dwelling isnt disturbed by the emptiness of the things that used to disturb itWhen its not disturbed you can look into it more carefully to the point where you see that even the emptiness of concentration is fabricatedIt too is empty of anything worth taking as you or yoursWhen you see this you lose the passion that keeps you fabricating it and in that way the mind is releasedThats when these two different meanings or the two different contexts for emptiness come together in a way that creates freedom for the mindThis positive intent applies to of all the passages where the Buddha focuses on the negative side of thingsTheres a passage in the Sutta Nipata where he describes how as a young man he looked at the world with dismayThe human race as a whole seemed like fish fighting in a dwindling puddle of waterTheres not enough water for them so all the fish are struggling with each otherThats the way the world isPeople are constantly struggling as if there werent enough in the world to feed everybody to clothe everybody to give everybody shelterIts a constant competition and everywhere he looked he found that everything was laid claim toThere wasnt a spot in the world where you could simply be freeThere wasnt a spot in the world where you wouldnt be squeezed out by somebody elseThis gave him a strong sense of samvega a strong sense of dismayBut then he realized that the problem was not in the worldIt lay in the heartThere was an arrow in the heart as he called itIf you could pull that arrow out then there would be no more problemHis description of the world may sound pessimistic but its there for a positive purposeIf we didnt see the world as confining that would indicate that our hearts are smallBut our hearts are largeOur problem is that were trying to use the world to fill up the heart and thats impossibleThe world isnt large enough for the heartThe only thing that can fill the heart is the sense of emptiness  the peace the lack of disturbance  that comes from concentration from focusing the mind on a particular object and even more so from letting go of attachmentsOur problem is that were trying to fill up our lives with the wrong thingsWere trying to fill them up with things rather than filling them up with the space and peace that can come as we work with the concentration as we develop discernmentAnother negativeseeming passage is the one where the Buddha talks about the body in terms of its partsYou take the body apart look at each piece and realize that theres nothing there in the body that youd want to get attached toYouve got lungs youve got a liver youve got intestines and youve got the contents of your intestines  all the way down the listMany people object to this contemplation saying that this is a negative way of looking at the body but the purpose of this contemplation is to free the mindIt leads to a sense of lightness it helps you realize that you dont have to take such obsessive care of the bodyYou dont have to be so attached to it you dont have to regard it as an end in and of itselfIts a useful tool and we need it in the practice but when we make it an end in itself we burden the mind we weigh it downThe purpose of this analysis is to free the mind to give it a sense of lightness to fill the mind up with the space of concentrationSo these ways of looking at the world that seem so negative actually serve a very positive purpose to remind ourselves of the happiness that comes when we dont confine ourselves to narrow desires narrow obsessions when we can free the mind from the straitjackets its imposed on itself when we can pull out that arrow the arrow of the craving based on the ignorant notion that somehow were going to get satisfaction out of our body satisfaction out of our possessions satisfaction out of our relationships satisfaction out of building a nice coherent philosophy satisfaction out of the worldWe look at these things in this way to see through them to realize that our attachments our clingings are nothing but forms of confinement for the mindWhen we have concentration as a counterbalance its easy to follow through with this sort of analysis and not get depressed for it opens the mind to stronger more lasting more solid more spacious states of peaceSo at whatever stage you are in the practice remember that respect for concentration forms the basis for everything else appreciation for the stillness in the mind those little spaces that may not seem all that impressive in the beginning but can lead to true happiness if you take them seriously if you treat them with respectThis is another common theme throughout the Buddhas teachings that little impressive things in the mind if you pay them attention if you look after them  if you in Ajaan Fuangs word prakhawng them  can more than repay the effort needed to develop themThe potential for happiness lies in little unexpected things that may seem unremarkable but really show their true colors when you pay them respectAs in those fairy tales where theres a little ugly troll whom everybody despises When a little child takes the time to show a little respect to the troll the troll reveals his treasure of gold and gives it to the childIts the same with these qualities of the mindWhen you show them respect they give you their goldWere here to look after the health of our minds because the mind has a tendency to fall prey to diseasesTheres a passage in the Udana where the Buddha right after his Awakening surveys the world and he sees everybody on fire with the fevers of passion aversion and delusionSo when we talk about the diseases of the mind here were not talking about the ones that would throw you into a mental institutionWere talking about the diseases everybody is born withWe come into the world carrying germs insideOr you might say that were born with a low resistance to diseaseThe mind doesnt have its immune system up and as a result it catches fire  catches these diseases  when germladen stimuli come in from the eyes ears nose tongue and bodyAs you know we live in a world full of germs but they can take hold in the body only when our resistance is downThe same principle holds with the mind There are all sorts of things out there that would spark passion aversion and delusion but only when our resistance is down do these things actually take over the mindThere are times when you can look at something really beautiful and feel no passion at allEvents can be really bad and yet theres no aversionThats a sign that your resistance is on a high level your immune system is workingSo the cure the Buddha offers is a double oneAs a stopgap measure he says to practice restraint of the senses so you dont take in too many germs from outsideIf you notice that when you focus on certain details the mind gets worked up dont focus on those detailsOften when we hear restraint of the senses it sounds like weve got to put blinders on  were not allowed to look were not allowed to listen which would cause all sorts of repressed things to come boiling up out of frustration insideThats the image we haveBut thats not what the Buddhas talking aboutHe says to watch for the detailsWhat are the little things that set you offOftentimes thats just what the problem is the little detailsWhen you focus on the details and not on the whole thing the mind comes up with a lopsided or unbalanced responseSo if something with beautiful details is giving rise to passion look at its repulsive detailsThats why we chant that contemplation of the thirtytwo parts of the body almost every morning  as an antidote to give you some perspectiveAs for people or situations that get you angry look on the good side look for the good detailsDont focus on the details that get you upsetAs Ajaan Lee says If you look at things with only one eye you see only one side of the situation If you look at both sides that helps get rid of delusionSo thats the stopgap measure restraint of the sensesIf youre really diligent in practicing it things get a lot easier in the meditationOur problem is that in the course of the day we leave our mind on a long leash and let it get involved in all kinds of stuffThen when the time comes to meditate its like a dog on a long leashYouve got to pull here and unwrap it there because the dogs gotten the leash wound around a lamppost wound around a bench wound around bushes and all kinds of stuffBy the time youve unwound it the meditation session is overAt the same time the mind hasnt just gotten wound around thingsIts also picked up all kinds of germs and youve got to sit here treating its illnessesBut if you really exercise restraint over the senses  if you notice when the mind is getting worked up in an unskillful direction and you counter it immediately  thats developing mindfulness and alertness right thereSo youre strengthening your immune system at the same time youre keeping germs from coming inThe enemies of our inner immune system are the mental qualities called anusaya  one of those Pali terms thats really difficult to translateSometimes its translated as latent tendency because literally saya means to lie down and anu means to be with or following But if you look how the word is used in the texts its more like obsession In other words your thoughts keep lying down with a particular object a particular patternTheyre obsessedThere are particular types of obsessions and these are the things that cause troubleFor instance when pain comes the pain itself is not all that big an issue but on its heels comes the obsession of resistanceYou get obsessed with resisting the pain and then you start looking for an escapeAnd because you see sensual pleasure as the only escape from pain thats where you go lookingYou want to find some sort of sensual pleasure to cover up the pain get rid of the pain push it awayThen once the sensual pleasure comes theres the obsession of passionYou get obsessed with passion for that pleasureYou want to keep it going to counteract the pain to protect you from the painAnd as for delusion that usually centers on feelings that are neither pleasant nor painful neutral feelingsYou dont pay much attention to themYou dont really see them because youre out looking for the pleasure and trying to push away the painThe neutral feelings seem unimportant and so a lot of delusion comes into the mind right at that pointThats where the Buddha says the ignorance obsession tends to focusHe said that these obsessions circle around the pain the pleasure the feeling of neither pleasure nor painTheyre the things that cause problems in your immune systemNow the minds immune system doesnt work quite like the bodysTo strengthen it requires understanding  understanding that there are alternatives to the ways you ordinarily react to pleasure or painThe texts talk about three ways of doing thisIn the Culavedalla Sutta Visakha a layman asks his exwife Dhammadinna  whos now a nun  some questions on the DhammaAfter she explains these three obsessions  resistance passion ignorance  he asks Is there passion obsession with every feeling of pleasureResistance obsession with every feeling of pain or diseaseIgnorance obsession with every feeling of neither pleasure nor pain She answers No and goes on to explain You can focus on the pleasure of the first jhana and the passion obsession doesnt come into play there Its a different kind of interest a different kind of attachmentThere is attachment to that state but its not quite the same as the obsession you have for sensual objectsIt actually builds up your resistance to those obsessionsAs for the desire for Awakening she says Even though it may be unpleasant to think about how far you have to go or how much you want to be awakened and youre not awakened yet its still a useful unpleasant feeling A lot of people say Dont let yourself have the desire for Awakening because youre going to make yourself miserableJust be content with where you are Thats not how the Buddha taught at allHe said If you dont have the desire to awaken how are you going to awaken When youre shooting a gun you cant hit higher than you aimYouve got to aim highSo the frustration of aiming at a goal an Awakening you havent yet attained Thats a useful sense of disease a useful sense of somethings got to be done somethings not quite right yet In the course of that useful disease though theres no obsession of resistance so that helps break this cycle of these obsessionsAs for the ignorance obsession that tends to hang around neutral feelings you can cut through it with the fourth jhana where the mind settles down to a state of neither pleasure nor pain  total equanimityPurity of equanimity and mindfulness its calledTotal fullbody awareness like a white cloth covering the body from head to toeTheres no ignorance obsession thereSo these obsessions that circle around pleasure and pain can be cut when you realize that there are alternative ways of dealing with pleasure and pain alternative pleasures and pains to focus onWhen theres pain in the body you can still find a way of giving rise to jhanaYou focus not on the pain but on the parts of the body that are still comfortable at ease and you maximize that sense of easeThis leads you either to the point where the physical pain goes away or to the point where even if its still there it doesnt matterYouve got a better place to be which at the same time doesnt have the drawbacks of sensual pleasuresThat sets you on the path to cutting those other obsessions as wellSo the work here is twofold just as it is when you try to protect the body from diseaseOn the one hand you dont expose yourself to more germs than you need to and then on the other you build up your resistance strengthen your resistance strengthen your immune systemTo do this you start with the practice of jhana the practice of good solid concentration so you can cut through those obsessions so that you gain alternative ways of relating to pleasure and painAs the Buddha said in his sutta on the two arrows if theres pain in the body its like being shot with one arrowWhen these obsessions get involved with the pain its like shooting yourself with another arrow  although for most of us its not a second arrow its a third fourth fifth  whole flurries of arrows get shot there right in the mind over one little painIts even worse with big painsIn other words the germs get in and simply take overSo you build up your resistance through the practiceUltimately when discernment finally breaks through to the ultimate level you can go wherever you wantNo germs can touch you because your immune system is totally in controlBut until that point you have to be careful working both on the outer and on the inner levelWhen you work on the two of them together thats when you get the best resultsYour mind gains a better sense of what it means to be really healthy to have real sense of wellbeing no matter what happens because you know the basic principles of looking after the minds healthAfter all the Buddha said he was a doctor for the mindThis was the kind of medicine he practiced not where he cures our diseases but he tells us how to cure our own diseases  which is what were doing right nowWe all carry whole worlds in our heads whole worlds in our bodiesI once saw a cartoon of a meditator being taken over by her thoughtsIn the first panel shes sitting very quietlyThen the word think appears in her headThen another think gets added onto her neck and then another one in her chest and finally by the end of the cartoon the words think think think think think blot out her entire bodyThats the way it is with us Our bodies are filled with thoughtsWe ordinarily think of thoughts as filling the mind but they also take place in the body as wellThe mind is what does the thinking but parts of the body get involved in the processThis is how we carry those whole worlds aroundYou sit here with your body and all of the sudden it turns into someplace elseIts all happening right here in the mind and body in the present moment but in the course of the process the body and mind get turned into another world and another timeYou can compare it to the control keys on computer keyboardsIf you ordinarily push a P or a Q you get a P or a Q on the screenBut if you push the control button and then push the P or the Q theyre not Ps and Qs anymoreYou get something elseThe machine prints or it quitsAll of the sudden the key does something else for its in a different contextThe same with the mind and the body in the present moment You press your inner control key and all of a sudden youve got another worldIts not just the body sitting here breathingIts Thailand or Europe New York or TexasIn addition to the worlds we intentionally carry around there are also lots of unintentional ones that come blowing through our mindsThose come because of the force of our old actionsAs those storms come blowing through sometimes the best thing you can do is simply hold onto the breathJust as you would batten down for a storm you just lie low and try to hold tight to the breath for dear life as the winds blow throughYou hang onto the breath as tenaciously as you canEven though it doesnt fill your awareness it at least gives you a corner where youre still in the context of the present momentIn the Discourse on the Establishing of Mindfulness youre told at the first stage to subdue greed and distress with regard to the world vineyya loke abhijjhadomanassamIn other words you may not be able to stop these various worlds from happening in the present moment but you can work at subduing any greed or distress with regard to them as they come throughIn other words try to be as equanimous as possible as uninvolved as possible in the processStay with the breath as much as you consciously canAs you keep this up after a while the storms begin to calm downThen if youre holding onto the breath consistently enough you can begin to see things a bit more preciselyYou see more and more how much youre conspiring with those various worlds coming inBut the initial principle is that whatever conscious decisions youre making make sure theyre decisions to stay with the breathAt the very least dont get involved in other things that come along even if theyre filling your body and mindThis helps establish a beachhead in the presentWithout that beachhead you simply get blown aroundEven though this standpoint may ultimately be a fabrication its a useful oneIn the beginning you hardly notice that its a fabricationYou just notice that its a place where you stand still where you take your stance and try to stay as solid as possible as uninvolved as possible so that your frame of reference doesnt shift  so that you dont find yourself suddenly in Las Vegas or PattayaYoure right hereThose other worlds are coming through but theyre coming through right hereAnd you do your best even though you may get involved a little bit to make sure you feel no greed or distress with regard to the worlds coming throughIn other words you dont get involved with any narratives that would pull you in even furtherYou dont let these things get you upsetSometimes this requires just standing still with the breathOther times it requires reflecting on those various worlds What do they give youWhat do they hold for youHow real are theyTheres a passage where VenRatthapala is talking to a king who wants to know why VenRatthapala ordainedAfter all his family is wealthy his parents are still alive he himself is young and healthyWhy would anyone whos not obviously suffering want to ordainVenRatthapala says he considered that All worlds are swept away they dont endure Thats his way of expressing the principle of inconstancy and impermanenceThey offer no shelter theres no one in charge No one can protect you from the suffering of those worldsThats the principle of stress and painThe world has nothing of its own one has to pass on leaving everything behind Thats the principle of notself Theres nothing you can really hold onto in any of these worldsNo matter how much you grasp at them they just slip right through your fingers like waterFinally All worlds are insufficient insatiable a slave to craving No matter how good they get theyre still not good enough for the mindOnce the mind develops a sense of desire for these things its never fulfilledThe Dhammapada contains a verse where the Buddha says that even if it rained gold coins we still wouldnt have enough for our sensual desires because all the things they could buy keep slipping away slipping awayTheyre impermanent unstable stressful notselfThey offer no real protection nothing you can really hold ontoReflecting on this makes it easier to let go of these worlds as they come roaring throughIf you sense any temptation to get ensnared in a particular world if it seems interesting or intriguing just reflect on this No matter how good it gets its never good enoughAt the same time it can cause a lot of suffering not only for you but also for the people around youYou sit here with a mind capable of creating these worlds but they require a body as their staging groundAnd just keeping this human body alive Think of how much other people have to suffer so that you have enough food shelter clothing and medicine to keep goingAnd then what do you doYou use this body to entertain yourself as a staging ground for your private worldsHow selfish and thoughtless can you getSo these worlds that youre building Youre building not only on your own suffering but also on the suffering of othersWhen you think about this it sets you wondering Can you develop the skill where you dont have to build these worlds and still be happyCan you find a happiness that doesnt depend on the bodyThe first step as I just said is learning how not to get involved in the worlds coming through the mindTry to establish this frame of reference right here at the body in and of itselfEven though the breath might not fill all your awareness right from the very beginning even though these various worlds may keep barging in you at least lay claim to a corner of your awareness and hold onThe basic principle is that you dont get involved with anything else but the breathYou just stay right hereThen as you stay here with more consistency you find that this frame of reference begins to fill more of your awarenessThis inandofitself frame of reference becomes more and more predominant as you develop an interest in the breathIts not just a matter of inandoutThere are all kinds of variations in the flow of breath energy coursing through the bodyAs you explore them you find that youre learning not only about the breath but also about the mindYou begin to see the mind a lot more clearly as youre staying with the breath and you get more absorbed in this frame of reference body feelings mind and mental qualities in and of themselves all present right here at the breathThis is what helps keep you anchoredMore and more this fills your awarenessWhen the body fills your awareness and your awareness fills the body without all those other worlds coming in when you finally get a sense of seclusion where youre not involved in those things Thats when you can settle down in Right ConcentrationThis gives you a stronger and stronger frame of reference right hereThen you look into the process where this frame of reference gets switchedWhats the control key that turns a simple P into a print commandWhats the switch in your frame of reference that turns the process of fabrication in the body and mind into another worldYou have to be quick to catch these things as they happenThe more quickly you notice this process of fabrication  before it starts forming a world when its just a little stirring in the mind  the betterHere the first step is learning simply how to notice it and dissolve it away notice it and dissolve it awayMake it your sportAs soon as theres any stirring that could turn in to a world as soon as youre aware of its happening just zap itBreathe right through itRelease whatever tension there may be around it in whatever part of the body it may show itself because whenever a thought shows itself in the mind theres going to be a corresponding tension in the bodyWhen youre consistently with the breath you can see this clearlyAnd you keep zapping that tension with the breath to dissolve it away zapping it to dissolve it awayIts like shooting rubber ducks in an arcadeNothing really gets harmedTheyre not real ducks that youre shootingJust try to get really good as a marksmanThe Buddha compares this to someone whos really good at firing arrows who can pierce great masses and can fire arrows in rapid successionIn other words once you gain a sense of being established in the body in and of itself or in feelings in and of themselves you want to shoot down the process of fabrication as quickly as you canAs soon as it switches from the inandofitself to another frame of reference shoot it downGradually you get quicker and quicker and you begin to see more and more how youve been involved in the processThere are points where you make a decision Am I going to let what Ive got here shift into another frame of reference And theres that curiosity Whats this thought going to doWhats that thought going to do Youre always hoping for something to provide satisfaction to provide entertainment but if you keep in mind the fact that these things never can provide enough satisfaction no matter how great a world they create you can just shoot them downTheres the example that VenRatthapala gave of the king who controls a really large prosperous territoryWord comes that theres another territory to the east that he could conquer and rule as wellSo he sends troops to conquer itThen hes told of another territory to the westIf he wants he could probably send over his army and defeat that one tooSo he goes over to the west and just keeps expanding expanding his territory until hes got everything  east west north south  on this side of the oceanThen someone tells his of another territory that he could conquer on the other side of the ocean so he decides to go ahead and do thatThats the way it is with the mind Theres never a sense of enoughThese worlds we create never provide satisfactionWhen you reflect on that its easier to give yourself over to the process of shooting them down shooting them downAny distraction that comes up and could disturb your concentration just shoot it down as soon as you realize its happeningThe breath is very useful in this processAs your awareness begins to fill the body you get more and more sensitive to obscure places in the body where thoughts can land on the body or take different sensations in the body as their basisThe more completely your frame of reference fills the body the more quickly you can see these thingsYou can shoot them down shoot them down and then you begin to see What are the raw materials that these worlds are created fromWell theres not much just a little stirring here a stirring there and you connect them upYou stitch them togetherTo what purpose to what endYou begin to realize that theres nothing there of any real satisfactionThe worlds you create offer no satisfaction the things you create them from are all very ephemeralThey offer nothing really solid that you can hold ontoIts like building a house out of frozen meatIts bound to melt and start stinking up the placeRealizing this gets you more and more firmly established in your frames of reference in the present the body in and of itself feelings mind mental qualities all in and of themselvesBefore these things can turn into anything more elaborate you keep them really cleaned out cleared out as uncomplicated as possibleUltimately your gaze will turn on the basic building blocks themselvesEven this present frame of reference Thats a kind of becoming tooTheres an element of fabrication an element of creation in here as wellBut before you start taking this apart youve got to get it really solid as a basis for taking other more obvious things apartMost people when they practice are in too much of a hurryThey get a little bit of concentration and they say Okay the next step is discernment So they abandon their concentration and destroy it before its really had a chance to do its workWe like to figure things out too much in advanceAfter all we think were clever it would take less energy take less time if we could move on as fast as possibleBut some things you just cant rushThe analogy the Buddha gives is of a woman whos pregnantShe asks her husband to take a monkey and dye it so that when the child is born it will have a little monkey to play withThe husband wants to know what color to dye it depending on whether its a boy or a girl so the wife tears open her womb right there  and of course that kills the childSome things you cant rushThe same with training the mind Youve got to get it really solidly established really centered here on the breathDont worry about the next step where its going to goWhen you settle down with the breath you do need to remember that this is not the ultimate  its just a temporary resting spot  but at the same time you need to try to make it as good and as comfortable as possible as solid as possibleOnly then can it provide you with a framework from which you can see other things that are subtle and refinedTry to inhabit this world as continuously as you can  the world of the present moment the world where things are kept simple body in and of itself feelings in and of themselves mind in and of itself mental qualities in and of themselves before they get turned into something else with the control key that transforms your frame of referenceKeep this frame of reference as consistent as possible so that you can see the other movements of the mind understand how they happen how things come about how they arise stay how they pass awayTry to keep this spot as solid as possible so you can see those other subtle movements in the mindThat you find will cut away a lot of the suffering that goes along with those thingsWithout this solid foundation you just get swept awayThe world gets swept away  you get swept away along with itThe world offers no shelter  youve lost your shelter here in the present momentThese worlds have nothing of their own  well you have nothing of your own in the present moment because you keep destroying it abandoning your frame of reference to go running after shadowsThese worlds are a slave to craving  youre the slaveSo do your best to establish a good solid state right here in the present moment at whatever level you can manage whether its simply the level of not getting involved in greed and sorrow for the worlds that come blowing through your mind or the level of being more and more independent from themUltimately you want to get to the point where youre totally independent of any worldAnissato viharati na ca kinci loke upadiyati as they say in the Satipatthana SuttaYou dwell independent not attached to anything in the worldThats the direction you want to go where youre not attached to any world at allSo whether its simply the level of withstanding the worlds that seem to be totally beyond your control or youre getting more and more sovereign and independent Whatever level youre at do your best to stay as solid as possible as uninvolved as possibleDont get upset because youre not totally uninvolvedWork at whatever level you find yourself because the work of the practice does build on your earlier more faltering steps to make something more solid and secureIts a path where you can make progress even if its just step by stepA lot of people say I dont want thatI want sudden Awakening Well some things can happen suddenly but no understanding no skill comes with sudden things that happen haphazardly in the mindWere working on a skill here the skill of learning to stay centered keeping this frame of reference not shifting to othersJust that skill in and of itself can cut through a lot of sufferingSo as you meditate try to keep your nose downTry to keep as close to the ground as possibleAs always the people who stay close to the ground are the ones who dont get blown awayThe people who keep their nose down get to sniff interesting things get to find out interesting things that everybody else tends to overlookPeople have a lot of resistance to contemplating the body as a topic of meditationSome of them complain they already have a negative body image so why focus on the negative side of the bodyOthers say that body contemplation is a way of fostering aversion to the body which is an unhealthy mental stateOthers say theyre not all that attached to their bodies so why should they have to focus on the bodyOr theyll refer to that story where the Buddha recommended contemplation of the body to some monks and then went off into the forest for a couple of monthsThe monks got so disgusted with their bodies that they started committing suicide while others hired assassins to kill themselves offWhen the Buddha came out of the forest he found the community of monks was a lot smaller than it had been before so he called the remaining monks together and told them to practice breath meditation insteadSome people cite this as proof that contemplation of the body is an unhealthy practiceHowever the fact that people resist this meditation so much shows that its importantIts threatening for it gets right to the core of our attachmentTheres nothing in the world were attached to more than our own bodiesThats why people have so many excuses for not focusing right hereIf you dont focus right here whats going to happenYoure going to maintain your deep attachment to the bodyIts not going to go away on its ownSome people think they can short circuit the process of attachment by going straight to their sense of self thinking that by cutting out the sense of self they wont have to work on contemplation of the body because the work theyre doing goes deeper straight to the rootBut attachment is like a vine You cant find the root until you take hold of the nearest branch and trace it backYou cant really get to the root of your attachment to self until youve looked at where your most blatant daytoday momenttomoment attachment is right here at the bodyThe least little thing happens to your body and you cant stand itA little bit of hunger a little bit of thirst too much heat too much cold sets you running offA little bit of illness and you go running for medicineIf thats not attachment what isSo its important that we look right hereOtherwise we stay attached to the suffering the body is going to bring usAs we all know it grows old gets sick and then diesIf you dont think thats going to be suffering then go spend some time with some very old people some very sick people with dying peopleSee how much they sufferWhen I was back at my fathers house two weeks ago I helped every day with the daily ritual of turning him over so my stepmother could take off his diaperWhile she was doing that I got to see what an old body with bed sores looks like how an old body functions and doesnt function how much suffering it brings when its helpless not only for the person in the old body but also for the people taking care of himI also saw what its like to be old and not to have trained the mindThe mind at a time like that is totally out of control because as the body gets weaker your energy fallsThe thoughts that come barging into the mind can take total control if you havent developed the ability to counter themThen there are all the indignities of agingIts as if the human body is designed to undercut any sense of pride we might feelOther people have to wipe you other people have to turn you over whatever sense of privacy you used to have about your body gets thrown out the windowYou cant control your urinating cant control your defecatingEverything goes out of controlAnd its good to contemplate this not to develop a sense of aversion but to look at the universality of this bodily condition and to develop a sense of samvega seeing how much effort goes into maintaining the body and then where all that effort ends upIf thats where youre looking for happiness youre looking in the wrong placeThats what this whole contemplation is aboutIf you dont learn how to give up your attachment now while youre still healthy and strong its going to get harder and harder as the body weakens as the body grows oldSo we have to develop a sense of pasada a sense of confidence in the contemplation of the bodyTheres no way youre going to get over your attachment to the body if you dont look at it very very carefullyThe reason were attached is because we dont look carefullyThis is what the contemplation of the parts of the body is all about contemplating the body in terms of the elements for thats all it isWhat have you got hereJust physical elementsWind or energyFire warmthWater coolnessAnd earth solidityDo they belong to youNo theyre all part of the worldAs the saying goes Ashes to ashes dust to dust As long as were alive we take in the elements as we eat and we expel elements as we defecate and then when we have to give the whole thing up it all goes back into the elements as we dieSo where are you going to find true happiness thereAfter all the effort that goes into the body is the body true to youSometimes it does what you want but a lot of times it doesntWhen it starts getting old and grows sick and dies it doesnt ask your permissionYoud think that after all the effort you put into it it would show some gratitude but it cantThats not its natureWere the ones whove been animating this thingOne of the images in the Canon is of the body as a puppetWe pull the strings for a while and then they snap the pieces break downIts good to develop a sense of dispassion and disenchantment for the body to develop a sense of samvega so that when it breaks down we dont break down tooWe chant the parts of the body so often that the chant has become almost automaticYou can do it without even thinking about what youre saying so stop and focus on each of the parts one by oneStop and visualize each one as you go down the listStart with hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin fleshAs you visualize each part also try to have a sense of where exactly in your body the part is locatedWhen you get to the skin you realize youve got the whole body all surrounded right thereTheres skin all around you on all sidesFlesh is all over the place with the bones at the coreGo through the various parts until you hit one that really strikes you really hits homeRemind yourself Oh yeah theres one of those in this body too And it really hits you how incongruous it isYou have a liver a gall bladder a large intestine hours out of the dayYouve been carrying this thing around with you all the time  this thing being whichever part gives you a sense of how odd or disgusting or unclean or peculiar this body is whichever part hits you in any way thats helpful for contemplatingHere youve been taking so much care of this looking after it so much and this is all youve got to show for all that effortWere not badmouthing the body were just looking at it for what it isUltimately we want to learn how to use it simply as a tool without attachment but to counteract the attachment youve got to go very far in the other direction to counteract all the hype all the slick advertising slogans youve used to sell yourself on the body about how important it is how essential it is all the good things that come from looking after it very carefully doing all the yoga giving it exercise eating all the right foodsYou can do those things and yet still its going to age grow ill and dieOne of the meditation techniques Ajaan Fuang liked to teach when people developed a sense of light in the body was to have them visualize themselves within that lightSometimes they didnt even have to will itThe image would appear on its own right there in the lightThey could see themselves sitting right in front of themselvesThen hed say Okay think about what the body is going to look like five years from now then ten years fifteen twenty on up to when you dieWhat is it going to look like when you dieThen if you keep it around the second day after you die the third day fourth day fifth day What will it look like thenAfter seven days cremate itWatch the cremation flamesAnd then whats leftJust some ashes and bones and then over time the bones themselves will ultimately turn to ashYouve got nothing but a pile of powderThen it gets blown away Then hed have them run the film backwards reassemble the whole thing until you got back to the present moment to reconnect with the fact that what youve got right here is inevitably headed in the direction you just sawThe benefit of all this is that when theres the least little delusion about the body this contemplation helps to cut right through itThen the desire for an ideal body any thought that Other people may get old but Im going to do yoga Im going to eat right and Im not going to get old as fast as they do You see how deluded and futile it isThis is not to encourage you not to take care of the body but simply to watch out for any delusion that gets built up around it so that when aging illness and death come youre more preparedAnother reason to contemplate it is to ask yourself Aging illness and death are coming  have you attained the state of mind thats going to be free from suffering when they arriveIf you havent how much time do you haveYou dont knowSo get to work right nowWhen the urge comes to cut short your meditation remember this How much more time will you have to meditateHave you gotten to where you want to goAfter all this is the end of the story line for all of usAging illness and death This is where its all headedYouve got to be preparedOtherwise youll lie in bed hallucinating when you get old  seeing strange dogs in the corner and people committing suicide out in the yard  because the fact of your being old the fact of your approaching death is just too much for you to think about too much for the mind to handleThe mind starts blocking things outWhen it blocks things out in that way it heads toward delusionIt tries to run away as much as it can from the unpleasant things but you cant run away from themTheyre right thereYou have yourself trappedThe only way to get out of this trap is to dig down into the mind and uproot your attachmentsThats where your hope liesWhen the Buddha points out the negative side of things its never just to stop at the negative sideIts to point you toward the DeathlessIts to remind you as a warning This is the way things are so what are you going to do to stay happy in the face of how they areOnly the Deathless can give you a secure refuge at a time like thatWe like to think that life will come to a nice point of closure where the loose ends get tied up where everything gets settled as at the end of a movie or a novel but thats not what happensEverything just unravels falls apartThings dont come back together and resolve themselves nicelyTheres is a huge dissonance at the end of life as things trail off every which wayThats how the body comes to an endThe question then is Will the mind go the same way as wellWe have the choiceThis is our opportunity  the practice  so we contemplate the unattractive side of the body to develop a sense of samvega to encourage us to practice and dig deeperAs the Buddha said mindfulness immersed in the body ultimately leads to the Deathless if you do it rightIf you do it wrong and develop a sense of aversion like the monks in the story then  as the Buddha advised them  go back to the breathThat will help dispel the aversion in the same way that the first rains of the rainy season dispel all the dust that has filled the air during the hot seasonBut that doesnt mean you stop doing contemplation of the bodyIt simply means you have to learn how to do it skillfully so that the sense of samvega is always there inspiring a sense of pasada in whatever way will give you some release provide the escape so that  as the sutta says  youll be happy even when ill happy even when aging happy even when you dieBut because our attachment to the body is so strong we need strong medicine to counteract itBody contemplation is not something you do once every now and thenIts something you have to do repeatedlyYou have to keep coming back to this theme because its the only thing that will keep you sane the only thing that will provide real releaseIf you find yourself resisting this practice look into that resistance to see exactly what it isIts usually a disguise for your attachmentThe body isnt the problem the attachment is the problem but to deal with the attachment youve got to focus on the object where the attachment holds on very tightWhen you really look at it you see that the bodys really not much its not worth much and yet your attachment builds up so many narratives so many desires around itSo this is a topic of meditation you need to have close at hand at all times because these attachments come up in all kinds of ways at all timesYou want to be ready for them on top of themAs the body continues doing its thing  it wears down here wears down there this illness comes up that illness comes up  youll be preparedIn Thailand they have the tradition of printing books at funerals and in the beginning of each book there will usually be a little biography of the person to whom the merit is dedicatedA lot of the best Dhamma books in Thailand are the ones printed at funerals so as you read these Dhamma books you cant help but look at some of the biographiesThey all follow the same patternThe person was doing well had a happy life wife husband children whateverThen after a while he or she started to develop a particular ailment maybe a little bit of kidney problem a liver problem maybe a heart problemAt first it didnt seem too serious the medicine took care of it but after a while it became more and more chronic more and more troublesome ultimately to the point where doctors couldnt do anythingThey just had to throw up their hands and although they did their best the person diedAnd its ironic The human mind has the tendency to think Well thats themSomehow Im different But youre not differentLook at yourself look at all the people around youWhat disease will strike down the person next to youWhat disease will strike down that person over thereWhat disease do they already have inside them thats ultimately going to do thatWhat disease is inside youThe potential is already there doing its workOne of the contemplations Id frequently do in Bangkok as I was riding a bus would be to remind myself that All the people in the bus have a funeral ahead of themTheres going to be a funeral for this person a funeral for that person a funeral for that person over thereItll hit all of themAnd me too And its funny You might think that this sort of thinking is pessimistic or sad but its notIts liberatingIts a great equalizerYou dont get tied up in the particulars of liking this person or not liking that person being worried about this or that issue in your lifeYou know its all going to end in deathAnd that thought frees you to focus on things that really are important like the whole issue of attachmentTry to see this practice as liberating because it isIf you appreciate that fact you find you get more and more mileage out of itIf you have the right attitude toward contemplation of the body it can take you farIt can provide a lot of freedom even in the midst of aging illness and death in the midst of all the indignities and pains and problems of aging illness and death for it helps point you in the right direction to the part of the mind that is freeThe last time I saw Ajaan Suwat shortly before his death he mentioned that his brain was beginning to malfunction that it was giving him all sorts of weird perceptionsBut he added That thing I got through the meditation though that hasnt changed its still there which is why the suffering of the body didnt weigh on his mind why the weird perceptions produced by the brain didnt deceive himHe showed that its possible not to suffer in the process of growing ill and dyingAnd when something like that is possible you really want to aim all of your efforts in that directionAs one of the chants says dont be the sort of person who later regrets that you didnt take advantage of the opportunity to practice when you were still healthy and strongThe Buddhas basic teaching on insight is the four noble truthsWe tend to lose sight of that fact thinking that insight means seeing the inconstancy stress and notselfness of thingsIt does in part but that insight has to take place in a larger context which is of the four noble truthsAnd these truths in turn come down to cause and effect skillful and unskillful the things you do that lead to suffering and the things you can do that lead to the end of sufferingThe doing there is important because we shape our experience much more than we normally imagine and insight lies in seeing precisely that fact seeing what were doing to shape our experience even though we may think were sitting here perfectly still doing nothing at allTheres an undercurrent of sankhara or fashioning going on in the mind all the time even nowInsight shows its usefulness in pointing out that were doing this shaping and also in showing us where were doing it in unskillful ways so that we can learn to do it more skillfullyEssentially insight consists of catching yourself creating trouble catching yourself creating stress creating unnecessary burdens for yourself seeing what youre doing as you actually do it realizing that you chose to do itAjaan Fuang once said Insight comes down to seeing your own stupidity Youve been doing things that you dont have to do that create suffering for you and the people around youAnd even though these things cause suffering you keep on doing them again and again and againThats stupidityWe dont like to think of ourselves as stupid but we areWhen you finally develop the equanimity needed to admit your stupidity when you can step back and learn how to unlearn all those stupid actions Thats where insight shows its benefitsIt can teach you to fashion things in a new way a better way so that your participation in shaping your experience your participation in the world around you gets more and more skillfulIf insight didnt help in these ways it wouldnt really be worth muchThere are lots of teachings about emptiness and inconstancy or impermanence that are wide of the markThey may be interesting to reflect on to speculate about but if they dont make any difference in what youre actually doing from moment to moment theyre pretty uselessThis is why the Buddha avoided many of the issues that everyone else in his time was worked up aboutIs everything a onenessA pluralityIs the body the same as the life forceIs the body different from the life forceIs the world eternalIs it not eternalIs it finiteIs it infiniteWhen people reach the end of the path do they exist not exist both neitherThese were the hot philosophical issues of the day but the Buddha refused to get involved in them because they didnt make any difference in terms of this one issue What are you doing thats skillful and unskillfulCan you learn to act more skillfully than youve been doingA lay follower of the Buddha was once approached by a person who asked just these questions What does your teacher teachDoes he teach that the world is finite or infinite And the lay follower said Well no  Eternal not eternal  No he doesnt address that issue either and so on down the listAnd the first person complained Well your teacher doesnt seem to teach anything at allSo the lay follower said Thats not the caseHe teaches whats skillful and whats unskillful Remember thatThats the most basic issue the Buddha addresses and he addresses it in a lot of detailIf meditation were simply a matter of learning how to get very still in the present moment how do you think all of those different Dhamma teachings would have developedAll of what they call the different division of the Dhamma in the Canon came from someone who was really focused on the issue of skill and lack of skill trying to develop more skillful ways of approaching everything in lifeThis is how your daily practice intersects with your meditation practice Just try to be more skillful in what you say more skillful in what you doDevelop that habit of being very clear about what your intentions are very clear about what your actions are and about their resultsWhen you develop that attitude in your external actions and then bring it into your meditation you get more skillful in what you thinkYou start seeing things you didnt see beforeAt the same time as you develop in your meditation you get more sensitive to your external actions as wellSo in this way your practice of sitting still with your eyes closed and your practice of walking around with your eyes open out dealing with people in the world become more of a wholeYoure tackling the issue of skillfulness on all frontsMake this the thread connecting everything you do as you practiceThis is the thread that turns daily life into a genuine practice of daily life Your interaction with other people then actually does become part of your practiceThe work you do becomes part of your practiceEverything you do and say and think can become part of your practice if you approach every activity with the question Whats skillful hereWhats not skillful hereWhat choices do I have Take advantage of the freedom that every moment offers to make the best choice possibleWhen issues come up in daily life try to approach them as a challenge in this wayWhen issues like lust anger or fear arise in the mind take the opportunity to approach them skillfullyAll too often were afraid of fear angry about our anger lustful for our lustIn other words we approach these unskillful mental states in unskillful ways that simply compound the problemSo the issue lies in learning how not to be angry about your anger how not to be lustful for your lust how not to be afraid of your fearThat way you can deal with these issues in a more effective more harmless wayFor example angerFrequently weve heard and its constantly repeated that the antidote for anger is metta or goodwillIn the Canon though the Buddha actually offers a wide range of approaches for dealing with angerIn a few cases he advocates developing metta for people who are harming you but more generally he cites all four Sublime Attitudes as antidotes to angerIn other words the antidote includes metta but not just mettaYou want to develop the other Sublime Attitudes tooAnd the attitude the Buddha recommends most is equanimity equanimity in the sense of stepping back from the situation and seeing it as part of a universal pattern not just as something personal between you and the person youre angry withOne of the traditional ways to develop equanimity is to contemplate the principle of karma that what you do is importantParticularly in the situation in which you find yourself whats important is not so much what the other person is doing as what youre doingFocus on thatIf you let yourself get worked up about what the other person is doing how often hes done it and how hes come back with it again and again and again and again If you carry that thought around you make it more and more difficult to deal with your response in the present momentSo drop any thinking about what the other person has been doing and turn around to look at what youve been doing and are about to doTo do this its useful to divide the anger into three parts one the object of the anger two the anger itself as a mental state and three the physical manifestations of the angerWhen you can separate them out in this way anger becomes a lot easier to deal withTo separate the anger itself from the object of the anger you step back and think in terms of equanimityHere the Buddha recommends looking at the universality of your problemIn one sutta he divides up the reasons for being angry and sets them out in kind of a chartOne reason for being angry is that this person has done something harmful to meOr this person has done something harmful to people I love or this person has done something helpful to people I dont like at allIn each case youre supposed to reflect Well what should I expectIts the way of the world That question  What should I expect asked with a cynical tone of voice is meant to pull you back a little bit to get you to see the situation in a larger contextThen you go on to This person is doing something harmful to me this person is doing something harmful to people I like or this person is doing something helpful to people I dont likeIn other words you bring the whole set from the past into the present tense and again the question is What should I expectThe next set of three puts all three variables into the future This person is going to do something harmful to me and on down the lineWhen you stop to think like that the simple act of stepping back from the situation and putting it into a larger framework can provide you with some perspectiveIn other words you reflect on the ways of the worldThis is a world of friends and enemies where any action is bound to displease somebodyThis is the kind of world you were born into  and you were the one who wanted to be born hereThis is the way things are everywhere in this worldA lot of wisdom lies just in being able to step back and remember that factLook at the situation in terms of a larger framework so that your thoughts arent focused with such narrow intensity on the person or the activity you dont likeWhen theyre narrowly focused like that the huge blind spots around them make us lose our perspective  not only about whats happening but also about what we should be doingOften what gets shunted off to the side when were angry is the sense of shame and the sense of fear for the consequences of our actionsPeople can get extremely courageous in dumb ways when theyre angry because their fear of consequences gets shoved off to the side like a poor relative or an unwanted childSo the first step is to take that larger viewpoint to see the situation in a larger framework so as to eliminate the blind spotsWithin that framework your anger becomes something you obviously dont want to follow through withYou dont want it to influence your actionsIf you know that youre the heir of your actions you dont want to inherit any actions done with an unskillful state of mindThe function of equanimity is to remind you of that factThats when you can drop your focus on the object of the anger and turn to look at the anger itself in the mindHere the problem is complicated by the fact that anger is usually accompanied by a physical reactionWhen a flash of anger bursts into the mind it really sets our bloodstream churningAll sorts of hormones come roaring out our heart beats wildly we breathe in a different way and an oppressive sense of tension or discomfort develops in the bodyOur immediate reaction is that wed like to get that discomfort out of our systemBut if we try to get it out of our system in the usual way which is speaking or acting under the force of the anger that just compounds the problemAlso the physical reaction confuses usSometimes we can actually think ourselves into a better perspective about the anger but the bloodstream is still churning and it makes us think we must still be angryThat churning of the bloodstream can last a long timeAfter all our bodies are built for the fightorflight response and we normally need more than just a few seconds if were going to fight more than a few seconds if were going to fleeIn cases like that those longlasting hormones are usefulBut when youre trying to overcome the anger in the mind the lastingness of those hormones is not helpful at allSo make sure to see the thoughts and the physical symptoms as two separate thingsThe mind itself may have calmed down somewhat from the anger but the physical manifestations are still present obstructing your view of the mind so you want to deal with themBreathe through the tensionBreathe in a way that gets your heartbeat back to normalBreathe in a way that gets the level of tension in your body back to normalYou might want to think of the tension in your body as flowing out your feet out your hands all through the inbreath all through the outOpen up those energy channels so that youre not carrying the sense of oppression aroundThat makes the anger a lot easier to deal with because you feel less burdened less irritated less constricted physicallyThen you can look at the mind in and of itselfWhat is this state of anger in and of itselfAs I said its often a blinding of the mind putting blinders on the sides of your mental eyes so you can see only certain things and focus only on certain detailsThe state of being constricted mentally like this is really unpleasantJust stepping back to look at it helps take off some of those blindersYou dont have to be afraid of the anger or angry about the angerJust ask What is this state to be angryTaking a look at it begins to open things up insideBut again your looking has to come from the larger perspective that helps you see through the anger helps you disidentify with the angerThe anger may still be there in the mind but you dont have to identify with itYou can see it as a separate mental eventThats important because you then realize that there are parts of the mind that really arent angry that arent involved in the anger at allThe anger seemed to consume the mind but thats just because it narrowed your perception of the minds full rangeSo as you open things up like this you can help weaken the anger weaken the hold of the anger on your mindWhen you develop a larger perspective you can step back and see what really should be doneWhats the most skillful thing to say hereWhat are my opportunitiesWhat are the choices available to me If you have a broader viewpoint then its easier to see the choices than you could have when the blinders were onThen you can see what really would be appropriateYou can see If you were to say what you feel so much like saying what would the results really beAs the Buddha points out many of the things we want to do under the force of anger are precisely the things our enemies would like to see us do destroying our good looks destroying our property destroying our friendships doing things that will get us punishedDo you want to please your enemy that wayIf you look dispassionately at the actions you wanted to do and can see that the results wouldnt be good remind yourself I dont want thatMaybe this is not the best time or place to say anything at allMaybe I should wait for circumstances to change Because youve breathed through the physical side of the anger you find it a lot easier to delay your actions to a more appropriate time because you dont feel the compulsion of bottledup frustrationOr if it so happens that something should be done right away the fact that youve broadened your perspective helps you to see better alternatives better things to do better things to say right awaySo remember this as an appropriate antidote to the normal way of reacting to angerToo often when were angry about what someone has done were either angry at the person or we turn around and get angry at ourselves for the anger neither of which really is very helpfulInstead we should step back to see the actions of that other person in context After all this is the way the world is That helps you to react in a more skillful wayWhen we talk about the limitations of the world it sometimes seems very confining and depressing but its notActually to think about these things is a very liberating teachingTheres no way youre going to make the world perfect so you dont have to make the world perfectThat takes a huge burden off the mind right thereYou simply think of what should be done right now in this particular set of circumstances given the larger perspective looking at the world as a whole looking at human nature looking at the whole human enterpriseYou view your interaction with other people within the context of a much larger perspectiveThese are the ways of the worldOf course its going to be imperfectWhat did you expect given the fact that the world is imperfectGiven the reality of the situation what are you going to do right now to respond in the most skillful wayThis way you find that of the lessons from the meditation this quest for skillfulness is precisely the lesson that translates best into daily life as you deal with lust anger fear  as you deal with all of the imperfect situations in the worldYou see that theyre imperfect and yet you try to find a skillful responseThis quest for skillfulness requires that you use your imaginationThats what the larger perspective is forIt opens up more possibilities to your imagination so that your old habits dont form ruts that you can never get out ofYou think of new ways of responding unexpected ways of respondingThis is where insight really opens up new possibilities in your life where it shows its true worthThe ability to see the movements of the mind minutely is an important insight only if it makes you more skillful in the way you act and speak and thinkSo keep that perspective in mindKeep that quest for skillfulness in mind as well so that your actions really do fall into the path that leads to the end of suffering and dont keep falling into the path that leads to more and more compounded suffering again and again and againThis is where the meditation shows its true value in our lives even if we dont get all the way to the ultimate skill of reaching the DeathlessThe fact that weve trained ourselves to be more and more skillful leads the mind in the direction of less and less sufferingIt inclines the mind in that directionIf you dont make it all the way to the Deathless in this lifetime your quest for skillfulness insures that your next lifetime will keep heading in that directionYou build up a momentumSo do your best to head your mind in that direction because otherwise this samsara this wandering around that we keep doing is pretty aimlessThe image the Buddha gives is of throwing a stick up in the airSometimes it falls on this end sometimes it falls on the other end sometimes it falls flat on its side all pretty random aimlessTry to turn your life from a stick thrown up into the air into an arrow flying straight in a particular direction toward more and more skillfulnessUltimately someday whether in this lifetime or the next that arrow will reach its target  but only if you focus on this issue of skillfulness right here and right nowAnd keep it right here right now every right here and right nowThats what builds up the momentumThats what gives direction and meaning to lifeEvery now and then you read a piece taking the Buddha to task on the first of the three characteristicsThe thrust of the piece usually is Whats wrong with changeChange is a good thingIf it werent for change we wouldnt have happinessThere would be no art in the world no music no literatureAll the things that make life enjoyable they say come from changeSo whats wrong with itYou have to look at change in contextThats what VenRatthapalas four Dhamma summaries  the comments he made to the King Koravya to explain why he ordained  are all aboutThey tie into both the teachings on inconstancy stress and notself and into the simple facts of aging illness and deathThe first of the summaries has to do with inconstancy The world is swept away it does not endure This on its own may not be a bad thingCertain things getting swept away would not be bad for the worldBut then VenRatthapala illustrates his point with agingWhen King Koravya was young he was so strong he felt that he had the strength of two peopleBut now hes years old and as he says I think Ill put my foot one place and I end up putting it someplace else We dont even have that much control when aging comesChange can be nice when its well handled but when you think of all the beautiful music in the world think of all the lousy music tooPeople actually make an effort to write lousy musicNot that they intend it to be lousy but its very difficult to write good music create good art write great literatureIf change were a good thing in and of itself good literature would be easy to write good paintings easy to paintBut these things are hardIt takes an awful lot of skill to make change happyAnd even with people who are very skilled at it What happens to them over timeThey grow olderAs they grow older all kinds of indignities come to themThe body cant function and when the body cant function they cant entertain people as they used toThey get less control over themselves their bowel movements their memory their minds less and less control over their relationshipsIts a pretty sad state of affairsThink of the misery suffered by Beethoven Brahms and Mozart as they approached deathThat kind of change is inevitableIts built into the way things areIf you think about it you realize that the change we try to create through art literature music goes against the way things areWorks of art and literature have a nice beginning they build up a little tension but then its nicely released at the endTheres a sense of completion a sense of coming to a satisfying goalBut life isnt like thatAt the end of life everything gets disjointed and simply falls to piecesThat moves into the next Dhamma summary The world offers no shelter theres no one in charge Ratthapala illustrates this with the fact of illnessHe asks the king Do you have a recurring illness And the king answers Yes I have a wind illness  which in those days meant sharp shooting pains going through the body  and he adds that when he has an attack all his courtiers and relatives hang around saying Maybe hell die now maybe hell die now They might be saying this out of fear or out of hope Some of them might want him out of the way so that they can grab powerSo Ratthapala asks the king Can you ask those friends courtiers and relatives who are hanging around to please share out some of your pain The king replies No of course not Not even a king can ask other people to share out the pain that comes with illnessThis illustrates the second of the three characteristics the stress and suffering that come along with change  in other words the natural change of the bodyWhen youre in pain you have to suffer it on your ownThen the third characteristic of notself The world has nothing of its own one has to pass on leaving everything behind The king has lots of wealth all stored up and of course he has a strong sense that its his own wealthBut when he dies he wont be able to take it with himHes got to leave it behindThats the ultimate notself teachingEven your body your feelings your perceptions your thought constructs your consciousness You cant take those with you eitherThese first three Dhamma summaries provide an interesting point to reflect on  that the Buddhas teaching on the three characteristics may have come from the simple facts of aging illness and deathAging  inconstancy illness  stress and suffering and death  notselfThe fourth Dhamma summary shows why those three characteristics are so threatening The world is insufficient insatiable a slave to craving Theres never enoughNo matter what you create in this world theres never a sense of true completionEven the sense of the completion that comes at the end of a piece of nice music the end of a good novel a good book is falseAside from Awakening theres never a point where all your problems in life are settled where theres nothing more to doTheres always a lot more to doAs long as theres craving theres still an underlying sense of disease and discontent in lifeYou keep looking for other works of art other music to create that sense of completion but they just cant provide itRatthapala illustrates this fourth summary by asking the king Even though you already reign over a very prosperous country here suppose someone were to come to you and say Theres a country to the east with lots of wealth but in terms of its military strength its weak enough that you could conquer it given the forces you have Would you conquer it The king says Of course Suppose someone were to come from the west with the same news Well Id conquer the kingdom to the west the north the south Id conquer the kingdoms to the north and south Its unendingWhat if someone were to come and say Theres a country on the other side of the ocean Well the king would send his forces there tooIts not the case you satisfy desire and craving by giving in to your desires and cravingsYou simply make them hungrier for moreIt becomes more and more habitual that once theres a craving once theres a desire youve got to satisfy itAnd when you think of how things are inconstant stressful and notself and how you yourself are subject to aging illness and death theres no end to it allTheres never a point of satisfactionEven death doesnt put an end to thingsThe Buddha says that we travel on through the cravingJust as wind can carry a flame from a burning house to another house and set the second house on fire he says craving carries us over from one lifetime to the nextWhats interesting is that the Buddha says all this inconstancy stress and notself is rooted in desireAnd yet because of the desire were never satisfiedIts through our lack of satisfaction that we want this and want that and yet the things that we create in order to fill up that lack never really give satisfactionSo we desire moreWe create moreThe process keeps feeding on itself but it can never make itself fullAll that work and yet it cant bring us to a point of completionThats the ordinary way of the worldNo matter how good change gets no matter how skilled you are at riding the waves of change its never enoughThats why the Buddha advises us to look elsewhere for true happinessAnd what he does is to tell us to take that craving and try to manage it wiselyIn other words that thirst of craving basically wants as much happiness as possible as quickly as possible and with as little effort as possibleBut to develop discernment he says you take that desire for happiness and adjust it a bit What could we do to give rise to true happiness longlasting happiness a happiness that wouldnt change In this way you take your desire you take the possibility of change and you turn it into a path that leads beyond that finally does lead to a point of completion a point of total satisfaction what many of the Thai ajaans call The Land of EnoughThats what were doing as were practicing hereWere trying to take that craving and turn it into something wise use it wisely  this desire that the Buddha said lies at the root of all things the root of all dhammasDhammas here means any phenomena of any kind but it can also mean what we think of Dhamma with a capital D  the Dhamma that leads us out the Dhamma of practiceThere has to be a desire underlying the practiceIf youre going to walk across the room youve got to have the desire to get to the other sideThe question is how to use that desire in a skillful wayWalking across the room is not a big issue but the issue of desire in the practice is a lot more subtle a lot more intricateWe want the desire that impels us along the path but we dont want it to be so overwhelming that it gets in the wayWe need desire to be focused on this one issue What can we do that gives rise to longlasting happiness and ultimately a happiness that doesnt give rise to change at allThats what were working on hereWherever we may be in the practice right now thats the general direction were headingThats the question that underlies everything we doBut to make sure that the desire doesnt overwhelm us we have to refocus it on the practice on the individual steps that will take us where we want to goSo look at the particulars of what youre doing in terms of your thoughts words and deeds not only while youre sitting here meditating but also in the whole course of the dayWhat habits do you have that get in the way of longlasting happiness  your habits in terms of dealing with yourself dealing with other people how you manage the day where you devote your time the intensity in which you focus on what youre doingAll of this is part of the practiceThese are things you can look atAnd this is importantAll the things the Buddha teaches are things we can actually look atHe wasnt a mystifierHe didnt make anything into a big mysteryHe said that everything you need to know is right in front of your eyesThe problem is that youre looking past itSo look very carefully at your intentions right hereI was reading today a blurb for a book on Buddhist ethics in which the author was proposing that the precepts are too simpleminded because our actions have so many ramifications that morality should be seen as a big world of mysteryWhat the author is doing is to take the mystery and confusion the Buddha removed from our lives and put it back inWhat does mystery do aside from providing a convenient hiding place for the defilementsSo do your best to clear away the mystery by looking right at what youre doingIf you look very carefully at your intentions you can see whether theyre skillful by the mental qualities that underlie themThen you stay right there and act on that insightIs there anger motivating your thoughts words and deedsIs there greedDelusionIf there are these things dont act on themKeep your focus right hereThis way the process of change in your life becomes something you can manage more and more skillfullyDont lose sight of whats right here because everything you need to know to attain true Awakening to discover that happiness beyond change is right here in your body and mindThe process of sitting right here with the mind on the breath thinking about and evaluating the breath perceiving and feeling the results All the factors youre going to need to know are right here and yet you tend to look past themSo try to keep your focus right hereThe irony of it all is that the more right here you are in your focus the longerterm the happiness that comes from your actionsAs you get more and more skillful at this one point it has ramifications that go out in all directionsThe process of change is something thats happening right hereLearn to master it right hereInstead of becoming the change that leads to more and more stress and suffering to more separations to a greater sense of dissatisfaction you turn it aroundYou take that craving and you tame it by focusing it right hereThe more right here you are the longer the good results will lastYou give up the guesswork and speculation you focus on things you can really know right here right nowThats why the Buddhas teachings are for everybodyThink about itMost of the great ajaans in Thailand came from peasant familiesThat was back in the days when the Thai government was very proud of what it was doing to BuddhismIt was straightening out Buddhism it was restructuring everything starting from the top down for the sake of the nationstateBut that didnt have nearly the effect the longterm beneficial effect that the actions of a few peasants sons had out there in the boondocks out there in the woods focusing on things they could know for themselves right there in their own thoughts words and deedsThose were the ones who had the biggest impact the most longterm and deepest impact on keeping the Dhamma alive not only in Thailand but around the worldSo given the way the whole process of change and causality operates in this world the more careful you are about what you do and say and think in the immediate present the better the longterm results are going to beInstead of trying to satisfy your desires for happiness within the world of change you take that world of change and use it to attain the changelessLook directly right here right now at every movement of craving so that you can take it apart Why is there craving for this thing that changesWhat can be done to channel it properlyWhat can be done to put it to an end Thats what the teaching on the three characteristics is aboutThats why the Buddha keeps reminding us about aging illness and death  because otherwise we tend to get contented with this that and the other thing This seems to be okay that seems to be okay this is good enough in the practice But that fourth summary reminds you that its never enough until you get to the DeathlessOnly then will there be a true sense of enoughThats where the craving finally disbandsSo this is why we keep chanting these passages again and again about aging illness death and separation The world is swept awayIt does not endureIt offers no shelterTheres no one in chargeIt has nothing of its ownOne has to pass on leaving everything behindThe world is insufficient insatiable a slave to craving It all sounds pretty negative but it has a positive import to remind us not to settle for less than the bestInstead of being depressing these teachings are liberatingThey remind us not to look in the wrong place not to weigh ourselves down with expectations that can never lead to true happiness at allInstead they remind us to look in the right place where ultimately all worlds disband and the happiness of the Deathless can be foundSo even though the teachings may sound negative they have a very positive aimTry to get comfortableSit with your back comfortably straightIf youre bending over its going to put a lot of pressure on your backAnd be comfortable with your breathFind the breath sensations in the body that feel comfortable and stick with themAllow them to stay there undisturbedAs that sense of comfort begins to grow be careful not to get sucked into it too muchTry to maintain your mindfulness and your alertness so that the mind doesnt start drifting offThats one of our problems We get a little bit of pleasure a little bit of comfort and we let go wallowing in the pleasure forgetting where we are forgetting what were doingAs a result the pleasure goes away because the causes for keeping it there get droppedThe mindfulness the alertness the ardency of your effort to stick with it weakenAnd when they weaken so does the pleasureSo try to stay alertAs soon as theres a sense of pleasure try to be aware of the whole body letting the pleasure seep through the body and keep that awareness goingYoull find that its not as easy as it sounds because the mind has a habitual tendency to shrinkKeep reminding yourself Whole body breathing in whole body breathing out And the amount of mindfulness and alertness that are required to keep that whole body awareness going will keep you awake keep you alert as long as you maintain themThis is one very immediate very visceral way of showing goodwill to yourself providing yourself with a sense of pleasure and easeWhen you think about it just about everything we do is based on the pleasure principle trying to maximize pleasure and minimize sufferingWe come to the meditation because weve found that other ways other strategies for pursuing the pleasure principle havent worked or are not working to our satisfactionThis is why the Buddha points his teachings at the issue of suffering and the end of sufferingThese are the big issues in our lives and theres a lot of bewilderment surrounding themAs the Buddha said our reaction to suffering is one bewilderment and two a search for someone to show us a way outThis is why the Buddha put so much emphasis on who you hang around with who you associate with who you look to for your advice because they can set you on the right path to the end of suffering or they can set you on wrong paths winding in all kinds of directionsThis is why you have to be very carefulWed like to think that all paths lead up to the top of the same mountain but I dont know any mountain in the world where that principle worksThe path to the top of Palomar doesnt lead to the top of EverestAnd there are a lot of paths on each mountain slope that lead away from the top of the mountainSome lead you over a cliffSo we have to be very careful about which path we chooseThe same is true with the old idea that all rivers lead to the oceanThey dont all lead to the oceanThink of the rivers that end up in Great BasinThey just dry upThe water will evaporate and form clouds and maybe someday fall down in the catchment basin of another river that will flow to the ocean but that can take a lot of timeSo you have to be careful about who you hang around with and what kind of strategies you employ for a lasting happinessThe Buddha said that this is the beginning of wisdomWhen you find wise people you ask them What can I do that will lead to my longterm welfare and happiness Then you reflect on their answersYou compare them to the strategies youve been pursuing and you see whats worth giving a tryMost of our strategies work to some extentIf they didnt work at all we would have discarded them long agoBut the Buddha saw that a lot of our strategies dont work as well as they couldFor example theres a habitual strategy to avoid even thinking about sufferingYou do anything you can to put the thought of suffering out of your mind  the idea being that if you avoid thinking about it pay it no attention ignore it itll go awayAnd there may be a few cases in life where that works  where focusing on your pains makes them worse  yet there are so many cases where it works only for a while and then it breaks downBut because were used to this approach used to this strategy we feel a lot of resistance to even listening to the Buddhas first noble truthThis is why theres so much misunderstanding about the first noble truth as wellPeople think that the Buddha says that life is sufferingThen they think Thats not trueI dont believe thatTheres plenty of joy in life Actually theres no place where the Buddha said that life is sufferingIts amazing how many people  even scholars and Dhamma teachers  believe that but thats not what he saidHe simply said that there is suffering in lifeYou cant argue with him thereAnd he points out all the obvious sufferings we live withBirth is suffering all the pain that goes into being born and giving birthAging illness and death These are all sufferingBeing separated from what you like having to live with what you dont likeThen he summarizes his definition of suffering with the five clinging aggregatesThis is where he starts getting technical and where he starts attacking another one of our common strategies which is our sense of selfThis is another one of the Buddhas great insights  that our sense of self is an activity a strategy for avoiding suffering for maximizing happinessWe latch onto certain things and say This is meThis is what I have to watch out forAs long as I watch out for this maximizing the happiness and wellbeing of this thing thatll provide the happiness I want This way of thinking is an activity a strategyIt works to some extent but then there are areas where it breaks down because the things we latch onto are all impermanentNo matter how much time we try to dress them up fix them up keep them going they ultimately break downForm feeling perception thought constructs even sensory consciousness They all break downBut were strongly addicted to this approach to hanging onto them as ends in themselvesWhich is why again we spend so much time misinterpreting what the Buddha saidThe Buddha says there is no self we think but he cant be right Were not looking at what hes actually sayingHes saying your sense of self is a strategy  an attempt to maximize happiness and minimize sufferingTo some extent it works and he actually has you use your sense of self as part of the practice teaching you to be selfreliant to look after your true selfinterest  in other words your longterm welfare and happinessHis teachings on generosity virtue and the development of goodwill  all the things that come under the category of merit  are skillful ways of employing your strategy of selfBasically he has you take your sense of self your sense of a continuing identity not only in this lifetime but also even into other lifetimes and shows how to work with it intelligently so that youre not causing harm to yourself youre not causing harm to other peopleYoure creating the conditions for a relatively reliable happiness in this world and on into the nextHe also uses the development of goodwill  immeasurable goodwill compassion appreciation and equanimity  to clean up one of the major problems we have in this sense of self our sense of responsibility knowing that in the past weve done things that are not all that good and that the results will come back to haunt usHe has us develop these sublime attitudes these immeasurable states of mind as means to allay our fear of the consequences of those unskillful actionsAs he says dont let yourself get tied up in remorseFocus on the present moment resolving not to make the same mistakes you made in the past and at the same time develop an attitude of limitless goodwill because within a mind like that the impact of past bad actions gets weaker and weakerThe more limitless your goodwill compassion appreciation and equanimity the weaker the impact of past bad actionsSo in all these cases  giving virtue the development of goodwill  he takes your sense of self and tries to get you to use it intelligentlyThats a strategy for maximizing happinessUltimately though self as a strategy can only go so farThis is where the notself strategy comes inLook at the various things you hold onto this activity of creating a me or a mine Exactly what are you creating it out ofLook at the raw materials and youll see that they cant possibly be youThey cant possibly provide true happiness in the ultimate sense because theyre so unstable and inconstantTheyre all stressful because theyre all fabricatedTheyre made theyre intentionalAnd intentions are inconstantWhen the cause is inconstant how can the result be constantThis analysis though goes against the grainBut hopefully by the time we come to it weve been practicing the Buddhas teachings  especially the ones on generosity virtue and goodwill  and our confidence in the Buddhas teachings has grownOur standards for what counts as true happiness have become more refinedParticularly as we develop our powers of concentration and get used to a more and more refined sense of ease a more expansive sense of ease we grow more discriminating in our taste in our appreciation for what true happiness can beAnd there comes a point where were willing to uncloud our minds and say Well maybe the Buddha is rightMaybe if we let go of these things we wont be burdened by them This is what the notself strategy is all about learning how to let go of all the makeshift things we cling to in order to find the greater happiness that comes from letting goSo he takes us step by step starting with our normal desire for true happinessHe says to focus on happiness focus on what needs to be done for happiness but also be aware of the limitations of how youve been looking for happinessAs you get more sensitive to those limitations you can uncloud your mind to want something more refinedThats where he offers you more refined techniques more refined strategiesSo in that sense its a seamless practice but when were immersed in the practice it doesnt seem seamless at allOur minds go back and forthWe seem to advance for a while and then retreat advance and retreat go left go right and all over the place because some of the Buddhas strategies go so strongly against our old habitsThe mind tends to rebelSo we have to learn how to be patient with itAs with anyone overcoming addiction there are going to be ups and downsBut if youre patient enough sensitive enough and rely on your powers of perseverance they see you throughYou become more mature in understanding your desire for happinessAfter all we really do want true happinessIts not an artificially induced desireIts something that already underlies all our actionWhat were doing is putting the mind in a position where it has a better and better chance of gaining that kind of maturityIts finally willing to give the Buddhas approaches a try to replace our old strategies  which have had some success but not total success but to which were so attached  with new strategies that promise something moreAlthough those new strategies may initially seem counterintuitive they make more and more sense as you get to know themAnd they really do give resultsThe promised resultsA happiness thats unconditioned  because thats the only kind of happiness that can lastConditions  where do conditions come fromUltimately they come from our intentionsAnd what are our intentions likeWell youve seen your intentions  they go up and down backwards and forwardsEven when you try to make them constant in concentration you find that even the most refined states of concentration have their ups and downsIn this way the Buddha has you corneredYou let go of the grosser forms of happiness the grosser strategies for happiness and get used to more and more refined onesAnd they finally take you to the point where theres no course left but to let go of strategiesAll strategiesIts like painting yourself into a cornerThe only way to get out of the corner is not to be anywhereWhen you can manage that you see that what the Buddha taught was rightHe really knew what he was talking aboutThis is the way to true happinessThe Buddhas last words were to become consummate through heedfulnessBeing consummate of course means developing the path to its fullness so that it can take you all the way to releaseAnd the way to do that he said is through being heedfulThe Pali word is appamadenaIts interesting that word heedful Its not one we use very much in ordinary everyday languageAnd all the other words that could be used for translating appamadena  by being vigilant by being noncomplacent These arent words we use in everyday language eitherTheyre perfectly good words  we know their meaning  but in terms of our active vocabulary they tend to disappearWed much rather hear the word trust being trustful Wed like to be able to trust in certain things trust that our innate nature is wise our innate nature is to be awakened and that we can trust in our nature to take care of these things for usBut thats not what the Buddha taughtHe didnt say anything about innate nature at allThe only thing he assumed about people is that they want happiness but are ignorant in how to go about itThis is why he said that you have to be really careful you have to be watchful you cant be complacentThere are dangers to your happiness out thereAnd there are dangers in here as wellIn fact the dangers out there come from the dangers in hereIf youre not careful the dangers in here are going to take over and drown youSo you have to be heedful you have to be watchfulThe Buddha once said that all skillful mental qualities are rooted in heedfulness and have heedfulness as their leaderIts because were heedful of the dangers that we arouse the energy needed to develop skill in the mindWe see that were suffering that were surrounded by suffering and a lot of suffering lies ahead of us if were not carefulIts through being careful through being heedful through not being complacent that we can do something about itThats the important message here We can do something about this sufferingAging illness and death are lying in wait and theyre not pretty thingsSometimes you hear people saying that we shouldnt badmouth aging illness and death that theres a beautiful side to them as well like a lovely flower thats wiltingIt has its own kind of beautyBut being a person isnt like looking at a flowerIts a miserable experience being an aging person being an ill person being a dying personLook at all the indignities all the suffering all the pain and anguish that serve no purpose at allThey just load you downIt doesnt seem to serve any purpose that we have to die with a lot of pain or have our bodily functions leave us one by one by one so that were totally dependent on other peopleIt serves no purpose but thats the way things areSome people might say that trying to get out of this suffering is being aversive to life but its being realisticAnd its being true to our heartsWe dont want to go through all that needless sufferingAnd the Buddha says theres a way outWhen theres a way out that means that trying to find the way out is not being aversive its being intelligentAs with any danger in life if you see a way out of the danger you take the way to safetyHere though the safety is something we have to find in our own minds in the midst of the qualities that we cant trust within ourselves our laziness our complacency our willingness to put up with secondbest our desire to turn the responsibility over to somebody else  either a great teacher some divine being  or just hope that the way of the world will take care of usBut look at the way the world isI went to Alaska years back  one of the last real wildernesses remaining in this country  and was impressed by how implacable it wasThe wilderness would not give one damn if I diedIf I died nicely or if I died a miserable death it wouldnt careBeing surrounded by all that indifference was a sobering experienceThats the way of natureAnimals dieBefore they die sometimes they go through a lot of pain and anguish and terror all alone with no one to sympathize no one to comfort them no one to helpNature doesnt care about any of us at allSo its up to us to make the difference to make sure that were not going to suffer from those things and that means we have to be very watchful very heedful because as I said the danger comes from withinWe have this tendency to get sloppyWere meditating and things get good for a while and so we get carelessInattentiveComplacentThese are precisely the qualities that are going to do us inWhen things go well we have to keep reminding ourselves that they could get worse but they can also get betterHow do they get betterWell for one thing when you get a good state in concentration you try to maintain itDo what you can to keep it goingThis requires skill knowing how to hold onto it not so tightly that you squeeze it to death and not so loosely that you lose itLike holding a hummingbird in your hand If you hold it too tightly itll die if you hold it too loosely itll fly awayYou have to watch and see precisely how much pressure is just rightIts interesting The Buddha never defines the term heedfulness or appamada in the CanonBut he does give instructions on how to be heedful how to develop heedfulnessRealizing that the problem comes from within he says that the first place youve got to look is in your intentionsBefore you sit down to meditate  before you do anything at all  he says look at the quality of the intentionIs it going to be skillful or notIf its not a skillful intention dont act on itIf it is skillful be clear about itAs when youre meditating Sit down and remember that you have a purpose for being hereRemind yourself of that purpose every time you meditateThis is why we have the chanting in the evening before we meditate as a groupWhen youre meditating on your own take the time to remind yourself Why am I meditatingThere are a lot of dangers here in the mindYouve got to learn how to sidestep them how to cut through themSo be clear about what youre doingDont just go through the motions because youve scheduled x number of periods to sit during the day and youre just putting in timeBe carefulBe diligentBe scrupulous in what youre doingAnd scrupulous in checking for the results  thats the other side of heedfulnessWhen you do something that you think is going to work out well look at the results while youre doing it and after its doneBe honest about the resultsWhat kind of results are you actually getting from the practiceWhat could you change to get better resultsThis principle applies all the way from initially getting used to the principle of karma getting used to the principle of being a responsible person on the external level and going all the way through into the very refined states of concentrationEven when the Buddha talks about emptiness what he says follows the same pattern Be clear about what youre doingOnce you can maintain a good state of concentration the next step is to look at whats going onIn what way is this concentration empty of prior disturbancesIn what way is there still disturbance in itAnd whereIf you look carefully enough you find that the disturbance is related to something youre doing the way youre creating that state of oneness in the mindThe oneness itself is a disturbance its an intention based on a particular perceptionSo what do you doIf you let go of the oneness if you go back to having your mind scattered all over the place thats not skillfulThe skillful thing is to go forward to more subtle states of oneness based on more subtle perceptionsIn other words when you see that the way youre focused on your object is causing stress learn to focus in a way thats less stressful that causes less disturbance to the mindYou can pursue this principle all the way through the various levels of concentration even to the objectless concentration of awareness where youve let go of the oneness where theres no specific perception at all  its almost as if youre not intentionally meditating  but the mind is centeredIts simply that it doesnt have a particular theme or object for its center not even a formless oneAnd even there the Buddha says to watch it carefullyIf you look at it really carefully  and this takes very subtle very intent powers of observation  you begin to see even there theres an element of fabricationIntentionIts willedSo you learn how to drop that realizing that it wasnt the underlying principle of the nature of  the underlying awareness of  reality that you thought it wasTo see this requires that you be wary about whats going onThats another translation of appamada warinessNot so wary that youre not willing to get into the concentration and work at developing itWariness here means that once youve done the work to get into concentration you dont get complacent about itYou dont allow yourself to be deceived about it to think that its more than what it isThis is your protection in the practice to make sure that you dont overestimate what youve got you dont settle for secondbest you dont leave yourself open to the dangers out there and in hereSo what heedfulness comes down to is being very clear and very scrupulous about your intentions about what youre doing and the results that youre gettingIf you see that the results are not up to par ask yourself What can you do to change what youre doingBe honest about itThis principle of honesty is what underlies the whole principle of being heedful and noncomplacentThe Buddha once said this was his one prerequisite for someone he would take on as a student Bring me someone whos honest he said and no deceiver and Ill teach that person the DhammaSo we have to learn to make ourselves trustworthy people because no matter what promises you get from outside the test is insideThis is another function of being heedful learning to test things test yourself test particular practices as theyre recommended to youWhen insights arise in your meditation you cant be complacent believing that everything that arises in a still expansive mind has to be trueYouve got to test all your insightsNo matter how impressive the insight the vision whatever Only when things pass the test can you have a really secure sense of what you can trust and what you cantWed like to think that all the teachings out there are simply different ways of getting up to the top of the same mountainYou can choose whichever you like because all of them are guaranteed to workBut theyre notJust as all rivers dont flow into the oceanSome of them  the Severn the Humboldt  flow into the Great Basin and just disappearSo how are we going to know what worksWe have to test thingsWe have to put ourselves to the test and keep reminding ourselves that no matter how good things get in the meditation we have to be wary we have to watch out because the ability of the mind to deceive itself is so pervasive so prevalentThe only way we can get beyond that selfdeception is by being very scrupulous very careful very clear about what were doingIts a quality the Buddha called by different names ardency alertness intentnessBut it all comes down to being heedfulThis is what sees us throughThis is why the Buddha made heedfulness his last message because this quality will get all the good results we wantHe could have ended his teaching career with some nice platitudes about emptiness or nirvana or the DeathlessBut there was no need for thatHe said that if you work on this quality of noncomplacency thats whats going to get you there and then you can know nirvana and the Deathless for yourselfSo heedfulness is the heart of the practice the heart of the teachingAnd its aimed at giving our heart what it really wantsThe heart doesnt want to be lifeaffirming it wants to be happinessaffirming  affirming that there is a true happiness that there is a Deathless happiness something we can really trustThats what we really wantSo this quality of selfhonesty  willing to test test test things over again because youre not complacent because youre wary and heedful and vigilant  is whats going to see you throughIts whats going to deliver releaseWere here for the sake of true happinessThats why the Buddha left his palace and went out into the wildernessHe wasnt satisfied with the happiness that comes in normal everyday lifeHe wanted a happiness that was dependable a happiness really worth all the effort that would go into itAll kinds of happiness require effort in one way or anotherThe question is Is the effort worth it In terms of fabricated things conditioned things many times the answer is NoIn fact if you make any conditioned thing an end in and of itself the effort isnt worth it for ultimately it will leave you high and dryYet the Buddha realized that conditioned things have another side as wellNot only are they conditioned theyre also conditioningIn other words as conditioned things theyre dependent on other causes they arise and fall in line with those causes arising and falling away  sometimes immediately sometimes over timeBut then they themselves give rise to other thingsThe Buddhas major discovery was that even though certain things are conditioned  in other words the elements of the path are conditioned  they can lead to an opening to the UnconditionedAnd this is what makes the path worthwhile what gives hope to our livesIn Thai theres a term for the state of mind where all you can see is the bad side of conditioned things Everything passes away passes away passes away and everything starts seeming hopeless pointlessIts called narrow equanimity small minded equanimityIn other words you get disenchanted with everything but the disenchantment doesnt lead to the opening to the DeathlessYou stay stuck there on the disenchanted sideIf you stay stuck there its easy to get hopeless apathetic depressedBut the Buddha pointed out another side to conditioned things tooA potential for true happiness lies here in the practiceWere fabricating conditioned thingsRight View Right Resolve all the way down to Right Concentration These are all conditioned thingsTheyre the highest of all conditioned thingsBut even though theyre the highest you dont stop thereTheyre a pathThey open up to something even biggerSo make sure that you look at life from both sidesIn other words youre focused on the drawbacks of taking conditioned things as your goal so that you dont get complacentSometimes its easy You get a nice calm state in meditation life around you seems pretty effortless and its very tempting  and this happens to many many meditators  to say that this is fine enough right hereIts in cases like that that the Buddha points out all the drawbacks of conditioned things all the drawbacks of conditioned happinessNot only is a lot of effort wasted in creating that happiness but sometimes in order to maintain it you also start doing things that go against the precepts that go against the principles of morality concentration and discernment so that your conditioned happiness causes suffering not only in passing away but also in leading to all kinds of bad things down the roadSo you have to watch outYou cant be complacentOn the other side the Buddha emphasizes the fact that heedfulness really does pay offIf everything were negative then no matter how heedful or careful you might be then thered be no chance for any true happinessBut skillful action does pay offThats why heedfulness is so importantIf youre careful if youre circumspect itll make a big differenceSo we have to ask ourselves What kind of happiness are we going to pursue in our livesAnd we have to be singleminded in the practice because its so easy to stray off in other directionsSome of the side roads are blatantly bad and others are relatively goodWith the good ones its easy to talk yourself into saying Well this is a good thing to doTheres nothing wrong with doing this In a general sense yes that may be rightBut if its second best if its not all the way to the Unconditioned you cant let yourself stop thereYou cant turn off the road thereYouve got to be careful to stay on courseThe problem is that we come to the practice with many mindsWe dont have any singleminded determinationAjaan Mun in his last Dhamma talk referred to singlemindedness as being the essential element in the practice the singleminded determination not to come back and let the defilements step all over you as before  the determination not to come back to sufferingBut that determination is something that we have to develop over timeWe dont come into the practice this wayWe start out with two or three minds about the whole thingThis is what training the mind is all about getting the mind to gather around that singleminded purpose that singleminded intentionThis kind of training starts with the preceptsThey show us exactly where our minds are manymindedWhen you observe the precepts you have to focus on your intentions all the timeAs you get to know your intentions you begin to realize that the mind is like a committeeSometimes its not just a committee  its a whole crowdEven concentration is not the kind of singlemindedness were talking about but its a basic prerequisiteIts part of the training that takes you thereWe take one intention and run with it as far as we can in the face of the inevitable contrary intentions that counteract itIn the beginning the intention to stay with the breath to stay with the meditation is bound to be weak and its easy to get knocked off courseBut as you begin to feel at home here at ease here you grow more resistant to getting knocked off because you dont want to leave what youve gotThis feels like the right place to beThen you can start taking on the more deeprooted intentions that come your wayYou take them apart to understand Why do they seem to have such force You overcome distraction you overcome the defilements of the mind not by pushing them away and pretending theyre not there but by understanding them  and understanding means the ability to watch them from a good solid standpointThats what concentration is forAs things keep coming up you realize This isnt really an intention I want to abide by and thats not either So you cut them away cut them away until you run into the really big defilements the really important onesSometimes theyll knock you off base again which is a sign that your concentration and insight need further developmentThe path of practice is not a smooth straight line on a graphIt has its ups and downsIt has its dramaAs you learn in any writing class one of the basic principles of story construction is that a story has to have setbacks in order to be interesting in order to be realisticIn the same way the story of your practice of the Dhamma is bound to have setbacks  the difference being that youre not reading it youre living it and many times youd rather not experience the interesting setbacksBut keep reminding yourself of why youre hereYoure here for true happiness genuine happiness a happiness thats not going to let you down a happiness thats going to be worth all the ups and downs that go into finding itWhen you look at all the other happinesses you gain from getting off the path you see that they all let you down in one way or anotherThis realization helps pull you back on the path so that ultimately you can start cutting through the big distractions the big defilementsBut whether the defilements are big or small they require a similar practice a similar technique You see where theres stress you see what youre doing to cause that stress and you see that you dont have to do that  you can stop you can let it goThis is the basic patternIts simply that with stronger powers of concentration stronger mindfulness stronger alertness you can cut through things that you couldnt cut through beforeOver time that singleminded determination not to let yourself suffer gets stronger and stronger plays a larger and larger role in the committee discussions until finally its the voice the unanimous voice in the mindAll the other voices have been eliminatedEither that or theyve been convertedBut even when there are still a few traitorous voices lurking in the background remember that the important voice is this one the one resolved not to stop short of genuine happinessTry to strengthen that voice as much as you can because thats the voice that saw the Buddha throughLook at all the setbacks he encountered in his practice finding teachers and then realizing that they couldnt take him all the way going as far as austerities could take him and then realizing that that didnt go all the way eitherAnd then he was stuckHe had tried all the alternatives that had been suggested in his culture and they hadnt workedBut he was determined not to give upThats what saw him through to AwakeningWhatever there is of that determination in you is whats going to give you the strength to pick yourself up dust yourself off and keep on goingSo make sure that that determination stays nurtured for thats whatll see you throughHere are some of the many ways you can access

Pali Text Societys publications catalog should be enough to convince anyone that there is much more to classical Pali literature than the Tipitaka aloneIntermingled with the familiar Nikayas Vinaya texts and Abhidhamma are scores of titles with long scarcelypronounceable Pali namesAlthough many western students of Buddhism may be unacquainted with these works these books have for centuries played a crucial role in the development of Buddhist thought and practice across Asia and ultimately the WestIn fact in some countries they are as deeply treasured as the suttas themselvesBut what are these ancient books and what relevance do they have to the western student of Buddhism in the st centuryAlthough complete answers to these questions lie well beyond the range of my abilities I hope that this short document will provide enough of a road map to help orient the interested student as he or she sets out to explore this vast corpus of important Buddhist literatureThis article is in two partsThe Introduction provides historical background to the texts and offers some thoughts on why these texts are so valuable to the Theravada traditionThe Field Guide is essentially an annotated table of contents in which I borrow heavily from a variety of sources to describe each textThe Tipitaka assumed its final form at the Third Buddhist Council and was first committed to writing sometime in the stcBCEShortly thereafter Buddhist scholarmonks in Sri Lanka and southern India began to amass a body of secondary literature commentaries on the Tipitaka itself historical chronicles textbooks Pali grammars articles by learned scholars of the past and so onMost of these texts were written in Sinhala the language of Sri Lanka but because Pali  not Sinhala  was the lingua franca of Theravada few Buddhist scholars outside Sri Lanka could study themIt wasnt until the thcCE when the Indian monk Buddhaghosa began the laborious task of collating the ancient Sinhala commentaries and translating them into Pali that these books first became accessible to nonSinhala speakers around the Buddhist worldThese commentaries offer meticulously detailed explanations and analyses  phrasebyphrase and wordbyword  of the corresponding passages in the TipitakaAfter Buddhaghosa the catalog of postcanonical Pali literature continued to grow with the addition of commentaries by both Buddhadatta and Dhammapala and subcommentaries by Dhammapala on several of Buddhaghosas AtthakathasDuring this time and in the centuries that followed other writers prepared Pali translations of additional early Sinhala textsThese ranged from poetic hymns in celebration of the Buddha to chronicles tracing the first millennium of Buddhist history to detailed Abhidhamma textbooksMost of the major postcanonical works including the subcommentaries were completed by the thcPostcanonical Pali literature supplements the Tipitaka in several important waysFirst the chronicles and commentaries provide a vital thread of temporal continuity that links us via the persons and historical events of the intervening centuries to the Tipitakas world of ancient IndiaA Tipitaka without this accompanying historical thread would forever be an isolated anachronism to us its message lost in clouds of myth and fable its pages left to gather dust in museum display cases alongside ancient Egyptian mummiesThese texts remind us that the Dhamma is not an artifact but a practice and that we belong to a long line of seekers who have endeavored through patient practice to keep these teachings aliveSecond almost everything we know today about the early years of Buddhism comes to us from these postcanonical booksThough the archaeological evidence from that era is scant and the Tipitaka itself contains only a handful of passages describing events that followed the Buddhas death the commentaries and chronicles contain a wealth of historical information with which we are able to partially reconstruct the early history of BuddhismThe texts illuminate a host of important historical events and trends how the Tipitaka came to be preserved orally when it was first written down and why how the Tipitaka came close to extinction how the Buddhas teachings spread across south Asia how and when the various schools and factions within Buddhism arose and so onBut these are not just idle concerns for the amusement of academiciansAny practitioner of any century stands to benefit from understanding how the early Buddhists lived how they put the Buddhas teachings into practice what challenges they faced we stand to learn from those who have gone beforeAnd there are other lessons to be learned from historyFor example knowing that it was the actions of just a few individuals that averted the extinction of the Tipitaka reminds us that it is ultimately up to individuals like ourselves to safeguard the teachings todayWithout the postcanonical texts important lessons like these  if not the Tipitaka itself  might have been lost forever to the mists of timeThird these texts  particularly the commentaries  help us make sense of the suttas and give us clues about their context that we might otherwise missFor example the famous Satipatthana Sutta is popularly cited today as evidence that all one needs to achieve Awakening is a week or two of unrelenting mindfulness practiceBut the commentary suggests another viewpointIt explains that the Buddhas audience for this particular discourse were already well established in their practice of mindfulness and virtueThey were not coming to meditation practice cold but were in fact unusually well prepared to receive this deep teaching  a point not apparent from the text of the sutta itselfThe commentary thus reminds us that there are some important fundamentals to be developed before one undertakes intensive meditation practiceFinally the commentaries often contain magnificent stories to illustrate and amplify upon points of Dhamma that are made in the suttasFor example Dhp takes on a much richer meaning in light of the commentarys background story  the famous parable of Kisagotami and the mustard seedCommentarial stories like this one offer valuable Dhamma teachings in their own rightOne might reasonably wonder how can a collection of texts written a thousand years after the Buddhas death possibly represent his teachings reliablyHow can we be sure they arent simply derivative works colored by a host of irrelevant cultural accretionsFirst of all although many of these texts were indeed first written in Pali a thousand years after the Buddha most Sinhala versions upon which they were based were written much earlier having themselves been passed down via an ancient and reliable oral traditionBut mustnt those early texts themselves be suspect since they are based only on hearsayPerhaps but by this argument we should reject the entire oral tradition  and hence the entire Tipitaka itself which similarly emerged from an oral tradition long after the Buddhas deathSurely that is taking things too farBut what of the credentials of the commentators themselves can their words be trustedIn addition to living a monastic life immersed in Dhamma the compilers of the commentaries possessed unimpeachable literary credentials intimate acquaintance with the Tipitaka mastery of the Pali and Sinhala languages and expert skill in the art of careful scholarshipWe have no reason to doubt either their abilities or the sincerity of their intentionsAnd what of their firsthand understanding of Dhamma if the commentators were scholars first and foremost would they have had sufficient meditative experience to write with authority on the subject of meditationThis is more problematicPerhaps commentators like Buddhaghosa had enough time both for mastering meditation and for their impressive scholarly pursuits we will never knowBut it is noteworthy that the most significant discrepancies between the Canon and its commentaries concern meditation  in particular the relationship between concentration meditation and insightThe question of the authority of the postcanonical texts thus remains a point of controversy within Theravada BuddhismIt is important to remember that the ultimate function of the postcanonical texts is  like that of the Tipitaka itself  to assist the student in the quest for nibbana the highest goal of Buddhist practiceConcerns about authorship and authority recede when the texts are subjected to the same healthy skeptical attitude and empirical approach that should be familiar to every student of the suttasIf a commentary sheds light on a murky corner of a sutta or helps us understand a subtle point of Vinaya or of Abhidhamma or if the chronicles remind us that we hold the future history of Dhamma in our hands then to that extent they help us clear the path aheadAnd if they can do even that much then  no matter who wrote them and from whence they came  these texts will have demonstrated an authority beyond reproachIn the following guide I have arranged the most popular postcanonical titles thematically and by dateAuthors names are followed by the date of authorshipThe authors of these texts were all monks but for the sake of concision I have dropped the honorific Ven from their namesEach noncommentarial title is followed by a brief descriptionMany of these descriptions were lifted verbatim from other sourcesPage numbers from these sources are given in the bracesMost of these titles have been published in romanized Pali by the Pali Text Society the few for which English translations are available are noted with a dagger followed by the translator date of translation and publisherFor the purposes of this guide the postcanonical texts may be grouped into the following categoriesAbhidhamma In the discourses of the Pali Canon this term simply means higher Dhamma a systematic attempt to define the Buddhas teachings and understand their interrelationshipsA later collection of analytical treatises based on lists of categories drawn from the teachings in the discourses added to the Canon several centuries after the Buddhas lifeApāya Realm of destitutionOne of the four lower realms of existence in which beings suffer because of their bad kamma hell the realm of hungry shades the realm of angry demons and level of common animalsIn the Buddhist cosmology a person reborn in any of these realms may stay there for long or short periods of time but never for an eternityAfter the bad kamma has worked out the person will return to the higher realmsArahant A worthy one or pure one a person whose mind is free of defilement and thus is not destined for further rebirthA title for the Buddha and the highest level of his noble disciplessava Effluent fermentationFour qualities  sensuality views becoming and ignorance  that flow out of the mind and create the flood of the round of death and rebirthBodhisatta A being for Awakening a term used to describe the Buddha before he actually become Buddha from his first aspiration to Buddhahood until the time of his full AwakeningSanskrit form BodhisattvaBrahmā A deva inhabitant of the higher heavenly realms of form or formlessnessBrahman A member of the priestly caste which claimed to be the highest caste in India based on birthIn a specifically Buddhist usage brahman can also mean an Arahant conveying the point that excellence is based not on birth or race but on the qualities attained in the mindDeva Literally shining one An inhabitant of the heavenly realmsDhamma Event a phenomenon in and of itself mental quality doctrine teaching nibbānaSanskrit form DharmaHīnayāna Inferior Vehicle a pejorative term coined by a group who called themselves followers of the Mahāyāna the Great Vehicle to denote the path of practice of those who aimed at Arahantship rather than full BuddhahoodHīnayānists refused to recognize the later discourses composed by the Mahāyānists that claimed to contain teachings that the Buddha felt were too deep for his first generation of disciples and which he thus secretly entrusted to underground serpentsThe Theravāda school of today is a descendent of the HīnayānaIdappaccayatā Thisthat conditionalityThis name for the causal principle the Buddha discovered on the night of his Awakening emphasizes the point that for the purposes of ending suffering and stress the processes of causality can be understood entirely in terms of conditions in the realm of direct experience with no need to refer to forces operating outside of that realmJhāna Mental absorptionA state of strong concentration focused on a single sensation or mental notionKamma Intentional actSanskrit form karmaMaṇḍala Microcosmic diagram used as a power circle and object of contemplation in the rituals of Tantric BuddhismMāra The personification of evil and temptationNibbāna Literally the unbinding of the mind from passion aversion and delusion and from the entire round of death and rebirthAs this term also denotes the extinguishing of a fire it carries connotations of stilling cooling and peaceTotal nibbāna in some contexts denotes the experience of Awakening in others the final passing away of an ArahantSanskrit form nirvāṇaPali The canon of texts preserved by the Theravāda school and by extension the language in which those texts are composedPāṭimokkha The basic code of monastic discipline composed of rules for monks and for nunsSamaṇa ContemplativeLiterally a person who abandons the conventional obligations of social life in order to find a way of life more in tune with the ways of natureSaṃsāra Transmigration wandering through death and rebirthSaṅgha On the conventional level this term denotes the communities of Buddhist monks and nuns on the ideal level it denotes those followers of the Buddha lay or ordained who have attained at least streamentryStūpa Originally a tumulus or burial mound enshrining relics of a holy person  such as the Buddha  or objects associated with his lifeOver the centuries this has developed into the tall spired monuments familiar in temples in Thailand Sri Lanka and Burma and into the pagodas of China Korea and JapanTādin Such an adjective to describe one who has attained the goalIt indicates that the persons state is indefinable but not subject to change or influences of any sortTathāgata Literally one who has become authentic  an epithet used in ancient India for a person who has attained the highest religious goalIn Buddhism it usually denotes the Buddha although occasionally it also denotes any of his Arahant disciplesTheravāda The Teachings of the Elders  the only one of the early schools of Buddhism to have survived into the present currently the dominant form of Buddhism in Thailand Sri Lanka and BurmaVinaya The monastic discipline whose rules and traditions comprise six volumes in printed textAlthough I have tried to be as consistent as possible in rendering Pali terms into English there are a few cases where a single English term will not do justice to all the meanings of a Pali termThe rule of one English equivalent per one Pali word may make for consistency but any truly bilingual person knows that such a rule can create ludicrous distortions of meaning in translationThus while I have not consciously used one English term to translate two different Pali terms there are cases where I have found it necessary to render a single Pali term with two or more English terms depending on contextCitta in some cases is rendered as mind in others as intentSimilarly loka is rendered either as cosmos or world manas as intellect or heart āyatana as medium dimension or sphere upādāna as clinging or sustenance and dhamma as phenomenon quality or principleAlso with some of the Pali terms that are central to the teaching I have chosen equivalents that do not follow general usageIn the following list I have indicated these equivalents with asterisks explanations for these choices are provided at the end of the listFabrication Saṅkhāra literally means putting together and carries connotations of jerryrigged artificialityIt is applied to physical and to mental processes as well as to the products of those processesVarious English words have been suggested as renderings for saṅkhāra  such as formation determination force and construction  but fabrication in both of its senses as the process of fabrication and the fabricated things that result seems the best equivalent for capturing the connotations as well as the denotations of the termFrame of reference The literal rendering of satipaṭṭhāna is foundation of mindfulness establishing of mindfulness or application of mindfulness all of which require a great deal of explanation to make them intelligible in EnglishHowever the actual function of satipaṭṭhāna in practice is precisely that of the English idiom frame of referenceAlthough adopting this rendering requires some inconsistency in translating sati  using reference here and mindfulness otherwise  this seems a small price to pay for instant intelligibility in an otherwise obscure termInconstant The usual rendering for anicca is impermanent However the antonym of the term nicca carries connotations of constancy and dependability and as anicca is used to emphasize the point that conditioned phenomena cannot be depended on to provide true happiness this seem a useful rendering for conveying this pointStress The Pali term dukkha which is traditionally translated in the commentaries as that which is hard to bear is notorious for having no truly adequate equivalent in English but stress  in its basic sense as a strain on body or mind  seems as close as English can getIn the Canon dukkha applies both to physical and to mental phenomena ranging from the intense stress of acute anguish or pain to the innate burdensomeness of even the subtlest mental or physical fabricationsUnbinding Because nibbāna is used to denote not only the Buddhist goal but also the extinguishing of a fire it is usually rendered as extinguishing or even worse extinction However a study of ancient Indian views of the workings of fire will reveal that people of the Buddhas time felt that a fire in going out did not go out of existence but was simply freed from its agitation and attachment to its fuelThus when applied to the Buddhist goal the primary connotation of nibbāna is one of release and liberationAccording to the commentaries the literal meaning of the word nibbāna is unbinding and as this is a rare case where the literal and contextual meanings of a term coincide this seems to be the ideal English equivalentThe following secondary sources were useful in placing the teachings of the Pali canon in their historical context both social and intellectualThe little book you are now holding in your hand grew from the faith and conviction of a Westerner of Jewish extraction named DrPhilip who came to study Buddhism in Thailand in when I was staying on Phuket IslandHe practiced meditation with me for a full six months and seemed to develop not only peace of mind but also a great appreciation for Buddhisms worthBefore returning to Hawaii he asked me to jot down a few short simple points for him to take and continue practicing so I wrote down ten pointsAfterwards I learned that he had had them printed abroad in a periodical whose name slips my mind at the momentThe thought has occurred to me that this little book might be of use to those who are interested in practicing meditation as it is small easy to carry and read through quickly without taxing the brainSo I have edited it polishing the style and adding more points  in particular point and onwards  in order to make the book more complete fit to be a guide to the practice of meditation showing the worth of meditation the way to meditate which ways of meditation are right which are wrong and in detail how to correct those things that should be corrected in the practiceI hope this little book will be of use to those who are interestedIf anything written here deviates from the truth I ask for all the responsibility to be placed on me alone as I still lack experience in terms of education practice writing skills and knowledge of many fieldsIf knowledgeable people should come across this book I would be very grateful if they would correct and enlighten meA basic tenet of the Buddhas teachings is that the mind and body work together but that the body lies under the control of the mindThe mind is what orders the body to do this or that activity but when the body wears down the mind is of necessity put to some hardship as wellIt doesnt lie under the control of the nervous system although the brain can be regarded as a central officeWhen the body dies disintegrating in line with the nature of its various elements the mind  if the necessary conditions of unawareness craving attachment and kamma are still present  will have to reappear in this or that plane of existence and to continue experiencing suffering and stressIn order to do away with unawareness craving attachment and kamma  which are the chief instigators  we must first of all practice abandoning the elementary evils of word and deed by observing the principles of morality corresponding to our station in lifeIn other words lay people should observe the five precepts and periodically the eight precepts novices should observe the ten or the twenty precepts and monks all precepts of the basic monastic code together with the principles of pure livelihood restraint of the senses and proper use of the requisites of life as formulated by the BuddhaAs long as your precepts arent being kept pure your mind isnt yet ready for trainingEven if it is trained its training wont lead to progress and development in the Dhamma for its foundations arent yet firm enough to advance along the Noble Path  and we can say that it hasnt yet reached the refuge of the Triple GemA true Buddhist must before all else be firmly based in the Triple Gem and the principles of moralityThe Noble Eightfold Path and the three teachings at the heart of Buddhism  the avoidance of all evil the perfection of skillfulness and the purification the heart  have to be established first on the principles of moralityThis is why for the Buddhas teachings morality forms the beginning of the religious lifeThe next step is to train the mind to develop concentration and absorption through the practice of tranquillity meditationOnce the mind is adept at maintaining a steady focus we can then develop clear insight based on an understanding of the Three Characteristics of inconstancy stress and notselfThis will lead us to pure knowledge and vision of things as they actually are and thus to release from all things detrimental and defilingFor Buddhism the true aim in developing concentration and absorption is to gather ones mental energies and make them steady and strong in a single pointThis then forms the basis for the knowledge and discernment capable of gaining true insight into all conditions of nature and eliminating all that is detrimental and defiling from the heartThus stillness of mind is developed not simply for other external purposes such as the various fields of scienceInstead its meant specifically for use in cleansing the heart of such defilements as the five HindrancesBut when you have practiced to the point of proficiency you can use your stillness of mind in any way you like as long as that use isnt detrimental to yourself or to othersIn training the mind  which is a mental phenomenon  material objects such as chains and leashes are of no useThe mind has to be trained by tutoring it first by listening to the explanations of those who are already skilled and then by being determined to practice in line with those explanations basing your initial efforts on a sense of trust and conviction if your own independent explorations into cause and effect dont succeedBy and large people who start out by exploring cause and effect on their own dont reach their desired goal because they lack the proper approachThey miss the true path tending instead to be biased in favor of their own opinionsTo develop first a sense of trust in the individual giving the training and in the practices in which one is being trained until the mind is firm and unwavering and then to begin exploring and figuring things out in line with the way they really are This is what will give satisfactory resultsThis is because any beginning exploration of cause and effect is usually a matter of looking at things from the outside following external influences  ie This person says that That person says this But to investigate and explore cause and effect exclusively within the bounds of the body  ie What is this body of mine made ofHow does it come about so that its parts are complete and able to perform their functions wellWhat is it to be used forWhat keeps it goingIs its fate to develop or to deteriorateIs it really mine  and then going on to mental phenomena  Do greed anger delusion love hatred and so forth arise at the body or at the mindWhat do they come fromWhen they arise are they pleasant or stressful  to reason and explore things strictly internally in this way is in and of itself training the mindBut if your stillness of mind isnt yet strong enough dont go reasoning in line with the books you may have read or the things you may have heard other people say because even though you may think things through it wont lead you to the truthIn other words it wont lead you to a sense of dispassion and detachmentSo instead explore and investigate things in line with the causes and effects that actually arise from the mind in the presentThe mind investigating and figuring things out in line with its own personal reasonings in this way will tend to focus exclusively on examining a single spot in a single objectThis is called onepointed concentrationThis is a gathering of the minds energies so that they have great strength able to uproot attachments  mistaken assumptions  and to cleanse the mind so that it is for the moment bright and clearAt the very least you will experience peace  an extreme sense of wellbeing in body and mind  and perhaps knowledge of one sort or another knowledge of a strange and striking sort for it arises not from mental imaginings but from the causes and effects of the truth acting in the present in a way that has never happened beforeEven if it is knowledge of something you may have suspected all along only now is it your own making your mind bright driving away all doubt and uncertainty about matters that may have been occupying your thoughtsYou will say to yourself with a sense of deep satisfaction and relief So thats how it isThose whose sensitivities are dull though wont be convinced and delighted with their knowledge until someone else confirms it or they see teachings of the Buddha in books bearing witness to what they have learnedThis is in line with the fact that the Buddhas followers are of various sortsThis type of knowledge  no matter how much or how wideranging it is  wont weigh on your nervesOn the contrary its a form of calm and true wellbeing that will greatly brighten and refresh your nervesAt the same time it will refine your mind and manners in a way that will be very inspiring to othersWhatever you say or do you will do mindfully with hardly any careless lapsesOnce this happens to you you should then try to maintain all these traits and not grow careless or complacentThese are all individual matters and wont occur in every caseBut at any rate when you have trained the mind as explained above even if you dont gain the results in full measure you will still experience a striking sense of peace and wellbeing in proportion to the extent of your own individual practiceYou should then try to maintain this mental stateDont let feelings of greed or desire disappointment or dejection ariseKeep the mind neutral and continue practicing as I have explained from the beginning with a sense of trust and convictionBe mindful careful and observant at every stage of your practice and you will then meet with the results you hope forIf training the mind in line with points and doesnt produce results then gather your awareness and focus it firmly with a single object or mental image as its targetFor example focus on an aspect of the body  the bones or one of its internal organs  so as to see its objectionable natureOr you may simply focus the mind on bare awareness itself  for the mind is something that cant be seen with the physical eyesIf it isnt focused on a single spot you wont know whether or not its presentThe mind is like the wind If the wind doesnt come into contact with anything you wont know whether or not its thereSo it is with the mindIf a new trainee doesnt have a target for the mind he or she wont really be able to catch hold of the mindBut please dont choose anything outside of the body as your targetMake your target  ie the object of the mind  an aspect of the body as already mentionedAnd when you take aim focus on a single object which seems right for youDont be greedy first taking some of this and then a little of thatIn focusing examine the object in line with the principles of the foundations of mindfulnessIn other words sort out the bodys various aspects until you can see This isnt meThis isnt myselfThere are two ways of doing the focused examination that prompts this realizationbWhen focused exclusively on the target at the same time keep yourself aware that This is the target of the mindThis is the mind examiningThis is mindfulness ie the act of remembering to keep the target in mindThis is discernment which sees into the truth of the object under considerationBoth methods work although method is suited for beginners and those whose sensitivities are not yet developed while method is suited for those who are sensitive and experiencedBoth methods though if you practice them diligently give rise to the same results namely concentration and discernmentIn training the mind as explained above no matter which method you choose please dont let yourself wonder about whether or not youre going to attain concentration and discernmentAnd put aside all desires based on the various rumors and reports that get passed around by word of mouthJust follow correctly the method mentioned in point and youll be doing fineAt the same time observe the approach youve taken to see how you brought the mind to the object how you maintained mindfulness and what happened to the mind as a resultIf acting in that particular manner made the mind open and bright keep at it until youre adept and able to do it all the timeBut if the results werent like that ie just the opposite then without delay use your powers of observation in the way already mentioned to make adjustments and correctionsIn observing how the mind behaves under training some people will be able to observe their state of mind while the mind is still in that state others only after the mind has withdrawn from that state and stopped still for a momentBoth ways workThey are simply a matter of individual temperamentBut if you dont use your powers of observation at all progress in mental training will be hard to achieve and  even if you do happen to achieve it  hard to maintainWhile you are training the mind one thing  strange and striking  may occur without your intending itThat is the mind will withdraw from its external objects and gather into a single whole letting go of all labels and attachments dealing with past or futureThere will be just bare awareness paired with its preoccupation in the presentThis is something with no sense of inside or outside  a condition whose features are peculiar to the mind itselfIt is as if everything has undergone a revolutionThis is the mind coming to its own level the bhavangaIn this moment everything has reference only to the mindEven though life may still be going on the mind when it reaches this level lets go of all attachments to the body and goes inward to experience nothing but its own object all by itselfThis is termed bhavacitta the mind on its own levelThe mind on its own level still has a refined version of the five khandhas complete within it and so can still experience birth and states of becoming and give rise to continued births in the futureReaching this state is somewhat like dozing off and dreamingThe difference depends on how much alertness there isThose who are collected and perceptive will  when the event first occurs  be aware of what is happening and what they are experiencing and so wont get excited or upsetThose who are gullible and not very mindful though will be just like a person who dozes off and dreamsWhen they come to they will tend to be startled or get misled by the visions they may happen to seeBut when they have trained themselves until they are skilled at giving rise to this state often their sense of mindfulness will improve and their various visions will go awayGradually they will gain insight until they see into natural conditions as they actually areThe phenomenon discussed in point  even though it doesnt give rise to discernment capable of exploring into the patterns of cause and effect in a wideranging way  is still a preliminary stage in training the mindIt can suppress the five Hindrances and at the same time give rise to a sense of peace and wellbeing in the presentIf it is properly developed so that it doesnt deteriorate it will lead to a good rebirth in the future in line with ones karmic backgroundIncidentally when visions and signs of various sorts appear its usually in the mental moment we are discussing hereBut this doesnt mean that when the mind reaches this stage there will have to be visions or signs in every caseWith some people and at some times they will occurWith others and at other times they wontThis is another matter of individual temperament  and of other factors as wellTo be perfectly truthful when it comes to the question of visions and signs that arise in the course of meditation you can say that theyre good only in the case of meditators who are quickwitted and astute enough to see through them who  when they see visions  dont fall for them or latch onto them as being the self or as really belonging to themselvesThey see the visions simply as visions enough to use them as tools or a temporary dwelling place for the mind and then let them goAs for people who arent especially mindful or alert  and who are gullible to boot  when a vision arises they will get extremely excited and may even become so deluded as to lose touch with reality because they believe the vision to something real and trueIn addition people who have trained their minds to this stage are usually stubborn and bullheaded in their opinions due to their strength of mindWhen they think about something they tend to see it from one side onlyThey wont easily give any heed to the opinions of others because they believe that their own opinions are perfectly reasonable and trustworthy  even though their opinions are actually selfserving and very much lacking in reason and can easily pervert the way they see thingsBut at any rate whether or not visions and signs arise theyre not really what you want here because aside from being defilements clouding your discernment they are also obstacles to the development of clear insightThe aim of training the mind is to let go of the five Hindrances and then to examine the khandhas so that they become clear to see them as they actually are to the point where you grow disenchanted with them loosen your passion and fascination with them and let them go never to enter into and take hold of them againWhen you have trained the mind to be firmly enough established in absorption and concentration to suppress the five Hindrances then you should work at developing clear insightActually clear insight may arise at the same time you are working on tranquillityIn other words discernment may brighten so as to know and see clearly the truth that all conditioned things that arise are bound to disintegrate and pass awayThey cant lastThey arent me or myself but are simply natural conditions acting on their ownWhen this sort of knowledge arises it will make the mind become disenchanted and dispassionate towards to all conditioned thingsThe mind will dwell entirely in a state of matured and chastened dispassion no matter what it sees or hears and no matter whereThis is called clear insight occurring together with tranquillityIf however insight doesnt arise in this way then when you have practiced tranquillity meditation until the mind is firmly established then you can select either a part of the body  such as the bones or the intestines  or else a topic thats occupying your thoughts at the moment and examine it so as to see that all the things which the mind fastens onto as stable and real as leading to true happiness actually fall under the sway of the Three CharacteristicsThe way we assume things saying This is this and that is that in line with our imaginings is not in any way trueAll conditioned things simply arise from their causes unawareness craving attachment and kammaWhen their causes are exhausted they disband of their own accordNo one forces them to disbandEven the body we are living in is able to survive only in dependence on causes such as breath and foodWhen these things are exhausted the body has no meaning at allWhen you examine things in this way using the power of a fully concentrated mind you will reach the goal of the minds trainingThe light of discernment will arise complete with the insight into cause and effect you have discovered totally on your ownThis is something that arises not from appropriating labels or theories remembered from other people but from realizing the causes and effects entirely within your own heartThe mind will never again be deluded into becoming attached passionate pleased or displeased with any conditioned thing at allIncidentally we can say that if the mind hasnt truly and clearly seen into the object of its meditation then it hasnt really yet gathered itself together and settled downBut the reason why the training of the mind isnt called insight meditation before this point is because discernment is still weak in terms of cause and effect and lacks circumspectionTo summarize The purification of our words and deeds has to begin with training in moral virtueThe purification of the mind has to begin with training in tranquillity  concentration and absorption  until the mind has enough strength to suppress the five HindrancesWhen the mind is adept at concentration and absorption able to enter withdraw and stay in place at will then discernment  the light of knowledge seeing into the truth of all natural conditions together with the causes for their arising and passing away  will arise in a remarkable wayThis sort of knowledge may arise only to certain individuals in certain circumstancesBut in any case those who have trained their minds to this level should realize that a mind that has reached this point is fit to be trained to give rise to clear insightThey should thus take any aspect of the body or any mental phenomenon that occupies their thoughts and examine it from the standpoint of the Three Characteristics as explained aboveThen they too will develop the light of insight seeing clearly into all conditioned things  and be able to uproot attachments to physical and mental phenomena of every sortEven though the mind is intangible it has influence over the body and all things in the worldIt is capable of bringing everything in the world under its powerStill it isnt so vicious or savage as to lack all sense of good and evilWhen a person of good intentions trains the mind to enter correctly into the path of the Buddhas teachings as explained above it will be tractable and quick to learn developing the wisdom to bring the body which may be behaving without any principles back into lineIn addition it can cleanse itself to be bright and clean free from defilements able to realize by itself truths that are subtle and profound and to bring dazzling light into this world so dark with blindnessThis is because the true substance of the mind has been from the very beginning something bright and clearBut because of the preoccupations that have seeped into it and clouded it the brightness of the mind has been temporarily darkened making the world dark as wellIf the mind were originally dark there probably wouldnt be anyone able to cleanse it to the point where it could give rise to the light of discernment at allSo whether the world is to be dark or bright whether it is to experience wellbeing or suffering depends on the mind of each individualWe as individuals should thus first train our own minds well and then train the minds of othersThe world will then be free from turmoilThe visions and signs that arise from the practice of meditation are a strange and uncanny affairThey may delude a gullible person of weak judgment into being so convinced of their truth as to lose touch with realityFor this reason those who practice meditation should be cautious examining and reflecting on them carefully as I will now explainThe signs arising from meditation are of two sorts visions and signsIn other cases visions of divine beings or of hell and hungry shades may sometimes appearbAs for signs When the mind gathers as already mentioned a whispering voice may appearIt may be the voice of a person we respect telling us to examine a particular truth or to beware of a coming event or else it may be the voice of an enemy who means to harm us appearing to us just before heshe will come to do us harm  which shows how the mental currents of different individuals impinge on one anotherOn the other hand the same sort of thing may occur involving a person who means us wellSometimes an unidentified voice may come to tell a truth thats thoughtprovoking and worthy of consideration which meditators in general call the teachings and warnings of the Dhamma or abhiññaIts not the case that visions and signs will occur to all meditatorsWith some people no matter how refined a level their minds attain visions and signs wont appearWith others the mind may gather in a flash for a brief moment and all sorts of visions and signs will appearThis depends on the individuals temperamentWith people who are gullible and dont give much thought to what is reasonable visions and signs tend to occur quickly and grow all out of bounds to the point where they can lose their bearingsSo treat them with cautionVisions and signs arise from the power of mundane jhana and are sustained by attachment and mental concoctingThey thus fall under the Three Characteristics Theyre inconstant  they cant last theyre stressful and theyre notself  ie they arent yours or anyone elsesThey are conditions that do nothing but constantly arise and fall away in their own way at all timesExamine them to see their true nature in this way and then let them goDont be deluded into latching onto visions and signs which are the resultsInstead work at the cause jhana so that you become more and more adept to the point where you can attain it at willThe visions and signs will then take care of themselvesAlso learn to see the drawbacks of visions and signsOnce they arise and we get fooled into latching onto them they will cause our jhana to deteriorate just as sound waves are an obstacle to a person trying to quiet the mind and explore phenomena that are subtle and deep or as waves in clear water prevent us from seeing our reflection on the waters surfaceThe visions and signs that appear to a meditator just beginning to attain jhana tend to be extraordinary and amazingThe acts of mental grasping and concocting will tend to fasten tightly to them and they will be indelibly impressed on ones inner eyeIf the above methods for curing and removing these visions and signs dont produce results then try not to have the mind enter jhanaIn other words dont put your mind to it dont let the mind be still dont take a liking to the visions or signsSleep and eat as much as you like perform heavy tasks until the body is very tired think of objects that will give rise to defilements such as beautiful sights or sounds that will give rise to desire  and once the mind withdraws from its absorption the visions and signs will disappear of their own accordIf the student meditator cant solve the problem with these methods then the teacher should try to help by using the same sort of approachThe quickest and most effective way is to find an issue that will provoke the person attached to visions and signs to extreme angerThe visions and signs will immediately disappearThe basis for giving rise to knowledge into the Dhamma is threshold concentration which is of two sortsbThe mind becomes more and more refined until it is able to let go and withdraw from the object it is considering so that the object disappearsThis is called fixed penetrationThere is full mindfulness and alertness to a sense of emptiness not grasping after or fastening onto anything at all simply partaking of its own exclusive objectWhen the mind comes out of this state and is again considering the Dhamma  objects cause and effect  this is threshold concentration coming out of fixed penetrationBoth sorts of threshold concentration can form a good basis for insight into particular truths and various events which is different from the knowledge arising from the visions and signs mentioned above because visions and signs arise from mundane jhana whereas the knowledge we are discussing here even though it arises from mundane concentration gives more dependable resultsAnd if your concentration becomes transcendent it will do away step by step with all the effluents of the mindIn short the knowledge arising from visions and signs and the knowledge arising from threshold concentration differ in terms both of origin and of qualityAn item deserving a little more explanation here is the term fixed penetrationFixed penetration is a superior human attainmentBy and large people who reach fixed penetration tend to focus on the inandout breath as their object of meditationAs they focus on the breath and come to pay attention to its arising and falling away or just to its falling away the mind gradually becomes more and more refined until step by step it lets go of all its preoccupations and gathers together to become fixed as explained aboveThe stilling of the inandout breath is what indicates fixed penetrationIn some instances it is called fixed jhana because it comes from the act of becoming absorbed in the breathIt is called fixed concentration because even though there is no inandout breath when the mind reaches that point mindfulness is still absolutely fullWhen youre in this state you cant examine anything because the mind is totally uninvolved with anything at allOnly when the mind comes out of this state and enters threshold concentration can you begin examining things againYou will then see clearly into all the truths that the Buddha said are to be known and into other matters as wellThere will be no visions and signs as mentioned above but the knowledge here will be based on cause and effect complete with analogies and similes that will utterly erase all doubtIn some cases meditators will be considering objects of meditation other than the inandout breath and yet will still be able to reach fixed penetration in the same way as those who practice mindfulness of breathingWhen the mind gathers to a point where there is no more inandout breathing thats fixed penetrationThis at any rate is my opinion on the matterMeditators shouldnt take my opinion as their criterion because the thoughts and opinions of people in this world  even when we see the same things under the same conditions in the same place  can formulate different names for and reach different understandings about those same things and thus give rise to endless disputes and argumentsSimply let us all work with our own objects of meditation so as to reach fixed penetration as discussed above and then  with a fair mind free from bias  compare what we experience with what has been formulated in the various textsOur knowledge will then be paccattam  arising exclusively from within ourselvesThat is what I would like to see in this regardAll transcendent phenomena are rooted in mundane phenomenaThe Wings to Awakening which are classified entirely as transcendent have to begin first with mental and physical phenomena ie this mundane body and mindVisions signs and the knowledge resulting from jhana are obstacles to the oneeyed  those who are simply developing jhana  but can provoke insight for those with two eyes ie those who are developing discernment along with concentrationEvery sword and ax is made with both a sharp and a dull edge each with its own different uses but a person who confuses those uses aside from getting nowhere with the sword or ax may actually harm himself or the work he is doingInsight and the defilements of insight come from one and the same basisWhen people without discernment consider things wrongly they will give rise to the defilements of insight but when they consider things rightly using the proper approach the same things will become true insightMundane phenomena  when we clearly see and know them and their causes for what they are and when seeing their drawbacks we grow disenchanted with them not being deluded into latching onto them  then turn into DhammaBut when we get taken in by them and are unwilling to let them go Its not the case that the world will stay the way it is foreverThe world of the Brahmas may degenerate into the world of the Devas the world of the Devas into the human world the human world into the lower realmsJust as liquids tend to seek out lowlying places so it is easy for the minds of living beings to seek out whats low  namely evilEven though the practice of meditation is a selfrevolution you must be willing to risk your lifeAt the very least if you dont succeed you should threaten yourself with selfexileThose who dont make such a vow can look forward only to being a slave to others  the defilements  throughout timeThe daily schedule at Metta Forest Monastery includes a group interview in the late afternoon and a chanting session followed by a group meditation period later in the eveningThe Dhamma talks included in this volume were given during the evening meditation sessions and in many cases covered issues raised at the interviews  either in the questions asked or lurking behind the questionsOften these issues touched on a variety of topics on a variety of different levels in the practiceThis explains the range of topics covered in individual talksI have edited the talks with an eye to making them readable while at the same time trying to preserve some of the flavor of the spoken wordIn a few instances I have added passages or rearranged the talks to make the treatment of specific topics more coherent and complete but for the most part I have kept the editing to a minimumDont expect polished essaysThe people listening to these talks were familiar with the meditation instructions included in Method  in Keeping the Breath in Mind by Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo and my own essay A Guided Meditation If you are not familiar with these instructions you might want to read through them before reading the talks in this bookAlso further Dhamma talks are available at dhammatalksorgAs with the previous volumes in this series I would like to thank Bok Lim Kim for making the recording of these talks possibleShe more than anyone else is responsible for overcoming my initial reluctance to have the talks recordedI would also like to thank the following people for transcribing the talks andor helping to edit the transcriptions John Bullitt Kathy Forsythe Roger Fox Gareth FyshFoskett Richard Heiman Linda Knudsen Addie Onsanit Nate Osgood Xian Quan Osgood Malcolm Schaeffer Walter Schwidetzky Atthaññu Bhikkhu Balaggo Bhikkhu Gunaddho Bhikkhu Khematto Bhikkhu and Vijjakaro BhikkhuMay they all be happyRight concentration forms the heart of the pathThe other factors of the path serve two functionsOne is to get you into concentration the other is to make sure you dont get stuck thereIn other words concentration on its own is a state of becoming thats useful on the pathEven though you eventually want to go beyond all states of becoming if you dont first master this state of becoming youll be wandering around in other states of becoming where it would be hard to see whats going on in the mindAs the Buddha said when your mind is concentrated you can see the four noble truths as they actually come to beWhen its not concentrated you cant see these things clearlyNonconcentration he says is a miserable path leading nowhere useful at allSo concentration is the essential factorOnly when the mind is stable and still can it really see whats going on insideTo get into right concentration you need the other path factors right view all the way up through right mindfulnessRight view starts with conviction in the principle of kamma that there are good and bad actions that give good and bad results  not only in this lifetime but also in future lifetimes  and that there are people who really know these things from direct experienceIts not just a theoryWhats interesting here is that when the Buddha presents this introduction to his teaching on kamma he focuses on two types of good actions to stress their importance gratitude to your parents and generosityThese things really do have merit they really do have valueThe fact that your parents gave birth to you was not just a set of impersonal processes that just happened to happenIts not the case that you dont owe any debt of gratitude to your parents for having gone through all the pain of giving birth to you and then raising you once you were bornThere really is a personal debt thereThey made choices sometimes difficult choices that allowed for your survivalGenerosity is one of the ways you pay off that debt and its also one of the valuable ways you interact well with other beings benefiting both them and yourself in the processThe Buddhas attitude towards generosity is instructiveHes very clear on the fact that when hes telling you what you should do the should is based on a conditionAfter all the Buddha didnt create youYou might resist his shoulds with the thought Who is he to tell me what to doYears back I was sitting in on a course on the Metta SuttaThe first line in the Metta Sutta starts This is what should be done by one who aims at a state of peace As the teacher started out with that line a hand immediately shot upA man sitting in the class said I thought Buddhism didnt have any shoulds And they spent the rest of the morning going back and forth over that one issueActually Buddhism does have a lot of shouldsYou look at the Dhammapada and youll see that its full of shouldsBut each should is based on a condition as in the first line of the Metta Sutta This is what should be done by one who aims at a state of peace The Buddha doesnt tell you that you have to aim at a state of peace or that you have to want true happinessThats your choiceBut if that is what you want this is what youve got to doThe nature of cause and effect is such that these are the practices you have to followThe Buddha isnt saying Well this is what worked for me and it may work for you but Im not sure so you have to find your own way Thats not what he would sayHed say This is what works if youre aiming at this goal And its up to you to decide whether you want to aim at that goalIf you do then youve got to do it this wayTheres a passage where King Pasenadi comes to visit the Buddha and his first question is Where should a gift be given The Buddha responds Wherever you feel inspired In other words there are no shoulds in this area aside from your own sense of inspiration  where you feel the gift would be well used or where you just want to giveThere are no restraints placed on the act of generosity at allBut then the King follows up with another question Where when a gift is given does it bear great fruit And the Buddha says Thats a different question This is where the principle of cause and effect kicks in placing its imperativesYou have to give to someone whose mind is pure or to an institution where the people are being trained to make their minds pure  ie the Sangha  if you want your gift to bear great fruitSo there are shoulds in the Buddhas teachings but theyre based on the principle of what actually works for the purpose of true happinessAs for what you want to do with your life theres no imposition there at allIts your choiceBut once you appreciate the principle of generosity and see that it is really worthwhile youve made the choice to get started on the pathAs the Buddha said its impossible for someone who is stingy to attain jhana to attain any of the noble attainmentsSo you start with the principle that generosity is good and that your actions matterWhen you dig a little bit deeper into the principle of action you realize that your intentions are what matter in your actionsThis insight leads to the next step in the path right resolveYou want to avoid intentions that would make it difficult to get the mind into concentration so you want to learn how to go beyond being resolved on sensual passion being resolved on ill will being resolved on harmfulness  because all these things stir up the mind and interfere with its settling downTheres a passage in the Canon where Prince Jayasena walking for exercise through a forest one day comes across a novice staying in a little wilderness hutHe says to the novice I hear that when the monks really apply themselves they can get their minds into a state of onepointednessIs that true And the novice says Yes And the prince says Well explain it to me And the novice who probably knew the princes reputation says You wouldnt understand The prince responds Well I just might So the novice replies In that case Ill explain it to you but if you dont understand dont harass me with more questions okay So the prince agreesBut when the novice explains it to him the prince says Thats impossibleNobody can get their minds concentrated like that He gets up and leavesThe novice then goes to see the Buddha and tells him what happenedAnd the Buddha says What did you expectThat person is immersed in sensual passion on fire with sensual fever being chewed up by his sensual thoughts How would he understand anything like this  something that has to be attained through renunciationThis is why the Buddha has you put sensual passion aside for it prevents the mind from getting concentratedIt prevents you from even conceiving of the possibility of getting concentratedSimilarly with ill will and harmfulness If you hold ill will for somebody if you want to be harmful to that person then as soon as the mind settles down to be quiet in the present moment those thoughts are sure to flare upThey obsess youSo the Buddha has you resolve to put them asideWhen you want to act on those right resolves this is where right action right speech and right livelihood come inSome people find the Buddhas precepts too hard to follow other people say theyre not inclusive enoughThe ones who say that theyre not inclusive enough insist that we have to be more responsibleIf theres a precept against killing you shouldnt be able to eat meatIf theres a precept against stealing you shouldnt abuse the earths resourcesThey make the precepts bigger and bigger and bigger all the time to the point where they become impossible too big to be fully put into practiceOr in some cases it is possible to practice them fully but the Buddha said it wasnt necessary to go that farWere working on the precepts that help the mind get concentrated which is why they go only as far as they doIn other words you dont want to act on an unskillful intention and you dont want to tell other people to act on those intentionsBut as far as breaches of the precepts where you dont know whats happening or its not intentional those dont countAfter all the intention is the important part of concentration and you want to train the mind to master its intentions in areas where you have some control over your life and over your actionsOnce youve created this context for the practice youre in a better position to follow the parts of the path that deal directly with right concentrationFirst theres right effort which means generating the desire to get rid of unskillful qualities of the mind  ie the things that get in the way of concentration like the hindrances  and then to give rise to skillful qualities like the factors for AwakeningThis is an area where desire is a useful part of the pathIt gives you the energy you need to work on the mind and to realize that youve got to make choicesThere are skillful and unskillful things arising in the mind but right view  in terms of the principle of kamma  reminds you that the unskillful ones will lead to bad results and the skillful ones to good resultsSo you cant just sit there totally passive as you watch them arise and pass away because that doesnt lead to concentrationYouve got to foster the good qualities and abandon the unskillful onesIn the next step of the path the Buddha surrounds right effort with right mindfulness  surrounding it in the sense that you add two additional qualities to right effortAs the text says you bring three qualities to bear on your contemplation You want to be ardent alert and mindfulThe ardency there is right effortThe mindfulness means that you keep your frame of reference in mind  as when were keeping the breath in mind right nowThe alertness means seeing whats happening in the present moment seeing if you really are with the breath if the mind is settling down well with the breath and catching it when youve forgottenYoure trying to establish a frame of reference here because these four frames of reference  the body in and of itself feelings in and of themselves the mind in and of itself and mental qualities in and of themselves  are the themes or topics of right concentrationMindfulness practice and concentration practice go hand in hand on the Buddhas pathThen as youre trying to get the mind to settle down with its frame of reference you have to start evaluating it to see what works and what doesnt workAs your frame of reference gets more and more solid you actually move into the factors of jhanaSo thats what you should do to get into jhana  if you want itAgain the Buddha doesnt say you have to do it but if you want it this is what you should doJhana on its own doesnt lead to the end of sufferingThere are a lot of passages describing people who attain different levels of jhana and are able to maintain them but if they dont go beyond that they end up getting reborn in the various Brahma worlds after they dieThen when they fall from there who knows where theyre going to landOne sutta shows people falling from the Brahma worlds and doing really stupid thingsTheyve been so blissed out for so long that theyve forgotten that their actions can carry consequences so they act in wanton and careless waysThis is why once the mind is firmly in jhana youve got to start applying right view againOnly this time its right view in terms of the four noble truths looking for the stress in your activities and seeing where its coming from in your mindIn other words you look at mental events and mental states simply in terms of cause and effect whats skillful and whats unskillfulThose are the basic categories underlying the four noble truthsSo as were meditating here remind yourself that the concentration is what were after what were focusing on doing right hereEverything else on the path is aimed either at getting us here or else at making sure that once we are here we make the best use of the opportunity really to see things as they happenIn particular we want to see this issue of how the mind is creating all this unnecessary stress all the time and what can be done to stop itOf course if you only want to follow part of the path thats up to youRemember the Buddha never forced us to do anythingBut if you want the best results this is what youve got to doA recurrent theme in the teachings of the forest ajaans is that all the steps of the practice are of a pieceIn other words having attained Awakening they dont say anything disparaging about the early steps in the practice that theyre only elementary and that you have to drop them to move on to the more important stuffAs Luang Pu Dune put it The Dhamma is one thing clear through Or as Ajaan Maha Boowa once said one of the realizations that comes when you hit Awakening is that everything is the same teaching starting from generosity and gratitude all the way up through AwakeningThere are different levels of subtlety but its all the same principleAnd you could see this fact in their livesEven having attained Awakening they didnt just sit around and say now that their own job was done they didnt have to do anything furtherThey were very industrious peopleAjaan Fuang even when he was sick would get out every evening and do some chore around the monasteryWhen we were doing construction work he wasnt up to doing any of the heavy jobs but at the very least he would go out and pick up the thrownaway nailsHe was very frugal very meticulousSo its important to keep this principle in mind that the practice here is a practice of generosity of gratitude of goodwill and kindness all the way throughLook at the Buddhas teachings on the four noble truthsWhat are they motivated by if not goodwillThe desire for an end of suffering the desire for happiness that doesnt place any burdens on anyone else What is this if not compassionAnd look at his teaching careerWherever there was anyone ready to learn the Dhamma he would go thereIn those days that meant going on footHe traveled all over northern India on foot just to teachEven the very last day of his life he knew there was one more person he had to teach before he entered total nibbanaSo even though he was suffering from dysentery he walked all the way to Kusinara  a full days walk  because there was one more person Subhadda he had to teachWhat this means in our practice is that we should value all levels of the practiceIts not that you put in time with the elementary levels and then drop them as you move on to the higher onesYou simply add more and more levels of subtlety to your practice more and more levels of generosity goodwill and gratitudeThe Buddha started his teaching with very basic mundane right view the teaching on kammaAnd he introduced kamma with two teachings one on gratitude one on generosityHe started out by saying that generosity is realThe gifts you give actually benefit you and the other personThis is something of real valueAnd you can think of the whole practice  all the way through the abandoning of greed anger and delusion  as an act of generosity an act of goodwillThe less greed anger and delusion you have the better off not only you are but also everybody elseThink of all the suffering youve inflicted not only on yourself but also on other people through your anger your greed your delusionYou give these things up not only for your own benefit but for the benefit of the people around you as wellThen theres the teaching on gratitudeThe Buddha focused on the gratitude we owe our parents  that the good theyve done for us is something of valueWe really are in their debtAll that your mother went through just to give birth to you Think about thatIn Thailand its traditional for there to be a chant on this topic before an ordinationThey hire somebody to come in and he chants for a couple hours about all the hardships your parents went through to raise you as a way of reminding you of your debt to themIn Thailand theres a very strong sense that you ordain as an act of gratitude to your parentsYou dedicate the merit to themSo right before the ordination they remind you of exactly how big that debt isIf the chant lasts for four hours three and a half of the hours are about the pains your mother went through being pregnant with youYoure fortunate she didnt abort you  she could have done thatYoure fortunate your parents didnt abandon you after you were born  they could have done that as wellThey went to all that trouble to raise you to teach you how to speak how to sit how to walkTheres a huge debt of gratitude you owe themAs the Buddha said gratitude is a sign of a good personIf you dont appreciate the good that other people have done for you its very unlikely that youre going to do good for anybody at allAjaan Fuang if he noticed that people didnt have gratitude for their parents didnt want to associate with themIf people cant appreciate their parents what are they going to appreciateGratitude is essential to every form of goodnessAnd it carries you all the way throughThis is why were generous this is why we practice the precepts why were harmlessWe meditate to train the mind so that its harmlessNot only harmless but also more energeticIf youre not weighing yourself down with greed anger and delusion you have a lot more energy to help other peopleAnd even though theres that popular conception of Theravada as a selfish path as someone who had studied Buddhism both in Japan and in Thailand once said you wont find that Thai people are any more selfish than Japanese peopleIn fact it can often be the other way aroundThe example of the Buddha in the Pali Canon is not a selfish exampleSariputta and Moggallana were extremely helpful not only in teaching other monks but also in teaching laypeopleAnd look at all the rules in the Vinaya for the monks to look after the monasteryBasically the monastery is pure generosityIf you were to open your eyes right now and look around everything youd see would be somebodys giftAnd as for the monks the longer you live as a monk the more and more the very bones of your body are the results of somebodys generosityThey say that after seven years all the cells in your body have been changed so once a monk has hit seven years his whole body is somebody elses giftSo youve got to use it wisely generously in the same spirit with which it was given to youAnd as for the monastery around you youre trained to look after the placeThe Buddha encouraged the monks to be clean to be careful in the way they use things to put a lot of energy into looking after the results of other peoples generosityIn the forest tradition theres a very strong tradition of keeping alive the protocols that the Buddha gives in the KhandhakasTheres a Vinaya textbook that the monks in Thailand are supposed to study written by a city monk back at the beginning of the twentieth century and he cut back on a lot of these rulesThis textbook was never popular with the forest traditionThey preferred an older book that went into a lot of detail particularly on the protocols most of which deal with looking after the monastery when you come to a monastery how youre supposed to set things in order when you leave how youre supposed to leave it in good shape and while youre there how you keep it cleanA lot of energy should go into keeping the monastery in good shape because a lot of energy went into giving the monastery in the first placeSo the Buddha never discouraged people from being generousHe never discouraged people from being energeticAjaan Suwat liked to make this point again and again Theres no place where the Buddha encourages lazinessEven though he teaches contentment its contentment with the material things you already have so that you can devote yourself to building on that and especially so that you can devote yourself to the training of the mindBut contentment doesnt mean that if you find the place dirty you leave it dirtyContentment means that if you just have a little shack youre content with your shack but you make it a clean shackYou keep it spic and span in good repairUtthanasampada is the word in PaliIt means that you take initiative youre energeticAnd this translates into your meditationThe sort of person whos energetic in keeping the place clean tends to be more energetic in meditatingOnce when Id just arrived in Bangkok on some visa business I was in the midst of cleaning my room sweeping it wiping it downA Western monk whod just returned from Burma knew that I might be there so he came around and sure enough I had just come inBut as soon as he saw me wiping down the floor he said You Thai monksAll you do is spend your time cleaning upOver in Burma we have other people who do that for us And as you looked at the quality of his meditation you could see that he was used to having other people doing things for himHis meditation had gotten slack and sloppy as wellThis is a strong tradition in the forest tradition starting from the time of Ajaan MunHe was very diligent in keeping his place cleanHis place in the forest wasnt just some hovelEverything was neatly swept everything in its proper placeAs Ajaan Fuang said even the rags for wiping feet at the base of the stairs to his little hut If they were torn he would sew them if they were dirty he would wash themAnd this quality of being energetic and meticulous translated into his meditation as wellSo dont think that the elementary practices are just for people on an elementary levelTheyre for everybodyThats how everybody gets started and everybody keeps goingYou build on themYou dont abandon themYou build on themYou include more and more subtle levelsBut the basic levels stay there as well until as the texts say generosity is no longer something you do for your own sake or for the sake of other peopleIt becomes just a natural expression of the mindAll the steps of the practice become a natural expression of the mind once its fully trainedReflect back on the passage we chanted just now May I be happyMay all living beings be happyMay all beings be freed from their sufferingMay those who are happy not be deprived of their happiness These are good thoughts to thinkThey put the mind in a good place a place where youre not wishing ill to anyone at allYoure wishing them wellAnd youre wishing well for yourself tooSometimes people find that hard but if you cant wish for your own true happiness what are you wishing forThe desire for true happiness is nothing to feel ashamed aboutIn fact the whole teaching of the Dhamma is based on that desire recognizing that if you follow through with your desire for true happiness intelligently if you really are careful about how you go about finding it youll actually find it and wont harm anyone in the processIts a desire that should be respectedThe world however teaches us not to respect itPeople will tell you Forget about true lasting happiness just go for the thrill of purchase the thrill of a relationship in the beginning stagesGo for the quick and easy but also the quick to fadeAs for true happiness forget about it Thats what they sayBut the message of the Dhamma is that if you dont wish for true happiness what are you wishing forThis is the one assumption that the Buddha makes about human beingsSometimes you read that the Buddha assumes that everybody is basically good at heart but you cant find that in the textsWhat he does assume is that everyone wants happinessThe problem is that we go about it in confused and misinformed waysBut if we can find a path to true happiness that really works everyone would be happy because true happiness is something that doesnt harm anyone at allYour true happiness doesnt conflict with anyone elses true happinessKeep that in mindThis is why we chant this passage every dayThey say that Ajaan Mun spread thoughts of goodwill to all living beings three times a day in the morning when he woke up in the afternoon when he woke up from his nap and at night before he went to sleepIn this way the desire for goodwill the desire for true happiness framed his practiceSo its good to establish it as a frame for your practice as wellIt helps remind you of why youre hereThere will be barren patches in your meditation patches where things dont seem to be going the way you want them toWhen you hit these patches remember that youre doing this for true happiness something that goes beyond the ordinary quick fixThat helps get you over the rough spotsSo always keep these thoughts in mindRemember that goodwill and compassion are qualities you cant separate from the Buddhas teachings on wisdom and discernmentYou have to understand how to go about true happiness if your desire for happiness is actually going to get resultsWhat this comes down to is training the mindAll the Buddhas teachings  on generosity virtue and meditation or on virtue concentration and discernment  are aimed at training the mind because the mind is what shapes our experience of pleasure and pain happiness and sufferingA welltrained mind can deal with any situation in life and not have to suffer at allWhat does it mean to train the mindIt means to look at what youre doing and to see what the results areThen you learn to refrain from things that cause suffering no matter how much you like doing them and to do the things that lead to true happiness whether you like doing them or notSome of the things that lead to true happiness are really pleasant to doOthers require effortThey go against the grainYou have to learn not to let your resistance to the effort get in the wayYou need a clear sense of cause and effectThats what discernment is all about seeing what really works in terms of cause and effect what doesnt really work and then adjusting your actions accordinglyWere here to train the mind to be its own best friendOne very visceral way of doing this is to focus on your breathWhen the Buddha analyzes the way you cause yourself suffering very early on in the list he says that if youre ignorant of whats really going to work then even the way you breathe can lead to sufferingSo lets focus on the way we breatheWhere do you sense the breath right nowWhen you close your eyes what sensations let you know that now the breath is coming in now the breath is going outFocus on themThey can be in any part of the body at all for breath here means the flow of energySometimes youll sense the breath as the feeling of the air moving in and out of the nose but it can also be the rise and fall of the abdomen the rise and fall of the chestSometimes those movements send ripples out to different parts of the body so that you can sense even in your arms or your legs whether youre breathing in or breathing outSo wherever you find it convenient to focus focus on the breath sensations thereThen allow them to be comfortableIn other words dont put too much pressure on them as you focus on themAt the same time notice how long an inbreath feels goodAt what point does the inbreath start feeling uncomfortableJust breathe in as long as is comfortable and then allow yourself to breathe outBreathe out only as long as is comfortable and then breathe back in againTry to sensitize yourself to what feels good right now in terms of the breathingThink of the whole body breathing in the whole body breathing out with every cell in your body bathed with breath energyWhen you think of the breath in that way what kind of breathing feels goodYou might find as you start thinking in that way that the breath gets deeperIf that feels gratifying fineIf it feels uncomfortable change the rhythmJust think What would be more comfortable right now and see what the body does in responseThink of yourself as hovering around the breathYoure not squeezing it out youre not forcing it in youre just staying very close to it watching it letting it adjust in whatever way feels goodGive it some space to adjustSometimes you might want to nudge it a little bit and see what longer breathing would feel like or what shorter breathing would feel like faster slower deeper more shallow and then notice what happensAt first you may not sense much difference but after a while you begin to get more sensitive to the breathing processYou become more of a connoisseur of your own breathingYou gain a sense of what kind of breathing really feels good for the body right nowThe more satisfying the breath is the easier you will find it to stay with the breathingIf the mind wanders off just bring it right back to the breathIf it wanders off again bring it back againAsk yourself Is the breath as comfortable as it could be and see what you need to changeBut dont browbeat yourself over the fact that the mind is wanderingDont get upset or discouragedIts natural that itll wander for thats what its been doing for so longYouve probably heard the word samsaraIt means wandering aroundThats what the mind is used to doingIts used to wanderingWhen you try to get it to stay in one place like this its going to resistIts like training a puppyYou want it to come and it seems to want to do everything else but comeBut if youre firm with it at the same time rewarding it when it does come after a while itll come willinglySo have some confidence in yourselfRemind yourself that this is a really useful skill to have because we cause ourselves so much unnecessary stress and strain simply because we breathe in unskillful and oblivious waysIf you can master just this one skill you change the way you relate to your body you change the way you relate to the present moment you have a greater reserve of wellbeing to draw on in any situationIf they threw you in prison you could just sit there and breathe really comfortablyThey wouldnt have to knowSo in that way youre not adding suffering to the pain already thereSo you have an hour to get acquainted with the breath to try to see what kind of breathing feels good right now and then right now right nowThe needs of the body will change over time so you have to be on top of themNotice how they changeMake it a gameDont be too grim about the meditationAfter all were here trying to find pleasure in the breathSo treat it as a sport something you want to learn how to enjoyAs with any sport it takes time it takes training it takes disciplineBut theres also the element of enjoyment that comes when youre doing it wellIt feels goodIt feels rightAfter all the breath is the process in the body that you experience most directlyYou sense your body through the movement of the breathIf the breath were not moving of course youd be deadBut if you could somehow be alive while the breath was not moving even then you wouldnt sense the body at allIn fact there are stages of concentration where the breath energy stopsThe oxygen coming in through the pores of the skin is enough to keep you going because the brain is very still and isnt using much oxygen at that timeWhen that happens you find that the shape of the body begins to dissolveThe breath is that essential to how you know your bodyIn addition the breath is also instrumental in how you move your body by means of the breath energy running through the nerves and along the blood vesselsSo here you are sensitizing yourself to your most direct experience of the body and youre learning to relate to the body in a way thats comfortableAt the same time you find that the breath is a mirror for the mindA sudden emotion comes into the mind and the breath will changeThats one of the reasons we sometimes feel that weve got to get our anger out of our system The way the breath has changed in response to the anger is uncomfortableSo you can undo that effectAs soon as you sense a change in the breath you can consciously breathe in a way that dissolves away whatever tension has built up in the breathingThat weakens the power of the angerThis is another way the breath can be your friendIts like having a friend who reminds you when you get angry that its not in your best interest to be angryIt can soothe you when youre angry put you in a better moodIt can be your friend when youre sick it can be your friend when youre suffering from fear or any other strong unpleasant emotionThe breath can be there as your friend but only if you learn how to befriend itGet to know itAs with any friendship it takes timeYou cant just walk in and shake hands and say Hi youre my breath Im in charge of you lets go The breath doesnt respond well to that just as a person wouldnt respond well to some stranger coming up and saying thatAfter all youve been a stranger to your breath for who knows how longIt has been there for you but you havent been there for itYou havent paid it much attentionYou dont really know it wellSo heres your opportunity to get on good terms with the breathWhen you have your breath as your friend you have a friend wherever you go in any situationAs the Buddha said to really get to know someone requires time and being very observantSoHere youve got a whole hour of timeIts up to you to be observant and to see how well you can get to know the breathTo show some goodwill for the breath in a very direct and visceral way like this is to show goodwill for yourself the wish thats expressed in that chant May I be happy Heres one way to act on itAt the same time you cause no harm to anyone elseThe way you breathe doesnt directly affect anyone else at allIndirectly if you breathe in unskillful ways and uncomfortable ways youre going to get irritable and take it out on other peopleBut if youre breathing comfortably theres no irritation to take out on anybody at allIn this way the fact that youre working with your breath is a way of showing goodwill for other people tooSo try to make the most of this opportunityAs youre sitting here there are a lot of things you could focus on in the present momentYou could focus on the sound of the cricketsYou could focus on the sound of the bombing practice off to the west the temperature of the air  all kinds of thingsThe question is Which thing are you going to focus on thats going to deliver the best results for the mindThis is where the breath comes inIts something thats here all the time  coming in going out staying still  giving us our sense of the bodyIts a place where we can settle down something we can stay in touch with at all times  if were mindfulIts important to understand what mindfulness is Its the act of keeping something in mindThe word sati is related to the verb sarati which means to rememberYou focus your attention on one particular thing and then keep reminding yourself to stay thereThis is how concentration is developedBut concentration is not just a question of memoryTo be a part of the path it has to be alert as wellWere not trying to put ourselves into a tranceWe simply want to stay focused on an aspect of the present moment thats going to be helpfulMindfulness is what reminds us to stay at that present sensation or present occurrence alertness is what allows us to see whats going onThe third quality we add is persistence or ardencyKeep with itNo matter how loud the bombs or incessant the crickets youre not going to send your attention after themYou know theyre thereYoure not going to deny that theyre there but theyre simply not places you want to goYoure going to keep tabs on this one thing the breath coming in going outIf you prefer a meditation word you can stay with buddhoIf you want you can focus on the parts of the body like the bones skin your liver  anything that keeps you grounded here in the present moment in a way that helps mindfulness and alertness to grow to developYour ability to stick with these qualities is whats going to help them growWhen you notice yourself wandering off ardency means that you bring the mind right backIf it wanders off again bring it back againYou dont give upYou dont get discouragedWhile youre with the breath ardency means that you try to be as sensitive as possible to the sensation of the breathingThe more consistent your sensitivity the more refined the sense of comfort youll derive from the breathingAs Ajaan Lee says when youre mindful and alert like this mindfulness and alertness change into the factors of jhana or steady absorptionWe often hear that mindfulness practice and concentration practice are two different things but the Buddha never taught them that wayHe said that right mindfulness leads naturally to right concentrationIn all of the descriptions of the path  such as the noble eightfold path the five faculties the seven factors for awakening  right mindfulness always precedes right concentrationSo dont think of them as separate practices think of them as qualities of the mind that help each other alongMindfulness turns into directed thought as it shades into the steadiness of concentrationOnce concentration gets more solid your mindfulness gets a lot steadierWhen you reach the fourth jhana the Buddha says thats where mindfulness becomes pureThe word jhana is related to a verb jhayati which is a homonym for a verb to burn  to burn in a steady way like the flame of this candle at the front of the roomPali has different verbs for the word to burnTheres the burning of an ordinary fire that flickers and flares but then theres jhayati which describes the burning of an oil lamp  steady so steady you can read by itAnd thats the whole purpose of getting the mind to stay steadily here in the present moment so that you can read whats going on in the mindIn the beginning the steadiness requires some protection just like the candle hereIf the wind outside started to flare up more than it is right now wed have to put a glass globe around the candle to keep the flame steadyThat glass globe is directed thought and evaluationKeep reminding yourself to come back  stay with the breath stay with the breath stay with the breath  consistentlyAnd then evaluation which grows out of alertness looks at the breath Is this a comfortable place to stayWhat do you need to adjustDo you need to move the focus of your attentionDo you need to adjust the breathDo you need to adjust some of the concepts in your mind about what youre doingIf the breath is too subtle to follow can you stay simply with the sense of the body sitting hereThere are lots of things to evaluateThis is where the element of discernment or insight comes into the practiceAgain we often hear that jhana practice is a tranquility practice and insight practice is something else but again the Buddha didnt divide things up that wayHe said that you need tranquility and insight in order to get the mind to become steady like thisThe insight lies in understanding what problems you have to face and how you can get around them the tranquility lies in the element of steadily calmly watching thingsSo you use directed thought and evaluation to protect what youve gotAs a sense of ease and fullness develops in the present moment youve got to protect it even moreStick with it work at whatever you need to do to maintain that sense of wellbeing  learning when youre trying too hard to make it better learning when youre not trying hard enough to notice what can be done to relax things even further make them even more gratifying and pleasurableThats all a function of insight watching things evaluating things figuring out which causes to change to make the effects just rightThis is the element of insight the element of discernment that were working on while were on the pathWe develop it in simple practices like this learning whats just right in terms of the breathThats the middleness of our middle way right nowThe word middleness also applies to the appropriateness of what were doingSometimes we have to be very protective of what were doing when there are lots of external distractions or when the mind itself seems to be rambunctious and hard to controlWe have to make an extra effort during times like thatAt other times the effort doesnt have to be quite so strong All you need to do is just watch keep tabs on things and they seem to behave on their ownIf you mess with them too much theyre going to rebel so you have to be very sensitive to whats needed whats going onThis is part of the middleness of the middle way the appropriateness of what youre doingAs you develop this sense of appropriateness this sense of just right youre developing discernment in the midst of concentration practiceThe Buddha said theres no discernment without jhana no jhana without discernmentThe two qualities help each other alongSo if you find yourself slipping off the breath slipping off the topic of your meditation remember these thingsWhen things get balanced you dont have to think about them that muchOnce you develop a sense of balance you just maintain that balance in your practiceItll be subverbalIts like sailing a boatWhen you get on the boat for your first sailing lessons and youre told to steer the boat to the left sometimes you flip it over because you steer too hardOr youre told to steer to the right and again you flip it over in the other direction because youre steering too hardBut after a while you begin to get a sense of exactly how much pressure you have to apply to the rudder and you get so that you hardly even think about itIt becomes an intuitive senseYoure alert to it  you have to be alert  but you dont have to verbalize itThis is what were working toward in the practice gaining that intuitive sense of whats just right for right now  when you have to apply a little bit more pressure when you have to hold back a little bit  so that you dont need all these conceptsAs the meditation gets more and more intuitive as the mind gets more and more firmly settled right here you can actually drop the directed thought and evaluation and just plow right into the sensation of the breath or whatever your object isWhen you get there you begin to wonder Why did you ever think you had to do anything more in the meditation than just be right here Thats what it seems like from that perspectiveSo watch out that you dont get complacent because you can lose thisIts simply a matter of having that intuitive sense of where your spot is and how to stay thereThis is how to develop a foundation for the mind You use mindfulness and alertness you use your discernment to get the mind concentrated and then once its concentrated you use that concentration to discern things even more clearlyAll the factors of the path help one another and they all come togetherTheres a unity to the pathEven though it has eight folds its one piece of paperSo if these thoughts are helpful when you find yourself drifting off or losing balance keep them in mindThere will come a point where you dont have to consciously remember themAll youll have to do is be very watchful very alert making sure youre not complacent and you can drop the conceptsDropping them doesnt mean youll forget themTheyll be there to pick up again when you need them but you dont have to carry them around all the timeTheyre like a magic set of tools They float right within reachYou dont have to carry themOr like your shadow It goes everywhere you go but you dont have to carry it with youIt places no weight on you at allI once heard of a tennis pro whose game had gone into a slumpHe tried everything he could imagine to get his game back fired his trainer got another trainer tried different racketsThen one day he realized hed forgotten the number one lesson in tennis Keep your eye on the ballThe same sort of thing often happens in meditationYou start out with a very simple process and then it gradually grows more complicatedAfter a while you forget the first principles ie stay with your breathSo try to spend the whole hour staying with the breath no matter whatBe really sensitive to how the breath feels and to what youre doing to the breathThe breath is a fabrication which means that theres an intentional element in the way you breatheYou want to be very sensitive to that to what youre adding to the breathing processTry to do it skillfullyAs long as youre going to add an intentional element add something goodYour relation to the breath is something very intimate very privateOften its hard to talk about how the breath feels because the breath feels like the breath feelsIt doesnt quite feel like anything elseSo we talk about it indirectly in terms of metaphors and similes realizing that our descriptions are approximateWhen you hear something in the instructions learn to translate it in such a way that it relates to whats happening in your direct experienceAnd keep your inner experience primaryFor example Ive noticed that one of the best ways of getting the breath energy in the body to be comfortable and full is not to put any effort into the outbreath at allWhat effort there may be goes into the inbreathAs for breathing out you dont need to help the bodyIts going to breathe out on its ownWhen you dont force it out that allows the breath energy to fill up in the bodyThis is hard to put precisely into wordsIts not like youre trying to stuff the breath in but because you dont squeeze it out then each time you breathe in breathe in breathe in and allow the sense of fullness to run along your nerves the nerves begin to glowAgain this doesnt fit easily into words for its not a visible glowBut theres a feeling of glowlike energy filling the nerves radiating out from them radiating out of the blood vesselsYou try to breathe in such a way that maintains that sense of radianceThe body then feels a lot more comfortable the blood can flow freely through all the different parts of the bodyIt feels really goodSo try to relate that to what youre doing right now and see if you get resultsIf you dont try experimenting a little bit on your own to see which way of breathing really does feel good in the bodyWhen you do this it sets up the issue of pleasure and pain cause and effect right from the startThats what the Buddhas teachings are all about Why do we suffer from painHow can we use the pleasure of a concentrated mind to lead us to even greater ease and wellbeingOften its best not to analyze the issue too much in advanceYou can read the books on jhana or vipassana and then try to impose the words on your experienceAnd of course your understanding of the words comes from whereIt comes from ignoranceSo that takes you away from your direct experience away from this very private matter of why the mind is causing itself suffering how your intentions are causing sufferingSo instead try to approach the meditation from a standpoint thats more familiar How do you feel right nowWhich ways of thinking about the breath which ways of letting the body breathe lead to pain and a sense of constrictionWhich ones lead to a greater sense of openness and easeStart from your immediate experience and branch out from thereThats the way Ajaan Fuang used to teach meditationHed have people get in touch with their breathHed use a few analogies and similes and then hed listen to the words they used to describe their own experience of meditation when the breath felt sticky when it felt solid or dense when it felt full And then hed use their vocabulary to teach them furtherFor instance one of his students would talk about the delicious breath so Ajaan Fuang would start his instructions to that student by saying Get in touch with the delicious breathIn this way the meditation is not something imposed from outsideIts something that develops from your own inner sensitivityThen somewhat after the fact after youve had some direct experience with it you can read the books and begin to relate their terms to what youve experiencedEven then though its always best to take those terms and use them as postit notes for as you develop your inner experience further your understanding of the inner terrain is going to changeYou may have to move some of those notes aroundThis is a much more trustworthy way of approaching the meditation than trying to fit the mind into a mold based on your understanding of what somebody else has written or saidIf you do that it takes you away from your direct experience from your own sensitivityAnd theres always that element of doubt Does this really qualify as what theyre talking aboutWhereas if you approach it from the other direction  If I do it this way how does it feel  you know better than anybody else how it feelsNow your sensitivity may not be refined enough to see subtle levels of stress but theres no way youre going to see those subtle levels until you deal with the blatant ones firstAnd its a natural matter that over time as you get more familiar with the breath more familiar with the way the body feels from the inside your powers of sensitivity are going to developYou pick up things that you didnt notice before both in the breath and in the way the mind relates to the breathThis way you keep the meditation very directIts your own private matterAjaan Fuang once said that he didnt want his students discussing their meditation with anybody else aside from himWhen you talk to other people they have their ideas they have their preconceived notionsMaybe they know something about meditation maybe theyre very wise but that in itself is a questionable thingYou dont know how experienced they are how much they really knowSecondly you may start taking their words and trying to fit them on your own experienceIf you dont have enough inner experience its very easy to get messed upEven when they simply ask you a question the way they frame the question already embodies a certain viewpointAnd that viewpoint may be questionableSo keep your meditation a private affairAfter all the suffering youre causing yourself is a private affair something nobody else can seeEven when we live together day in and day out each of us is making a lot of decisions that nobody else here will knowWe may see some of the outside effects but the actual experience of suffering  your suffering your pain Youre the only person who can feel itAnd youre the only person who can know which little decisions you make from moment to moment to momentThats what you want to learn how to observeSo try to develop your inner sensitivity as much as you can so that you can make sure your decisions are going in the right directionThe intentional element here is to try to minimize suffering as much as possibleThis is why breath meditation relates directly to the sublime attitudes we chant every eveningThis is your front row seat on the question of how to bring about more happinessMay all living beings be happy All living beings are out there but youre one of them too in hereThis is the being you have the most direct impact onSo if you learn how to be kind to yourself in the way you breathe its going to be easier to be kind to other peopleIf you see that theres some stress and suffering inside have some compassion for yourselfTry to breathe in a way try to relate to the breath in a way that minimizes that stressWhen you learn compassion for yourself inside like this its a lot easier to feel compassion for others outsideThe same with empathetic joy and equanimity When the breath is going well appreciate itEnjoy itAs for the uncomfortable things in the breath that you cant change youve just got to watch them for a whileThe word for equanimity  upekkha  actually relates to that quality of just watching looking onIn other words you see that this may not yet be the time to do anything but you never know when the situation will change so you just keep watching watching watching until you detect thingsAnd even here the breath helps a lotIt gives you a foundation from which to watchAs youre staying with the breath youre in the present momentSimply being with the sensation of breathing helps pull you out of a lot of your thoughts that ongoing committee discussion in the mindIf youre with the breath youre like an outside observer on the committee meetingYoure not necessarily pushed around by the voices in the committeeIn that way youre in a better position to see Is this the time to exercise goodwillOr is it more the time to exercise equanimity compassion or empathetic joySo these two types of meditation  the meditation that develops the sublime attitudes and the meditation on the breath  really come together like thisThe breath gives you practice in the proper attitudes and puts you in a position where you can see which of these four attitudes is appropriate at any one time always taking your inner experience of stress  something youre most intimately related to  as your touchstoneThat way your knowledge is not just wordsTheres a direct experience underlying it allAs your skill is being developed youre growing more sensitive to what that experience is and more honest with yourself about where youre still causing yourself stressYour experience of stress is your only proof of whether the meditation is working and even then its reliable only if youre honest with yourselfYou may want to look for an outside authority to verify things for you but that leads to the question of who out there is awakened who is notYou may have some ideas you may have some intuitions but you cant really prove anything about whats going on outsideYour only real proof is what lies insideAnd until you make the inner proof as clear and as honest as possible youll have no proof about anything at allSo this inner sensitivity something totally private to you is what youre trying to develop hereThats where you start thats what helps keep you on the pathAnd of course this sensitivity doesnt necessarily have to be here only while youre sitting and meditatingTry to keep in touch throughout the day with your inner experience of what youre doing and what stress is or is not arising as a result of what youre doing the little choices you make insideTry to carry that awareness around as much as you can in all your activitiesMake that your first priorityWhen you act act from that pointWhen you speak speak from that pointWhen you think think from that pointIn that way the meditation becomes timelessAjaan Fuang once made the comment that our lives are often chopped up into little times time to eat time to talk time to go here go there do this do thatInstead of having more time when life has more times like this everything gets chopped up into little tiny pieces and becomes lessBut when you make this inner sensitivity as continuous as possible  you breathe in let the body breathe out if it wants to but you dont have to force the breath out breathe in again breathe in again  that inner sense of wellbeing can growThen as you carry it through the day it becomes solidIt may take time to focus on it time to get a sense of what helps it what doesnt help itBut the sense of inner refreshment that comes You want that to be as continuous as possibleThe more continuous it is the more strength it developsThe more resilient it becomes the more you can rely on it even in very difficult situationsThis involves unlearning some old habitsSociety often teaches us to give all our attention to things outsideWhat happens of course is that we lose touch with our own inner sensitivityWe become strangers to ourselvesSo reintroduce yourself to this inner sensitivityOpen up this area of your awareness and be as sensitive to it as possibleIn that way the meditation will grow in an organic way  not from words imposed outside or ideas imposed from how you understand the words outside but from a direct experience of whats actually going on insideWhat works and what doesnt work whats skillful whats not where theres stress where there is no stress These are the questions that only you can observe and only you can knowAnd they can be answered only by a very honest sensitivity thats always willing to learn moreAjaan Lee sometimes talks about not being aware of the breath in the whole bodyHe sometimes recommends focusing on one spot and just staying right thereSome people he says find it too distracting to deal with the breath sensations in the different parts of the bodyAs youre thinking about your hand your arm or your leg other thoughts related to hands arms and legs might sneak in and carry you off someplace elseHe compares this to starting an orchardIf you plant your whole orchard all at once using all your resources you may find that youve overextended yourselfYoure faced with a drought for several days the trees all die and you end up with nothingIn cases like that its smarter to start out with one little area and to focus on planting just that caring for thatSay you plant a mango treeYou care for it for a couple years and then when they give their first crop of mangoes you collect the seeds and plant themThe same with the second cropThat way you gradually enlarge your orchard until you fill your whole plot of landSo if you find that focusing on the breath here and there in the beginning of the meditation gets you distracted just focus down on one spot and stay right thereTell yourself Youre not going anywhere elseYou may want to use the word buddho to help keep things under controlBut just use one spot in the body It might be right between your eyes the middle of the forehead wherever you feel is closest to the center of your awareness in the bodyYou stare right down right thereThe one warning is that you not tighten up around that spotThink of the area as being open and free flowingIn other words the blood can flow in the blood can flow outEnergy flows in energy flows out but you are not movingYoure going to stay right hereNo matter what happens youre going to stay right in this one little spotThat can gather the mind together and keep it thereYoure not trying to take care of too many things at onceOther people find that one spot is not enoughIn that case you might want to try two spotsThere was an old schoolteacher I knew who had come to meditation late in lifeAfter she retired she went to stay at Wat AsokaramShe found that the easiest way to get her mind down  she told me once well before I was ordained  was to focus on two spots one right between the eyes the other at the base of the spineShed try to keep both spots going at onceIn her case she said it was like connecting the two poles of a batteryAs soon as the two poles were connected things lit up insideThat enabled her to get the mind into concentration really quicklyWhat all this shows is that concentration is an individual matterDifferent people find that their minds settle down in different waysAnd theres room in the practice of concentration for you to experiment and see what works for youTheres no one ideal method thats going to suit everybody and the whole purpose of the concentration is for the mind to settle down with something it likes something it finds interestingThe iddhipada or bases for success basically say that concentration will succeed by stressing one of four different qualitiesFor some people its fired by desireFor others persistence the energy of sticktoitividnessOther people find that concentration works best when its based on the quality of intent when you dive in and give it your entire attentionOther people find that analysis worksIts by analyzing the breath by making it interesting  and finding that it really is interesting the way the breath energy flows in the body how it can be very different from what you might expect by playing with it by experimenting with it  that you find yourself absorbed in the presentNot because youre forcing yourself to be there but simply because you get interested just as you can get absorbed say in painting a pictureAs a child I used to find that drawing would have me absorbed for hoursId be working on a drawing and Id have no sense of the passage of timeItd be time for dinner before I knew itAnd the same can work in your meditation as you learn to analyze the breathYou pull yourself into the present moment not with any force but simply through the power of your curiositySome people though find that analyzing things like this gets them distracted You start thinking about the breath and then you start thinking about your stomach and then about the doctor who looked after your stomach and all of a sudden you find yourself thirty miles awayIn that case your meditation may succeed based either on the desire to stay here or the effort to stay focused on just one spot or being intent on one spot or on two spots whatever you find worksSo theres room for experimentation theres room for you to learn what works for youKeep this in mind as you practiceSometimes youve got to use your ingenuityAs Ajaan Fuang once noted all the elements in really wellbalanced concentration are there in the seven steps in Ajaan Lees instructionsThe problem is simply that different people will find different steps to be the ones that really pull them inOnce theyve been pulled in by one of the steps theyve got to balance out the other onesAjaan Lee talks about finding your one spot in the body and staying focused there but some people miss this step because it comes after the steps that tell you to explore the breath throughout the bodyBut the steps dont have to be done in sequential orderThink of them as different component factors of concentrationYou may have to start out with just the one spotOnce thats established you can develop the other componentsIn other words you stay focused in your one spot and then see how its related to the area right around itThen radiating out from there you look at the areas right around that until youve got the whole body in your frame of awareness even though youre still really staring down on the one spotYou cant help but be aware of the bodyIn other words you dont totally blank out the rest of the bodyAfter all the purpose of concentration is to be aware all around as a basis for discernmentDiscernment can arise only when youre aware all aroundIf your concentration is the sort that blocks things out its not going to be a good basis for discernmentYou wont see unexpected connectionsYoull have huge blind spots in your range of awareness where all kinds of things can hideSo one way to start is to go right for one spot and then gradually expand from thereBut if you find that too confining if the mind rebels against being forced into one spot you can have it range around your bodyNotice how the breath feels in the toes how it feels in the fingers how it feels in the arms and the back how your posture effects the breath how your breath effects the postureIn other words use the meditation as an opportunity to exploreThis is one of the good things about the breath as a focal point for meditationYou can use it both as an object to stare at and as an object to analyzeIf you find that the mind needs more tranquility before its going to get anywhere okay you can just settle down and be very very stillIts almost like youre not even watching the breathYoure more focused on the direction in which your awareness is beamedYoure preoccupied with just keeping the beam steadyThe one danger you have to watch out for there of course is that you might clamp down on the blood circulation in that spotSo watch out for thatAllow things to come in and go out but you stay at that one spot as consistently as possibleBut as for the connections you can see when you use the breath as an object for discernment theyre infiniteWe were talking earlier this morning about name and form and how they play a role in the arising of sufferingWell they also play a role in the path leading to the end of sufferingYouve got form which is the form of the body the four great elements and the breath is the most prominent elementYouve got perception whatever perceptions you have of the breath whatever ways you have of conceiving the breathThats an effective way of getting the mind to settle down simply by holding that perception in mindYou pay attention which is another element of formYouve got the intention to stayAnd then youve got the feeling that arises when you try to create a feeling of easeIn other words instead of allowing these things to happen willynilly you try to bring as much awareness and clarity to how they function in bringing the mind to stillnessSo these elements  which if left to their own devices based on ignorance would lead to suffering Youre now playing with them all the while being very aware of how they interactThis is one of the best ways of learning their interactions by playing with themYou adjust your attention or your intention and see what happens to the feelingYou change your perception and see what effect it has on the mindWhat were doing is to take the basic causes of suffering and to bring as much awareness to them as possible  specifically awareness in the form of the four noble truths Where is there stress what are you doing thats causing stress and what can you change to make the stress go awayYou start with blatant levels of stress related to how youre sitting here breathing trying to get the mind to settle downAnd then from there you grow sensitive to levels that are more and more subtleYoure here right where all the action isIts simply a matter for you individually to figure out exactly where you can get your first handle on these issuesEstablish that as your beachhead and then from there your understanding will begin to spread outThere will come times in the meditation when you begin to think that just being very still right here is kind of stupidNothing is going to happenAnd you wonder what else is there to do nextWell ask yourself Who says that its stupidWhy do you need to push the whats nextThose are perceptions right thereRight there youve got some issues you can work throughEverything you need to know for the purpose of putting an end to suffering is right hereJust bring a lot of alertness to itA lot of mindfulness to itAnd notice what works for you in getting the mind to settle downThats how insight arises by seeing what worksThats the way the Buddha tested all of his insights Did they workIn other words he was looking for pragmatic truth the knowledge that would make a differenceAs for truths that wouldnt make a difference he just put them asideHe was very singleminded in his questWhatever was necessary for putting an end to suffering he focused on thatWhatever wasnt necessary he might know it but he didnt let it clutter up his mindAs he said in describing his Awakening he learned the equivalent of the leaves of the forestWhat he brought out to teach  in terms of focusing on the issue of suffering its cause its end and the path to its end Thats just like a handful of leavesBut its precisely the handful you needIf you were to make a comparison with medicine there can be lots of medicine in the forest but just this one handful is what you need for your specific diseaseAs for the other leaves if theyre not helpful for your disease why bother with them right nowThe mind has this disease of ignorance craving greed anger and delusionAnd if we dont take care of it its going to fester going to cause a lot of suffering for a long time to comeSo focus on the leaves that will cure itAs for the other leaves in the forest you can pay attention to them after youve got this specific disease curedSo everything you need to know is right hereIts simply a matter of paying attentionSee which perceptions work which perceptions dont work which ways of paying attention work and which ones dont which intentions work and which dontJust by exploring these issues you can learn an awful lot about the mind  and make a big change in the mind as wellOnce soon after I had first met Ajaan Fuang I had a dreamIn the dream I was visiting Ajaan Lees monasteryI had never been there but in the dream they had a big museum several stories highI had the choice to climb the stairway or to climb a ladder up on the side of the building going straight to the top floor and I chose the ladderI wanted to go straight up to the topBut as I was climbing the ladder fell downFortunately I was caughtThe problem was that the ladder wasnt leaning against anything solidAt the end of the dream I found myself at the door again having to contemplate going up the stairwayThats when I woke upAnd thats pretty much a story of how my practice started A lot of things happened very quickly those first couple of weeks with Ajaan Fuang but then they all unraveled and I had to start back at the beginning step by step by stepThis can sometimes be discouragingIt happens to all meditatorsSometimes by fluke we happen to hit something very advanced  or at least it seems to be very advanced  in the meditation and then it all unravels right before our eyesAt first it can be encouraging but ultimately it turns discouraging as we see the defilements were still living with in our minds  that those quick flashy experiences didnt actually make much of an impactThe followup work seems a lot less glamorous and a lot of people give up right thereBut its important that you dont give up and that you dont look down on the situation where you areDont get discouraged because wherever you go those are the issues you have to deal with thats the situation you have to addressIf you dont deal with it now you have to come back to that same situation all over again and sometimes it gets worseSo the proper attitude is that whatever issues arise in the meditation those are the ones you have to deal withDont compare them with where youve been before in the meditation or with the issues youd like to be dealing with now or where you want the meditation to goMost of us would like to be magically beamed up to a higher level of concentration or a higher level of insightBut its often the case that our refusal to look at the situation in our minds right now is whats preventing concentration and insight from arisingSo look at what youve gotLook at where you areDont pass judgment as to whether the problem youre facing is elementary or advancedIts the problem youre facingIts the problem that has to be dealt withBring all your powers of attention to bear right thereAnd be glad that youve got the opportunity to practiceDont view it as drudgeryA lot of people are in situations where they have no inclination have no idea what the practice is aboutOr they may have an idea and the inclination but they dont have the opportunityHere we have the opportunityWeve got the inclinationWe have some idea of what the problem is all aboutThese opportunities are rare to findSo the teaching on acceptance means accepting where you areIt doesnt mean that you accept that youre going to stay there foreverYou simply accept that this is the situation youre facing right nowWhether its something you like or not whether you find yourself attracted to it or not thats not the issueThe issue is Are you willing to work with what youve gotThat willingness is an important element in all levels of practiceIt starts with our willingness to help other people and goes on with our willingness to practice the preceptsThis volunteer spirit is an important part of training the mindThats what its all about realizing that youve got to put energy into it if youre going to get anything out of itWhen youre willing to take that first step make that first gift of your energy thats where the practice starts to growWithout that attitude it doesnt go anywhereAll we can think of is what wed like to get out of the meditation but before you can get anything you have to giveAs for generosity sometimes people look at what theyve got and theyd like to be able to give much moreTheyd like to make a more impressive offering but their means are limitedSo they have to content themselves with giving limited gifts to begin with but the momentum builds on thatSometimes the little gifts bring the greatest rewardAjaan Fuang liked to tell the story of a man and his wife who had only one upper cloth between themThey each had a cloth to cover the lower parts of their bodies but only one cloth between them to cover the upper parts of their bodiesThat was back in the days in India when you didnt go out of your house unless you had two pieces of cloth around you one wrapped around your waist the other over your shouldersBecause they only had one upper cloth between them theyd have to leave the house at separate timesIf one was going out the other had to stay at homeThey were that poorOne night they heard that the Buddha was going to be giving a talk so they agreed that the husband should be the one to goThe talk was basically on the rewards of generosityThe husband kept sitting there thinking This is why Im so poorI havent been generousWhat have I got to giveNothingAll I have is this one cloth and if I give this I wont be able to go anywhereBut if I dont give this what can I giveI wont be able to give anything at all So he battled back and forth back and forth back and forth in his mind for hours and the Buddha noting what was going on just kept on talking and talking on generosityIt was originally supposed to be a short Dhamma talk but it went on and on and on until midnightThe king was in the audience lots of people were in the audience and they were wondering why the Dhamma talk was going on for so longFinally around midnight the man stood up shouting VictoryVictory He had overcome his stinginessHe was going to give the cloth to the Buddha so he went down and gave the clothPeople in the audience wondered who this was and why he was shouting Victory When they learned of his poverty they were very impressedThe king said Okay Ill give him another cloth and other things in addition  a cloth and a horse and an elephant all kinds of stuffOne of eachAnd because the man was on a roll a generosity roll he gave all those things to the Buddha tooSo the king upped the ante  gave him two of eachThe man gave all of thatThe king kept doubling four eight finally sixteenAt that point the man decided to keep eight of each of these things  eight pieces of gold eight pieces of silver eight pieces of cloth eight horses eight elephantsHe gave the other eight to the Buddha and went home with his remaining eightThe lesson of the story is that a small gift by a person of little means translates into a lot more in terms of its rewards than a large gift from someone of large means because the first gift requires more of a sacrificeThe same principle applies in the meditationWhen things arent going well you have to make a sacrifice of your pride a sacrifice of your likes and dislikes and get down to dealing with whats actually happening in the mindOnly when youre able to make that sacrifice can the rewards comeIn the beginning they may not be all that impressiveYou may not get a piece of gold a piece of silver an elephant or whatever but you do make a step you see a slight change in the mindThats much better than just sitting around being discouragedSo whatever the issues youre facing in your meditation be content to deal with them because those are the real issues the genuine issues youve got to faceThey may not stack up against the things youve read about or the things youve experienced in the past but a little solid progress is much more valuable than all the quick and flashy special effects out there in the worldAjaan Fuang sometimes had students who would come to sit and meditate with him for the first time and gain visions of their past lives or of heavenly beingsSome of his older students felt jealous and discouraged by thatHere theyd been sitting and meditating for months with nothing special happening and this person comes in and has all kinds of interesting things going on all at onceIt often happened though that the quick and flashy students didnt last very longWhen the visions stopped when there was no more entertainment they leftIts the steady progress that makes all the difference that turns out to be the winner in the endSo sacrifice whatever attitudes get in the way of looking at the issues staring you right in the face because those are the genuine articleTheyre right hereTheyre not abstractionsWe can sit around and think about Dhamma abstractions from dawn to dusk and dusk to dawn but the problems in the mind arent composed of abstractionsTheyre not composed of memoriesTheyre composed of movements in the mind right nowLook at what the mind is doing how it movesCan you change the way it movesYouve got to poke around in whats actually going on in your mind to see which parts of the present are made of elastic and which parts are made of steel  in other words the things you can change and the things you cantThere will be drudgery and there will be mistakes but these are the things you learn fromThis is the kind of knowledge that really makes a difference in the mind because this is how you develop your sensitivity how you get a sense of how to balance excessive desire with lack of desire how to balance excessive effort with lack of effort and all the other balancing acts that need to be done in the meditationYou learn from falling down and picking yourself up againAnd you do this not by thinking about the ideal of balance but by gaining an intuitive feel for it by poking at this poking at that leaning this way leaning thatWhatever the attitude thats coming up in the mind  the discouragement the frustration the irritation whatever  you poke at itYou dont necessarily have to believe itAnd whatever positive attitudes come up in the mind no matter how small they might seem those are what youve got to work withAfter all redwood trees come from tiny seedsIf you step on them they never have a chance to growBut if you look at them carefully you can recognize them you can see that theyre different from weed seedsThat gives you an idea of what youve got to encourage and what youve got to discourage in the mind what youve got to cultivate and what youve got to cut out uprootSo gardening like this may not be glamorous work and it may not be flashy but this is how all genuine work is done in this worldThis is how things come to blossomYou poke around bit by bit by bit paying careful attention making mistakes and learning from themThats the sort of work that gets solid results results that build on a good solid foundation where you take the stairway and it does ultimately get you up to the top floor  with no danger of crashing downConceit is one of those qualities we all have  and its a slippery friendThere are times when its useful as in that passage where Ananda teaches a nun that we practice to overcome conceit and yet we have to use conceit in the practiceThe example he gives is that when you hear of someone who has put an end to suffering has made it all the way to the goal you can reflect That person is a human being Im a human beingThat person can do it so can I To that extent you need conceit in the practiceIf you believe that you cant do the practice or if it seems way beyond you you end up giving up you set your sights lowAnd as we all know you never hit higher than you aimSo to that extent conceit is helpfulBut it has its fangsAjaan Maha Boowa calls it the fangs of ignorance when you have the conceit that Well this is going to be easy and you get careless complacentAnd conceit has another side as wellThe Buddha talks about comparing yourself to other people thinking that youre better than they are or equal to them or worse than they areAll of these comparisons count as conceitIn other words the idea I am this I am that gets brought into every issue and this is where it grows fangs Im really good at everything therefore Im going to be good at this and you get carelessOr you may think Im not up to thisThis is beyond me and you give upYou make the practice harder than it has to beSo its a fine line realizing where conceit is going to be helpful and where its going to biteFirst theres the issue of confidenceOn the one hand its important to realize that this path youre on is a hard path to follow so you cant go on the complacent assumption that This is going to be easy for me On the other hand you dont want to discourage yourself with the thought Its going to be impossible for me The problem isnt the path or how easy or hard it isIts the me in thereThats the fangsSo try to put that word aside as much as you canRemind yourself simply This is what has to be done Is it going to kill you Well no Then you can do itThats what Ajaan Fuang said to me onceOne evening after a long day of work he told me to sit up all nightThis was very early on in my time with him and I was dumb enough to say I dont think I can do that He looked at me and said Is it going to kill you Well no Then you can do it This didnt mean that it wasnt going to be hardIt was hard but after all this is a hard practiceIt goes against all our inclinationsWe like our greedWe like our anger sometimesWe like our delusions and yet all these things have to be put aside let go of as we practiceBut its within human capability to do thisEven if you do die in the practice its a good way to dieIts better than dying without having accomplished anything or dying doing something really stupidSo try to think in those terms Realize that even though its hard this is part of being a good friend to yourselfOne of the definitions of a good friend is someone who is able to give whats hard to give to do whats hard to do to endure whats hard to endureIf you meet friends like that associate with themValue themTreasure themThese are the people you really want as your friendsAnd you want to be able to make yourself your own best friend in just the same wayAsk yourself Whats hard for you to give and yet something thats actually a burden for you Forgiveness is one thingIts funny how sometimes material things are easy to give but forgiveness which is totally free can be very hardJust go down the list of the people in your life who you find it hard to forgive and try it Forgive themTry not to carry a grudge and youll find that thats a really good gift to give to yourselfDo what is hard to doMeditate longer than you might want toDo walking meditation longer than you might want toPut more effort into the practice than you want to and youll find that you benefitThis ties in with enduring whats hard to endurePain is hard to endureOther peoples dislike is hard to endureWell learn to endure itIts not going to kill youThis doesnt mean that you sit there and grit you teeth through the painLearn to use your wisdomAs Ajaan Chah once said if you could gain Awakening simply by endurance chickens would have attained Awakening a long time ago  they can sit for really long hoursYou have to use your wisdomWhen something seems burdensome why is it burdensomeExactly what is it placing a burden onAnd why do you want to identify with whats being burdenedCan you learn not to identify with itA good way to learn these lessons is to force yourself into situations where youve got to face this difficulty head onOkay its there its a problem and try to use your ingenuity to get around itIts when youre cornered that you realize that youve got to find a way outAnd that you canSo learn to be your own best friendIts not a matter of being pessimistic or optimisticIts a matter of learning to be heedfulHeedfulness involves an interesting combination of qualitiesOn the one hand youre confident that your actions do make a difference so heedfulness is not negative or pessimisticOn the other hand you realize that there are dangers out there dangers inside as wellThere are difficulties youve got to work withYou respect those difficulties but you dont get overwhelmed by themIn other words youve got to drop the element of conceit from your graspDont bring your self into what youre doingDont bring I can do this really easily or I cant do this at all Just put them aside and see what you can doEven if things dont work out well the first time try try try againThis is how people growOne of Ajaan Fuangs terms of criticism was of someone who was good even before hed tried something  in other words the sort of person whos got it all figured out beforehandHe didnt trust people like thatAt the same time though if he found that you were getting very pessimistic about your ability to practice he didnt want you to stay there eitherBeing overly optimistic or overly pessimistic were as far as he was concerned really unskillful ways of approaching the pathTheyre both forms of conceitAdmit that things are difficult but do what you canAnd learn to develop your discernmentWatch out for those fangs of ignorance the I am this or I am that or Im not used to this I cant stand this This is hard for me Drop the I the me and things get a lot easierSo even though it may be hard you can do itThe things that are hard to give you can giveThe things that are hard to do you can doThe things that are hard to endure you discover you can endureIt may not be easy the first timeYou may find yourself running into a brick wall but even brick walls can be battered downThey have their cracksThere are ways around them under them over them through themAll you have to do is find where they areSo learn the proper use of conceit the confidence that yes you can do this other people can do it its something human beings have done  youre a human being you can do it tooOnce youve got that amount of conviction drop the you drop the me the I and then set to workThat right there makes it a lot easierAnd this way you become your own best friendAs you embark on the practice  and as you stay with the practice  its best to think of it as a voyage of discoveryAfter all the Buddha says that the goal is to see what youve never seen before to realize what youve never realized before to attain what youve never attained beforeSo youre going into the unknownThis means that youre going to have to deal with risk and uncertainty which require an interesting mix of attitudesOn the one hand you need a certain amount of confidenceOn the other hand you need humilityThe confidence is confidence in your ability to deal with unknown factors as they ariseThe humility is the realization that you cant expect everything to follow your preconceived notionsThe path is going to stretch your imagination and ask more out of you than you might originally be prepared to giveSo you need the confidence that Yes you can do this and Yes this is a good place to goAnd you need the humility to realize that No you dont know beforehand what its going to be likeYou have to be willing to learnSome people want to have all kinds of guarantees before they embark on this training but you cant really guarantee anythingYou can guarantee that when you reach the goal its going to be good but how much is that guarantee worth for someone who hasnt experienced it yetJust one more thing to take into considerationThe Buddha when he embarked on his quest had no guarantee that all the sacrifice was going to be worth it that he was going to find the deathless or even that he was going to surviveBut he had reached a point in his life where he realized that if he didnt at least try it he would feel that his life had been wastedAnd so for him it was a huge experimentThere was a lot of risk and a lot of uncertaintyAnd yet he was willing to take the risk and to face the uncertaintyFor us its not quite that drasticWe have people whove gone beforeTheres the question of whether we can trust them and believe them but then look at the alternative a life lived devoted to the pursuit of sensual pleasures trying to squeeze happiness out of things that are going to die and that well have to leave in the end  if not before the endSo at the very least you say Well theres a possibility hereLets give it a try Try to have that sense of adventureBe open to new things and learn how to deal with uncertaintiesEarlier today we were talking about the maps for the jhanasWhen you try to apply the map to your actual experience its going to be uncertain for a whileYou read the description of directed thought and evaluation rapture and all and the question is What do those terms correspond to in your actual experienceYou may have some ideas but they may be wrongIs that going to stop you from practicingIt shouldntIt should simply alert you to the fact that youre going to be dealing in uncertainties for a whileWhen you place labels on your experiences they have to be postit notes signposts to use in the meantime until you get a better sense of the terrainThe surest of the signposts is the one for the fourth jhana  when the inandout breath stops and stays stopped for the duration of that state of mind  but thats all the way in the fourthSo how are you going to know the signposts for one two and threeWell you guess for the time being and you attach a few notes here a few notes thereAnd have the confidence that when you find something more certain youre going to be in a position to rearrange the notes if need beThe sense of adventure also means that you may have some anticipations of whats going to work and what things should be like in the practiceBut right anticipation is not part of the pathSometimes your anticipations can push things in the wrong directionThe Buddhas instructions are very precise and pretty simple and part of us doesnt believe anything that simple could really workThere must be some secret there must be some way you can speed the process alongBut sometimes in speeding along you derail yourselfIts like sharpening a knife on a stoneIf youre in too much of a hurry you can ruin the bladeSo you sit there very carefully rubbing it against the stone rubbing it against the stone making sure that the pressure is even all along the bladeThen you realize that you may be at this for a whilePart of the mind says Well Id like to have it done fast so I can go off and do something else But there also has to be another part of the mind that says If you try to speed it up you could ruin itSo keep doing what youre doing Even though the results dont appear as quickly as youd like maybe the slow results are the ones that will be the most lastingSo you have to put your preconceived notions asideDont try to skip over the stepsThe Buddha does teach a sense of urgency but he also teaches patienceAnd you have to learn how to balance the two and be willing to learn new thingsThis evening I was reading a study guide to some of the suttas that raised questions about different passages in the suttas that just didnt sound right to the author or didnt seem to fit in with his preconceived notionsBut theres always the question of whether our notions rather than the passages are wrongTheres a lot going on in the texts maybe more than we realizeThe Buddha was talking to people in a different time with a different range of experiencesSometimes he was talking to people with extremely unusual meditative experiencesIn other words maybe he knew what he was talking about why he had to address that issue in that particular wayMaybe the texts are accurately reporting what he said  even though they dont fit into our preconceived notions of what the texts would be like if they were written for a modern American audienceSo what you are asked as you read the Dhamma  and as you approach the practice as a whole  is to stretch your imagination a bitIts not the case that the Buddha will be able to prove everything to you beforehand  before youre willing to act  so that you can act with confidence and full awareness of where youre going to go and how youre going to get thereYou have to be willing to live with uncertainty and to put question marks against a lot of your assumptionsRemind yourself that your assumptions are the assumptions of a person with defilement the assumptions of a person still sufferingPerhaps it would be in your best interest to put them aside for the time being instead of demanding that everything fit into your preconceived notions of how things should beAnd you should be willing to embark on this without a  guarantee that everything is going work out the way you want it toHave a clear sense of the precariousness of your own position of where you are right nowWhere do you get your sustenanceWhere does the mind gain its pleasuresAre those things solid and secureWhen you go into the uncertainty of the path are you leaving an area of true certainty and assuredness to go off into figments of someones imaginationOr are you leaving the world of your current uncertainties to test some different uncertainties that ultimately promise something more certain than where youre staying right nowThis is why one of the basic principles in the practice is practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma  in other words not in accordance with your preconceived notions not in accordance with your ideas of what you want before youre going to commit yourself to the practiceInstead of reshaping the Dhamma to fit your notions maybe you have to reshape yourself to fit the DhammaThere is bound to be a period of discomfort bound to be a sense of frustration when things are not quite working out the way you wanted them toBut you need the maturity to learn how to deal with thatThis is not a path for immature peopleIts a path for people who know that they are in a very precarious position already and that their ideas and assumptions are especially precariousBut the ideas and presumptions of a materialistic worldview which is what we were brought up in offer a very limited range of happiness whereas the Dhamma offers a lot moreIts simply up to us to decide whether were willing to make the sacrifices and take the risk to see if the more is a reality if what the Buddha had to say is trueOnce the Buddha was extolling the advantages of breath meditation the benefits that could be derived from keeping the breath in mind and one of the monks said I already do breath meditation So the Buddha asked him What kind of breath meditation do you do And the monk replied I sit breathing putting away any desires for the past or future and any irritation in the present moment  ie developing a sense of equanimity for whats arising and passing away right here and nowAnd that was it That was his methodThe Buddha responded Well that is a form of breath meditationI dont say that its not but thats not how you get the most benefit out of the breathSo he proceeded to teach breath meditation in a much fuller wayAnd its important to look carefully at how the Buddha taught breath meditation because you begin to realize how proactive his method wasYou also realize that many of the steps contained in his method are more like questionsHe said Do this but without fully explaining how you might go about doing it which means that you have to test and exploreThe first two steps are exercises for gaining practice in discerning the breath  discerning when its long discerning when its short  to help sensitize you to how the breath feelsWhen you do that you begin to notice which kind of breathing feels bestHe simply mentions long or short but there are other qualities you can look for as well deep or shallow heavy or light fast or slowIn other words you want to get in touch with the physical sensations of the breathWhen you breathe in where do you feel the sensation of breathingWhen you breathe out where do you feel itThe Buddha doesnt say that you have to focus on any particular pointHe simply says Bring mindfulness to the fore In other words be very clear about what youre keeping in mind which is the meaning of mindfulnessTo have a purpose in mind what youre planning to do and then your ability to remember that Thats mindfulnessAs for actually watching whats going on thats called alertnessYou need both qualities but it helps to know which is whichBecause the Buddha doesnt say where in the body you have to focus you can ask yourself when you breathe in where you actually feel itPut aside your preconceived notions of where you should be feeling it Where do you actually feel the breathWhere is it comfortable where is it uncomfortableFrom those steps in learning how to sensitize yourself to the breathing the Buddha then moves on to a whole series of trainings in which you have to learn how to do somethingYou will something to happenThis is where the breath meditation gets more proactiveThe first training  which is the third step  is to learn how to breathe in and out sensitive to the entire bodyIn other words you try to create an expansive state of mindYoure conscious of the breath but youre also trying to be aware of the body as a whole from the top of the head down to the tips of the toesThe question is How do you do thatSome people find it very easy to go straight to the whole bodyOther people have to work gradually up to itOne way of doing that is to go through the body section by section noticing how the different parts of the body feel as you breathe in how they feel as you breathe outAnd to help yourself along you might try making the breath more comfortable wherever you focusFor example as you focus on the back of the neck notice Is there tension thereWhen you breathe in do you build up tension thereWhen you breathe out are you holding on to tensionWhat can you do to relax itThis is actually moving into the fourth step which is to calm whats called bodily fabrication the effect of breath on the sensation of the bodyBut you can combine the two stepsAs you go through the body working up to this full body awareness you can also learn how to calm the breath so that the sensation of breathing feels goodYou begin to realize that the breathing is not just a process that you feel in one or two points in the bodyThe entire body is involved in the breathing process or it can be involved in the breathing processThe more it becomes a wholebody process the more refreshing it feelsThis moves on to steps five and six training yourself to breathe in and out with a sense of refreshment with a sense of ease and pleasureYou build up to these steps as you try to find which rhythm of breathing is best for each part of the body until youre ready to settle down at one spotThen think of your awareness spreading from that spot to fill the whole bodyThen you go back again and follow the strict order of the steps which is once youre aware of the whole body to allow the sensations of the breathing to calm downYou begin to notice that your ideas about the breath will have an effect on how calm it can getYou can perceive the breath in different waysFor instance you can hold in mind the perception that its a wholebody processThink of the breath coming in and out every pore of the skinAnd there is oxygen exchange happening at the skinThe more wide open your pores the more oxygen gets exchangedIf you think of the skin as being wide open the muscles of the rib cage can do less workJust make the mind still and hold that perception in place The breath can come in and go out from any direction through all the parts of your body all the pores of your skinIt all connects on its own without your having to massage it through the bodyYoull notice that there are subtle sensations in the body as you breathe in as you breathe out that correspond to the grosser sensations of the movement of the rib cage the movement of the diaphragmAllow those subtle sensations to blend together in a way that feels harmoniousThink of every part of the body being connected all the energy channels in the body being connected so that the breath energy spreads through them instantly and automatically independently of the inandout breath without your having to do anything to breathe it in or outHere youre using one of the aggregates the aggregate of perception to help calm the breath downAnd you notice that it does also induce a sense of piti which is usually translated as rapture although in some cases its not quite as strong as what we would ordinarily call rapture Its more a sense of refreshmentThe body feels full satisfiedIts as if every little cell in the body is getting to breathe to its hearts content and is not getting squeezed by the other cells in the processA sense of ease will come along with thisOnce the body has been really refreshed in this way things will begin to calm down even furtherThis is where you get sensitive to what the Buddha calls mental fabrication feelings and perceptionsYouve already noticed that changing the perception of how you breathe will have an effect on the breathing process and the feelings that arise from the breathing processIt also has an effect on the mindIt calms things downSo you can continue exploring exactly which perceptions help to calm the mind down even furtherWhat youre doing here is learning both calm and insight at the same timeThe Buddha never treats these two qualities of mind as diametrically opposedHe points out that they can develop separately but ideally they should be working togetherAs you calm things down mindfully you at the same time gain insight into the workings of the mindHere you begin to see on the one hand the impact the breathing can have on the mindThe more soothing the breath becomes the more the mind is willing to settle down in the present and feel soothed by itAt the same time you see the impact of the mind on the breathThe way you perceive the breath is going to change the way the body actually breathesYour mental picture of the breath of the breathing process will have an impact on which parts of the body actually get involved in the breathing processAs things grow more and more calm they lead to a point where you can sit here just looking at awareness  the awareness of the mind itself as its watching the breathThis is an important ability in the meditation learning how to observe the mindIts almost as if there are two minds the mind being observed and the mind doing the observingYou can watch the state of the mind as it stays with the breathThen you begin to notice that sometimes its steady and sometimes its notSometimes it can maintain its concentration sometimes it cantSometimes it feels refreshed and gladdened by doing the meditation other times it feels like the meditation is more of a chore when youre just going through the motionsYou want to learn how to read your mind in this wayOnce you can read it you can then learn to provide it with whatever it needsFor instance how do you gladden the mind when its feeling a little bit down a little bit bored by the processWhat can you do to make it more interestingThe analogy the Buddha gives is of an intelligent cook working in the palace for a princeNow to get to be a cook working for a prince you have to be sensitive to what the prince likesThe prince isnt going to come down to the kitchen and say Hey buddy tomorrow Id like fried chicken or Tomorrow Id like tofu The prince will sit there at his table and hell reach for this food and not reach for that food take a lot of this and take only a little bit of thatSo youve got to notice thatYou have to pick up on the signs the prince is sendingWhether hes sending them consciously or not you want to notice themAnd then when you can read his signs you can anticipate his wants every dayAs King Asoka once said in one of his edicts that if the people who worked for him were going to please him they had to know what he wanted even before he knewYou have to learn how to be that quick at reading your own mindWhat does the mind need right nowWhat is it going to need with the next breathSometimes it gets bored with the breath so you can give it other things to think aboutYou can develop qualities of goodwill compassion empathetic joy or equanimityYou can think about the Buddha the Dhamma the SanghaAll of these are valid topics of meditationTheyre there to inspire the mind to gladden the heartYou can think about the good times youve been generous in the past when you didnt really have to share something but you felt moved to shareOr of the times you could have gotten away with harming somebody or taking something away from them but you didntThink about those timesThey help bring joy to the practiceIn other words like the cook you learn how to read your mind and then provide it with whatever food it needsThe same with the issue of steadying the mind When the mind is feeling kind of wobbly how do you get it fully and firmly fixed here in the present momentYou might want to go back and review some of the steps in the meditation Which ones are you forgettingHave you forgotten to stay with the whole bodyHave you forgotten how to give rise to a sense of rapture refreshmentWell go back and do those thingsOr you might be able to change the way you perceive the breathingThink of the breath going down into your bonesFocus on the breathing sensations in your hands and feetSome people find that focusing on one spot at a time is not enough to keep them really transfixed so give yourself two spotsI knew an old woman in Thailand when I was first getting involved in meditationShe was a retired schoolteacher and she said that one of the quickest ways of getting the mind to settle down and stay really focused in the present moment was to focus on the sensations in the head and the sensations at the base of the spine at the same timeThink of those as two breathing centersAnd you may find that the effort involved in keeping two things going at once  thinking of a line connecting the two to make it a single sensation  really steadies the mind focuses it gets it to settle down and stay stillThe next step the Buddha recommends is learning how to release the mindHere hes not talking about the ultimate release but simply about how you refine your concentrationOne of the important ways of gaining insight while youre in the process of developing concentration is to be able to notice the differences among the various levels of concentration as you go through themSometimes you settle down and youre still sort of hovering around the breath as you try to adjust itOther times you can let yourself simply dive into the breath to be bathed by the breathing without having to analyze much at allWhat youve done is that youve moved from using directed thought and evaluation to help with the concentration to the point where you dont need them anymoreYou can let them goTheres a much greater sense of refreshment that comes a greater sense of fullness as youre one with the breath as opposed to hovering protectively outsideThats one way of releasing the mindThen you can compare which state is more easeful which state has more stressAnd then again you can provide the mind with what it needsOnce youve learned these ways of dealing with the breath the workings of your mind become a lot more transparent just as the breath element in the body becomes more transparentThats when youre ready to take the work of insight even deeper seeing the inconstancy of anything thats intended whether its physical or mental  anything thats fabricated in any way at all whether its a bodily fabrication or a mental fabricationNo matter how easeful and refreshing and stable the mind in concentration may be theres still a slight instability a slight wavering you can detectAnd as the mind develops a sense of dispassion for everything intentional it grows disenchantedIts had enough of thisThats when its really ready to let go  ie it loses interest in fabricating these fabrications and so they stopThats when everything gets relinquished including the pathThis is how you can get great benefit great rewards out of the practice of breath meditationIts not simply a means for calming the mind downThe breath itself becomes a way of understanding the process of fabrication in both body and mindAnd it ultimately allows you to develop a sense of dispassion not because you come into the meditation with a negative attitude but because youve learned how to outgrow the exercises that the Buddha has set out for youIts like a child outgrowing a gameYouve played the game enough so that you know everything the game has to offerYouve mastered all the challenges and are ready for something moreSo the dispassion here is more like the dispassion that happens when you naturally grow up when you matureIts the dispassion that comes when you realize there must be something betterYou sometimes hear that the point of meditation is to learn simply to accept things as they are and not to be too demanding of what you need to be happyThat principle works on an outside level teaching contentment with your external situation but it doesnt work on the inside levelThe Buddha said that he gained Awakening by not resting content with the state of his mindOn the inner level he said to notice what things can provide what level of happiness and to see how far you can push this process of fabricationBecause thats what youre doing as you breathe in this way Youre exploring the potentials for bodily fabrication verbal fabrication and mental fabrication to see how far they can goOnce youve explored their limits you want something betterYou realize that you cant look to fabrication to these acts of intention for true happiness any furtherYouve got to go deeperYouve got to learn how to abandon even these skillful intentionsWhat this means is that you maintain a high standard for what it means to be happyIn fact you heighten your standards for whats going to count as true happiness as you grow in the practiceYou begin to realize that in the past youve been looking in the wrong placeYouve been settling for a crude and unreliable happinessYouve been looking for all your happiness in things that are fabricatedIs it possible for there to be happiness in something totally unfabricated totally unintendedYou look for that  something that lies even beyond the intentions of equanimity the intentions of calm or stillness the intentions of insightYou cant get to that level without having developed these other skills because these are the skills that refine your powers of awarenessTheyre not taking you to a place that you could create which is what youve been doing all along but they are taking you to a dimension you couldnt have found without having created the creationsThe act of creation sensitizes you and as you get more refined in your skill it clears away a lot of the static in your experience of the presentIt sensitizes you to very very subtle thingsIts like tuning in on a radioThe more sensitive your ear the more you can tell whether youre tuned into the radio station very precisely or youre off a little bitIf youre off a little bit theres going to be static interferenceSo you keep tuning in tuning in as your ear gets better and betterYou dont want even the least little bit of staticAnd thats how you get right on targetThis is how the breath leads you all the way to nibbanaOf course the breath doesnt do that itselfBut if you follow the Buddhas steps learning how to master the steps he recommends for you to experiment and explore the breath does become a pathIts a path happening right here all the timeSo try to take advantage of whats right here and see how far you can goWe live in a stormy world a world of constant changeAs in that passage we chanted just now about aging illness death and separation  which when you think about these things only that far gets pretty depressingBut fortunately we dont have to think about these things only that farWe can think a little furtherAs in the other chant May I be happy The Buddha has us respect that wish for true happinessAnd he points out the way to true happiness which is through our own actionsThats the part of the first chant that says Im the owner of my actions heir to my actions This is what we can depend onEven though our actions may change we try to develop a certain amount of constancy in the mindThis is why were practicing concentration focusing on the breath staying with the breath as it comes in staying with the breath as it goes out doing what we can to make it easy to stay with the breathPart of that involves allowing the breath to be comfortable and having the sense that the breath is not just air coming in and out of the lungsWe learn how to perceive the breath as the wholebody energy flowHow do the different parts of the body feel during the inbreathDo you tend to tense up around your neck or in your shouldersCan you breathein in a way that you dont tense upIts all connected  your posture the way you breathe the way the blood flows through the bodyYou can explore these issues as a way of making it easier to stay hereAnother way of making it easier to stay here is to have the right view about what youre doingIt may seem a little thing just keeping the mind in one spotYou can think of all the other things you might be doing right now all the other responsibilities you have all the other problems you could solveThose things can pull you away  because its not just gross manifestations of greed anger and delusion that pull us awayYour misinformed sense of responsibility can also pull you away that sense of Well Ive really got to think about thisIve got to prepare for thatIve got all these other responsibilities out there in the world things Ive got to prevent things Ive got to encourage But when you think in those ways youre neglecting one of your major responsibilities which is that if youre going to do anything effective anything skillful the mind has to have a good solid basis insideIts like a post at the edge of the oceanIf your post is planted firmly down in the sand  or even better if its firmly planted down into the rock below the sand  then when the waves come in the waves go out the post doesnt go in doesnt go out with themYou can use that post for lots of useful thingsIt can become a post on which you build a houseIt can be a post to which you tie up your boat so that the boat doesnt get washed out to seaAnd the post itself doesnt get damaged much by the wavesBut if you take your post and lay it down at the edge of the ocean  thinking that by laying it down there you can prevent the waves from coming in much better than if its standing in one spot  what happens of course is that the post gets washed in washed out and after a while it gets smashed against a rock someplaceIf anything is tied to the post itll get smashed tooIn other words if you take on too many responsibilities out in the world but dont have a firm foundation for the mind the mind ends up getting smashed to piecesAnd its of no use to anybodySo while youre focused on one small point right here  just the breath just the body  it may seem like youre neglecting your other responsibilities but in actuality youre notYoure providing a solid foundation for the mindA mind with a solid foundation is a lot more useful both for you and for the people around youTake this as your prime responsibilityBecause theres really only so much you can do for the worldYou may think about other people youd like to help but there are areas of their minds areas of their experience where you cant reach where you cant touch them at allYou see this very clearly when someone is sick and suffering in painYou cant go in and help share out the painYou may be able to give that person a medicine that helps relieve the pain somewhatBut sometimes theres so much pain that it goes beyond the reach of any morphine any opium any painkiller at allThats where that person has to be responsible for him or herselfYou see this in other people and it should remind you that youre going to have to face those same issues someday yourselfThats an area where each of us has to be responsibleIf we can be responsible about how we handle our pain were much less burdensome to the people around usAfter all it is our responsibilityWe were the ones who chose to be born hereIt was because of our desires and our cravings that we took birth as human beingsWhen youre responsible for your birth then you also have to be responsible for how you handle your aging illness and deathThey all come as part of the same packageAnd the point from which youre going to learn how to handle these things is this point right here  as youre focused on the breath focused in the present moment learning how to let go of all your other wrong views all your other distractions all the other things you might cling to that are going to end up getting you smashed against the rocksSo try to maintain this spotThink of it as a post planted against the waves of the oceanEven though the post gets knocked over you realize you shouldnt let it stay knocked overYou know its in a better position when its standing up planted down deep into the sandJust knowing that much can help a lotOtherwise you feel you owe it to other people to let your post lie down in the waves thinking that the post somehow will protect them from the force of the wavesBut what happens is that sometimes the waves come behind the post and push up against other people smashing them up against the rocksSo its both for your own good and for the good of the people around you that you try to keep this post firmly planted right hereAnd try to keep your views rightTheres a lot out there in the world that you cannot changeTheres a lot you cant even knowKierkegaard once commented that we live life forward but we understand backwardsIn other words there are a lot of decisions we have to make right now but we dont really know how theyre going to turn out tomorrow or the next day next month next yearWe can look back on decisions we made in the past and say Gee I shouldnt have done that I shouldnt have said this And in some cases we made the wrong decision fully knowing what we were doingThose are the decisions that carry a lot of blameBut a lot of times we made that wrong decision because we couldnt knowThat kind of decision is something you cant blame anybody forNobody can blame you you cant blame anybody elseSo you have to leave that to being uncertainIts part of the winds and the wavesLike tonights weather forecast They say there may be a storm coming inWe dont know for sureWe do our best to prepareIf the storm doesnt come in will we say Well all that preparation was a waste of time a waste of energyWe couldve done other things Thats not the right attitudeYou prepare as best you canAnd as for the things you dont know you just let them goWhat you do know are certain basic principlesIf you can develop more mindfulness more alertness more concentration more discernment in the mind youll be better prepared for handling things as they come up even if you dont know ahead of time what they will beIf youve got these qualities developed in the mind youll be in a better position to handle anything whatever comes your wayThe prime means for developing these qualities is by giving the mind one place to stay still and then maintaining that stillness regardless of whatever else may come to knock it overIn some cases that requires just being mindful and alert to whats happeningIn other cases it requires more discernment catching the currents of the mind that would knock you over learning how to resist the ones that say You really ought to think about this you really ought to worry about thatYoure sitting here with your eyes closed focusing on your breath ignoring your responsibilities Youve got to learn how to be able to argue with those thoughts so that they dont overcome the mindSo remember the post at the edge of the seaIf its just lying down there on the sand the waves will come up and the post will get washed back and forthIf there are people standing on the beach the post might hurt themIf there are rocks on the beach the waves might wash the post up against the rocks and smash itYou dont want thatIf your post is planted firmly there at the edge of the water its a lot more useful for yourself and for the people around youSo have a sense of the value of staying firmly planted right here focused right here developing this stillness as a skill getting the mind to be as constant as possibleWe know that the constancy you create through concentration like this cannot be totally constantAfter all youre building your path here out of what are called aggregatesAnd as the Buddha said all these aggregates are inconstant stressful and notselfWhen were resisting that to some extent we know that we cant ultimately make our state of concentration permanentBut what we are doing is giving the mind the strength it needs to let go of things that cause harm of things that cause suffering because were letting go from a position of strengthWe dont let go out of weaknessIf people let go out of weakness theres bound to be an element of sour grapes an element of dissatisfaction or resentment which means that they dont really let goTheyre hoping for some other time when they can latch on againBut if you let go out of strength you let go for sureWhen youve let go of things outside your concentration then you can turn and look at the concentration itselfYou realize that your concentration and discernment have taken the mind this far but they can take it no furtherThe only thing thats keeping you from going further is the fact that youre holding onThats when you let go out of genuine strengthWhen you let go in that way you find that theres something deep down in the mind thats constant totally free from stress beyond even the issues of self and not self  something that cant be affected by the wind or waves at allThe image in the texts is of a stone post sixteen spans tall planted into the solid rock of a mountainEight spans are buried in the rock eight spans are abovegroundNo matter which direction the wind comes from it cant make the post shake at allBut until you can get to that point use your post at the edge of the oceanIt may get knocked over now and then but you know well enough once its knocked over how to plant it down in the sand againEven just this much can help you through a lotIt can help eliminate a lot of suffering even before you come to the end of sufferingAnd thats quite an accomplishment right thereSometimes when you hear the Buddhas teachings explained its almost as if hes playing gotchaHe talks about jhana  the ease the rapture that can come from concentration  but then youre told that if you try to attain jhana youre not going to get thereOr once you get there you have to be very careful not to get attached to itIts dangerous so you shouldnt do it too muchSimilarly with nibbana Were told that nibbanas the highest ease the highest happiness and yet if you want it you cant get itIts like hes dangling these things in front of you and taunting you saying you cant have themThats not the way he taught at allThe ease and pleasure that come from jhana he said are totally blamelessAs he was struggling to find Awakening he spent six years practicing different austerities and finally realized that austerities were a deadendSo the question arose Is there an alternative wayHe thought of the time when he was a child sitting under a tree while his father was plowing and his mind entered the first jhanaSo he asked himself Why am I afraid of that pleasureWhy am I afraid of that raptureIs there anything blameworthy about itAnything harmful about it And the answer he came up with is NoAfter all its a pleasure that can arise simply by focusing your mind on the breathYoure not harming anyone at allAnd in following this pleasure youre not getting intoxicated with youth or health or life or the other things that intoxicate the mindSo its a good pleasure to pursueIn this way jhana was the first factor of the path that the Buddha realized in his quest for AwakeningAnd as with all the other factors of the path he said its something to be developedSo when states of ease and pleasure arise in your meditation try to develop themTry to master them as a skillA similar principle applies to nibbanaThe path to nibbana does include desire even though nibbana itself is the ending of all desireIf you had to drop all desire in order to get on the path nibbana itself would be the path to nibbanaThat would put you in a double bindBut the path actually includes desireOn the one hand theres right resolveThe resolve to overcome attachment to sensuality the resolve to be harmless the resolve not to feel ill will These are all types of desireAnd even more explicitly the factor of right effort starts out when you generate desire for doing away with unskillful qualities and making sure they dont arise againYou generate desire to give rise to skillful qualities and bring them to the culmination of their developmentIn other words the desire here focuses primarily on the pathNibbana itself is beyond skillful and unskillful but the factors of the path such as right mindfulness and right concentration are skillful qualities you want to develop to give rise to and then bring to the culmination of their potentialSo the Buddha is a very straightforward teacherHe points out that there are good things in the path and its okay to desire them simply that your desire should be matureImmature desire is the kind that wants to get the results without putting in the effort or focuses so exclusively on the results that you neglect the effortAs the Buddha said you focus on the causes and when the causes are ripe they yield the resultsThrough developing the path you come to realize the cessation of sufferingSo you focus on the path and the goal takes care of itselfSometimes you may hear that the path and the goal are oneAnd the one way in which that teaching makes sense is if you realize that in the doing of the path the goal gets realizedIn other words youre not supposed to sit there just going through the motions of the path passing the time saying When is the goal going to appear  ie doing the path but with one eye someplace elseYou focus your attention totally on developing the pathAnd in developing the path the realization of the end of suffering appears right thereSo focus on bringing the mind to stillnessIf the mind hasnt yet come to stillness ask yourself Whats getting in the wayUse your ingenuityIts not just a matter of desireYou use desire you use persistence you use your intent as you really focus on what youre doingAnd you use your powers of analysis and ingenuity figuring out whats going wrong whats not working right here what distractions are getting in the wayYou bring all of these bases of success to bear on what youre doingBut they all start with desireThere are lots of good reasons to want to bring the mind to concentration not only for your own sake but for the sake of other people as wellIf your happiness is more inwardly based you need less and less from the outside worldNow as the Buddha said in order to attain strong states of concentration the body needs to be nourishedYou need a certain level of comfort for the mind to settle downBut its not that muchThe more reliable your concentration gets the easier it is to make do with less and less outsideYoure placing less of a burden on other peopleYoure competing with them lessThat means you can treat them more fairlyYou can go into a situation and base your actions your words and your thoughts totally on goodwill and compassion  because you realize you dont need anything from those peopleIts when you need something from others that your actions are tilted in terms of bias or prejudice in terms of things you desire things that irritate you things youre deluded about or things you fearThis is because your hopes for happiness are focused on something outsideBut when your desire for happiness is focused inwardly you place less of a burden on things outsideYou need less from the outside world which means your compassion for other people can be more clearheaded balanced and fairIn this way the pursuit of happiness through developing strong concentration for the pursuit of total freedom is not a selfish thingAs long as your concentration is imbued with the other factors of the path  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness  its perfectly safeThey sometimes talk about getting stuck on concentration or becoming a concentration junkie but those are cases where the concentration lacks the other elements of the pathYour understanding of why theres suffering in the world is skewed or your understanding of why youre suffering is skewedYou spend all your time just focusing on your breath and not wanting to do anything for anyone else anywhere not wanting to be bothered by the worldYou have to realize that its not the world thats bothering you youre bothering the world with your demandsA weakness in your concentration and a weakness in your discernment make you think that wayIf your concentration is really solid you can stay in all kinds of difficult situations and maintain your balanceOr even if you get knocked off balance in the areas where youre still attached you can get back into balance a lot more easily if youve got right view and the other elements of the pathSo the dangers of concentration come when its pursued to the exclusion of the other factors of the pathBut right concentration being focused in this present moment with full body awareness a sense of ease and rapture that then shades into equanimity Thats a valuable skillThere are greater dangers in the path such as the danger of getting teachers who say Well you cant gain concentration or you shouldnt try Thats pretty dangerousOr other teachers who tell you youve attained some level of Awakening when you havent yetHolding on to their estimation of things is extremely dangerous because it makes you complacentIt really blocks the pathBut if you stay in right concentration imbued with right mindfulness and right view its in the concentration that you start seeing the stress of clinging to the aggregatesWhat the Buddha does basically is to teach you how to take these aggregates  which we normally cling to in an unskillful way  and learn how to cling to them in a more skillful way pointing out that Yes it is possible to attain happiness hereAs you get more and more sensitized to the grosser suffering outside your hopes for happiness get more and more focused on the concentrationWhen theyre totally focused here and have gotten good results you can start taking the concentration apart realizing that even this source of happiness is composed of aggregatesIt still has a potential for being inconstantStressfulNotselfThat spurs you to look for something deeperBut it puts you in the position where you can see that something deeper more clearly as wellIn other words your taste for happiness has grown more refinedRepeatedly the Buddha talks about analyzing the concentration in and of itself seeing what in the concentration is form feeling perception thought fabrication or consciousnessYou realize that even when you let go of outside aggregates or the grosser aggregates there are still these subtler aggregates insideIts right here that the work can be doneSo the Buddhas teachings are very straightforwardHere he says is a better safer more blameless form of happinessGo for itAs you master it you find there are even deeper levels of happiness ultimately to a level thats totally unconditionedBut its okay to desire these thingsIts okay to make an effort in these directionsIts through the desire through the effort that you get thereSo we learn how to take that desire and focus it in the right place  on the path on the causes  and the results will comeThats about as straightforward as you can getOne of the Buddhas essential insights was that the suffering that really weighs down the mind is a suffering we create  and its unnecessaryEven though we create it and we suffer from it we cling to itThis has some unexpected implicationsOne is that for a lot of us if we didnt suffer we would be lostEven the simple idea of not suffering would leave us hangingThis is because our strongest sense of who we are often comes from being treated unjustlyWe define ourselves through the suffering that comes from being treated unjustlyIf we were to deny ourselves that perverse pleasure wed feel lostBut when other people treat us unjustly we start treating ourselves unjustlyWhen other people criticize us unfairly we start criticizing ourselves unfairlyWe suffer from all of this but we would feel lost without the sense of self provided by that unfairnessThe mind can be really perverseTo work around this problem the Buddha has us focus simply on the problem of suffering without asking whos causing this or who you are or what you have to do to your sense of self to make it betterHe says Just look at the suffering in and of itself Thats important the in and of itself That helps get you out of the entanglements that come from your clinging to your sufferingWhen you can look at these things as events simply on their own terms simply as a pattern of cause and effect without asking how youre involved in it when you can simply see the fact of suffering as its being caused then you see the connection to its causeYou realize that you dont have to engage in the causeThat helps loosen up your attachment to the sufferingSo its important to understand this process that youre clinging to identifying with the very things that cause you to sufferEven though thats what defines you its simply a definition youve imposed on thingsYou dont really need it to functionYou dont really have to worry about being annihilated if you stop the sufferingFor many people thats a scary idea because the connection between their self and their suffering is so strongThis is why the Buddha focuses you back on just the suffering in and of itselfDont ask whos doing thisDont ask how youre involved in itJust ask Whats happening here Look at things in and of themselves as events as processesStart with the breath in and of itselfThats pretty neutralAnd ask yourself Whats going on in the process of breathing You breathe in until breathing in starts getting uncomfortableThen you breathe out until breathing out starts getting uncomfortableThen you start breathing back in againYoure bouncing back and forth between the discomfort of too much in and too much outYet you need to breatheIf you tried to stop breathing by holding your breath that would be painful tooYouve got to breathe yet its breathing between one extreme of breathing out too long and the other extreme of breathing in too longThe breath is an impersonal process something you can watch in and of itself and it teaches you a lesson about suffering in and of itselfFortunately for us there are not too many elaborate theories about the deeper meaning of breathJust the fact The breath is now coming in the breath is now going outYou cant watch your future breaths you cant watch your past breathsYouve just got the present breathAnd its impersonalYou know that everybody has the same breathingYou simply ask the question of whether it feels good or notThats all youve got to ask right nowAs for other larger issues you can put them asideGet used to dealing just on this level the immediate experience of the breath in and of itselfIn doing that you help to depersonalize the issue of sufferingFrom this point you can begin to spread your attention to other problems that need depersonalizing as wellBut make sure youve got this foundation strongSimply stay with the issue of how the breath is coming in how the breath is going outAre you enjoying itEven though the breath moves between two different types of pain if you adjust it properly you can make the experience of the breath in between the feel of the breath in between really gratifying  as it feels good coming in coming in down to the lungs down to the abdomenIt can feel refreshing gratifyingAnd just that fact of how it feels in the present moment without your having to get involved in thoughts of identity the narratives of your life your worldviews Get used to looking at things simply on this level just the experience in and of itselfThis gives you a new foundationYou get in touch with the ability in the midst of the potential for pain to make the present moment pleasantAnd its not threateningIts gratifyingYou shift your center of gravity away from the sense of self that needs to suffer in order to maintain its identity to a different sense of self one based on a sense of pleasure combined with a greater sense of competenceYoure developing a skill and you see the results immediatelyThis new center of gravity then acts as the fulcrum from which you can pry loose your other attachments the old ways of identifying yourselfTheyve done studies of people going through psychotherapy trying to figure out which method  Jungian Freudian or whatever  works bestAnd theyve discovered that the actual method doesnt make all that much differenceWhat does make a difference is the ability of the patient to get inside his or her body to fully inhabit the body and then from that standpoint to work through whatever issues there are in the mindThis is what youre doing as you work with the breathYoure getting into the body getting more sensitive to the body creating a new center of gravity for yourself a new area of sensitivityA lot of the Buddhist texts when they talk about the knowledge you gain from meditation express it as a form of vision something you seeYoure working toward knowledge and vision they sayThe first experience of Awakening is the opening of the Dhamma EyeFull Awakening comes with knowledge and vision of things as they have come to beBut there are also passages that describe this knowledge as something sensed not through the inner eye but through the bodyAll the teachings about jhana are concerned with gaining a sense of ease and wellbeing from the breath and then allowing it to permeate the whole bodySome of the texts talk about touching the various formless dimensions that can be accessed through jhana touching them with your bodyOne of the texts says that those who practice jhana touch the deathless with the bodyAnd one of the verses in the Dhammapada says that you see the Dhamma with the bodyThe Sutta Nipata describes the Buddha as the Allaround Eye His whole body was an organ of vision an organ of sightSo one of the things we want to do as we practice is to get out of our heads  where we have all these notions about who we are and how we relate to other people how we have to maintain our identity which is centered on suffering in the face of the onslaughts of the world outside  and learn how to fully inhabit the bodyAs we inhabit it the body itself becomes an organ of vision an organ of sightYou see things going on in the body you didnt see beforeYou resensitize the bodyAs a meditator you work from a new center of gravity so that when you start taking apart your habits of creating your sense of self  the habits that make you suffer but that you cling to so tightly  its a lot less threateningYou dont feel that youre going to be obliterated by the processTaking apart these old habits becomes something you really like to do because youre looking from another point of viewYoure looking from the point of view of fullbody awareness fullbody competenceThis is why its so important to get in touch with the breath and to learn to breathe with the whole body whole body breathing in whole body breathing outIt develops a sensitivity and a foundation you need to do some really radical work on how the mind is causing itself to suffer and how you can uproot all the ways that cause you to sufferIts only from this different point of view that the work can actually be doneOnce when Ajaan Suwat was here he asked me to give the Dhamma talk in ThaiI had been translating Ajaan Lee so I used one of Ajaan Lees images comparing the practice to digging a wellGenerosity was like a very shallow well virtue a deeper well whereas concentration was a well down to the water tableAfterwards he told me that the Dhamma talk had been too interestingIt was distracting people from their meditationSo dont listen to meFocus on your breathThe talk is here in the background to catch you if you wander away from the breath like the catcher in the ryeIm standing at the edge of a cliff in case those of you who are running around in the rye arent really looking at what youre doingIf I see that youre heading to the edge of the cliff Im here to catch you to make sure you dont fall away from your meditation objectOr you can think of the talk as a fenceWhen you start leaving the meditation object the first thing youll run into is the fence formed by the sound of the talkThats to remind you to go backThe word desana the word we usually translate as Dhamma talk actually means pointingAnd the talk is here to point you back to the breath back to your present awareness to make sure you dont go wandering offTry to stay with the breathBe one with your meditationThere are two words with one in the Buddhas descriptions of jhanaOne is ekaggata as in ekaggatarammana oneness of preoccupation or singleness of preoccupation and ekaggatacitta singleness of mindThis kind of oneness applies to all levels of jhanaIt means being focused on one thing like the breathYou stay steadily focused on it at the same time making it the one thing filling your range of awarenessSo you start out trying to do thatBut in the beginning there are two onesTheres the mind aware of the breath evaluating the breath commenting on the breathThats one thingAnd then theres the breathOne subject one object and you want to keep both of them one in their own waysYou want to make sure that the one topic of your inner conversation is the breathAs for other things that have been going on in the course of the day you dont talk about themDont go slipping off into the past slipping off into the future wondering about what youre going to do tomorrow what youre going to do at the end of the meditation or how much longer you have to meditate hereThats introducing other topics of conversationAnd the mind never really settles downSo just keep the topic of conversation on one thing on the breath and evaluate how its goingWhat kind of breath would you like to breathe right nowYoure perfectly free to chooseYou may not be able to think about other things right now but theyre off the agendaThey dont really matter right nowWhen the breath is the one item on the agenda you can give it your full attention and youre totally free to explore itWhat kind of breathing would really feel good right now in your stomachLet the body breathe that wayFocus on your stomach for a while and see what kind of breathing really feels good thereWhat kind of breathing feels good going down your backboneWhat kind of breathing feels good in your legsYou may not yet be able to breathe with your legs but there is a breath energy that can flow down through the legsSee what rhythm of breathing keeps that breath energy alive awakeAjaan Lee talks about using your awareness of the breath to wake up the different properties of your bodyThis is what he means having a sense that theres an energy flowing through your legs flowing through your arms all around your head all the different parts of your body out to the fingers and toes like an electric currentThere is even an energy if youre really sensitive that surrounds your bodyCan you be sensitive to thatAnd what kind of breathing makes those different parts of the body feel goodGo through the body and tell yourself that youre breathing specifically for your stomach for a while so what kind of breathing would feel good right thereIf the stomach could speak what kind of breath would it ask forThen breathe specifically for the sake of your chest What kind of breathing would feel good in your chestAnd so on through the rest of the body in the shoulder in the back of your shoulders between your shoulder blades in the small of your back in your hips in your legs in your toes in your eyesThen try to be aware of the breath in the whole bodyThis is how the breath the object of your conversation becomes one It fills the range of your awarenessThink of the whole body breathing in breathing out and let the wholebody breath flow as comfortably as you canThen after a while when youve been evaluating the breath and it really feels good as youre breathing in breathing out there comes a point where you dont have to evaluate it any moreAs Ajaan Fuang once said as you fill up the breath energy in the body its like filling up water in a jarThere comes a point where the jar of water  here were talking about those big jars that they used to line up along the sides of houses in Thailand to catch rainwater off the roof enormous jars sometimes bigger than a person After a while the jar is so full of water that no matter how much more water you pour into it it cant hold any moreThe excess just flows outThe same principle holds with the breathYou get to a point where the breath energy feels full throughout the bodyThe legs feel full the arms feel full with a pleasant buzz of energyThey feel energizedAwakeAnd you dont need to do any more evaluation for theyre as full as theyre going to getYoure now free to just dive into the breathThis is where the other word for oneness in the descriptions of jhana ekodibhava comes into playEkodibhava means unificationIt starts at the second jhanaThe oneness of your awareness and the oneness of the breath become a single oneness totally unifiedYou dont hold anything backThat sense of the observer which is sometimes like an animal perched on your shoulders looking through your eyes looking at the breath in different parts of the body You want to obliterate the sense that that observer is separate from the breathSo you breathe into the observerThinking of the breath energy in your eyes is especially helpful here in creating a sense of being oneMany of our ideas of subjectobject dichotomies come from our sense of sight  the objects out there the eye is in here and they dont touchOne good way of erasing that dichotomy is to focus on the breathenergy flow in your eyesThe breath is right there the eyes are right there in the same placeTheres no dividing line between themThis helps to induce a sense that awareness is fully one with the breath the breath is fully one with the awarenessThen you simply maintain thatAny thought that spills out from that you dont wantTotally throw yourself into the breathTheres nothing else you have to do nowhere else you have to go nothing that has any need to pull you awayAjaan Lee makes the comment that this breath if youre totally immersed in it will take you through all the levels of jhana up to the fourthThe difference is simply a matter of how steady you are in staying one with the breath and of how still the breath grows in responseAjaan Fuang noted that this sense of total oneness or unification with the object can take you all the way up to the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessIts simply a matter of the perception you hold in mindAfter the fourth jhana you drop the perception of the form of the body  the still breath allows you to do this  and you can focus on the sense of space permeating the mist of sensations that remainsAfter that perception of space is unwavering you turn to focus on whats aware of the spaceThat puts you into the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessTo get beyond that to the dimension of nothingness you have to drop the onenessBut these tactics work only after this sense of total oneness is developed and strongIt takes some energy to do thisYouve got to throw all your energy into being one with the breathBut you find that by giving all your energy you get a lot of energy backThats when everything in the body is really awakeYour sense of awareness permeates every cellThe breath permeates every cellIt flows so well that the inandout breath can grow more and more stillThis is when your preoccupation with the object of your meditation really does become one not simply in the sense that its the one thing youre talking about to yourselfActually youre not talking about it much any moreYoure just in with itAnd it fills the whole range of your awarenessWhen you do this you find that any movement of mental chatter in the mind becomes very obviousWhen you see it just drop it drop it drop itWhen a little stirring happens in your awareness zap it before you even know what its going to talk aboutThis is not the time for chatterYouve got something much better going on hereThe mind is snug with the breath like a hand inside a glove totally surrounded in the breathThe breath has you surrounded on all sidesYoure not pulling back to watch it from outsideYoure totally immersed in itTo use a phrase from the Pali this is kayagatasati Your mindfulness is immersed in the body your awareness is totally surrounded by the breath totally surrounded by the bodyOnce you can do this just try to maintain it in a very balanced statePart of the mind might object This is stupidYoure not thinking about anything But thats precisely the point You dont have to think about anythingThe mind needs this opportunity to rest to gain energyAjaan Lee compares this to putting a knife in a scabbardYou want to make sure that your knife is sharp when you need it so you have to protect itPut it in something that keeps it snug and protected on all sidesWhen you need it to cut something you take the knife out of the scabbardBecause its sharp it can cut right through thingsBut in the meantime youve got to keep your mind well protected well energizedThis is when the mind enters into fixed penetration in a very strong and solid wayThis is the heart of the pathThe other factors will come out of this and surround this  or as the Buddha says support thisBut this oneness of the mind with its object is the center from which everything else happensAjaan Lee talks about this as the point where all four frames of reference  the body in and of itself feelings in and of themselves the mind in and of itself mental qualities in and of themselves  all become oneYou could look at this sense of oneness as any one of the fourFrom one perspective its body from another its feeling or mind or mental qualitiesBut theyre all here in the same placeIf you want to see the actual distinctions among them you have to bring them together firstIf you draw lines around them before making them one the lines tend to come more from your ignorance than from genuine knowledgeBut if you make them one then when they finally do separate out its not because you tried to pry them apartAjaan Lees analogy is of heating a piece of rock containing different kinds of oreYou heat it to a certain temperature and the silver melts out at another temperature the gold melts out at another temperature the tin  all of their own accordIn other words youre not dividing things up in terms of your preconceived notionsInstead you put the energy of this oneness into the breath to make everything oneThats when things are allowed to separate in a natural way in ways that you may not have expectedBut in the meantime keep trying to make them oneGet really good at thisThis is an essential skill in the meditationAs for the insight that will arise from this you dont have to worry about it at least not yetJust make sure the foundation is solidPeople often ask how to bring the practice into daily lifeThe answer is relatively simpleIts one many people dont like to hear but it is simple restraintThere are basically two kinds of restraintTheres restraint in what you do and restraint in how you look and listen and smell and taste and feel and think about things  in other words restraint in what goes out and restraint in what comes inAnd both kinds of restraint require a good amount of skillTake restraint of the senses Theres a skill to looking a skill to listeningYou want to look at things in such a way that youre not exciting greed anger or delusionYou want to listen to things in such a way that you dont excite greed anger or delusionAnd so on down through the sensesThis is a skillYou want to be able to do it in such a way that you dont starve yourself of pleasures to the point where you break down and suddenly find yourself in front of an open refrigerator scarfing down a gallon of ice creamYou need to know how to keep the mind well fed even as youre starving your defilementsIn mastering this skill it helps to have concentration as a foundationThe texts often give restraint of the senses as a prerequisite for concentration but as is so often the case in the Buddhas teachings the two qualities actually help each other alongTry to notice when you look at something Does your attention go flowing outDo you lose your sense of the bodyIf you do its a sign that your looking isnt all that skillfulYou want to be able to stay in the body as you look as you listen to maintain your sense of the breath energy throughout the bodyIf you cant thats a sign either that youre looking for the purpose of forgetting the body  in other words youre looking for the purpose of greed anger or delusion  or youre simply careless and the sight the sound the smell or the taste whatever happened to catch you off guardThats how most people look and listen and smell and taste and feel and think about thingsThey forget their inner center and suddenly find themselves centered outside trying to get some pleasure from grabbing onto a sight or a sound and then elaborating on it  either to make it more attractive or to make it seem more meaningful than it actually isIf the mind is in a mood for a little bit of anger you focus on the things that would provoke the anger and then you can elaborate on it proliferate as much as you likeThose are where our skills tend to beWere great at proliferatingBut if you think of input at the senses as a kind of food for the mind  which is how the Buddha sees it  you have to ask yourself Are you preparing good food for the mind or junk foodOr poisonous foodThats the kind of cooking were used toWe think were cooking up great meals but they can make us sickSo youve got to learn a new way to cook for the mindThe Buddha counts sensory input among the four foods for consciousnessIt actually includes three of the four contact at the senses intentions at the senses  why youre looking at these things listening to these things to begin with and then consciousness of the act of sensingThese three aspects of sensory input are what the mind is feeding on all the timeThe basic skill in learning new ways to cook this food is to focus on the breath and get the mind centered insideYoure actually changing the level of the mind when its inside the body in this wayInstead of being on the sensual level its suddenly on the level of form which is a higher level than the level of sensual desireEven though there may be the desire to stay here at the level of form its a skillful desire because it raises the level of the mindYoure not so dependent on things outside for your happiness so youre in a position where you can look at sensual pleasures from aboveAt the same time youre learning how to make the most of what youve already gotAs Ajaan Lee says its like learning how to grow food on your own property rather than invading the property of others to plant crops on their landLearn how to develop a sense of ease a sense of fullness and refreshment right here in the bodyMake that your foodTry to preserve and protect that level of the mindThats the skill in how you look at things and listen to things maintaining this sense of the center in the body a sense of ease refreshment and fullness no matter what happens outsideThat puts the mind on a higher plane  and in a much better positionWhen you handle restraint of the senses in this way youre not depriving the mindYoure simply learning how to give the mind better food to nourish it in a healthier way a way thats totally blamelessSometimes you hear people talking about the dangers of getting attached to jhana as if it were a huge monster waiting to ambush you on the side of the pathBut the dangers of jhana are relatively minorThe dangers of being stuck on the sensual level though are hugeWhen your happiness is dependent on sensory pleasures being a certain way it can lead to all sorts of unskillful behavior as you try to keep on feeding the mind the kind of sights sounds etc it likesThis is why we see so much killing and stealing illicit sex lying getting drunk around us in the worldAll the precepts get broken because of peoples attachment to the pleasures of the sensesYou dont see anybody killing or stealing because of their attachment to jhanaSo even though this is an attachment its a better oneAnd when your happiness is not dependent on things outside being a certain way people outside have less power over youWe see this so much these daysAll they have to do is wave the red flag Theres danger out there there are terrorists out there they can harm usWeve got to do all kinds of evil things to stop them Thats what they tell usIf the minds only nourishment is things outside youre going to be swayed by those argumentsBut when you can step back and say No Ive got a source of pleasure a source of happiness inside that people outside cant touch then youre much less likely to be led astrayIn this way your ability to find nourishment inside is protection for the mindThe pleasures of the world outside hold a lot less poison because youre not trying to feed on them anymoreTheyre still there but you can learn how to handle them more skillfully use them more skillfully as you try to make the mind even strongerFor instance there will be times in your meditation when things arent going as well as youd likeIn cases like that it can be helpful to go outside and look at the beauty of nature around you  the clouds the sunset the moon and the stars at night  to help clear and refresh your mindThere are passages in the Canon where MahaKassapa who was one of the strictest and sternest of the Buddhas disciples talks about the beauty of natureThe constant refrain in his verses is of how the hills the mountains bathed in rain and the jungle refresh himSome of the first wilderness poetry in the world is in the Pali Canon  an appreciation of the beauties of not just nature but of wild natureThat sort of appreciation is part of the skill in learning how to gladden the mindWhat this comes down to is that as the Buddha said even something as simple as looking or listening can be developed as a skillYou look and listen while at the same time trying to maintain your sense of being centered insideThis is one of the best measurements for how much greed anger or delusion is lurking in the mind and pushing it aroundIf you catch the mind flowing out to a particular object there you are Youve found a defilementMany of us in the West dont like the word defilement We deny that theres anything defiled in our minds and yet when the mind is clouded by desire narrowed by desire thats precisely what the Buddha meansYour sense of inner awareness gets obscured and narrowed as your attention goes flowing outAccording to Ajaan Lee the tendency to flow out to things is the meaning of asava effluent or fermentationThat kind of looking and listening  the kind where your mind flows out to the object  is unskillful looking unskillful listeningIf youre skillful you can stay inside while you see and hearWhen you catch the mind in the course of flowing out youve learned an important lesson that theres still greed anger and delusion in the mindIf you want to look for it here it isOnly when you see it can you actually do something about itYou begin to sense the danger of falling for those currentsYou develop the motivation to want to do something about it so that you dont have to get pushed around like this any moreYou find ways of stopping the flow at its sourceThis is where you find that being inside the form of the body really is a higher level of food for the mind a higher level of happiness a better place to beYou want to do everything you can to stay here regardless of what happens outsideWhen a wildfire swoops down the mountainside at you you want to stay right where you areYou may want to move the body of course but you want your center to stay right here inside the bodyWhen disappointments come in life you still want to stay here and not let the disappointments from outside make inroads into the mindWhen a cold wave comes a heat wave comes you want to be able to find your refreshment your sense of wellbeing here in the bodyThis is why restraint of the senses is not deprivationIts actually a way of feeding the mind better food giving it a higher level of pleasureBut you cant have everythingIf you go for the more dangerous food you miss out on the better foodYouve got to make the choice health food or junk foodIn that sense restraint is a form a deprivationBut its actually a tradeYoure getting something better in returnAs you go through the day keep asking yourself that question What am I feeding on right nowAnd what is it saying about the mindWhat am I learning about the mind by watching the way I feed In this way the simple act of looking or listening is part of the practiceIf you do it skillfully its nourishment for the practiceIt keeps it goingThe path doesnt provide refreshment for the mind only while you sit here with your eyes closed or while youre doing walking meditationWhen you know how to exercise restraint you can gain refreshment throughout the dayTheres a continuity in the practiceWhen you sit down and close your eyes youre right hereYou dont have to spend the whole hour pulling the mind in like a cat on a leash because its already hereYouve already been developing the wisdom and discernment that protect the mind keeping it hereYou dont have to cook them up fresh every time you sit down and meditateSo think of everything you do throughout the day as a skill including the way you exercise restraintSometimes that means not looking at or listening to the things you dont know how to deal with yet  like a beginning boxer who knows enough not to take on a world championBut you wont have to go through life with blinders on all the timeYou can teach yourself how to look at things that used to set off your anger or set off your lust but you do it in a new way a way in which they dont set you offIf theres something you feel greed for look at the unattractive side of getting what would be involved in trying to gain that thing and keep itIf theres lust think of the unattractive side of the human body your own and that of everyone around youAs Ajaan Lee would say look at things with both eyes not just oneAnd furthermore stay centered right here while youre doing your looking so that you can check and see if as youre looking and listening youre really staying separate from the defilementOr are you sneaking it in are you flowing along with itThis is why restraint is a good check on the mind in two senses of the word check Not only to stop it but also to keep tabs on whats actually going onIf the defilements seem really quiet while you sit in meditation well heres your chance to test themDo they flow out during the rest of the dayRestraint is what provides continuity to the practiceIf you do it skillfully your looking and listening all become part of the practiceThey can keep you on the path all day long In Thailand its common that when an ajaan arrives at a monastery hes never been to before and wants to check out how serious the monks are about practicing he looks at the walking meditation pathsIf theyre well swept and obviously well worn by walking he takes it as a good signOne of the reasons of course is that if you look at the place where someone sits you cant see how worn it is through the sitting whereas walking wears a rut in the pathBut the other reason is that walking meditation is an essential part of the practice that people tend to underestimateBy and large we emphasize the sitting and see the walking simply as an opportunity to get a change of pace from the sitting to get up and stretch our legs a bitBut thats not the only purpose for the walkingIn the Canon when the Buddha talks about the benefits of walking meditation some of them are health benefits but in terms of the mind he says that the concentration developed while walking is not easily destroyedThis is an important point to ponderWhen we sit quietly were trying to get the mind still and we try to keep the body still as a way of helping the mind alongBut you also want to be able to keep the mind still in the midst of movement in the midst of activityThats where walking meditation comes inWhen you get up from your sitting meditation to walk try to maintain the same center you had while sittingYou might think of it as a bowl full of oil that youre carrying with you as you get up from the seat and walk over to the path and continue walkingYou dont want to spill a dropThat requires a readjustment in where you keep your focusNormally when you open your eyes the first tendency is for your awareness to go flowing out the eyes out into the world of your visual sphereYou lose some of your sense of being inside the bodySo remind yourself not to lose that senseMaintain it even as you open your eyesYou may find that this can knock you off balance the first time you try it for it means finding a different kind of balance from what youre used toBut its important that you develop this new sense of balance this sense of being fully inside your body fully in the breath even while walking even while moving even while negotiating with the surroundings in which you walk because eventually you want to get to the point where you can maintain that same sense of center in the midst of all your activities  talking working eating whatever  wherever you areAnd this is a good first step in that directionWalking meditation is a means of connecting your sitting meditation with mindfulness throughout daily lifeIf when you get on your walking path you find that your center has slipped immediately bring it backThen walk to the end of the path at a normal pace  or slightly slower if you find it helps your concentration  but dont walk at an abnormally slow pace or you wont get the practice you need in bringing centered mindfulness to your normal activitiesDont glance around at the trees or the other sights around youKeep your eyes downcast focused on the path several steps in front of youYou can hold your hands in front of the body or in back the important point being that you dont swing your arms aroundWhen you get to the end of the path stop for a brief second to reestablish mindfulness in case it slipped away while you were walking and then turn stop for a second and walk back in the other directionAlways try to turn in the same direction either clockwise or counterclockwise to the right or to the left so that you dont have to keep deciding which way youre going to turn at the end of the pathAside from that try to maintain the same sense of center you had while sitting with your eyes closedIn other words focus on the breathEven though youre walking and looking ahead to make sure you dont trip over things you want to maintain the sense of being centered in the breath as much as possibleDont let the looking and the walking pull you away from your centerThis requires practice maintaining a center in the midst of movementThis is important for two main reasonsOne as I said just now is that it gets you used to maintaining your center in other activities as well so that even when youre engaged in complex activities even when youre thinking about things you can still have a sense of inhabiting the body being centered within the breathYou may have so many other things going on that you cant keep track of when the breath is coming in or going out but you should be able to maintain a sensitivity to the energy tone in the body  where its relaxed where its tight what you can do to keep it relaxed and comfortable in all situationsYoure inhabiting the bodyYoure not going off entirely into some other thought worldThis keeps you groundedIt gives you a place to return to as soon as youve done whatever work needs to be done in that thought worldOtherwise you hop trains from one train of thought to the next train of thought like a hobo and you end up in Lincoln NebraskaWhereas if youre grounded here as soon as the thought world has done its work youre back here with the breath againThat way you can stay grounded in the midst of your different activitiesYou dont get lost in the course of the dayThe other reason why its important to develop this ability to stay centered in the midst of activity is that while youre doing walking meditation you begin to observe how the mind slips outIts often the case that you gain insight into the movements of the mind a lot more easily while youre walking than while youre sitting because when youre sitting everything is supposed to be totally stillYou dont have to pay attention to anything else at allYou can clamp down on everything and get very very centered very very stillBut while youre walking you still have to watch you still have to move there are decisions to be made even in the simple matter of walkingWhere youre going to place your eyes where youre going to step noticing how close you are to the end of the path simple things but theyre movements of the mindAnd when the mind moves that way its easy for other intentions to sneak into the movement to divert it to their own endsIf youre not careful theyll pull you awayBut if you get used to looking for them you gain a sense of how the mind tends to flow outLuang Pu Dune talks about this in his short definitions of the four noble truthsThe mind that goes flowing out he says is a cause of stressIts good to be able to catch that flowing out in action to see the current to see how and why it moves and to get practice in not flowing along with itAjaan Lee also talks about this in his discussion of mind as a frame of referenceYou start he says with a sense of awareness thats still and brightThen a current flows out from that awareness and goes to sense objectsSometimes its looking for something to get angry about sometimes for something to get greedy aboutThe reason we dont notice whats happening is that we tend to go with the flowBut if you put yourself in the same position as when youre doing walking meditation  that youre going to stay still even though other things have to move  you can develop the skill needed to stay still while the current of the mind is flowing out and you dont go with itYou watch it go for a little ways and because youre not inhabiting it it just falls short of its mark and diesSo you get to see the mind in action and yet not get carried away by the actionThis way its a lot easier not to go along with everything that comes flowing through the mindYou get a stronger sense of the observer that can watch the movements of the mind as events not as worlds to inhabitIf you got into those worlds theyd turn into all kinds of stories and take you to a dark place on the outskirts of Bangkok shoot you and dump you out of the carBut when you see them simply as events you dont get involved unless you see clearly that they really are usefulThis puts you in a much better position not to get carried away by thingsThe same ability to watch movement but not move along with it helps you analyze your own concentrationThe Canon talks about developing an ability to step back a bit from your concentration after youve mastered itIn the first stages of concentration practice the Buddha recommends learning how to indulge in the concentration enjoy it immerse yourself in it really get absorbedIn other words you fully plant your mind in the object and become one with itWhile youre doing that you cant think analytically about what youre doing at allYoure totally focused on the one object the one perceptionYou may adjust it a little here a little there but when youve done enough adjusting you allow yourself to get immersed in itWhile youre in that state you cant do much analyzing of any sortBut then the Buddha talks about stepping back a bitThe image he gives is of a person sitting looking at someone whos lying down or of a person standing looking at someone whos sittingYoure above the other person a bit and you can observe what the other person looks like what he or she is doingIn the same way you can learn how to observe the mind while its stillYou arent so totally implanted in the object but at the same time you dont totally leave concentrationThe reason you can do this is because youve developed the skill through walking meditation for the observer to be still even though theres a little bit of movement in the mindThis way you can observe your state of concentrationThe Buddha recommends lots of ways you can observe itLook for whatever you can recognize as form feeling perception thought construct or consciousness within the concentration and then contemplate its behaviorOne simple way is contemplating the activity of perceptionTo what extent does the perception youre using as a marker for your concentration create stress or disturbance for the mindLearn to observe that perception the label you place on things as an act of the mindTheres an element of intention behind itOr many times theres a whole frame of reference for that particular perception a whole world of backgroundBut if you can see the perception as an activity with a beginning a middle and an end you see that the perception is one thing the actual object of the perception is something elseOne of the classic analogies the Buddha gives is of a mirageYou see a tree in the mirage even though the actual tree is much farther away than the image of the tree in the mirageThe tree in the mirage is one thing the actual tree is something elseTheyre connected but separateWhen you can see the distinction between the perception and the actual object you can start seeing the perception in motion and see what kind of effect it has as part of a causal chainThat way you can see which kinds of perceptions are helpful which ones are notAjaan Lee points this out in his breath meditation instructionsThe way you perceive the breath in the first jhana is going to be different from the way you perceive it in the second the third or the fourthIn the fourth jhana you perceive the breath as a still energy fieldWhat youve done is to tune in to a still energy field thats already there in the bodyThe way you can tune in is through this perceptionWhat do you have in your current range of awareness thats breath energy but stillIf you cant focus on that just yet focus on the perception of breathing in breathing out trying to get the right length of breath the right quality of breathThat will help you to get centered and to settle downBut there will come a point where the understanding of the breath that got you into concentration gets in the way of your moving to more subtle levels of concentrationSo you need alternative ways of perceiving breath in the bodyInstead of focusing on the inandout breath try focusing on the subtle breath energies that flow through the blood vessels flow through the nervesTheyre a very subtle form of the inandout breathThen theres a more subtle energy that goes very fastAs soon as you start thinking of breathing in its already gone around the body throughout the body from head to toeAnd then theres another level of energy the still breath something thats always there regardless of whether theres an inbreath or an outbreathAjaan Lee mentions one of the energy centers where you can access this  where the diaphragm connects to the rib cage right under your lungs  but there are other spots where you can first access it as wellThe inbreath and outbreath can impinge on this still energy can squeeze it but if you decide not to let the inandout breathing interfere with that sense of still energy you can then let that sense of stillness suffuse the whole bodyYou move to a deeper level of concentration where everything feels wide open still and freeYouve done this by focusing on your perceptions as events testing their results and then changing them to give better resultsAs you grow more proficient at this you can start observing the entire process to see how perceptions shape your experience as a wholeThats one way of developing a sense of disenchantment and disengagement seeing how what you thought were the raw data of experience are already shaped by perceptionThis is one way to develop insight in the course of practicing concentrationThis all depends on that ability to observe the mind in action and yet not get caught up in the actionAnd this is why walking meditation is so important because it helps give you practice in perfecting that abilitySo dont think of the walking simply as something you do when you get too tired to sit or as something where you simply go through the motions until youre ready to sit againIts not a meditation break its an essential part of the meditationIt develops an added skill the skill to be centered in the body not only while the body is still but also while the body is movingWalking meditation teaches you to be still in the midst of movement to get a stronger sense of the mind as the observer that doesnt move along with the things it observesRemember that chant about respect for concentrationIt doesnt apply only to sitting concentrationIt also applies to walking meditation as an essential skill in your concentration practiceTo develop respect for these things as the Buddha said puts you in the presence of nibbanaIf youve ever opened a book to look at dependent coarising your first impulse was probably to close the book because the topic is so complexBut actually there are some good basic lessons you can learn even from your first impressionsThe primary factor is ignoranceThats what starts suffering in motionWhen you replace the ignorance with knowledge that cuts the chain of causes and conditions leading to sufferingSo its good to know precisely what kind of knowledge is called for here knowledge of the four noble truthsThis is why right view is always given as the first factor in the noble eightfold pathIt starts with conviction in your actions that your actions are real that they really do have results and that the quality of the results is determined by the quality of the mental state engendering the actionIts within this context that the four noble truths make senseAfter all suffering is a result of a particular mental action or a series of mental actions  craving and ignorance being primaryIf mental actions didnt have an impact on your life the four noble truths would be meaninglessThis of course directs us to where we have to practice Weve got to train the mindNotice that each of the four noble truths entails a particular duty each of which is a skill to be masteredYoure trying to comprehend suffering so that you can let go of its causeYou develop the path so that you can realize the end of sufferingThose are the duties you have to master as skillsThis is why in the Buddhas teaching theres no big controversy over sudden versus gradual AwakeningThe kind of knowledge were developing here like any skill is incrementalThe more you work on it the more sensitive you getUltimately you reach a point where you really understandThe image in the texts is of the continental shelf off of IndiaIts a gradual slope and then theres a sudden dropoffIts not all or nothingThe buildup is important because the buildup is what makes you more sensitiveOnly when youre really sensitive can you have those Aha moments that really go deep into the mind open things up change your perspective on everythingThis is why the eightfold path is not only composed of right view but also other factors that help to increase your ability to know to learn to be aware of the mind and to help you let go of the factors that obscure the mindThats why one of the Buddhas terms for the path is developing and letting go Youre developing clarity of mind youre letting go of the things that obscure and defile the mindSo thats the big important factor in the chain of causes and conditions whether youre operating out of the right view of the four noble truths or the wrong view of ignoranceThe other point that will immediately strike you if you look at dependent coarising is how many of the factors come prior to sensory contactThings dont just begin with sensory contactYou bring a whole load of preconditions to any experience and working on those preconditions is whats going to make all the differenceFor instance building right off of ignorance there are what they call fabricationsThe way you breathe if its done in ignorance can contribute to sufferingThats physical fabricationVerbal fabrication consists of the way you direct your thoughts to things and then comment on themIf this is done in ignorance its going to lead to sufferingMental fabrication consists of perceptions and feelings If you fabricate these things out of ignorance theyre going to lead to suffering as wellThis is why a large part of the practice is focused on the issue of perception the way you label things how they fit into the larger picture of your thoughtsAnd this is why the Buddha didnt just sit people down and say Okay just be in the present moment and dont think about anything else He would often start his instructions by leading up to an understanding of why were in the present moment exactly what were trying to look for in the present moment what were going to do about it when we see itThis is why there are so many analogies and images in the CanonThey give you a framework for understanding what youre doingAnd again many of the images and analogies have to do with skills Being a skillful meditator is like being a skillful cook carpenter or archerTheres a skillful way to perceive theres even a skillful way to feelFeeling comes not only from raw data streaming in from the outside but also from an element of fabrication and mental impulseA physical impulse comes up your nerves and your mind processes it before youre really conscious of itWhat were trying to do as we meditate is to learn how to bring some of these unconscious processes into the light of dayAnd a central element in these processes is the way you perceive thingsYou can consciously train yourself to perceive things in more useful more skillful waysTheres a series of meditations called guardian meditations which are very helpful in using skillful perceptions to get the mind in the right mood in the right attitude with the right understanding as you come into the present momentYoull often find as youre sitting here meditating on the breath that the problem is not with the breathIts with the mental baggage youre carrying with youSo you want to open up the bags and throw out all the unnecessary weightTheres an image they have in Thailand of the old woman who carries around a huge bundle of straw on her backShes always bent over because shes carrying so much strawPeople ask her why she doesnt put it down and she says Well someday this straws going to come in handy so Im carrying it for the day Ill need it So she carries it wherever she goesOf course there are many other things she could be carrying but she cant because the straw is such a huge bundle and of course its pretty uselessSo you want to look into your baggage to see how much straw youre carrying around so that you can lighten your loadThen you can replace it with better things things that really will be usefulAnd the guardian meditations are a good way of sorting things out in your baggageThe first guardian meditation is recollection of the Buddha keeping in mind his Awakening reflecting on it as a central event in the history of the worldThe fact of his Awakening shows that through human effort true happiness can be foundIts an important point to keep in mind because so much of our modern culture tries to say HeyYou cant have an ultimate and deathless happiness but you can have the happiness that comes from our eggbeater with an MP player built right into the handle or whateverIn other words they keep you focused on what you can get out of buying their stuff which is all pretty miserableHow many articles in The Onion are based on this Woman discovers that buying that new mop did not deliver the fulfillment that she hoped it would bring to her life In other words our culture keeps us aiming pretty low Go for the quick fixGo for something that doesnt require any effort or skill on your part just money They dress it up make it sound like youll be really happy if you buy their stuffSo its important to keep in mind that there was someone in the past who found true happiness and it was through his own effortsAnd as he said it wasnt because he was a special god or anythingIt was simply through developing qualities of mind that we can all develop  man woman child lay or ordained ardency resolution heedfulnessWe all have these qualities to some extentIts simply a matter of developing themThe same with virtue concentration discernment These are things we all have to some extentIts simply a matter of learning how to make them allaroundSo when youre tempted to go for the quick but short happiness remind yourself The Buddha says that true happiness is possible and that it can be gained through human effort Do you want to live your life without exploring that possibilityOr do you just want to write it offIn this way keeping the Buddhas Awakening in mind is an important perception an important perspective to bring to all of your experiencesAnd there are many other things that you can gain by thinking about the Buddhas life the sort of person he was his last message to be heedfulHe was the sort of person who had already found true happinessHe didnt need to gain anything from anyone else but he went out and he taught for years walking around Northern IndiaWherever there was someone who was ready to be taught ready to benefit from his teachings he would walk thereThats the kind of person who taught this DhammaNot someone who was running a retreat center and needed to bring in cash and who was willing to say anything to attract clientele but someone acting totally out of pure motives pure compassionSo thats the kind of practice were practicing as we follow his pathAnd its ennobling for us to practice in that lineageSo these are good perceptions to hold in mindEspecially when youre getting discouraged or tempted to give up on the practice or if you think Well maybe Im not up to this Remember that the essential qualities for Awakening are qualities that everybody can developBut we have to develop them ourselvesWe cant depend on anyone outside to come and do it for usThats the other part of the message of the Buddhas life the part that keeps you on your toesThe second guardian meditation is goodwillYou want to bring an attitude of goodwill to everybody around youWhen the Buddha talked about goodwill in the brahmaviharas it wasnt ordinary everyday goodwillIt was goodwill all around without limitThats not easyIt doesnt come naturally to usWe tend to have goodwill for certain people and not so much for other peopleAs a result our actions very easily turn unskillfulIts very easy to do harm to the people we dont care about or who arent on our list of people who deserve to be happyAnd its also easy to drop people from the list when the mood strikes us to treat even the people we love in unskillful waysSo to protect yourself from that kind of unskillful action youve got to learn how to make your goodwill allaround That doesnt mean creating a cloud machine that sends out billowing clouds in all directions to hide your lack of goodwillWhen you start spreading thoughts of goodwill first you spread it to people who are easy  the people you already love and like  and then to people who are harderEven though you dont like them you can ask yourself Why would I not want this person to be happy After all when people arent happy they can do cruel and miserable thingsThe world would be a better place if everyone could find true happiness inside regardless of whether you like them or not or whether theyve been good or not or whether theyre on your list of the deserving And besides who made you the National Bureau of StandardsWhy should your likes and dislikes rule the worldIn this way goodwill meditation is meant to be a challenge for you to really think through why youd want to limit your goodwill and to remind yourself of why its good to have goodwill for everyoneYou cant act on harmful intentions if your goodwill is all aroundThis is why its called a guardian meditationThe third guardian meditation is of the foulness of the bodyA lot of people dont like this oneIf we took a poll of meditators here in the West wed probably find this at the bottom of the list of popular meditation topics yet its very usefulSome people say Hey Ive already got a negative body imageWhy do you want me to make it even more negative Well theres healthy negative body image as well as an unhealthy oneUnhealthy is when you see that your body is ugly but other people have beautiful bodiesHealthy is when you see that we all have the same garbage inside ourselves Nobodys liver would win the Miss Universe contestThis contemplation is helpful because its a guardianIt protects you from inappropriate lustThere are so many people out there you could feel lust for but if you acted on it youd create a lot of troubleEven if youre not practicing celibacy you need a way to guard yourself against that kind of vagrant lustSo the next time you see an attractive person instead of weaving all sorts of narratives from the ideas and associations youve developed around beauty its good to teach yourself other narratives other associationsRight under the skin what have you gotYouve got all these blood vessels and nerves and uckAnd as you go deeper its gets more uckAnd what do you gain out of lusting for thatWhy would you want itThis sort of contemplation really goes against the grain which is one of the reasons why its useful to reflect on over and over and over againAjaan Maha Boowa keeps making the point Dont count the number of times youve reflected on the foulness of the bodyJust keep doing it until its done its jobAfter all our lusting after the human body is what led us to be bornThis is what keeps us wanting to come back and it makes us do really stupid thingsSo this contemplation is a useful tool to have in your arsenalIts a useful new set of perceptions to developOur perceptions of beauty are dangerous so its good to learn how to see that beautiful bodies are not really beautifulAll you have to do is look inside a little bit and you see all kinds of stuff that can kill the lust if you really allow yourself to look at the body as a whole and not just at the few parts you tend to focus on as being attractiveThe fourth guardian meditation is recollection of deathFor most people this is pretty disturbing and depressing but its meant to be used in a way thats inspiring that helps us to follow the path beyond death to the deathlessRemind yourself that weve got this practice that allows us to prepare for death and transcend itHave you fully developed itAre you really preparedAnd the answer is almost always NoOkay then youve got work to doThis is a good antidote for lazinessTheres a great sutta where the Buddha talks about eight reasons for laziness and eight reasons for being diligent and for both lists the external conditions are the sameYou can be lazy because youre feeling sick you can be lazy because you are about to go on a trip you can be lazy because youve just gotten back from a trip you can be lazy because you just recovered from an illness you can be lazy because you havent eaten enough you can be lazy because youve eaten too muchBut you can also use those circumstances to remind yourself I dont have much time When you just recover from an illness instead of saying Im still weak Im not quite well yet let me rest you remind yourself I could get sick againI could have a relapse but at least now Ive some strength let me give this strength to the practice If you havent eaten enough remind yourself The body is light Im not spending all that time and energy digesting my food so Ive got more energy now for the practice Youve got the right conditions for sitting very quietly very stillSo your attitude is whats going to make the difference between whether the circumstances youve got right now are reasons for laziness or reasons for diligenceWhen you remind yourself that you dont know how much time youve got it should stir you to action  so that when the time comes when you really do have to go youre ready preparedYouve got the concentration youve got the power of discernment youve got the strength of mind to deal with whatever comes your wayIf you sit around saying Please may I not die please may I not die someday youll still have to die no matter how much you pleadA wiser attitude would be Please may I be ready when the time comesMay I have the strength to deal with any difficulty that might come my way Then you realize that this is something you have in your power to work on those strengthsAfter all weve got the example of how the Buddha diedThis is why these two recollections  recollection of the Buddha and recollection of death  go well togetherThe Buddha shows you how you can prepareYou look at the way he died one last trip through all the jhanasHe died with no suffering at all and gained total releaseIts possible for a human being to do thisIf you think that comparing yourself to the Buddha is too much of a stretch think about the members of the SanghaYou can read the verses of the elder monks and the elder nunsSome of them were pretty miserable total losers in meditation at first and yet they were able to pull themselves togetherThey could do it you can do itSo these four contemplations are guardian meditations to bring wisdom into your perception of things the labels and ideas you bring to your experienceThe more you develop them then the better the set of associations the better the set of narratives you bring to say just the fact youre breathing or the fact youre seeing hearing tasting or touching things in the present momentIn other words what you bring into the present moment is going to make all the differenceThis is why we train the mindThis is why we practice  so that when the time comes to perform you can perform well in a way that doesnt lead to sufferingYou bring knowledge into the equation so that no matter which factor of dependent coarising youre looking at  whether its feelings contact craving clinging or whatever  you can untangle the conditions for suffering and replace them with conditions that lead to the end of sufferingSo learn how to develop these topics along with the breathThey help put the whole practice into the right narrative into the right perspective and they protect you so that you arent constantly causing suffering for yourself and the people around youThats the best protection there isTheres a famous poem in Thailand about the amorous adventures of two men trying to outdo each other in terms of the number of women they can sleep withIts pretty light entertainment but one of its most interesting passages is when one of the men is entering the apartments of a woman hes enamored withHe opens the door and theres a folding screen painted with a storyAt that point the poem drops the story of the man and the woman and goes into the story on the screen describing not only the events depicted on the screen but also how theyre depictedIt turns out the woman herself had painted the screenSo as the man goes from panel to panel he not only learns the story but also gets a very good sense of what kind of person she is by the way she handled the scenes how she painted the charactersSo even though you havent met her yet in the poem by the time you finish the story in the screen you know her through her handiworkThis is a principle you find throughout Thai cultureBack in the old days people would learn about each other by the way they did things by the things they madeIf you were a young man and wanted to appeal to a young woman youd carve a pole for her to carry over her shoulder when carrying gifts to the monasteryAnd shed get a very good sense of what kind of person you were both by the fact that you made a pole for that purpose and by your handiwork in the way you carved itMost of us nowadays would be hopeless in a situation like thatWere not used to making thingsThis is one of our problems as meditatorsWe dont have many physical skills we havent learned the mental qualities that go with developing a physical skillSo weve got to go back and learn them from scratchThis is why the training is not just a matter of sitting and walking its a whole lifetimeAll the things you do throughout the day are opportunities to develop mindfulness alertness learning how to be meticulous in what you doTheres the saying How you do anything is how you do everything It may not be absolutely true but its closeAjaan Lee devotes almost a whole Dhamma talk to the topic of cleanlinessThe title of the talk is Reflection on Virtue or Recollection of Virtue but a good twothirds of the talk is about being cleanThats an important part of virtueIn other words while youre living here dont think that the daytoday facts of eating or having a place to sleep are minor matters to hurry through so you can get to the real business of meditatingIf youre sloppy with things outside youre going to be sloppy with your meditationIts a basic principleYou want to learn how to be meticulous clean neat alert in all the things you doIn that way the activities become not a chore to be disposed of as quickly as possible or something just getting in the way of your meditationThey become part of the meditationAfter all the word for meditation is bhavana It means to develop Youre developing qualities of mindAnd the mind that cleans your room is the same mind that tries to clean itself outIf its sloppy in cleaning the room its going to be sloppy in cleaning itself outSo youve got to take these things seriouslyI remember Ajaan Fuang telling me about his time with Ajaan Mun how Ajaan Mun was extremely meticulous very clean about everythingEven living out in the forest in the dry season when there was a lot of dust his hut and everything around it was very neat very cleanEverything was in its right placeEven the rags he used to wipe off his feet He always kept them well washedIf they got torn he would sew them upHe didnt let anything go to wasteSo try to have this attitude in all your activitiesWhen youre training the mind the mind is there not only when you meditateIts the same mind that goes through the day what you do what you say how you do your choresThose are the areas where you show the qualities of your mindThose are the areas where theyre also being developedIf youre developing sloppy lazy habits in your daytoday chores those habits are going to get in the way of your meditationIf you learn to be meticulous and neat those habits will come help your meditation  because the mind is like a large treeSome trees  like banana trees  have only one shoot at the endThey grow very fast but dont give much shadeThe trees that give a lot of shade are the ones that grow lots of branchesTheres a lot to be covered in training the mindIts not just a matter of mastering one single techniqueI was once asked the question How does someone whos mastered meditation overcome the problem of pride After all youve been able to master this technique youre pretty sharpWell that happens mainly in places where everything is reduced to a meditation technique in meditation centers where the people who meditate dont have anything else to doEverything gets channeled into that one shoot at the end of the banana treeThings may happen fast but theres no shadeIts an incomplete trainingThe complete training has to go all aroundIt has to deal with the way you treat other people how you handle difficult situationsYour whole life is part of the training and in the course of the wholelife aspect of the training you need to learn how to see how youve been sloppy how youve been stupid how youve been ignorant how youve been thoughtless and carelessIf you dont see those things youre not going to learn anythingThe experience is chastening instead of prideinducingWhen the training is complete every aspect of the mind has been trained so that youre skilled at all kinds of activities with an attitude nicely balanced between humility and prideOnce during my very first year with Ajaan Fuang the time came for the kathina which was the big event of the yearLots of people were going to come from BangkokSome of them would have to be housed for a night or two before the kathina and everybody would have to be fedI had a dream a few nights before they came that Ajaan Fuang had a huge closet with lots of different hatsHe would go into the closet and come out with one hat on then go back in and come out with a different hat onAnd sure enough in the preparation for the kathina they had to put up bamboo sheds and they had to arrange for the extra kitchen areas  lots of different tasks  and he was good at supervising them allAs later he told me Practicing the Dhamma is not just being good at sitting with your eyes closedIt involves learning how to be skillful in everything you do This attitude that wants to be skillful Thats whats going to see you through lots of different problemsIf you dont give a damn about things outside your mind is going to be a dontgiveadamn kind of mind inside as wellIt gets apathetic carelessBut if you make up your mind that whatever chore falls to you youre going to try to do it skillfully then you develop what are called the four bases for success the desire to do it skillfully the persistence that sticks with it till youve mastered it intentness paying a lot of attention to what youre doing and analysis using your powers of discernment to see whats not yet right trying to figure out how to get around problems how to solve themThis fourth factor also involves ingenuity  all the active qualities of the mindThe texts talk about these four bases of success specifically in conjunction with concentration but a common teaching all over Thailand is that if you want to succeed at anything youve got to develop these qualities of mind and apply them to whatever you have to do to succeedAnd regardless of what areas of your life you develop them in you can take them and apply them to other areas of your life as wellSo see every aspect of your life as an opportunity to train the mindIf you want to develop good strong powers of concentration its not just what you do while youre sitting with your eyes closedIts how you tackle any activity learning how to be focused on that activity learning to be strict with the mind when it starts wandering offThat way the mind is right there you learn how to keep it right there no matter what youre doingAnd when the time comes to sit down with your eyes closed well youre right thereYou dont have to go chasing the mind downSo try to see the practice as a seamless wholeThe word bhavana as I said is to develop You can develop your mind in any situationDont think that the important insights are going to come only when youre sitting with your eyes closedThere are many references to this point in the CanonOne nuns mind finally came to a good solid concentration while she was washing her feetAnd the poem in which she tells of how this happened is interestingAfter she washes her feet she goes into her hut and does all the things youre told to do in the VinayaShe checks the bed first before she sits down on it and then she takes a pin and pulls the wick out of the lamp to put out the lightAnd as soon as the fire went out she said that was the moment of her AwakeningShe said the liberation of awareness was like the liberation of the fireSo its not only when youre sitting with your eyes closed that important things can occur to the mind important insights can come or that the mind can gather into oneIts amazingSometimes the mind can really get concentrated while youre just doing a chore if you approach the chore with the proper respectSo remember that this tree of ours has lots of branches and theyre all growing at onceThings may seem slow because theyre all growing at once but at least youre getting a tree that offers really good shade once its grownThats what it means for the mind to be welltrained trained allaroundYou can watch the mind in its activities so you want to make sure that its well trained in everything it doesSome of the chants we recite in the evening are meant to inspire us and others are meant to warn us to keep us grounded to make sure we dont get lost in abstractions in ideas that are not all that relevant to where we areLike the chant on the requisitesIts there to remind us  day in day out  that when youre born youre born with a big lackYouve got this body that needs food needs clothing needs shelter needs medicine and youre not born with an entitlement to those thingsIf you were really entitled to them they would come on their ownThe fact that they seem to come on their own when were children is because our parents are looking after us but that means they have to go out and do extra work just to provide for this big gaping hole theyve just given birth toAnd so as you grow up as a human being you not only carry this huge load of needs around with you but you also carry a big debt to the goodness the work of other peopleIts important to keep that in mindPart of the reason for that chant is to give a sense of samvegaYou think about all the suffering that goes into making sure that we have the food we need to keep this body going the clothing the shelter the medicine  not only from the work we ourselves have done to get these things but also all the work and sacrifices that other beings make so that we can have themSo we come to the practice with a huge debtAnd the Buddha encourages us to have a sense of gratitude to everyone whos provided for us  materially and in terms of the Dhamma  because otherwise we get complacentTheres a saying that gratitude is the sign of a good personIf you dont appreciate the goodness of other people its hard to make that extra effort needed to be a good person yourselfSo stop and reflect every day on the debts you owe to other people and the various ways you might be able to repay those debtsThis means that you should come to the practice not with a sense of entitlement but with a sense of how much you need the Dhamma practice to help compensate for the debts youve been accumulating over timeLook at the monastery we have hereIts come about through the generosity of lots and lots of different peopleTheyve been generous with their money generous with their time generous with their strengthEverything we have here is the result of somebodys generosityOne of the reasons we need to be really active in the practice dedicated to the practice not complacent in the practice is because weve got this debtAs the Buddha once said the only people who are really debtless in this world are the arahantsAs long as we havent yet reached that point we still have a debt to other people to the other beings all around usWhatever way we can build goodness through generosity of our own observing the precepts through the meditation is a way of helping to repay that debtAt the same time theres the question of keeping this teaching aliveYou need to have a sense of how precious this is this teaching of the DhammaIts not that beings get to meet with the Dhamma every lifetimeThere are whole eons where the world has no notion of the Dhamma at allWe were born in a time when the Dhamma is still aliveThere are still people practicingThe world is not empty of arahantsSo value your opportunityThink of your debt of gratitude to all the people whove kept this teaching alive and do what you can to keep it alive for the people who come after youWhen you read Buddhist history it can sometimes be a pretty depressing project seeing how people take the Dhamma and bend it to other needs other agendas other ideasAnd yet there are always people who have a sense of the Dhammas true purpose and work to bring the tradition back in lineBut think of all the difficulties they go through like Ajaan MunIn his days the forest tradition had degeneratedIt was mainly composed of monks wandering around reciting magical spells selling amulets to peopleIt was a kind of businessBut he took the Vinaya and combined it with the forest practice and so rediscovered the way to AwakeningAt that time the Thai Buddhist hierarchy had decided that the way to nibbana was closedNobody seemed to be going that way  that was the official lineThey even had made a survey of meditation temples to prove itAnd Ajaan Mun had to prove singlehandedly that it wasnt true so you can imagine what he was up against  not only his own defilements but the disapproval of state and ecclesiastical officialsWhen you read his biography you learn just a little about the hardships he went throughSo try to develop a sense of gratitude for what he did so that you can maintain the Dhamma in your practice as wellDont be guilty of the sort of changes in the Dhamma that someone else down the line is going to have to come along and straighten outIdeally we should come to the Dhamma not with a sense of entitlement but with a sense of gratitude  a sense of how important it is and whats demanded of us to be equal to the DhammaWhen we have that attitude our Dhamma practice really starts getting resultsTheres a lot demanded of us but if we have a sense of conviction in the importance of the Dhamma well be willing to make whatever efforts requiredAjaan Fuang once told me that one of his prime motivations in practicing was that he was born into a poor familyHe didnt do well in school he was orphaned at an early age and as he was growing up he just didnt have anything to show for himself as a human beingIf you want to make your way in Thai society youve got to have a lot of good connectionsWell he had no connections and he didnt have anything else to fall back onHe realized that this was his only hope for any kind of happiness to build up the goodness that Dhamma practice can provideSo he threw himself into it and his singlemindedness was what enabled him to attain what he didAs we come to the Dhamma we need a strong sense of its importance  and a strong sense of our need for the DhammaWe come to it not because were entitled but because were in debt  to our parents to all the other living beings whove contributed to the fact that we now have a body and are still aliveLots of people talk about interconnectedness as a wonderful thing but it carries a lot of IOUsTry to think about this in a way that makes you willing and happy to repay those IOUs  understanding the need to repay them and happy that youve found a way to meet that needUse that as a motivation to keep your Dhamma practice in line to keep yourself devoted to the practiceThat way you benefitYou get the full set of benefits that can come from the practice and the people around you get a fuller sense of its benefits as wellWere often impatient at the practiceWe want to go straight to insight straight to the solution of all our problems so we can then go back home and get on with the rest of our livesBut you first have to put the mind in good shape before you can gain any insightYou have to feed it well Thats what concentration is all aboutAs the Buddha once said if you dont have the pleasure and rapture that can come from at least the first jhana youre always going to be tempted by sensualityEven if you understand the drawbacks of sensual pleasures and sensual desires if you dont have this alternative way of finding happiness youre going to go back to your old waysNo matter how much Dhamma you may have read or how precise your understanding of the intricacies of the Buddhas teachings when the time comes to feed youre going to go back and feed on the same old roadkill youve been feeding on all your lifeIts like Ajaan Chahs simile Westerners he once said are like vulturesWhen they fly they fly very high but when they eat they eat lowThats one of those quotes you dont normally see in books about Ajaan Chah but it hits homeWe in the West tend to overlook our need for the groundwork provided by concentrationThe Buddha himself compared the happiness pleasure and equanimity that come from concentration to kinds of foodHis image was of a fortress at the edge of a frontier and different qualities in the path correspond to different aspects of the fortressTheres discernment which is like a slippery wall that the enemy cant climb upLearning is like a range of weapons to fight off the enemyMindfulness is like the gatekeeper who remembers who to let in and who not to let inAnd jhana he said is like stores of foodThe first jhana is like water and grassWhen you work up to the fourth jhana youve got honey butter and gheeThese are ways of nourishing the mind and providing for its right livelihoodEven if youre not gaining any higher levels of insight at least youre finding pleasure in a blameless placeThis qualifies as right livelihood in the pathThe more pleasure the more a sense of wellbeing and stability you can develop from within then the lighter your kammic footprint on the rest of the world the less harm youre causing as you search for your livelihood both physical and mentalSo as youre practicing concentration youre developing several factors of the path at onceTheres right resolve the resolve to renounce sensuality to find a pleasure thats not involved with sensual passion right mindfulness which is the theme of right concentration and right livelihood looking after your needs in a skillful wayRight livelihood is the poor stepsister of the eightfold pathIts the factor that the Buddha hardly defines at allHe simply says the disciple of the noble ones avoids wrong livelihood and makes his or her living through right livelihood  which doesnt tell you muchPart of this may have been simply a question of etiquetteTheres only one passage in the Canon where the Buddha clearly comes out with a general statement condemning certain trades as wrong livelihoodHe lists five  trading in poison trading in weapons trading in intoxicants trading in meat and trading in human beings as slaves  saying that the disciple of the noble ones avoids themYou dont set yourself up with a shop to sell alcohol poison weapons meat or slavesBut otherwise the Buddha is very circumspect when talking about other peoples occupationsThere are two cases where people of questionable professions come to himOne is an actor the other a professional soldierThey say pretty much the same thingOur teachers who taught us to be actors the actor says claimed that if you spend your life entertaining people with your imitations of reality making them laugh youre going to attain the heaven of laughter after deathWhat does Master Gotama have to say about thatThe Buddha twice refuses to answer but the actor keeps after him and asks him a third timeSo the Buddha finally says Well it looks like I cant get anywhere with you by saying I dont want to answer thatSo Ill answer you He goes on to say that if as youre acting you give rise to greed anger and delusion in your audience and your motivation for acting is greed anger and delusion then after you die youre going to go to the hell of laughter  ie not the place where people laugh with you but where they laugh at youSo the actor breaks into tearsThe Buddha says SeeThats why I didnt want to answer your question The actor says No Im not crying because of what you saidIm just crying because Ive been deceived by my teachers for so longSimilarly with the soldierThe soldier says I was taught that if you die in battle youre going to go to the heaven of heroesWhat does Master Gotama have to say about that Again the Buddha twice refuses to answerWhen pushed for the third time he finally says When youre in the midst of battle giving rise to the desire for the killing of other beings  May these other beings suffer may they be harmed may they be killed  that mind state if you die then will take you to the hell of heroes who die in battle Like the actor the soldier breaks into tears and the Buddha says SeeThats why I didnt want to answer your question And the soldier like the actor says No Im not crying because of what you saidIm just crying because Ive been deceived for so long by my teachersThe Buddhas etiquette here is interestingHe didnt set out on a crusade against actors or professional soldiers or advertising people or whateverOnly if he was pushed would he condemn a particular occupationOtherwise what he would ask you to do is to reflect on your means of livelihoodIs it harming other beingsDoes it involve lyingDoes it involve unskillful mental statesIf it does maybe you should look for another occupation  which of course may take timeThis may have been one of the reasons why the Buddha observed that etiquette for a lot of people are stuck in their occupationIts going to take a while for them to disentangle themselves if they realize that their means of livelihood is unskillfulBut theres another side to right livelihood and thats looking at your attitude toward what you consumeThis is one of the reasons why we have that chant every evening looking back on our use of the requisites during the dayWhy did you use the requisitesActually that chant is for when you didnt reflect while you were using the requisitesIdeally you should reflect while youre eating why are you eating nowWhen you put on your clothes why are you putting these clothes onWhen you fix up your house or your hut why are you fixing it up in this wayWhen you take medicine why are you taking this particular medicine nowWhats your motivationThe chant reminds you of the ideal motivation Wear clothing to protect yourself from the elements to cover up the parts of body that cause shameTake food not to put on bulk not for the fun or the flavor of itAfter all those who provided the food that youre eating  the farmers who worked the animals who gave up their lives  didnt provide it in funYou take the food simply so you can continue practicing so you can eliminate hunger pains and yet at the same time not overstuff yourself until theres the discomfort that comes from eating too muchYoure not eating just for the flavor of the food youre eating for the nourishment of the body so that you can practice in easeYour use of shelter should simply be to protect yourself from the elements and to provide a place where you can be quiet find some privacy so you can practiceAnd as for medicine you use it to eliminate pain and to maintain freedom from disease thats allWhen you think about these things it forces you to look at your impact when you eat when you buy clothing when you buy any of these things and use them What is your impact on the worldThe fact that youre alive and breathing means that you have a lot of needs and the needs can be met only by relying on othersWhat way can you rely on others so that youre not harming them or causing them unnecessary painThis reflection ties in with one of the important principles of what are called the customs of the Noble Ones which is contentment with your material possessionsWhen you think in these ways you find that youre buying less using less because youre looking elsewhere for your happinessIe youre looking insideThis is where the concentration comes inThis is why concentration is an important element of right livelihoodIt provides you the honey the butter the grain and the other foods you need for the mind for your true happiness deep down insideAt the same time this happiness provides you with a good foundation for the insights that are going to come as you start looking at the various ways in which you keep on taking birthBecause again the fact youre taking birth is placing a burden on other beings a burden on the worldThe insights youre going to need to stop that process can be pretty harshAs the Buddha said when you take food think about the story of the couple who were going across the desert with their only childThey got more than halfway across the desert and ran totally out of foodThey realized that if they didnt eat anything all three of them would dieSo they decided to kill their child and make jerky out of the baby baby jerkyThat way at least two of them would survive and then they could start a family again when they got to the other side of the desertNow the Buddha said what would be their attitude toward the food while they were eating itWould they be eating it for funNo theyd be thinking with sorrow of what they had to do in this horrible circumstanceThat the Buddha said is how you should regard physical food not something you eat out of joy or for the flavor but simply to keep life going realizing that your having to eat causes suffering causes painThats a harsh contemplation  one of many harsh contemplations in the Buddhas teachingsThe only way the mind can stand up to that kind of contemplation is if youve got the strong sense of wellbeing that comes from nourishing the mind with right concentrationOtherwise the insights that can come from meditation if you dont have a good solid foundation like this can be disorienting destabilizingSo as the foundation for your practice you want to keep working on these skillsAppreciate the simple quality of getting the mind still finding a sense of ease simply by the way you breathe gaining a sense of wellbeing rapture equanimity when you need themIn this way you nourish the mind with good foodThats right livelihood in the highest senseIt puts you in a position where while youre still alive this time around you weigh lightly on the world around youAnd youre developing the skill so you dont have to come back and weigh the world down againThis is why the Buddhas teachings are not selfishTheyre an act of kindness both for you and for the whole world around youWhen you stop to look at your mind you begin to realize that theres a whole committee in there lots of different opinions lots of different agendasYou see this especially when youre trying to get the mind to settle downOne part of the mind decides to focus on the breath but other parts of the mind want to go other places and couldnt be bothered with anything as ordinary as the breathSo in the beginning you have to learn how to strengthen the side of the mind that wants to stayYou can do this in lots of different waysFirst you can remind yourself of why youre here of all the good things that can come through staying with the breath You develop mindfulness you develop concentration the mind gains a sense of inner peace when the concentration gets strongYou develop alertness You begin to see your own actions a lot more clearly and you sense the importance of their consequencesThis is important as its the basis for heedfulnessAnd heedfulness is so important that it was the topic of the Buddhas last wordsWatch out he saidWhen you practice you have to be carefulYou have to be heedfulYou cant be complacentThis is because your actions are importantThink about it The Buddha could have said a few last words about something wonderful or grand nibbana limitless compassion or emptinessBut instead he focused on heedfulness  the principle that your actions are important and you have to be careful about what you do because actions can take you in all sorts of different directionsThey have resultsAnd so as you meditate remind yourself that youre here to learn how to be a lot clearer about whats going on in your mindThe more steadily and consistently you can stay with the breath then the more you see in terms of all the subtle politics going on in the mind the part of the mind that wants to be heedful and the parts of the mind that dontThere are many different voices in there after all many different sides to any question not just twoSo when you settle down to be with the breath be prepared Lots of other voices will be pulling in different directionsAnd its normalDont get discouragedTry to strengthen the good voices by making the breath comfortable so that theres an immediately felt sense of ease a sense of wellbeing that comes just by sitting here breathingIt feels good to breathe in feels good to breathe outYou dont have to force the breath you dont have to hold it in you dont have to countLet the breath come in and out at whatever rhythm feels good for the bodyIf the rhythm keeps changing fine  as long as it feels goodBe on top of each breathMake sure it feels right for the body coming in and going outAs you do this you get more and more sensitive which means that you can get more and more precise in what youre doingThe more precise and sensitive you are the more absorbing the breath becomesThe easier it is to stay here so that this mindful alert faction of the mind gets strongerIt doesnt get kicked out so easilyOrdinarily when the factions of greed anger and delusion take over the mind they kick out the mindfulness and alertness they dont want anybody around watchingIts like politicians when theyre discussing a corrupt deal They dont want journalists in the room they dont want anybody to see or hear what theyre doingYou notice this when part of the mind wants to do something unskillful something it knows it shouldnt be doing It tries to kick out your alertness kick out your mindfulnessIt doesnt want to hear what they have to sayThats how it can then go ahead and do those thingsBut if mindfulness and alertness develop a strong hold here in the present moment they can refuse to budgeThey can stand in the way of any unskillful decisionsThis is why its important to keep hanging on to the breath and allowing the breath to feel good to feel clear in the different parts of the bodyThis is how you exercise mindfulness and alertness so that they grow strongWherever you can sense the breath focus on thatThen let the different breathing sensations connect so that they feel allaround goodThis gives mindfulness and alertness a really solid place to settle inAnd in this way you can turn the fact that the mind is a committee to your advantageIn other words when greed anger and delusion threaten to take over the mind they dont get the whole mindYou have another faction of the committee that says NoWe dont want to go there because we know betterThis is called having a sense of shame a sense of compunction a fear of the consequences of evilOrdinarily we dont like to hear about the word shame but its important that we understand what the Buddha meant by the word shame Its not being ashamed of yourself its being ashamed of the idea of doing something you know you shouldnt doYou realize that its beneath youIn this sense shame is a result not of low selfesteem but of high selfesteemYou know better than to do those thingsYoure not the kind of person who really wants to do those thingsSo when you have mindfulness and alertness on your side that sense of shame becomes an important protector of the mind a protector of your futureThe same with compunction the fear of the consequences of doing evil Thats a skillful type of fearIts wiseThe unskillful part of the mind says I dont care what the longterm consequences areI want pleasure right nowIm going to make my profits right now and run But a sense of compunction looks to the future and says I dont want to go thereNo matter how much fun this may be right now even if I run I wont escape the consequencesSo when mindfulness and alertness have developed this beachhead here in the present moment and can stay right here with the breath then these qualities of shame and compunction come and help strengthen your heedfulness strengthen your lack of complacency strengthen the good members of the committee the good factions of the mindYouve got a place where they can all band together and work in unisonIn the past the good members of the committee were all separatedThey didnt work togetherLike the hummingbirds at the feeder who cant band together to fight off a bigger bird they got beaten out by the other more forceful factions the unskillful factions of the committeeBut now youve given them a corner of the mind where they wont budge where they grow stronger and begin to take overWhen they take over its not that theyre going to abuse the other sideIn fact as these skillful members of the committee take over the whole committee learns that it can live more and more peacefully with itselfHaving this corner of the mind helps you step back and see the mind for what it is to see whats going wrongWithout this corner here youre totally immersed in unskillful states and cant see a way out at allBut if you remind yourself that the mind is a committee then even though unskillful things are coming up in the mind you remember that there can still be a part of you that keeps watching keeps mindful alertBy standing on the breath you gain a better perspective Youre not totally in your head youre also in your bodyThat takes you out of the backandforth of the thoughts in your mindThis separate perspective is what allows the mind to train itselfAs the Buddha said training the mind is something you have to do for yourselfOther people cant do it for youThey can point out the way but the actual work is something you have to doThere would seem to be a paradox thereIf the mind were one solid unit it wouldnt be able to teach itself anything newIf it were defiled it would be totally defiled and wouldnt be able to clean up its own actThis is the assumption behind the idea that we cant do this work ourselves that we need outside help and have to depend on some other outside powerBut the fact is that there are lots of different yous lots of different minds in the mindWhen you learn to turn that fact to your advantage  strengthening the good voices not allowing them to get pushed out when unskillful states come in  you find that the mind can train itselfIn other words the good committee members can band together and start training the less skillful ones the more shortsighted ones teaching them to look at things in a longer perspectiveThis is how you can bring the mind to a sense of unity when all the different factions realize that its in their best interest to undergo this trainingThey all start working together instead of at crosspurposesThis gives the mind strengthIf it decides to work on a project itll see the project throughIf its faced with pain and difficulty all the parts of the mind work together so that you dont cause yourself sufferingThese are some of the advantages that come from training the mind to stay with the breathIf you find it difficult to stay with the breath if you cant quite get it comfortable yet at least remind yourself that youre headed in the right directionYoure working on important skills hereEven though they may take time whatever amount of time that it takes is well invested well spentThat sense of conviction will see you through the difficult patches and remind you that theyre not always going to be that way Theyre just patchesIf you stick with the training you develop these qualities of the mind which at the beginning seem to be pretty weak  mindfulness and alertness can seem awfully ordinary and very momentary  but when you get them working together you find that they develop strengths you wouldnt have imagined beforeSit with your back straight facing straight ahead and your eyes closedPlace your hands on your lap right hand on top of your left and notice your breathingWhere do you feel the breathingWhat are the sensations in the body that tell you now the breath is coming in now the breath is going outFocus on those sensationsAllow them to feel relaxedThere will be a certain amount of tension when you first meditate because youre not used to focusing on one thing for long periods of time especially something as subtle and immediate as the breathFor the most part were more used to focusing on our ideas and emotions or on things outsideSo it takes a while for the mind to get used to being at home focusing on something inside the bodyAllow the sensation of the breathing to be as relaxed as possibleThink of the breath energy as something that already fills the bodyAs you breathe in youre simply adding more breath energy infusing it into the energy already thereWhen you breathe out youre not trying to squeeze everything outIf all of the breath were squeezed out of the body you would dieSo try to find the right balanceAt what point does an outbreath start feeling uncomfortableWhen you sense that point stop breathing out start breathing inAt what point does an inbreath start feeling uncomfortableStop there and allow yourself to breathe out againLearn how to surf the breath in the same way youd surf a waveIn other words try to maintain a balanced sense of ease in the body whether the wave tends right or leftThat sense of ease is going to be your friendWithout that sense of ease the mind starts flailing around grasping at all kinds of other thingsThe idea may seem strange but the more ease you can create for yourself inside the more youre actually creating a gift for the world around youIf you dont have this inner sense of ease and wellbeing the mind starts grasping at things outside latching on to things outside hoping to build some kind of happiness thereThat places a burden on other peopleBut when youre more selfsufficient like this youre less graspingYoure creating less of a burdenOne of the images of a wellconcentrated mind is of a lotus saturated with waterSome lotus flowers dont ever get up above the waterThey just stay immersed under the surface saturated with water from their roots up to the tipTry to think of your body as being saturated in the same way with a cool sense of easeThat lotus can be your gift both to yourself and to the people around youAt the same time youre establishing a good basis within the body for a clear mindful state of mind an alert state of mindAll too often our emotions take over the bodyWhen fear comes in theres a reaction in your heartbeatHormones start getting poured into the blood changing your heartbeat changing the way you breathe creating tension in the different muscles of the bodyWhen theres anger when theres fear all these emotions create changes in the bodyThey basically take it overThe mind then feels that its been usurped and it goes along with whatever the emotion isIts like a coupAnger comes in and it may not be well thought through it may not actually be in your best interest to act on the anger but the anger seems to have seized powerSo you go along with itThen afterwards you ask yourself Why did that happenWhy did I let myself fall for that The same with fear the same with all of these other emotions They seem to take over the mindThey start by taking over the bodySo your first tactic in learning how to counteract them is to get the body on your sideGet familiar with how good breathing feelsThen when another emotion comes in you can realize that although the emotion may create a certain reaction in the body it doesnt have to possess the whole body just as it doesnt have to possess the whole mindOrdinarily we tend to be unskillful in how we relate to our emotionsOne of the important skills in meditation is learning more skillful ways of handling themFor the most part we think we have to either give in to the emotion or else to deny that its there just totally repress it out of existenceOf course repressing it doesnt really get rid of itIt just goes underground like The Thing and sends up tentacles someplace elseAnd simply giving in to the emotion doesnt get rid of it eitherYou simply turn it into bad kamma which will come back and get you somedayBut as you meditate youre learning alternative ways of dealing with these emotions so that you dont have to give in to them but at the same time you dont pretend that they dont existYou admit that theyre there but you also admit that they dont have to take over the whole bodyThis requires concentration it requires mindfulness along with some discernment  the discernment being the realization that just because theres an emotion in the mind it doesnt mean that its your true feeling about somethingIts simply a feeling that came up a desire that came up to react in a certain wayBut you have other desires as well such as the desire not to do something foolish and unskillfulThats a desire to be cultivated and strengthenedOne way of strengthening it is to give it its corner of the body as wellThe hormones may be racing through your bloodstream but you can still determine the way youre going to breatheYou can counteract what the hormones are demanding by consciously breathing in another wayIt may not feel all that satisfying to have only one corner of the body but sometimes a wise warrior will realize that he cant defend his whole territorySo you establish a base in one part and then from that one part you can eventually reclaim the rest of your bodyThis also means developing the proper attitude when things are not going the way youd like them toProblems come up and youd rather not have those particular problemsSaunas get set on fireYoud rather not have the sauna set on fire but you dont give in to your regret for the saunaYou do what has to be done to put the fire out and keep it from spreadingStorms come in knock down treesYou dont go running around outside trying to push the trees back up in the midst of the stormYou find a safe place to stay and wait until the storm is overYou tell yourself Ill survey the damage when the storm has passed but in the mean time Ill just hunker down right here Instead of getting upset about how much damage might be done you focus on maintaining your safety and calmWeve had a couple of really bad storms here at the monastery so much wind and so much rain and all you could do was find a safe hut where you were fairly sure the hut wouldnt get blown down on top of youAs for the rest of the orchard it had to take care of itself until things were safe enough for you to come back outsideTry to develop the same attitude toward emotional storms in your mind and your bodyKeep thinking of the mind as a committeeThere are lots of people in there lots of ideas some of which are helpful some of which are actually destructive to your own wellbeingYou cant regard the destructive ones as your own true emotions or your own true ideasThey may be real but theyre not the true youAjaan Lee has a good way of thinking about these thingsHe says you have lots of germs and worms and other things in your body so maybe these thoughts coming through your brain are actually their thoughtsAfter all theyre going through your bloodstream the bloodstream is going through your brain so who knows whos responsible for thinking what thoughtJust keeping that perspective in mind helps pull you back when youre tempted to jump right into the thoughtYoure not denying that the thoughts are there you simply realize that you have the choice as to whether to take them on to develop themThe same holds true when the body isnt feeling wellYour meditation may not be going as well as youd like it to but you dont give up you dont just throw it awayYou just lower your immediate expectationsYou lower your demands on the meditationAgain like a skillful warrior When you find that you cant defend the whole territory you find one little corner that you can defend and you take that as your strongholdThis is why its very useful to have a very fluid sense of yourselfAs a meditator youre not asked to give up your sense of self totally right from the startYou just learn how to use your sense of self more skillfullyMake it more adaptableWhen some parts of the body are really painful establish your stronghold in the parts that you can make more comfortable through the way you breathe the way you relax your muscles around themThen from this position of relative strength if you have the energy you can start looking into the painLearn how to make the distinction between feeling sensations and body sensationsBody sensations are things like warmth coolness solidity energy  what are called the four elements or the four propertiesFeeling sensations are the fleeting sensations of pleasure and painThose are very different sorts of things  the feeling sensations and the body sensations  but we tend to glom them all togetherIn particular if theres a pain you tend to glom it together with sensations of solidity so that your knee is solid pain or your head is solid painThen you start using the pained parts to do your breathing which makes things even worseBut when the mind is in the right position with the right attitude you can look into the pain not with the idea of making it go away but with the idea of understanding it Okay which sensations in here are pain sensations which ones are earth liquid fire sensations If you have to hold on to something hold on to the body sensations and let the pain goLet it do its fleeting flittingaround thingOr even better hold on just to the awareness thats aware of these different sensations the question that makes these distinctions if you can separate the awareness and the question outThats where discernment comes inIf you dont have the energy to do this kind of questioning at least maintain your sense of stronghold in another part of the bodyGuard against the thoughts commenting on how long the pain or exhaustion has been going on or how much longer it might go onDont think about those things for theyre not helpful at allThe helpful thoughts are saying How do I maintain my awareness right nowHow do I deal with the sensation Im feeling right now As for the sensation of the pain you felt two seconds ago you can let it goIts not there any moreAll thats there is your memory of it and the stories youve built around itAs for how many more hours or days or weeks the pain is going to keep going on dont think about those thingsOtherwise you weigh the present moment down with too long a stretch of time too many burdens so of course its going to cave inGive it just the duty of being with the present momentThoughts of who you were in the past or who youre going to be in the future are unskillful ideas of self right nowAdjust your sense of who you are to fit the amount of wellbeing you can actually maintainThat can be your strongholdSo learn to be a warriorSometimes warriors have to admit temporary defeat sometimes they have to go into retreat but they dont totally give inThey simply adjust their tactics to deal with the situation as it presents itselfJust like the situation in Thailand when England and France were gobbling up colonies Thailand had to give up some of its provincesIt was either that or else give up its independence entirelySo the Thais were willing to make sacrifices in order to maintain at least something of their sovereigntyAs a Thai saying goes if you have to give up your arm to save your life choose your life over the armThere are times when the body is sick and you have to give up your sense of yourself as being strong and healthy  at least for the time beingOkay Im sickIve got to deal with this sickness with the tools Ive got Dont totally give inThe same with your emotions Sometimes your emotions get really strong and you have to lie lowThe emotion is there but you dont have to identify with itThis is your alternativeYou dont have to act on the emotion and you dont have to squeeze it behind a mental partition and deny that its thereYou admit that its there and then just lay claim to another part of the mind another part of the body as your stronghold for the time beingThat way even though youre in reduced circumstances youre not totally wiped outYoure still developing some very important habits the patience endurance concentration mindfulness and discernment that will serve you in good stead no matter what the situationThe Buddha never promised us that everything was going to be lovely in the present moment or that all you have to do is think nice thoughts and the world will be nice in returnHe keeps having us reflect on the fact that aging illness and death are normalThe world is swept away he saysIt does not endureIt offers no shelterThere is no one in chargeBut he says here are the tools for finding happiness in the midst of a world thats getting swept away all the timeThese are your weapons this is your strongholdJust make sure that you maintain that heart of a warrior and the wisdom of a warrior who knows which battles are worth taking on which are worth dropping which ones are worth avoidingThat wisdom is what will see you throughAs a culture we dont have much practice in being alone even though modern Western culture is unusual in the amount of privacy it offers in its homesEver since the th century people in the West have slept in private bedrooms more than at any other time in history or any other culture in historyYoud think that that would help us develop some skills in being by ourselvesBut thats very rarely the caseWhen youre alone in your room youre not really aloneBack in the th century when people started living in private bedrooms sales in novels shot upNow in the st they have all sorts of companions in their rooms books magazines TV or the InternetAnd so with all these clamorous companions we dont have much practice in being alone looking after ourselvesThat passage we chanted just now May I look after myself with ease It doesnt refer to just being physically at easeIt also means learning how to look after your own mind getting a sense of how to correct its imbalancesThis is one of the treasures that the Buddhas teachings have to offer in that it gives you some pointers in how to look after yourself how to be alone and not go crazy how not to get off balance learning how to be selfcorrecting selfgoverningSeveral years back when the book Into the Wild came out I was struck by how much the protagonist had to reinvent the Dhamma wheel in figuring out how to live an authentic life how to be alone facing the wilderness with just the company of his own mindHe didnt have many good resources to draw on a few books  a little bit of Thoreau a little bit of Tolstoy  and a lot of ideas most of which were untestedI couldnt help thinking that if hed been born in Thailand he might not have died for they have a whole tradition  the Buddhas teachings  that acts as a storehouse of wisdom on how to be aloneAnd the Sangha provides an opportunity to learn directly from people whove had lots of time alone leading a purposeful life and have come out stronger as a resultSo its good to look into the Buddhas teachings not only for techniques in the meditation but also for the attitudes you need in looking after yourselfNow the techniques are importantThey give you a good measuring stick for how things are going as youre alone they give you something specific to do a task to focus on so as to create a sense of purpose over time and of wellbeing in the present moment by being with your breathAt the very least you learn how to approach from the physical side whatever mind state is coming in and oppressing youMind states all have an effect on the breath but the breath can also have an effect on themIf youre not skillful this could become a vicious circleYou start breathing in weird ways and that puts you in a bad mood and then the bad mood makes the breathing get even stranger and you go spiraling downWorking with the techniques of breath meditation is one way of cutting those vicious circles giving you a handle on your state of mindBut its also important that you use right view in learning how to step back from your state of mind and evaluate itTo begin with right view allows you to see where your thinking has gone off courseAnd second it allows you to realize that you dont have to be immersed in a moodOne of the basic principles of right view is the principle of kamma and one of the principles of kamma is that we have freedom of choice in the present momentYet this is an area where the wrong views of our culture get in the wayWe tend to think that our moods are our real selfWe tend not to trust our thoughts because we know weve picked up a lot of ideas from the media and other people around us but our moods and emotions seem to be genuinely ours who we are in the present momentThis is where the Buddhas teachings on understanding yourself are importantYou dont have to identify with your moodThere is always a spot in the mind thats just simply aware of these thingsAnd you want to learn how to stand in that spotAgain the meditation is helpful in this regard because it teaches you to create a state of mind and then step back and look at itAs in Ajaan Lees analogy of learning how to make baskets You make a basket then you step back and look at itIs it too longToo shortIs the weaving coarse and irregularSee whats not right and then bring that observation along when you make another basket and then another oneIf you can learn to look at your moods as baskets  ie not who you really are but simply things youve created  then you can start working on the raw materials and make better onesBut its important that you have this ability to step backOne of the images in the Canon is of a person sitting down looking at someone whos lying down or a person standing whos looking at someone sitting downIn other words you step back a bit youre slightly above whats just happened and you evaluate itThats the second part of the Buddhas approach not only having a place to step back but also having good standards to evaluate thingsFor instance when youre in a bad mood there is a tendency  especially if youre in the West  to say Here I amIm finally being honest with myself and Im miserableIm horribleMy life is going nowhere We tend to think that thats getting down to the true facts of the situation because its so harshBut why should we believe thatAnd in what way is it helpfulYou might say Well its better to be realistic than living in fantasies but your bad mood is just a moodIt doesnt guarantee the truth of what you see while youre in that moodAnd its also selfdefeating for as the Buddha points out its possible to change your mood and to create moods that are a lot more useful in the practiceThats why one of the steps in breath meditation is learning how to gladden the mind when it needs to be gladdenedIn other words see where the mood is leading you and if you dont like the direction its heading realize that youre free to look at things in a different wayYoure not committed to the mood after all its not committed to youIt comes and goes without asking your permission so you dont need its permission to push it outDuring my first years as a monk this was a very important part of the training not only having the breath meditation technique to deal with whatever was coming up but also having the opportunity to talk with someone sane  Ajaan Fuang  who had a lot of experience in being alone and learning to gauge what was a healthy mood and what was an unhealthy oneHe had learned that regardless of how true you might think the mood is youve got to look at its effectsWhere is it leading youAfter all were here to follow a pathSo you can ask yourself what kind of path is a depressed moodWhat kind of path is an unhealthy moodIts not a decent path at allIts a path downward not the path you want to followSo again remind yourself that these moods are not necessarily true theyre not necessarily youTheyre like a set of clothing You can choose to put them on or you can take them offThe breath provides you with a place to step back and look at yourself the way youd look at yourself in a mirrorThe Dhamma gives you a set of standards for judging what looks good in the mirror what doesnt whats healthy and whats not  realizing that sometimes the things that were supposed to abandon at the end of the path are actually a help along the wayTheres that sutta where Ananda talks about how desire is often helpful in the path conceit can be helpful in the path  in other words the desire to do well the conceit that says Other people can do this why cant I Those are actually useful tools in the pathAll the skills we tend to associate with a healthy ego are also helpful in the pathFor example anticipation learning how to anticipate danger  ie to see the danger in wallowing in a moodIn the Buddhas language this is called heedfulnessSuppression The skills that allow you skillfully to suppress moods that you know are not helpfulYou dont repress the mood you simply realize that youre not going to go running along with whatever mood comes running into the mindIf you see that its an unskillful mood you stand your ground and use the skills of the meditation to cut it off from its sources of strengthAnd you use the skills of shame and compunction  these are skills if you know how to use them right  to remind you of why you dont really want to follow a mood that would lead you to do something unprincipled or harmfulAnother important ego skill is sublimation which means finding another kind of pleasure another way of looking at things to replace your current mood with a better oneThis is what jhana is all about providing a harmless kind of pleasure that you can tap into at all times to provide you with the food you need so that you dont go hungering after unskillful pleasuresAnother skill is humor the ability to laugh at your foibles  not in a nasty sarcastic way but in a goodnatured largehearted wayThe surest sign that youve dropped a mood is when you see how ludicrous it isAnd then theres altruism realizing that in learning to look after yourself youre also helping other peopleRemember the Buddhas famous sutta on the two acrobats where they realize If I look after my sense of balance and you look after your sense of balance thats how were going to get down safely from this pole were standing on In other words remind yourself that its not a selfish thing to know how to look after yourself youre not just gazing at your belly buttonYoure actually providing help to othersIf you cant look after yourself you become a burden to othersThis is why the Buddha in his instructions on breath meditation included the ability to gladden the mind when it needs to be gladdened  both in terms of the way you breathe and in terms of the way you learn to think and talk to yourselfThis involves your ability to step back and use the breath as a vantage point on whatever the depressed mood might be and in developing a set of values that help you to recognize that this is something you dont want to get involved withActually theres no limit to the number of the tools that can prove useful here anything youve learned about to how to change a mood  by the way you breathe by the way you look at things by what you focus on what you choose to just let goThere are also the skills of steadying the mind when the new mood youre trying to create is still unstableWhat can you do to make it more and more solidAnd then there are the skills of releasing the mind knowing how to free the mind from a relatively skillful mood to reach an even more skillful oneEven when youve developed a skillful mood you can then say Okay this can take me only so farWhat kind of mood would take me furtherTheres a passage where the Buddha talks about a meditator who finds as hes focusing on the breath that theres a fever in his mindSo he needs to change his topic for the time being to find something more inspiring more upliftingThat could include reflecting on the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha or whatever you find inspiring that relates to the practiceThen finally once youve got the mind in a much better mood when its fever has subsided you can go back to the breath and the mind can really settle downIt can drop all that thinking and go to a place thats a lot more still solid and buoyantSo when you find yourself overtaken by a mood or if youre not really sure about how you should approach the meditation when things are going poorly keep these points in mindAnd you should also keep them in mind when things are going awfully wellWe sometimes feel embarrassed to congratulate ourselves on how things are going but that embarrassment doesnt help at allRecognizing when the meditation is going well and learning how to appreciate when its going well will give you a reference pointWhen you start getting discouraged about the whole process you can remember that there were times when it went wellAnd its really worth whatever effort it takes to get it going well againSo to be able to look after your own mind and to thrive at being alone you need a whole set of skillsYou need a spot where you can step back and look at things the right set of attitudes that help you gauge the situation for what it is and then skills in creating and maintaining a better moodThis is how you look after yourself with easeThe skills that enable you to be more mature in general also help make you a more mature meditatorIn this way as you meditate you become your own best friend instead of your own worst enemyYou learn how to handle being aloneAnd its only when you can handle being alone that you can really handle being with other peopleYou dont get swept away by their ideas or their moods and you can actually become a source of stability in their lives as wellSo keep this in mind when say in the middle of an afternoon things dont seem to be going so wellGet up and walk around a bitClean out the tool shedHike up the mountainAnything that worksOne of my students a monk in Thailand once said that hed get restless sometimes when he was staying alone in the wilderness so hed hike over a few mountains just to get rid of the restlessnessAnything that works in getting you out of an unskillful mood and into a more skillful one  one thats ready to settle down  is an important part of the meditationBack when Ajaan Mun was alive scholarly monks would say of meditating monks What can they knowThey sit with their eyes closedWhat can they see Theyre still asking that question today What can meditators see with their eyes closed Of course the answer is that they see their own mindsScholarly monks would say Here we spend years looking through the books and we still dont fully understand themHow can you understand them by sitting there with your eyes closed The answer is that the real problems in life dont lie in booksBooks contain only the names of the problemsThe real problems lie in the mind which is why we sit here focusing the mind on the breath as a way of bringing the mind into the present moment where we can watch itWe turn our gaze inward instead of outwardWhat do you see when you look outwardYou see aging illness and deathYou see other peoples issues their good points their bad pointsYou see the world around you its good points its bad pointsBut those arent the things that make a real difference in your lifeThe things that make a real difference are your decisions the way you manage your own mindThis is why contentment is such an important principle in the practice contentment in terms of where you are the situation in which you find yourself contentment in terms of your various physical comforts and discomfortsHowever in terms of the people around you you need to find a group of admirable friendsEven if you find just one admirable friend youve got a lot right thereThats importantDont practice contentment with your friendsIf theyre not people who live by the Dhamma or who speak the Dhamma if theyre people who engage in lying and stealing and divisive speech abusive speech and idle chatter then you dont want to hang around with themAs the Buddha said If those are the only people you can find its better to go alone But once youve found a good admirable friend a good community in which to practice you should be willing to put up with a lot of hardshipsThink again of the time of Ajaan MunHe was way out in the forestPeople who wanted to study with him had to go walking on foot many times not even sure they were going to find him because he was frequently on the moveWhen someone showed up to practice with him he was sure that that person really wanted to practice with him because that person had already put up with a lot of hardships not only in finding him but also in staying with himAjaan Fuang once expressed a similar ideaBack in the very earliest days of Wat Dhammasathit it was very difficult to get thereThe trip from Bangkok to Rayong took almost a full day and it wasnt an easy rideFrom the highway you had to go further on six kilometers along a dirt road muddy and potholedHe said that by the time people came out to see him having gone through all that he was convinced that they were really serious about listening to what he had to teach so hed be happy to teach themHe said that it was a lot better than the days when he lived at Wat Asokaram on the outskirts of BangkokAnybody with time to kill could come out and try to kill his time tooWho knew how serious they were because it was so easy to get thereA willingness to put up with hardships is an important part of the practice but its not just a matter of gritting your teeth and bearing with themThe hardships are essential in helping you gain understandingWhen things arent going well outside where are you going to focus your attentionWell you could focus outside and just get upset about things outside but that doesnt accomplish anythingIf youre wise you learn from the hardships the lesson that youve got to focus your attention more and more inwardlyIf youre going to find happiness youve got to find it insideThis is why the great ajaans were able to find the Dhamma out in the forest They had toWe tend to have a romantic idea of the forest  peaceful green beautiful forest  because our idea of forest life has become awfully sanitizedActually there are a lot of difficulties thereThere are dangerous animals  not just the tigers that seem romantic and exciting but also the daytoday things the bugs and snakes and other animals that carry diseasesWhen youre surrounded by things like that where will you turnOur natural tendency is to want to look for happiness in terms of sounds sights smells tastes and tactile sensations but when these things arent all that pleasant where do you turnWhen you get sick and theres no doctor or medicine around where do you turnYou have to turn withinBeing able to keep the mind centered becomes a lifeanddeath matterIf you can find that sense of wellbeing within if you can stir up those resources of goodwill and discernment that youre going to need in order to live in the forest in spite of the fact that things seem to be weighing in on you from all directions thats where you really learn the strength of the Dhamma the importance of the Dhamma as a refugeThis forces you to choose your priorities Whats really important in your lifePhysical comfort or the comfort of the DhammaPleasant people who do things the way you like or people who teach you the Dhamma people who exemplify the DhammaA happiness thats based on things outside or a happiness that comes from withinDifficulties on the outside really force these issues in a way that pleasant surroundings dontYour realization of this and your willingness to act on that realization Thats what really makes a Dhamma practitioner out of you  when you finally decide that youre not going to hold anything back that this really is whats most important in life and youre going to go at it without reservationsThe Buddha gives the image of an elephant going into battleThe elephant fights with his front feet fights with his back feet fights with his front quarters and back quarters but he protects his trunk all the timeHe isnt willing to use his trunk because his trunk is his most sensitive partThe elephant trainer sees that and realizes that this elephant hasnt really given himself to the kingIts the same when you balk at discomfort Its a sign you really havent given yourself to the practiceThe willingness to put up with discomforts to thrive on them Thats the mark of a true practitioner someone who really has what they call dhammachanda desire for the Dhamma and dhammarati love for the DhammaThis is what makes all the difference in your practiceIf you hold back from the practice its going to hold things back in terms of the results youre going to receiveWe miss out on these results because our minds keep flowing outThe Buddha talks about asavas which can be translated as effluents both in the sense that they flow out and in the sense that theyre not especially cleanThe force of these currents that come flowing out of the mind can drive us all over the placeSensual desire views ignorance These currents come flowing out of the mind and we tend to ride with themYou dont really realize how strong they are because you dont try to withstand themAs a result they can push you all over the placeOnly when you decide to turn around and look at them as the main issue will you be able to work free from themThe problem is that they keep pointing outward and saying LookSee that over there and that thing over there is something you want or something you hateThey keep deflecting attention away from themselvesTheyre like politiciansPoliticians do their dirty work and then they say See that person over thereHes doing something horrible They get you all excited about the other person so you dont notice what theyre doingThis is the way the mind operatesThese asavas keep flowing out flowing out pushing you in all kinds of directionsTo withstand them as the Buddha says you have to create an island where that flood doesnt overwhelm youEven if you cant yet find the ultimate island of the transcendent you build a temporary island with mindfulness and concentration so that youre not pushed around all the timeThat means taking a stance where you areSometimes taking a stance where you are requires making some sacrificesBut thats where you make your choice whether you want to make that sacrifice or just continue going with the flowGoing with the flow seems easy because its more habitual but actually theres an awful lot of suffering in going with the effluent flowYou never know where its going to push youLike a flooding river it sometimes hits you with logs and debris or throws you up against a stone wallBut as you take your stance on your island of right here right now even though it may seem more difficult you begin to get used to it and you realize that you wouldnt want to live any other wayYou begin to appreciate the force of the effluentsYou begin to see how they push you around and you see the suffering that comes as a resultThats when you realize that you made the right choice not to continue with your old ways sloshing around in the world but actually taking a stance and keeping it solidSo it requires powers of resistanceWe usually use our powers of resistance to resist things people situations outsideWhat weve got to do is learn to resist the push that comes from within the push that makes us want to focus on things outside that distracts our attention from the real issues bubbling up in the mindThats the other translation for asava fermentation These things come bubbling up and who knows where theyre going to take you if you give in to themAs you begin to take your stance you come to see the value of not following through with those fermentations  and you see the value of contentmentYou see that once you make your choice youre going to maintain your stance here as a person who loves the Dhamma more than you love comfort or whatever the defilements are clamoring forThats when the Dhamma really shows what an excellent thing it is what a worthwhile thing it is why its the sort of thing you can give your whole life toUltimately the teaching asks nothing less than that that you give yourself totally to the practiceBut what it gives in return is more than a life far more than worth the effort you give itThe Buddha once said that if you could make a deal that someone would spear you with a hundred spears three times a day  morning noon and night  for a hundred years with the guarantee that at the end of the hundred years you would gain Awakening that would be a deal worth takingOtherwise think of all the eons of endless sufferings involved in repeatedly coming back again and againHe said that when you attained Awakening as a result of that deal you wouldnt even think that you had attained it with pain and sufferingIt would have come with joySo when you run into hardships in your daily life compare them to the three hundred spears a dayPut things into perspectiveThatll help keep you on courseWhen you meditate during the Dhamma talk  of your attention should be with your breathLet the talk be in the background  because the Dhamma is found inside the mindThe Dhamma in words is just pointersAs you listen to the talk remind yourself that the words are pointing inside your mindIf youre inside your mind paying attention to what youre doing youre already at the right placeYou dont need the talkIf you find yourself wandering outside youll run up against the talk and itll point you back in to where the real problem is ignoranceReal ignorance is not ignorance of words or principlesIts ignorance of whats going on in the mindIn particular its ignorance of how youre causing yourself sufferingIn a broader sense its ignorance of four noble truths ignorance of where theres suffering right now and of what youre doing to cause the suffering ignorance of what you could be doing to put an end to the suffering and of what the end of suffering would be likeThose are the four things you could be paying attention toTheyre things that are happening right insideTheyre not happening in the wordsThe words simply point to these things and especially to your experience of suffering something that nobody else is experiencingThat suffering is as close as you get to really purely personal experienceTheres no way you can take it out and show it to usScientists studying your brain can see all sorts of indicators that you might be in pain but they cant actually see your sufferingAnd theres no way you can compare your suffering to anyone elses to see whos suffering more exactly what it tastes like or what it feels likeBut it is something you can know for yourselfSo you should pay attention to itWhat this means is that the four noble truths are not some abstract teaching whose truth is peculiar to India years agoTheyre things happening right here right now and theyre happening very directly in your awarenessTo chip away at that ignorance you start by focusing on something more obviously happening right here right now the breathIn the Buddhas analysis of suffering ignorance conditions fabricationBodily fabrication is the breathIf you breathe with ignorance it can be a condition for sufferingIf you breathe with knowledge and awareness it can help cut through sufferingIt can help you see your ignorance more clearlyAs you see your ignorance more clearly youre replacing it with knowledgeSo when youre focused on the breath learning to breathe comfortably allowing the mind to relate in a comfortable way with the breath youre taking a stand against ignoranceAnd all the ignorant thought processes that go on through the day Youre putting up a resistance to them so that you can understand themIts through understanding them that you can go beyond them transcend themThese principles are universalThats why the Buddha called them ariyasacca which we translate as noble truthsBut the word ariya in addition to meaning noble also means standard in the sense of a universal standardSo these truths are not only noble theyre also universal standardsThey apply to all of us with no exceptionsTheyre something we all have in commonWe each experience suffering and the cause of suffering for ourselves alone but the pattern of our suffering is something we have in common which is why the path to the end of suffering is universalIt doesnt matter what country you come from what your background what your languageThe path works across the board if you apply it in all fairness if you realize that this is something that applies to you as much as it does to anyone elseMost of us like to think of ourselves as exceptions to the ruleWe like to think that its going to be different for us somehow especially when you hear of all the effort that the various ajaans put into the practiceWed rather not have to do all that workWe think that maybe things should be easier for us because were better educated or maybe we know more in our cultureWell no we dontOur problems are just the same as theirsThey may be dressed up a little bit differently in each case but at their root theyre all the sameAjaan Fuang once quoted Ajaan Mun saying that people are all alike but then if you look a little deeper you see that theyre really not but then when you look deeper still you see that they really areAjaan Fuangs comment on that was Take that and think about it for a whileThere are some differences but what we have in common is whats really importantLike the chant we had just nowAging illness death and separation These are things we all have in commonThe chant is a little bit lacking in that it simply reminds you that you are subject to aging subject to illness subject to deathOr as in the Thai translation these things are normal for youYoure subject to being separated from things that you loveLife starts out youre always learning new things gaining new things but then it reaches a point where they all start going awayWhat you do have left is your actionsYou will fall heir to what you do say and thinkAnd the results depend on whether what you do say and think is skillful or notAs the Buddha said thinking about these truths as they apply to yourself keeps you from doing unskillful thingsYou realize My gosh if I allow myself to think a lot of unskillful stuff today the results are going to seep out into my words theyre going to seep out into my actionsThen Ill start not just thinking unskillful things but also doing and saying unskillful thingsThat all begins to pile up Do you want thatNoSo these reflections are meant to keep you in line to keep you from doing harmful things to yourself harmful things to other peopleThey teach you restraintBut the original sutta in which this chant is found doesnt stop just thereIt goes on to recommend that you remind yourself that these things dont just apply to you they apply to everybody to all levels of beingNo matter where you go  this lifetime the next lifetime whatever the realm all beings that have been all beings that will be whether theyre living whether theyre dying whether theyre being reborn These principles apply to all of themAnd as the Buddha said when you think about that it not only prevents you from doing unskillful things but it gets you on the pathYou finally realize that theres no other escape from these principles of suffering and its causeAnd the path has to be the same for everybody so that the cessation would be the same for everybodyYou are not an exceptionNo matter where you go whether you would like to be reborn as a brahma or to come back as a human being whos maybe a little bit more wealthy  maybe a lot more wealthy better looking more powerful You would still be subject to these same truths no matter whatThats meant to give rise not just to restraint but also to a sense of samvega something that goes deeper a realization that the way youve been living your life really is going nowhereThe way most people live their lives goes nowhereThe only somewhere you can go is outEven thats not a place but still its a directionOtherwise life has no direction at allIt just wanders around looking at this for a while looking at that for a while  like the map charting the way a dog wanders around the neighborhood sniffing at this sniffing at that wandering over here rolling in this rolling in thatIt really goes nowhere in particular at allBut if you accept that these truths are universal then the Buddhas ready to show you the universal way outHe doesnt teach just good or bad karma or skillful or unskillful karmaHe says that there are gradations of skillful karmaIn particular theres the plain old skillful karma that keeps you in the cycle and then theres the karma that puts an end to karma that gets you out of the cycleThats the path  the path that cuts through the ignorance the path that cuts through the craving that causes sufferingThats the way outSo its up to us to decide whether we still want to dabble around to roll around in a few dead squirrels or whether weve had enough and want outIf we want out then the path is all laid out from right view on through right concentration which means that you try to endow your concentration with all the factors of the pathVirtue concentration discernment All these things should come together in your practiceSo as you focus on the breath try to do it in a virtuous wayIn other words do it with restraintRemind yourself you cant go wandering off dabbling in this dabbling in thatYouve really got to be true to the theme of your concentrationAnd your concentration should be discerning Which ways of focusing on the breath make the mind uncomfortableWhich make the breath uncomfortableWhich ways of focusing which ways of thinking about the breath which ways of labeling and understanding the breath help make it more comfortable easier to stay here so that it does become your home so that no matter where you go you have this home inside this nourishment on the pathThats how your discernment worksYou want to bring all of these qualities togetherIf you leave any of them out then the path is incompleteWhen its not complete it cant do its workSo you give it all of your mindThe word for mind in Pali  citta  also means the quality of really being intent on what you are doingAnd citta in this second sense is one of the elements of right effort one of the bases for successSo give this practice your whole mind your whole heart your full intent so that the results will be full and complete as wellWhen it comes to the issue of pleasure we prefer bothandWe dont like eitherorThe more ways we can find pleasure the more types of pleasure we can find the betterAfter all thats a lot of what pleasure is about the varietyWe dont like the idea of having to be stuck with one particular type of pleasure or of having to abandon some of the things we already like for the sake of something else we also likeWe want to have it allAs the Buddha once said even if it rained gold coins we wouldnt have enough to satisfy peoples desire for sensual pleasuresWe always want more and moreThats why we tend to be pretty stupid about the issue of pleasurePsychologists have shown that even when people know the drawbacks of a certain activity they like they still go back to it again and again and againEven when they know they have better things to do  more lasting more solid forms of pleasure they can work toward  there are still some fleeting pleasures they cant let go ofSo its not the case that when you find a better pleasure your attachments to your old lesser pleasures simply fall away like leaves off a treeThe tendency in the mind is to keep trying to gather more and more adding new pleasures to the stock of old pleasures we want to keep in storeYou can see this even among some of the least advanced of the noble ones the streamenterersThe Buddha had to counsel them to be heedfulThat was his last instructionOf all the monks gathered at the Buddhas passing away the least advanced were streamenterersAnd yet the Buddha had to counsel them to be heedfulThere are other places in the Canon where he explicitly states that even a streamenterer can be heedlessAfter all when youve reached that level you know for sure that theres a deathless that youre destined for nibbanaYoull have at most only seven more lifetimes and theyre all going to be human lifetimes at the very leastAnd a sense of security can develop around that thoughtBecause of that sense of security its possible for a streamenterer to become complacent  to say nothing of people whove simply experienced jhana or right concentrationJust the fact that youve encountered the really refined pleasures of right concentration doesnt mean that you automatically let go of your attachments to other forms of pleasureThe principle of bothand applies here as wellPeople want to enjoy their concentration along with all the other pleasures theyve managed to gather up in the course of their livesThis is why we also need discernment to remind us that there are a lot of important areas where things are eitherorIn particular discernment is needed to see the drawbacks of many of the old pleasures weve been wallowing inThis is a lesson we resistOne we dont like to be told that weve been engaging in harmful or unskillful behaviorAnd two the mind has an incredible tendency to put up walls to screen out the negative sides of our pleasuresBecause we like our pleasures so much we resist acknowledging their drawbacksI was talking recently to a monk who had been to the police morgue in Bangkok where they allow monks to come and observe autopsiesHe saw the doctors working in the morgue very efficiently going through bodies opening them up opening them up with all the guts and stuff spilling outAnd he wondered How do they still manage to go home and sleep with their wives and enjoy their old sensual pleasuresThen he walked into their office and saw girlie calendars all over the wallsThats when he understoodThey were determined to maintain the perception of the beauty of the body in spite of what they were seeing every dayThe side of the human mind that wants to maintain its old attachments It doesnt give them up easilyIt does everything it can to hold onYou give things up only when you really see that theres a direct connection between suffering and the pleasures youve been enjoying  and that theres a better alternativeOnly then will the mind begin to let goThis is the duty of discernment to see the drawbacks of these thingsThis is why right concentration on its own or jhana on its own is not enough to cut through your other attachmentsSimply because you can sit here and be very blissful very equanimous doesnt mean that youre going to see the connections between unskillful pleasures and their negative consequencesThat insight requires an act of determinationYou really have to be heedful to remind yourself that these issues are eitherorYou have to work at developing the strength and determination of discernment that can see this clearlyAjaan Chah in one of his talks refers to the knowledge of the three characteristics not as a truth not as a form of discernment but as a strengthThats what it is a strengthIt gives you a solid place where you can stand outside your attachments and really look at themFor the most part we just jump into our attachments jump into our pleasures and totally lose perspectiveWhen they slosh around we get sloshed around as wellBut being able to step back from these things gives us a solid place to standAnd that solid place to stand is a strength in the mindIt helps us to resist the temptation to go jumping back inSo this is a theme you have to contemplate over and over again the theme of eitheror together with the theme of the connections between the pleasures you enjoy and the drawbacks they carry in their wakeThis is why the path has right view right at the very beginning and why the Buddha said that of all the various strengths in the mind the strength of discernment is what holds the others togetherThe image he gives is of building a houseYoure putting up the beams to form the roof but only when the ridgepole is in place are the other beams secureUp to that point they can still sway back and forthTheyre still not quite solidBut when you finally get that ridgepole up across the top everything fits together properly and stays solidThe ridgepole is discernmentUntil discernment is strong everything else  your conviction your persistence your mindfulness your concentration  can sway back and forthYou may like your concentration but you can also like whatever else life has to offerYou treat your life like a big flower garden or a vast buffet where you can choose all the things you wantThats your preferred attitudeYou come to your senses only when you clearly see that things are eitherorThe more you let your mind go wandering around in sensual desires the harder it is to get back the harder it is to turn the concentration into something transcendentEven when youve hit the transcendent for the first time youre still not totally safeThere can still be the complacent thought that this is good enoughYouve reached the point of being a noble one for sure guaranteed against falling into the lower realms guaranteed that nibbana will be attained within seven lifetimesSo its possible to be complacent even on that levelYour work on discernment still isnt completeSo while we practice we need to develop this added strength the strength of discernmentIt helps us see connections between our pleasures and their consequences  and it also helps us to see where theres a disconnect where you have to choose one form of pleasure over anotherTheres a passage in the Dhammapada When you see a greater form of happiness that comes from abandoning a lesser form of happiness the wise person abandons the lesser form for the sake of the greater Note that not everybody does thatIts only the wise person who doesSomeone who once translated this verse said that this couldnt possibly be the meaning of the verse because its so obviousEveryone knows enough to abandon the lesser pleasure in favor of the greaterBut thats not really the caseVery few people do thisVery few people see that its an eitherorThey want the bothandandandandandThis is because were so stupid around pleasureSometimes we intentionally make ourselves stupidWe dont want to see the connection between our pleasures and their drawbacksWe dont want to see the way one pleasure fights with another is inconsistent with anotherEven when its right before our eyes we refuse to seeSo while its important that we develop concentration we also need to develop the discernment that makes it right concentration that keeps it on track that helps you to appreciate it for what it isThe pleasure of concentration is one of those rare pleasures that has no drawbacksIt may be shaky in the beginning and thats probably one of the reasons why when we start out we dont want to place all our hopes on it because we know how difficult it is to attainBut later on when it becomes easier and more consistent we can get complacent about that too thinking that we can tap into it whenever we wantSo you have to develop the discernment the strength in the mind that can help overcome both forms of complacency both reasons for wanting everything to be bothandAs long as youre still on the path the eitheror has to be kept in mindOnly the wisdom of eitheror can get you beyondIn India they have an interesting theory about why people enjoy artIts based on a distinction between an actual emotion and the taste of the emotionThey say that people enjoy art  this includes drama music literature all the fine arts  because in looking at the depiction of a particular emotion they dont actually experience the emotionThey taste itThe taste is always pleasant even when the emotion being depicted is very unpleasant fear anguish or sorrowIf its well portrayed the audience likes the depiction because they like the tasteThey taste for example the taste of grief which is not grief itself but compassionThe taste of fear is not fear but excitementSo we enjoy art not because were actually experiencing the emotion being depicted but because we like the tasteThis distinction is useful to keep in mind when you contemplate your thoughts especially when youre sitting here meditatingSometimes focusing on the breath starts to lose its appealYou lose interestEven when you get nice long periods of bliss and wellbeing part of the mind gets boredIt wants some action it wants to taste some emotionsSo you start thinking about all kinds of other thingsBut you have to remember that no matter how attractive and tasty those alternatives  all the different worlds that you can create in your mind  may seem actually living in them would be pretty miserableSo dont get beguiled by the tasteWe had an incident of this in my own familyA relative of mine was a novelist and her novels were pretty melodramaticShe liked stories filled with scandalous surprises murder incest intrigue infidelityThey made for very interesting storiesBut when in her own life she encountered some marital infidelity it was the end of herThe sorrow caused her deathSo its one thing to imagine these things but its another thing to live themAlways keep that in mindEven the stories the narratives we like to make about our own practice about the progress we expect about how well attain concentration and from concentration well quickly move on to insight and there it will be  liberation We like those stories because of the tasteWe like to read the stories of the ajaans because the stories are contrived in ways to make them very compellingTheyre designed to make you want to practiceWhat you miss in the stories though are the long days where nothing happens at all or the long fallow periods in the meditation meditations that may have been perfectly pleasant but with no ups and downs or meditations that were actually unpleasant because the mind was unwilling to settle downThose are the parts not depicted in the books but when you actually meditate everyones bound to experience those thingsSo youve got to keep a perspective on your thoughts on the stories you like to tell even about your own practiceWere here to train the mind and part of training the mind involves doing things over and over and over again pulling the mind away from distraction over and over again keeping the mind with its object over and over again taking a skill that you develop while youre meditating and learning to apply it in daily life over and over againThat may not be exciting or compelling and the mind will have a tendency to rebel sometimes but you have to ask yourself when youre rebelling Where are you going If you think of dream worlds or pleasant worlds where you could be right now ask yourself What would it actually be like to be thereTheres a great story in Ajaan Lees autobiography where he tires of being a monk and starts thinking about disrobingSo one night he decides to think seriously about disrobing whats actually going to happen what its really going to be likeHe starts out with a story that sounds pretty goodHe gets a job and then a raise in payHes doing pretty well  so well that he decides he wants the daughter of a nobleman for his wifeThat in reality would have been pretty unlikelyAjaan Lee was the son of a peasant in the northeastIts very unlikely that he would have gotten anywhere near the daughter of a noblemanBut he was able to contrive a story whereby he actually meets one and she gets attracted to him and they end up getting marriedThats when reality sets inThe daughter of a nobleman is probably very delicately brought up yet for the family to survive she would have to workSo she gets a job and she has a child but with the stresses of work and pregnancy she dies soon after childbirthHes left with the kid and her parents want nothing to do with himSo he hires a woman to be the wet nurseAt first shes good with the kid and after a while she works herself into his affectionsThey eventually get marriedBut then she has her own child and she starts playing favoritesThats when it gets really badHe comes home from work at night and the mother has one version of the days events the first child has another version and the second child has still another version of the storyTheyre all fightingAjaan Lee feels like hes being pulled in three different directionsHe thinks to himself Boy I wish I were back as a monk Then he realizes Of course Im still a monk That puts the issue of disrobing in a different lightIn other words he talked himself out of doing something foolish by allowing his dreams of disrobing to get realSo this is one way of dealing with the allure of distracting thoughtsAsk yourself If I really lived in that situation what would it be likeWhat would the constraints of that situation be When you think of the different worlds you could be going to the worlds of lay life the worlds of being a monk in the forest in Thailand While youre thinking of those worlds they seem like open opportunitiesBut you have to realize that each of those worlds has its constraints its constrictionsAnd the taste of the thought is very different from the actual emotion of being thereSo if a particular thought is really beguiling ask yourself what it would really be like to go to that particular state of beingYoud probably find yourself wishing you had some quiet time to be by yourselfBut here you already have quiet time to be by yourself so make the most of itIf thoughts of boredom come up question those thoughtsThis desire for playing around Theres a sutta in which the Buddha says that this is why beings fall from the bliss of the higher realmsThey start getting wanton and recklessThey see some of the lower realmsThey say to themselves What does that taste like Its through their carelessness and wantonness  wanting to play around a little bit wanting to sample new tastes wanting a change of scenery  that they fall and then just keep on fallingThe universe evolves not because of a divine plan but because of recklessness and irresponsibilitySo these irresponsible thoughts Watch out for themRemind yourself that when suffering comes its realAfter all its a noble truth and it really is painful it really does hurtAnd as for the anguish of the mind thats stuck in a particular situation youre outside of those situations right now so dont let yourself slip back inThis is why the Buddha says we should reflect day after day after day on the reflections we chanted just nowWere subject to aging subject to illness subject to death subject to separationThese things are real and the suffering they entail is realIn the original sutta the Buddha advises reflecting not only on that but also on the fact that all living beings are subject to these thingsNo matter where we go  in the deva realms the brahma realms whatever  were all subject to deathThat should give you a strong sense of samvega and a desire to be heedfulSamvega means a sense of dismay a sense of urgency in trying to get out of being trapped in a situationAnd heedful means watching over your actions very carefully realizing that your actions do have ramificationsTheyve been making a big deal recently about the fact that psychologists are now studying happinessWell Buddhism has been studying happiness for yearsAnd it focuses on the most important thing that most psychologists tend to ignore which is that the way you look for happiness is going to have strong ramificationsThe actions you do the things you do and say and think in order to attain happiness If youre not careful they can lead to some very unhappy resultsThey can turn around and devour youNo intention is free from ramificationsIn other words anything you do with a dishonest intention is likely to lead to an experience of sufferingEven though it may yield happiness in the short term there are longterm ramificationsYou cant get away from that factThe way most people live nowadays is based on the premise that it doesnt matter what happens down along the roadThats in the futureI want happiness right nowI want it fast So people like to be told that the only thing that matters is the present moment where thats all there is just the present momentBut your intentions in the present moment act as a cause for things further down the line on into the futureYou want to make sure that those things coming in the future will be good to experienceThis sometimes means doing things you dont like to do right now but you realize that theyll lead to a longterm happinessOr you may have to stop yourself from doing things youd like to do right now because they would lead to longterm pain  not just a tangy taste of pain but the anguish of the actual thingYour skill in talking yourself into doing what would lead to longterm happiness and into avoiding things that would lead to longterm pain Thats one of the most important skills you can develop not only in meditation but in life as a wholeSo remember the difference between the taste and the actual emotionThe taste of the emotion is always pleasant which is why we enjoy art why we enjoy works of the imagination why we enjoy our dreams and fantasiesBut the emotion itself often entails painSo you do your best not to be heedlessDont fall for the tasteWhat is attachmentIts basically a kind of addiction trying to find happiness in things that have never given a true happiness in things that arent worth the effortAnd we do it again and again and againPartly this is from a lack of imaginationWe cant imagine other ways of finding happinessPartly its from a lack of skillWe havent mastered other ways other approaches for finding happinessAnd partly its simply a lack of knowledgeWere not paying careful attention to whats going onSo in the practice we try to develop more imagination more skills more knowledgeLets start with the knowledgeWhen you find yourself addicted to a particular pleasure and yet you know it has its drawbacks look to see when the felt need for that pleasure arisesWhat sort of disease is there in the body what sort of disease is there in the mind that incites you with a sudden urge to try to alleviate that sense of disease in the same old way youve tried beforeExactly what are the triggers what are the feelingsWatch them arise watch them pass awayYoull begin to realize that the need you have say for a particular kind of food or particular kind of pleasure a particular kind of object a particular kind of relationship is not permanentIn other words if you dont give in to that old impulse the need is not going to stay thereIt goes awayIf its a basic hunger you may need to feed the body but you dont necessarily have to feed it with something thats going to cause trouble later onBut so many of our other needs last for just a little whileIf you have enough endurance to watch them from a different vantage point you can watch them go away and youre done with them for the time beingA whispering voice in your mind might say that the impulse may be gone for now but its going to return so why dont you just go ahead and give in nowBut you dont have to be intimidated by that whispering voiceYou can tell it Well deal with its return when it returnsRight now I want to get over this one hurdle If you get good at watching the need arise and pass away you develop a greater sense of detachment from itThe Buddha also says to look for the actual gratification you get out of trying to fill that need in the old wayAfter all if there wasnt any gratification at all you wouldnt go for itAnd you wont understand it enough to really let go of it if you keep trying to deny that the gratification is thereAt the same time look for the drawbacksLearn to compare the twoIs the gratification really worth the priceIf you cant think of any other way of alleviating that need or desire thats where you need to develop skill and imaginationA lot of the training is aimed at expanding your range of imaginationIts possible to find happiness in life without giving in to your old attachmentsThe more you see the drawbacks of the attachments the more willing youll be to listen to the Dhamma to expand your imagination of whats possibleThe Buddha himself said that as he was practicing the idea of having to give up his sensual pleasures didnt appeal to himBut then he allowed himself to imagine that a higher type of pleasure was possibleAnd he realized that to find that higher level of happiness that more gratifying and more rewarding level of happiness hed have to give up his sensual pleasuresSo for the time being thats what he didHe didnt totally undercut sensual passions at first but for the time being he told himself to put them asideThats how he was able to get the mind into states of concentration that provided an even deeper and more gratifying pleasure than sensual passion could provideYoull notice this as you work with the breathThere come times when just the process of breathing can feel really gratifyingTheres a very strong intense feeling of pleasure that feels almost sensualBut as the Buddha says its not sensualIt has to do with the form of the body as opposed to sights sounds smells tastes and outside tactile sensationsBut it can feel really good in a very visceral wayThats importantOnce you see that theres this possibility its easier to let go of your other desires as they ariseYouve got something betterTheres a passage where the Buddha says that the reason we get so stuck on sensual desires sensual pleasures is because we dont see any other alternative to painBut when you see that there is the alternative and as you reflect on it you see that it has fewer drawbacks greater rewards and that you can learn how to tap into it when you need it then it can be your new attachment  a much better oneIf you want to call it an addiction its a healthy addiction as opposed to the unhealthy ones youve pursued in the pastSo in the beginning its a matter of learning to imagine yourself accessing the pleasure of concentration realizing that there is that possibility and then developing the skillThat way having developed the skill your knowledge gets more preciseAfter a while you begin to see that the level of concentration youve obtained is not as gratifying as you might likeSo you can ask yourself Are there deeper more gratifying levels of concentrationWell the Buddha says there areAgain open your imagination to that idea and see whats there in your present state of concentration thats still a burden still stressful still unsatisfactoryLearn to let go of thatIn many cases this will involve abandoning some of the factors that got you into concentration to begin with  such as directed thought and evaluation  so there may be a resistance to letting them goOther times theres notYou see clearly that you dont need these things and you simply let them dropEither way the process of imagining that you can let them drop will open the way for you to go through more and more refined levels of concentration deeper more pervasive levels of pleasure and wellbeing all the way to a strong state of equanimityEven the equanimity that comes when you let go of pleasure has a very strong sense of wellbeingYou feel perfectly satisfiedYou can stay there with the stillness and it feels deep down goodIn this way you find that there are alternative ways for finding happiness in life finding pleasure in lifeYou look back at your old addictions and they seem not to make much sense any moreFrom your new perspective you wonder why you would have felt so addicted to them in the first placeIn this way the Buddha doesnt ask you just to go cold turkey with no gratification nothing to replace your old addictionHe gives you something new and viscerally pleasing to hold on toIn so doing you expand your imagination to other levels as wellYou begin to see your old ways of doing things as not so fixed or necessary as you once thought they wereYou begin to loosen up your sense of who you are and where you find your happiness and that alerts you to the fact that you can change even furtherYou feel more inclined to try out new things in the meditation even though they seem to go beyond your old ideas of what you thought was possibleThis is why the Buddha talks about nibbana primarily in metaphorical terms to excite your imaginationHes not totally silent on the topic and hes not  contrary to what most people say  willing only to discuss it in negative termsHe has some very positive things to say about it calling it shelter harbor the beyond This is to expand your imagination to encompass the possibility that theres something even beyond the pleasure the wellbeing that comes from getting the mind into good states of concentrationThis encourages you to start questioning some of your other addictions such as your sense of selfOur sense of self is basically our strategy for happinessIn the course of the practice we learn how to develop new strategiesThat means we develop different senses of ourselves as we go through the practice as we expand our repertoireA lot of people feel threatened by the Buddhas teachings on notself precisely for this reasonYour sense of self is your strategy for happinessWhen you hear the idea of notself it sounds as if the Buddha is asking you to abandon everything you know about how to find happinessNo self would leave you with no means for happiness at allThats the fearBut what hes actually doing is teaching you how to refine your strategies for happiness developing new strategies that are more effective ultimately coming up with a strategy thats actually a notself strategyIts not that radically different from what hes been teaching you on the more elementary levels because on those levels hes been teaching you to abandon your unskillful strategies the addictions that are obviously harmfulBut there comes a point in the practice where you have to learn to abandon some of the strategies that were skillful in the beginning but now are beginning to get in the way of something even more refinedSometimes you hear people treating your sense of self as an obvious fallacy that causes nothing but harm and stressIf that were the case it wouldnt take much to let go of it seeing how obviously harmful it isBut hey its part of your strategy for happinessIt has its gratificationsYouve got to admit its good sideStill there comes a point where you have to look at its drawbacks its limitationsEven your most skillful strategies for happiness at some point have to get droppedSo the Buddha gives you the positive teachings on nibbana to encourage you to let go of those things even those skillful strategies when the time comesAt the same time he refuses to say whether theres going to be a you in there or no you in thereHe wants you to develop the attitude that at this stage your sense of self is irrelevant to whether youre going to be happyBut hes not saying that you dont existWhen asked point blank if there was a self or there was no self he refused to answer saying that if you hold to the idea that there is a self you get stuck in eternalism which blocks the practice You hold on to certain things as being the eternal you and youll never be able to let them goIf you develop the idea that there is no self thats annihilationism which blocks the practice as well Either you fear being annihilated or you have a neurotic desire to want to be annihilated neither of which is helpfulSo there comes a point where you have to put issues of self and notself aside and just look at where theres stress and what activities are causing the stress and how to stop themThats why the teachings on the four noble truths trump every other teachingIts how the teachings on developing a skillful self are strategies and the teachings on notself are strategies as wellThe teachings on nibbana are strategies tooNibbana wont get you to nibbana but the desire to get there willSo learn to use these strategies to overcome your most blatant and harmful addictions and then your more subtle ones until you finally reach what the Buddha called the ultimate happiness  nibbanam paramam sukham  where you can put all your addictions all your strategies asideThere are some places in the Pali Canon where the Buddha says that the five aggregates are stressful and others where he says the five clingingaggregates are stressfulIts important to notice here that hes talking about two different kinds of stressThe sense in which the five aggregates are stressful is related to stress in terms of the three characteristicsTheyre inconstant and so theyre stressfulThats simply the way they are whether you hold on to them or notBut if you dont grab on to these things your mind doesnt sufferIts when you grab on its when you cling that stress comes into the mindYou create a clingingaggregateYou create a connectionThis is stress in terms of the four noble truthsWherever theres craving there can be clinging and the clinging to the aggregates is the stress that really weighs on the mindWhen we practice our main focus is on the stress in the four noble truths the stress that weighs on the mindIf you dont cling to the things that are stressful then they can be as stressful as they want but the stress doesnt come in and weigh you downIts like picking up a heavy objectIf you just leave it there on the ground it doesnt weigh you downIt weighs the same whether youre picking it up or notWhen you pick it up its fifty pounds when you leave it on the ground its fifty poundsThe difference is that the fifty pounds is suddenly on top of you when you pick it up and thats when you sufferThats precisely the stress the Buddha is focusing onThats the important one to noticeAlways try to be clear about this distinctionThe real problem isnt the aggregates its the clingingAnd the word clinging has a double meaningIt can also mean the act of feeding on somethingWhere we cling is where we look to feed for happinessWe look to the five aggregates for foodWe munch them down and then they munch us downWe feed on the form of the body we feed on feelings perceptions thought constructs and sensory consciousnessWhen these things are pleasant theyre not too heavyBut they can turn around and turn unpleasant very quicklyThey gobble us up for weve opened the way for them to get to usOnce you start clinging to the good ones you start clinging to the bad ones as well because thats where youre looking for foodSo its important to understand clinging so that you can put an end to itAs the Buddha said there are four kindsTheres sensual clinging clinging to views clinging to habits and practices and then clinging to doctrines of the selfAll of these hover around the five aggregatesTheyre different ways of clinging to the five aggregatesAnd the Buddha has a different cure for eachSometimes you hear that the deepest most underlying form of clinging is the sense of self identity that you build around thingsIf you learn how not to have any sense of self identity there you are Youve taken care of all the other forms of clingingSometimes you hear that clinging to views is the basic form of clingingIf you can deconstruct all your views youll be done with all the other forms of clinging as wellSo you reason your way to seeing how you cant say that things exist you cant say that things dont exist or both or neitherTheyre emptyThat means that your sensual desire is empty your habits and practices are empty your doctrines of the self are emptyWith everything empty like that theres nothing to cling toBut that doesnt work eitherAfter letting things go in this way youll find that your sensual desires werent touchedYou just turn around and pick them back upSo you have to realize that each kind of clinging has its own antidoteFor example clinging to sensuality When the Buddha talks about sensuality he doesnt say that youre attached to sights or soundsThe word kama or sensuality here doesnt mean beautiful or desirable sights sounds smells tastes or tactile sensationsIt means the plans and intentions you have around these thingsThats what were really focused onWere all attached to the ideas we have of the things we want wanting them to be a certain way to give us pleasureIn other words were more attached to our dreams and plans about sensual pleasures than we are to the sensual pleasures themselvesThis is simple enough to seeIf you find your sensual desire thwarted in one area you turn around and you focus it on something elseThe desire is what we cling toWe cling to the plans that we make for sensual pleasureAnd what are these plans likeFor the most part theyre pretty onesided and sketchySay you have designs on somebody elses bodyWhen you think about that persons body there are only certain details that you think aboutA lot of details you dont want to think about at allOr when you think about a particular relationship you think about only certain aspects of the relationship and not about othersSo the antidote here is to broaden your view to see that your pursuit of pleasure in this way carries a lot of pain along with itWhen the Buddha talks about the drawbacks of sensuality he starts with the fact that in order to lead a sensual lifestyle youve got to workThe work in and of itself is painful and wearisomeYou work and work and work to build up wealthSometimes you gain it sometimes you dontEven when you do gain it theres the fear that as he says thieves and kings will steal it  I like the way the Buddha always mentions kings and thieves in the same breath  water might wash it away fire might burn it hateful heirs could take off with itThat can easily happen to your wealthAnd as the Buddha points out its over sensuality that people fightParents fight with their children children fight with their parents brothers with sisters sisters with brothers husband with wife wife with husbandAnd not just in the family There are wars over sensual pleasures as well because we need to take wealth to pay for our passions which are far greater than all the wealth in the worldThats how we end up going to warThe Buddha goes down a long list of all the pains and sufferings tied up with this pursuit of our dreams of sensualitySo as you look at the pursuit of sensuality in its entirety you realize how much pain and suffering it involvesYou dont have to look too farThis contemplation we have of the requisites every day thinking about food clothing shelter and medicine Just the fact that we have a body makes us a burden on other peopleSo think about thatEvery time your mind starts spinning a web of sensual desire tell yourself If youre going to spin a web spin the full webTry to encompass the whole pictureLike that daydream that Ajaan Lee reports in his autobiography from the time he was planning to disrobe At first it starts out really nice he even gets a noblemans daughter for his wifeBut then the reality principle starts kicking inEventually because shes a noblemans daughter shes not up to the hard work thats required in marrying a peasants sonShe dies and leaves him with a child to raiseHe gets a second wifeThe second wife has a kid of her own and starts playing favorites abusing the first kidAnd so on down the lineWhen we bring in reality like this it helps cut through a lot of our delusions around sensuality a lot of our attachment to sensual designs sensual plans sensual dreamsOr you can contemplate the body in all its partsYou can think of a beautiful body but when you think of the parts inside you say wuuhJust a few micrometers below the skin theres all this other stuff and its inextricably connected with the things you likeSuppose you lust for somebodyYou dont like the idea of their intestines but if you took their intestines out would you like that person without any intestinesIts not worth taking either way  with or without a liver with or without a stomachSo when you think in these ways you begin to realize that your sensual plans and desires are really unrealistic really misleadingThey make you half blind so that they can take you down a path to sufferingRealizing this helps cut through the sensualityYou see how arbitrary all these dreams are that you cant rely on themThats what helps you let them goAs for clinging to views the Buddha has you follow a similar process but with different detailsThe process is that he has you look at the drawbacks that come from clinging to a view one of the major drawbacks being that you inevitably get into arguments with other peopleBut more than that the Buddha has you look carefully at the things you have views aboutThis is where the details differ and the analysis goes into more technical termsYour views come down to the question of what exists and what doesnt exist he says but when you actually look at your sensory experience you just see things arising and passing awayAs you focus on the arising the idea of nonexistence doesnt occur to youAs you focus on the passing away the idea of existence doesnt occur to youYou realize that the basic building blocks of experience when you look at them just on the level of arising and passing away dont provide a foundation for the very basic polarities of existing and notexistingOn top of that any views you build are sketches based on not looking at things very carefullySo the Buddha has you look very carefully at the process of what its like to experience thingsWhen you see that views really cant express the truth about things and that holding onto them is going to cause you to suffer you can cut through your attachment to themAs for habits and practices he first has you look at the actual habits or precepts and practices youre attached toThe attachment here is to the idea that if you follow certain rules and youre a good little boy a good little girl thats all you have to doGod will be happy with you or the universe will approve of you or whateverSo the Buddha has people look directly at their habits and practices together with their results some of which are actively harmfulBack in his days sacrifices were believed to be a way to find true happinessSo he talked about looking at the misery that comes through the sacrifices not only for the animals sacrificed but also for the people forced to labor in getting the animals killedSelftorture as a form of austerity was also a popular practice in some circlesSo he had you look at the pain that comes from it to see that it doesnt really lead anywhereIt doesnt really help cleanse the mindSo in this way hed get people to abandon harmful habits and practices and replace them with good habits and good practices the habits we adopt as part of our virtue the practices we follow in the practice of meditationBut eventually he says to watch out If youre not careful youre going to create a sense of conceit around these things the pride that comes sometimes when I follow the precepts and you dont or My jhanas better than yours The way to get beyond that attachment is not to break the precepts or drop your practice of jhanaIts simply to continue with those practices while learning how not to develop a sense of conceit around themRealize that youre doing these things not to make yourself better than other people but simply because they work in cleansing the mindFinally theres clinging to doctrines of selfThis doesnt mean just the view that I have a self whatever your sense of self might beIt also means clinging to the view that I have no self Thinking in either way the Buddha said leads you into a thicket of views that will get you entangledSo as with the cure for clinging to views the Buddha has you take the polarity of existence or nonexistence and put it asideWhen the issue of existing or notexisting is a nonissue the idea of a self existing or not existing is a nonissue as wellInstead the Buddha has you look at things simply in terms of the four noble truthsWhere is stress arisingWhat is the cause of that stressWhats the path to the end of that stressAs you divide up your experience in those terms the whole issue of who you are or who youre not just gets put asideYoure more focused on what youre doing thats causing stress learning how to comprehend the stress learning how to abandon the cause through developing the path so that ultimately you can realize the end of stress the end of sufferingThats the way out of that type of clingingSo when you find the mind clinging weighing itself down with its attachment to the aggregates try to be clear about exactly which kind of clinging youre suffering from and what the antidote is what the medicine that the Buddha prescribed because its different in each caseTheres no one blanket cure to cover every form of clingingYouve got to develop your discernment from many angles develop discernment with many facetsEssentially every approach involves seeing things in terms of being inconstant stressful and notself but those principles get applied in different ways for each type of clingingSo try to keep this list of medicines in mind and apply them as appropriateThat way you put yourself in a position where youre living in a world thats stressful but youre not pulling the stress insideYou can live surrounded by inconstancy stress and notself but not suffer from itThe Buddhas decision to go off into the forest started with his realization that he was subject to aging illness and death and yet these were the things in which he had been searching for happinessWe too are subject to aging illness and death and we tend to search for our happiness in things that age grow ill and die as wellHe however wanted a happiness that was better than that something that was more reliableThis desire was what underlay all of his efforts to find a happiness that would not age would not grow ill and would not dieOf course all of his friends and his family told him that that was impossibleBut he decided that life would not be worth living unless he gave it a trySo he worked hard for six years going down some deadend paths finding himself in blind alleys but finally he found the path that led to a happiness that did not grow ill did not age and did not dieThats what he taught for the rest of his lifeThat path  the noble eightfold path  was his first teaching and it was one of his last teachings as wellProminent in the path is right effort the kind of effort that leads to the type of happiness that he had been looking forIt starts with desire generating desire upholding your intent to let go of unskillful qualities that have arisen to prevent unskillful qualities that have not arisen from arising to give rise to skillful qualities and to maintain them and bring them to their culminationsDesire is what animates those activitiesNotice that these efforts are internal activitiesThese qualities are qualities of the mindThey will manifest themselves outside  in your thoughts words and deeds  but they come from within so thats where the main effort is focusedThis is why the section of the noble eightfold path that deals with concentration starts with right effort the effort to give rise to skillful qualities like mindfulness alertness discernmentThese are the things that are really going to help youEven if you dont make it all the way to nibbana these qualities will stand by you as the body ages as it grows ill as it diesOne of the discoveries the Buddha made on the night of his Awakening was that things dont end with deathThere is a carryoverBut its not the body that carries overIts qualities of the mindHe called these qualities noble treasures  things like conviction in the principle of action the belief that all of your intentional actions will bear fruit in line with the quality of the intention virtue a sense of shame at the idea of doing evil things a sense of compunction or fear of the consequences of doing evil things a desire for learning the ability to relinquish what gets in the way of your path and discernmentThese seven qualities are called noble treasures because as the Buddha said fire cant burn them thieves and kings cant steal them death cant kill them water cant wash them awaySo death is not the endSome things carry over but you have to focus your energies on the mind if you want to have good things to carry overOtherwise the things you carry over are badThis is why our effort here is aimed in two directionsOne if you can gain total release this is the path to total releaseTwo if you dont gain total release within this lifetime youve got things to carry over as you continue your quest in your next lifetimeBut you have to desire those qualitiesOtherwise its hard to gain them for they do require workWe may be attracted to the idea of a path that doesnt require any action or effort at all but it doesnt work that wayThe path of inaction just goes in the general way that water goes  downhill  developing bad qualities to carry over whereas the path that goes uphill requires effortRight effort doesnt require that you kill yourself or exhaust yourself but it does require an appropriate effort whatever is required to get past unskillful qualities and give rise to skillful onesThere are times when it requires a lot of concerted effortOther times it requires just the ability to sit and watchBut its always a focused effort an appropriate effort whatever the situation demandsIts built on the desire to find something that goes beyond aging illness and death something you can really rely onTo help generate that desire the Buddha has us look long and hard at aging illness and death  and at our fear of these thingsHe says that our fear of death is based on four thingsEither were attached to the body were attached to sensual pleasures we realize that weve done cruel and harmful things to other people or we havent yet seen the true Dhamma that there really is a deathlessA lot of our meditation is aimed at overcoming those four reasons for fearFor example the realization that weve done cruel things in the past The Buddha doesnt have us get tied up in remorseThe principle of kamma which sometimes sounds deterministic is actually a very fluid and complex process one with room for making changes in the present momentOne of the things you can do to counteract the harmful effects from unskillful things youve done in the past is to develop an attitude of goodwill for all beings without limitThe Buddha calls it an expansive mind stateWhen painful things happen in an expansive mind state the impact is much different from things happening in a narrow and confined mind stateThe image he gives is of a lump of salt placed in waterIf you put the lump of salt in a glass of water the water becomes unfit to drinkIf you put it in a broad clean river the water in the river is still fit to drink because theres so much more water compared to the saltSo the Buddha recommends that you develop an attitude of goodwill for all beings both because it counteracts the effects of bad actions in the past and because it prevents you from acting on unskillful intentions now and into the futureIf you really feel goodwill for all theres no way you can intentionally harm themYou dont have to like all beings you simply decide that you dont want to cause them sufferingYou dont want to take pleasure in their sufferingAs you think about it what good do you get out of other peoples sufferingYou dont gain anything at allThere may be a sense of schadenfreude but thats pretty miserable food for the mindIts better to realize that if all the cruel and heartless people in the world had a true sense of happiness they wouldnt do cruel and heartless things anymoreSo the desire for goodwill sets your attitude straight on how the world would actually become a better place for everyone Youre wishing that people would understand how to be truly happy so that theyd stop doing cruel and heartless thingsGoodwill also puts you in a position where your true happiness doesnt have to conflict with the true happiness of other peopleSo this is one way of counteracting that particular reason for fearAs for attachment to the body and to sensual pleasures the Buddha has a doublepronged attackOne prong is to see the drawbacks of being attached to these thingsIf youre attached to the body where is it going to take youIts going to take you to aging illness and death for sure no matter how much you exercise or beautify the bodyIt may take you to other places in the meantime but the ultimate end is something we all share and we all know for sure that its going to happenThe same holds true for sensual pleasuresWhere are the sensual pleasures you were enjoying last weekRight now all you have is a memory of themSometimes that memory is tainted by the realization that you did unskillful things in order to gain those pleasures or to keep themNot only do they tend to slip away on their own there are also times when other people want what youve got and theyre going to fight you for itSo you have to fight them offThe Buddha illustrates this point with the image of a hawk that has found a little lump of meatAs soon as it tries to carry it off other birds are going to come and attack itThen theres the image of a man sitting up in a fruit tree enjoying the fruit in the tree but another man comes along with a hatchetInstead of climbing the tree to get the fruit he uses the hatchet to cut the tree downIf the man in the tree doesnt come down right away hes going to get hurtThats what looking for happiness in sensual pleasures does to youIt leaves you exposed on all sides to dangerThis is why the Buddha recommends right concentration as the second prong in his attack to provide you with an alternative source for happiness so that youre not so hungry for sensual pleasuresYou can sit here and bathe the body in a sense of ease in a sense of rapture simply by focusing on the breath adjusting the breath so that its comfortable and no one is going to try to steal it from youOnce it really feels good you can just settle in letting the breath bathe you on all sides coming in and out all of the pores of the skin allowing that sense of ease and rapture to suffuse the whole bodyAs you get really adept at this your attachment to sensual pleasures begins to loosen for you see that this is a much better pleasureIts more intense more pervasive more reliable less blameworthy and a lot less dangerousSo right concentration in a very direct way is one of the ways of overcoming fear of death because you realize that you have an alternative source of pleasureBut the ultimate step in overcoming fear of death lies in seeing the true DhammaThis means realizing that there is something deathless that can be touched by the mind right where youve been experiencing the bodyIt comes not just through concentration but also through working on the opportunities for insight that the concentration providesAs the mind gets more and more still you begin to see the minds attachmentsYou can see them as activitiesEven its sense of itself or your sense of yourself is just a series of strategies youve devisedThe Buddha calls these strategies the process of Imaking and mymaking Whatever way you form a sense of self around form feelings perceptions thought constructs or consciousness its all just fabricationIn the process of fabrication theres stressIf thats all there were in life youd be willing to put up with the stress for without your selfstrategies there would be no way to find happinessBut the Buddha says that theres moreIf you can learn how to deconstruct all those fabrications all the stories and ideas the things you build around your sense of who you are and who other people are and what the world is If you can learn to deconstruct those things you find a greater happiness one that doesnt dieThats what right mindfulness and right concentration are for to provide you with a framework in which you can do the deconstructionThe deconstruction is the four noble truths just looking at things in terms of stress the cause of stress what youre doing to put an end to that causeAnd the actual end of stress comes as you get more and more precise more and more skillful at following the pathYour precision and skill lead you to detect even more and more subtle levels of fabrication going on in the mindWhen you see the stress that comes with even the subtlest fabrication and see that you also have the choice not to fabricate  that whatever gratification you got from the fabrication just cant compare with the sense of ease that comes from dropping that particular level of fabrication  the mind will be willing to let go willing to stopIn this way it peels these levels of fabrication away in the same way as youd peel away the layers of an onionWhen all intention finally ends thats when you realize that there is something deathlessThe Buddha was rightThere is something that can be touched in the mind that doesnt require fabrication  in fact its totally unfabricatedIt has nothing to do with time or space or anything that can age grow ill or die at allIts just thereIt cant be touched by the vagaries of time but it can be touched by undoing the patterns of intention and fabrication in the mindOnce youve touched that you realize that there is something that doesnt dieIt has nothing to do with you although it was through your activities and intentions  skillful intentions that took apart your other intentions  that you got to the point where you could realize thisBecause theres no need to strategize in there theres no self that comes with the felt need to strategize or the felt need to partake of the happinessThe happiness is just thereYou dont need a you to create it or to partake of itOnce youve seen that thats what really gets you beyond fear of death for the part that doesnt die is much more worthwhile than the things that doRight now these are all just ideas possibilities for people who are still struggling to get on the pathBut its important to have a sense of whats possible because that expands your imaginationAs your imagination gets expanded your desires change as wellIf you think the deathless is impossible your desires are going to focus on things that can dieBut if you open up to the possibility that there is a deathless that can be attained through human effort its a challengeHopefully it stirs some desire to follow the path to test if what the Buddha said is really trueSo keep this possibility in mind because this is what gives energy to the desire to stick with right effort to stick with the path so that the deathless is not just an idea or news of somebody elses claimsUltimately it becomes an actual experience based on your actual effortsIts not just news about what somebody else did in the pastIts your newsOf course nobody else has to knowAs the chant says its paccattam something that each person can experience only for him or herselfBut when it becomes a reality in your mind it makes a huge changeAging illness and death dont hold any fearAs one of the texts says you attain something that allows you to live in peace ease and bliss even when youre old even when youre sick even when you dieAnd thats a possibility really worth exploringWhen you start out meditating you have to think  but in a skillful wayIn other words directed thought and evaluation are factors of right concentration on the level of first jhanaEven if you can get into concentration really quickly it requires some thinking to get you thereAnd if you get into concentration slowly youve got to learn how to think your way into the concentrationSo think about the breath visualize the breath in the bodyThink about how to make the breath more comfortableOnce its comfortable think about how to spread it around in different parts of your bodyThink about the way you understand the breathThere are various levels to the breath you knowTheres the inandout breathTheres the breath energy flowing along your blood vessels flowing along your nervesTheres a still breath in the bodyThere are lots of breaths you can think aboutAnd these thoughts if you use them properly are all meant to help the mind get settled downThe Buddha once said that after all his years of false starts and deadend alleys he finally got onto the path when he realized that he should divide his thoughts into two types skillful and unskillfulThis meant that he judged his thoughts by the results they gaveHe didnt say that all thinking was badHe did say that if you thought skillful thoughts for hours the drawback would be that the body and mind would get tired so you want the mind to learn how to rest from the thinkingBut he never said that the conceptual mind is badIts simply a matter of learning how to use your concepts properlyThats the pathIts part of right view and right resolveThese factors of the path involve thoughtsSo we cant condemn thoughts entirelyWe just need to learn how to think in new ways in ways that are actually skillful that help free the mindUltimately you do get to a place thats beyond concepts that goes beyond words but you need concepts and words to help get you thereThis is a point that a lot of people misunderstandThey think that in order to get beyond concepts you just drop concepts immediatelyIts like the old simile of the raftThe version in the Buddhas teachings is that you take the raft across the riverThen once you get across the river you dont need the raft anymoreYou can put it asideThoughts of right view and thoughts of right resolve are part of the raftYou hold onto them while youre crossing the river and only then do you put them asideHowever in the Diamond Sutras version of the simile you get across the river by dropping the raft to begin withBut that version of the simile just doesnt workIf you drop the raft before youve reached the other shore you get washed awaySo learn how to use the raftThis issue goes way back to the time of the BuddhaTheres a story in the Canon about Anathapindika who was out walking in the morningHe said to himself Its too early to go visit the monks why dont I go visit the members of other sects So he went to a place where the other sectarians were having their debatesThey were debating whether the world is eternal or not whether its finite or infinite whether the soul is the same thing as the body or something different from the body whether an enlightened being exists after death or doesnt exist or both or neitherThose were the hot issues of the dayThe sectarians saw Anathapindika coming and said Hey lets be quiet for a whileThis person is a follower of the BuddhaThe Buddhas followers like quiet peopleMaybe if were quiet hell come over and talk to us So they fell quietWhen Anathapindika came they asked him SoThis Buddha youre a student of What are his views And Anathapindika said I really dont know the total extent of his views What about the monksWhat are their views And he responded I dont know totally what their views are either Then what about you they asked himWhat are your views And he responded Well Ill be happy to tell you my views but Id like to hear your views firstSo they told him their viewsOne man said The world is eternalOnly this is true everything else is false and worthless Someone else said No the world is not eternalOnly this is true everything else is false and worthless And so on down the lineAnathapindikas response was Those who hold to any of these views suffer because theyre clinging to the viewThe view is conditioned and whenever theres clinging to anything conditioned theres bound to be sufferingSo theyre clinging to stress The sectarians then said Well what about your view And he said essentially All views are conditionedWhatever is conditioned you have to let go of They said Well then by your logic your view too is a cause for suffering for youre clinging to something conditioned And he said No this is the view that leads beyond suffering because it teaches you ultimately how to let go of everything conditioned including viewsAccording to the story this left them abashedThey just sat there with their heads drooping at a loss for wordsSo he got up and leftWhen he told the Buddha what had happened the Buddha said This is a good way to deal with those peopleSo this is the Buddhas approachNot all views are a cause of sufferingRight view leads you away from suffering because it allows you to do two thingsFirst you can use it as a tool to uproot your clinging to everything elseThen because it teaches you to recognize all your attachments wherever they are it teaches you how to turn around and let go of right view itselfPeople often come to the Dhamma thinking that were here to get beyond conceptsBut they run into concepts in the Buddhas teachings and therefore they feel that the Buddhas being inconsistentWhats inconsistent though is their misunderstandingThe Buddha never says that we have to drop concepts from the very beginningHe says you use concepts to get beyond conceptsMany people in the modern world come to Buddhism suffering from their conceptual frameworkTheyre raised in a materialist worldview whose basic concepts  that life comes from nothing and returns to nothing with a brief chance to pursue pleasure in the interim  are pretty dismalThey believe that if they could free their minds from these concepts and simply dwell in the present with no thought of what happens at the end theyd be happyTheyd be able to squeeze as much pleasure out of the present as they could before the inevitable hitsSo they look for a way to be free of all conceptsWhen they come here though they run into conceptsThey see the Buddhas teachings on kamma and rebirth and they say This is invalid you cant make presuppositions about these thingsNobody knows anything about what happens before were bornNobody knows anything about what happens after we dieDoesnt the Buddha say that you have to prove things before you can accept themAll we know is that you can blot these issues out of the mind and be in the present moment without any concepts and thats happiness So thats what they want the Buddhas teachings to beThey dont realize that theyre judging the Buddhas teachings by the very concepts that are making them miserableThe idea that we cant know beyond our immediate sensory experience so therefore we just try to heighten our immediate sensory experience Thats a concept itself and although it may aim at going beyond concepts it doesnt really get you thereThe Buddhas concepts though actually give resultsTheyre very open about the fact that you have to use concepts to get beyond concepts and their idea of whats there when the path has freed you from concepts is more than just a pleasant oblivion in the presentIts another dimension entirelyThats what right view is all aboutIts there for you to judge the concepts youre bringing to the path to see which ones fit into the strategy of the path to that dimension  nibbana  and which ones dontThe Buddha never says that he can offer an empirical proof of the teachings on kamma rebirth or nibbanaBut he says that if you do adopt these ideas theyre very helpful in taking you beyond sufferingIn other words he offers a pragmatic proof He has you look at these concepts in terms of what they do where they leadIf you find that they lead you to wanting to train the mind so you can get rid of the craving that leads on to future rebirth theyve performed their functionThen as you sit down here to meditate you can put the concepts that are not immediately relevant to your meditation asideIf you find that youre having trouble sticking with the meditation you can call up those concepts again to remind yourself of why youre here to induce a feeling of samvega a dismay over the pointlessness of life as its normally lived and a feeling of pasada or confidence that if theres any way out this has got to be it training the mind learning how to watch the mind so you can see where its misunderstandings lead it to suffer where its misunderstandings lead it to crave things that are going to cause problems on down the lineAnd as for the teaching on nibbana it reminds you that freedom from suffering isnt just a total blackoutIts the highest happiness there isIn this way you can use the Buddhas insights on these topics to give more impetus to practiceAfter all were doing something important hereWere not just trying to hang out in the present moment and squeeze as much intensity out of it as we canThe Buddha says that our intentions if theyre unskillful stand in the way of the ultimate happinessSo were here to watch our intentionsThis is where the teaching of kamma is always and immediately relevant to your meditation and why the Buddha stresses the issue of kamma over and over againThe early Buddhists often made the point that their teachings on kamma were what set them apart from all the other teachings available at the timeFor instance the Buddhist take on kamma isnt the deterministic view that some people held to at that timeAnd its not a view of total chaos eitherIts a nonlinear patternAnd the important element in that nonlinear pattern is that part of your experience is shaped by past intentions and part of its shaped by your present intentionsYou cant do anything about past intentions but you can change your present onesSo you focus thereThats why were focused on the present moment to look at our intentionsWhen you have right view you realize that thats why were hereThis helps give focus to your meditationOnce the mind is still you intend to keep it stillThats a skillful intentionThen you can start looking at the process of intention in a deeper way to see exactly how intention happens how much it shapes your present experience how you fabricate your breath how you fabricate thoughts how you fabricate feelings and perceptionsYou want to look into thatThats how discernment is developedYoure not going to maintain this kind of focus unless you have a real appreciation that yes your actions really are important in this issue of creating suffering  not only now but on into the futureThis is how the proper use of concepts gives focus to your meditationA while back I was giving a talk to a group of people on kammaTheyd been meditating for quite a while so I tried to make the point that an understanding of kamma really focuses your meditation in an important wayIt helps focus you on the issue of what youre doing thats skillful and what youre doing thats not skillful and realizing how much your doing does shape your experienceThey all gave me a blank lookThen I realized that theyd been taught that there is no such thing as skillful or unskillful good or bad in the meditationIts simply a question of hanging out in the present moment squeezing as much nonconceptual intensity out of the present moment as you can  which is an idea the Buddha never advocatedThats not what were here forI mean there will be times when you notice that being very mindful in the present makes experiences more intenseYoure less caught up in your thought worlds and the pleasure in the breath grows strongerEverything becomes more immediately feltBut thats not why were hereYou want to look deeper What is it about intention that makes the difference in the present momentAlways look for that because thats where freedom is going to be found  in being sensitive to your intentionsWhen youre totally sensitive to them and totally understand how they cause stress you can let them goThis is what the Buddha calls the kamma that leads to the end of kammaThis is why an understanding of causality is so essentialIf everything were deterministic your experience would have been totally decided by some outside being or some impersonal fate a long time agoThere would be no point in practicingThere would be nothing the practice could accomplishIf on the other hand everything were chaotic you couldnt be sure that the lessons you learned yesterday would give any guidance in knowing what to do skillfully todayBut the fact that things are nonlinear and not totally determined by the past  that part of your experience is being determined by what youre choosing to focus on what youre choosing to do and say and think right now That leaves an opening for the practice because you can change what you intend right nowAnd the fact that things follow a pattern allows your knowledge of whats skillful to grow over timeWhen you believe that you act on itYou try to make your intentions more and more skillfulSo when we come to the practice we learn to adopt new concepts that have a good impact on the mindThats the test  a pragmatic testIn the beginning you begin to see that this belief does help here it does help there so you pursue it more and more persistentlyThen ultimately you discover that its a big help in putting an end to sufferingThats your real proof that the concepts work  and only then do you get beyond conceptsEven when youre in concentration once you drop directed thought and evaluation you still have perceptionsIn fact all the states of concentration up to the dimension of nothingness are based on a perception  the label you hold in mind that keeps you in that state of stillnessEven though theres no discursive thought theres still a concept thereSo the practice is a matter of learning how to use your concepts wisely picking and choosing which ones are helpful and which ones are notKnowing when you need to think discursively when you can drop discursive thought and just be with one perception Thats a skill based on right viewIf you learn how to make your views right and then apply those right views to understanding how the mind creates suffering thats how views ultimately take you beyond viewsYour right view will show you how to let go of right view when you need toBut dont be too quick to drop itDont be the sort of person who leaves the raft on the near shore and tries to float through the air over the riverUse the raft when its helpfulThats why the Buddha left it behind for usThats what its forWere born into this world without an instruction bookletTheres nothing to explain which issues in life are important which are the important things to knowWe do know when we feel suffering and we know when we feel relative ease but thats about as much as we knowAs we grow up there are people to explain things to usThis is where human beings have an advantage over animalsTheres nobody to explain anything to a dog or a cat about how to liveTheres that wonderful story by Mark Twain where the mother dog explains the human world to her puppyOf course thats fantasyWhats interesting about that story is the mother has her information all garbled upPresbyterian is the name of a dog breed heroism means agriculture  that sort of thingActually getting garbled information can be one of the dangers of the human world tooOur parents have taught us things from childhood and they may have gotten things all mixed up as wellSo there are a lot of things we dont know and we have to make a lot of decisions based on uncertain informationWhat are the important issues in lifeAnd what is this life anyhowIs it part of a longer story or is it just this story the whole story right here right now birth aging deathAnd how about our actionsWe seem to decide what to doWe seem to make choices those choices seem to have results and there seems to be some sort of pattern to the resultsSome actions seem to lead to good results other actions to bad resultsBut are things as they seemWe dont really knowSo we find ourselves acting on assumptions as to what leads to happiness and what leads to pain those two things that we do know when we experience themBut the question is is the quest for happiness really worthwhile or should we be looking for something elseTheres really no hard proof for any of these issues so we act on assumptionsWhen you come to meditate youre already acting on certain assumptionsOne is that the training of the mind is worthwhileThat means you believe that your actions are important and that knowledge and training will make a difference in how you actThose are big assumptions right there but when you look at your life youve seen that acting on those assumptions has brought you at least some happinessThats called a pragmatic proofIts not an empirical proofAn empirical proof would be able to trace the energy that goes from our decision to act to the actual action and from the action to the results that we experienceYoud have to run experiments with controls and actually be able to measure happiness in a very precise wayBut you cant do thatAll those tests that they say theyve run about measuring the happiness in different countries or measuring the happiness of people in different social groups with different levels of income When you ask people to rate their happiness on a scale from to what kind of science is thatWhats your compared to somebody elses on a scale of toSo theres really no empirical proof for any of these thingsBut there is a personal pragmatic proofYou find that when you act on certain assumptions things seem to turn out in a particular way and some assumptions lead to better results than othersThats the kind of proof that the Buddha has you act onHe teaches about the principle of action that action is real and that your intention is what determines the result of the actionThere were people in the Buddhas time who said that action was unreal that it only seemed to existBut the Buddha said to look at how those people livedDid they live as if action didnt existThey chose different courses of action and preferred some to othersThis shows that on a pragmatic level they still believed that action was important and that some actions were preferable to others some were more skillful than othersThey really would have an impact on your happinessThere were also people who said that your actions didnt really lead to happiness or painHappiness and pain were selfcaused and very arbitraryAnd yet those people had a theory all worked out as to why this was so and why it was important to believe this and how to live in response to that beliefIn other words they still believed that knowledge was important actions were important and one way of action was preferable to anotherThis is how the Buddha recommended that you look at the issue of actionWhat series of beliefs about action lead you to act in a skillful way and give good resultsTheres a sense of greater or lesser happiness that you can know only for yourselfYou cant compare your happiness with somebody elsesBut you can look insideSo the Buddha never tried to offer an empirical proof for his teaching on kamma or the teaching on rebirthThe people who claim that science has proven either of these or that they have proven these principles to themselves in an empirical way are not doing the Buddhas teachings any favorYou cant really prove these things empirically and people who really understand empirical proofs will look down on Buddhism for making that sort of claimThe Buddha himself didnt try to give an empirical proofHe did say though that if you act in certain ways you will find a greater sense of ease a greater sense of wellbeing in lifeAnd these actions will depend on certain assumptionsFor instance the question of rebirth If you believe that this life is all weve got and the end of life is uncertain would you be sitting here meditatingMaybe maybe notIts all pretty arbitraryWould you be kind to other peopleMaybe maybe notBut if you did go on the assumption that this is part of a longer story shaped by your actions and that your actions are shaped by your mind youd be sure to put more effort into training the mind to be meticulous and carefulYoud take whatever time and effort is needed to get the mind in good shapeThis is one of the reasons why the Buddha recommended that we take his teachings on kamma and rebirth as a working hypothesisHe said that he learned in the course of his Awakening that this life is actually part of a longer story of many lifetimes that have been going on for a very long time and could potentially continue going on for a very long time to comeIn other words the principle of rebirth is trueAnd its also true that one of the reasons for training the mind is ultimately to be able to put an end to that story because theres a greater happiness that comes when theres no more rebirthBut he also stated that even if this were not the case youd live a happier better life by assuming that it isSo when you wonder about the Buddhas teachings on these topics remember that were all acting on assumptionsThe problem for many of us is that our assumptions are not articulated or we havent worked out the consequences of the assumptions we have articulatedThis means that when we encounter a fully articulated assumption it may seem strangeWe have to reflect back on ourselves What are our assumptions about action about life about happiness about how the principle of causality works in our livesAnd then which assumptions really lead to the greatest happiness if we act on them if we keep our actions consistent with what we believeThats the role of faith in the Buddhist teachingsFor many of us in the West faith has gotten a bad nameWeve had it pushed on us as a virtue from some circles The less a particular proposition or idea makes sense then the more faith you have in it the better  which is a real insult to the human mindIts an insult to be told that we have to take irrational and inconsistent doctrines on faith and that we have to believe them more strongly than we believe the evidence appearing right before our eyes or in our very own heartsFortunately thats not how the Buddha teaches faithFor him even taking things on reason is a type of faithJust because something is reasonable doesnt guarantee that its going to be trueBut when something is reasonable its a lot easier to act on it and not feel torn up insideHe also asks that when you take something on faith you have to remind yourself of how little you really do knowThe assumptions you act on may seem the most reasonable and so far in your experience they may have given the best results when you act on them but the more clearly you realize that this doesnt constitute real knowledge the more youre spurred to continue practicing until you really do knowThe Buddha gives the example of an elephant hunter in the forestThe elephant hunter wants a big bull elephant to do the work he needs doneSo he goes into the forest and he sees big footprintsNow because hes an experienced elephant hunter he doesnt immediately jump to the conclusion that these must be the footprints of a bull elephantAfter all there are dwarf females with big feetThey cant do the work he wants doneBut he sees that the footprints may indicate a bull elephant so he follows themNotice thatHe does follow themHe doesnt say Well I dont really know so I might as well give upIll follow something only if I know itll lead to a bull elephant He wants the elephant but he doesnt know for sure where it isThese seem to be the most likely footprints so he follows themThen he sees scratch marks high up in the treesAgain he doesnt jump to the conclusion that those must be the marks of a big bull elephant because there are tall females with tusksThey could have made those marksBut he keeps following the tracksAnd finally he comes to a clearing where he actually sees a big bull elephantThats when he knows that hes got the elephant he wantsThe same holds true with the practiceWhen you experience the pleasure of jhana when you attain psychic powers Those are just footprints and scratch marksThe real thing is when youve had an experience of the deathlessYou realize that these assumptions that you acted on  the power of your actions the truth of causality  are principles that have held good from the time of the Buddha until nowYour assumption that if you act in certain ways the results tend to follow a pattern your assumption that its worth your while in this short and uncertain life to devote as much time as you can to the training of the mind Youve found that those assumptions workedTheyve led you to a genuine happiness you know for sureYou know that this happiness doesnt depend on the aggregates doesnt depend on space or timeIts not going to be touched by the death of the bodyThats when you know youve found the bull elephantThats when you really know that the Buddhas teachings are trueSo the realization that youre taking certain things on faith but you dont really know them Thats meant to be a spur to continue with the practiceWhatever doubts you might have are not considered a vice or something to be denied for that would create lots of dishonesty in the mindInstead you acknowledge them and take them as an incentive to practice further until you get to the point someday when you really know for yourselfFor sureIts in this way that the Buddhas teachings on kamma and rebirth are not an insult to your intelligenceInstead theyre a spur to use your intelligence even further so that you can get yourself out of the ignorance into which we are born and into the knowledge of a happiness that doesnt dieHuman life when you think about it can be pretty miserableThink of how few people actually get what they want out of life and yet how much theyre driven by their desiresSometimes their inability to get what they want can be blamed on laziness but often its because of factors totally beyond their controlA wave comes up out of the ocean washing thousands of people away and all their plans their hopes their desires get washed away as wellWhat were left with is thousands of corpses wrecked buildings  and thats just one days eventsThe days add up to years and the years to centuries centuries of frustrated desiresSo what we need is a way of dealing with frustrated desire and thats one of the gifts the Buddha offers usHe talks about the emotions that come from desireTheres grief theres joy and theres equanimityHe divides each of these into two types householder grief and renunciate grief householder joy and renunciate joy householder equanimity and renunciate equanimityHe uses these different emotions as a way of mapping out the pathMost of us live in householder grief householder joy and householder equanimityHouseholder grief is the type that comes when you dont get the sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations you wantYou dont get the ideas you wantHouseholder joy is when you finally do get what you want in terms of sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideasHouseholder equanimity is when you stay equanimous in the midst of these things whether theyre good or badMost of us muck around in these three types of emotionsWe suffer grief and so we look for joy in terms of sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideasWhen we dont get what we want that brings more grief but we turn around to look for joy in the same placesWhat the Buddha wants us to do is to turn our attention to what he calls renunciate grief renunciate joy renunciate equanimityRenunciate grief is when you reflect on how you havent attained what you want in terms of freeing the mind from sufferingYou havent reached the goal of the pathRenunciate joy is the joy that comes when you have reached the goalAnd then renunciate equanimity is the peace and equanimity that come when you know the path is completedOne of the Buddhas most interesting tactics is that when we suffer from householder grief the way to get ourselves above and beyond that is to try to transform it not into householder joy but into renunciate griefHouseholder grief and joy he says dont provide us with much hope whereas renunciate grief at least gives us some hopeIt points to the way outOne way to foster renunciate grief is to reflect on the limitations of human lifeThat chant we had just now I am subject to aging subject to illness subject to death subject to separation from all that I love followed by the reflection on kamma In the full text of the sutta the Buddha doesnt stop there with just the fact that you are subject to these thingsHe says to reflect on the fact that all people all beings  man woman child ordained or not whatever level of being youre on  are subject to these thingsThis is one of the ways the Buddha repeatedly has us approach all our grief and dissatisfactionHe says Open your eyesAre you the only person suffering these things This is his solution for the question Why me The answer of course is that its not just youIt happens to everybody with no exceptionsIts amazing what opening your eyes like this will do for youAnd its ironic how realizing the huge amount of suffering in every life can make your suffering seem lessBut it worksIt changes your whole perspectiveYou start seeing the futility of looking for your happiness in sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideasIn other words the Buddha basically wants you to transform your grief into samvega an overwhelming sense of dismay not at your own personal problems but at the nature of human existence as a wholeAnd the reason for this is that samvega motivates you to look for a way outOf course samvega on its own is not a very comfortable emotion to haveBut it provides the impetus to pasada the sense of confidence that there must be a way outThe way to work with renunciate grief is not to go looking for sights sounds and so forthYou work with it by focusing your efforts on following the pathThis is why this kind of grief is a useful griefIt keeps you on the path of practiceOften you hear people saying Dont try to push too hard in the practice dont have any sense of goal because youll get frustrated over the fact that you havent reached your goal But that closes all the doorsWhat you want is the attitude that Im not where I want to be but there is a way to get where I want to be That gives you the right sense of directionYoure not going back to householder joy with all its uncertaintiesYoure aiming at renunciate joySo whenever you find yourself asking Why me the answer is always Well why not youIt happens to everybody And what are you going to do about itYou cant just stew around in your own personal problemsYou can deal with them but the only way to do that is to open up to the larger perspective that enables you to get something out of the grief to get something out of the disappointmentThis is why Ajaan Lee focuses so much on what are called the eight worldly dhammas gain loss status loss of status praise criticism pleasure and painHe says all eight of them have their usesWe dont like the negative ones but they have their uses for developing a sense of directionWhen loss hits you if you can realize Oh this is what happens to human beings everywhere then you can take it as a lesson so that you dont get carried away by gain when gain comes backThe same with loss of status This is what happens to people when they lose statusAfter all whose was itStatus is something the world gives youYou may feel that youve earned it but if the world gives it the world can take it awayInstead of taking these things personally you use the gains you use the status for whatever purposes you find skillfulWhen you lose these things you can learn lessonsYou can turn loss to a useful purpose as wellAt the very least you learn who your true friends are both inside and outIf you got complacent when you were wealthy and powerful you can now see if complacency is really your friendThis way you can reflect on the nature of the human condition and not get carried away by the good things when they come back againThis is how the Buddha has you deal with disappointmentDont try to assuage it by looking for more pleasure in worldly things for that he says is why most people get entangled in sensualityThey dont see any other escape from pain disappointment and grief aside from scrambling after sensual pleasures worldly thingsHe tells you to set your sights in a different directionRenunciate grief even though its still a kind of grief is better than getting lost in householder grief and joy because renunciate grief can lead to renunciate joy the kind of joy thats not affected by any change at allThats why were working on the sense of ease and wellbeing that comes from having the mind in concentrationThats part of the path toward renunciate joyWe dont have to wait until the very end of the path to gain some of this joy you knowIt comes with the sense of wellbeing you gain when you center the mindThat in and of itself reminds you that there are alternatives to running after sensual pleasuresTheres the pleasure of a wellcentered mind a mind thats not affected by things that has its own internal sense of wellbeingIt doesnt need to depend on anything else outsideSo when you find yourself wallowing in grief remember the Buddhas instructions on where to take that grief what to do with it how to find a way out so that you dont stay stuck in that vicious cycle of going from grief to joy to grief to joy to grief to grief to grief based on the ups and downs of things you experience through the sensesTake that grief and point it in another directionMy English teacher during my senior year in high school once made a remark that the sign of a great person is that he or she can reflect on his or her own personal problems but then from that standpoint can generalize universalize them to the human condition as a wholeShe was talking about great poets but its also the nature of any wise mind not to wallow in its own personal issues but to generalize from them to see how this is the way it is for human beings everywhereThis was what the Buddha did on the night of his AwakeningHe remembered his past lives over many eons  if you think youre carrying around a lot of narratives imagine what he saw  but then he broadened his gaze to encompass the cosmos as a wholeHe wasnt the only one suffering rebirth after rebirthEverybody has been doing thisBut only after seeing this as a universal story was he able to see the underlying pattern People are reborn in line with the quality of their intentional actions based on right or wrong viewsThat universal insight was what enabled him to turn and look at the present moment and to look at the right place in the present moment his own views his own intentionsOnly after looking at the universal picture was he able to depersonalize the issue of suffering and its causesWhen he had depersonalized it he could look at it simply as a processWhen he viewed it as a process he was able to find the way outYoure not the first person to suffer and youre not going to be the lastIf you dont set your sights in the direction of renunciate grief and joy and equanimity youll never find a way outBut if you learn to broaden your gaze to encompass the whole human condition thats the beginning of the road to freedomSo broaden your gazeDont just look insideLook around yourself as well for there are lessons to be learned there tooWhen the Buddha taught the practice as a path one of the implications is that the path goes somewhereYou follow the path because it takes you where you want to goThat would seem obvious yet you read so many times that the path is the goal or that its a path without a goalWhat kind of path is thatIts not really a pathYou wonder whats going onThink about the story of the Buddha in his quest for Awakening It was nothing but a story of paths and goalsFirst he mastered some very high levels of concentration that his early teachers taught as the goalOne was the dimension of nothingness the other was the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionYet the Buddha realized that neither of these attainments was the goal for which he was lookingSo he left those teachers and went off to try to find another path of practice that would take him to his goal the deathless a happiness that was free from change free from aging illness and deathSo he tried the path of austerities for a while and that didnt work either  tried them for six whole yearsImagine the amount of investment he had in hoping theyd workYou dont put yourself through that kind of torment unless you think theres going to be a reward or without developing a certain amount of pride around your powers of enduranceYet after six years he realized that that path led nowhere offered no rewardSo he was willing to drop that investment drop that pride for the sake of something betterThats when he remembered the time when he was young and while his father was plowing he sat under a tree and entered the first jhanaThe question came to his mind Could this be the pathAnd his mind gave an intuitive response YesSo he followed that path and he found that it involved more than just the practice of jhana which is just one of the factors of the pathWhen he finally reached the deathless he realized that the path leading him there had seven other factorsAnd he knew this because these factors acting together brought him to the deathlessIt really did go where he wanted to goSo the first thing he taught was the path and that was his central teaching for the rest of his lifeAt one point in his later years he compared himself to a man who had gone through the jungle and found an old pathIt was all overgrown but he followed it and found that it led to an old capital city that had once been prosperousThe buildings were somewhat fallen down but they were still livableIt was still a glorious citySo he went out of the jungle and told the king Get your men to clear this path and it will take you to this wonderful glorious citySo the imagery throughout the Buddhas teachings is that if you follow this path it goes someplaceAnd the place where it goes is really special free from aging illness and death a happiness totally unconditionedBut some people have raised the question What about the Buddhas earlier attainments the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionAfter all the Buddha does point out in some of his other suttas that you can use these attainments as the path as wellBased on these attainments you can develop the discernment that leads to releaseWhats the proper attitude to have toward the Buddhas earlier attainmentsFirst remember that the Buddhas early teachers had viewed these attainments as the goalOnce you got there you just stoppedThat was itYou continued practicing these things but that was itYou didnt take them anywhere elseThe Buddha however regarded them as a path to something furtherIn other words he used them as a basis for further insightInstead of seeing them as goals he saw them as a pathHe didnt equate goals with pathHe made a clear distinctionIts like somebody scrambling through a forest and finally arriving at a good roadBut instead of following the road to a good place he just lies down in the roadThats what the Buddhas earlier teachers were doingYou know what happens when you lie down in roadsYou get run overAging illness and death can come barreling down the road at any timeSo when you get to the road you follow itYou develop your concentration together with all the other elements of the path and then you find that it really does lead to something specialSo whatever you hear about goalless paths or paths that are goals Just recently I read about a meditator who has been meditating for yearsHe calls himself an experienced meditator and he says that he hasnt gotten anywhere but thats perfectly fine with him because thats the whole point of meditation realizing theres nowhere to goI dont know which is more disheartening the fact that hes been such a lousy meditator for so long or that he feels so good about being a lousy meditatorYou cant take people like that seriouslyYou cant take them as guidesThe Buddha taught skills that get resultsThat he said is the test for any kind of practice the results it leads toWhen he taught the Kalamas he told them that when you see for yourself that following a certain practice leads to a blameless happiness follow that practiceIf you see that a practice is praised by the wise follow that practiceIf a practice leads to unskillful behavior rooted in greed anger and delusion unskillful behavior in taking life breaking any of the precepts having wrong views having greed ill will any of these things Realize that that path of practice leads you to a bad place so dont go thereFollow the path that actually gives good resultsThis whole pattern of cause and effect action and result is our guidelineIts our test for whats a good path and whats notSo when someone is bragging that they have a path that doesnt lead to results you know that theyve been following a bad pathYou look for the path that does give results and doesnt scoff at people who want resultsIts very sad when you hear about people saying Do you want happinessAn unconditioned happinessPoor you Whats wrong with wanting a happiness thats totally blameless a happiness that doesnt take anything away from anyone elseIf you dont have that kind of happiness the only kind of happiness youre going to find in life is the type that does take things from othersI was reading a while back about a teacher who said he wouldnt want to live in a world without suffering because he wouldnt then be able to exercise his compassion  which is a very selfish wish You want there to be people who are suffering so that you can enjoy being compassionate to themYour sense of wellbeing needs to feed off other peoples painWhat kind of ideal is thatThe best possible ideal is to follow a path leading to a happiness that doesnt depend on other peoples suffering in any way shape or formThen you can show that path to other people
