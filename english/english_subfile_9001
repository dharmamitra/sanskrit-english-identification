How does one cross the flood Flow does one cross the ocean
How does one go beyond misery How is one purified
By faith one crosses the flood by vigilance the ocean
By energy one goes beyond misery By wisdom one is purified
How does one obtain wisdom How does one find wealth 
How does one obtain fame  How does one bind friends to oneself
Having passed away from this world to the next world how does one not grieve
  Having faith in the doctrine of the arahats for the gaining of quenching
one obtains wisdom by willingness to hear never being negligent clever
Doing what is fitting bearing the yoke exerting oneself one finds wealth
By truth one gains fame Being generous binds friends to oneself
Whatever faithful houseseeker has these four things
truth righteousness firmness generosity he indeed does not grieve when he has passed away
Come now ask others too many ascetics and brahmans
if anything is found in this world greater than truth selfcontrol generosity and forbearance
How now could I posiibly ask many ascetics and brahmans
I now know what my future goal is
Truly for my sake the Buddha came to Alavi to stay
I now know where a gift when given bears great fruit
I shall wander from village to village from city to city
revering the fully awakened one and the essential rightness of the doctrine
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Alavi the haunt of the yakkha Alavaka
Then the yakkha Alavaka approached the Blessed One and said to him Get out ascetic
All right friend the Blessed One said and he went out
Come in ascetic
All right friend the Blessed One said and he went in
A second time
A fourth time the yakkha Alavaka said to the Blessed One Get out ascetic
I wont go out friend
Do whatever you have to do
Ill ask you a question ascetic
If you wont answer me Ill drive you insane or Ill split your heart or Ill grab you by the feet and hurl you across the Ganges
I do not see anyone in this world friend with its devas Mara and Brahma in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins its devas and humans who could drive me insane or split my heart or grab me by the feet and hurl me across the Ganges
But ask whatever you want friend
Alavaka What here is a mans best treasure What practised well brings happiness
What is really the sweetest of tastes How lives the one who they say lives best
The Blessed One Faith is here a mans best treasure Dhamma practised well brings happiness
Truth is really the sweetest of tastes One living by wisdom they say lives best
Alavaka How does one cross over the flood How does one cross the rugged sea
How does one overcome suffering How is one purified
The Blessed One By faith one crosses over the flood By diligence the rugged sea
By energy one overcomes suffering By wisdom one is purified
Alavaka How does one gain wisdom How does one find wealth
How does one achieve acclaim How bind friends to oneself
When passing from this world to the next How does one not sorrow
 The Blessed One Placing faith in the Dhamma of the arahants For the attainment of Nibbana
From desire to learn one gains wisdom If one is diligent and astute
Doing what is proper dutiful One with initiative finds wealth
By truthfulness one wins acclaim Giving one binds friends
The faithful seeker of the household life In whom dwell these four qualities
Truth Dhamma steadfastness generosity Does not sorrow when he passes on
Come now ask others as well The many ascetics and brahmins
Whether there is found here anything better Than truth selfcontrol generosity and patience
Alavaka Why now should I ask this question Of the many ascetics and brahrnins
Today I have understood The good pertaining to the future life
Indeed for my sake the Buddha came To reside at Alavi
Today I have understood Where a gift bears great fruit
I myself will travel about From village to village town to town

Thus I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Svatthi in Jetas Wood Anthapindikas Park
A certain deity then in the nights last extreme the extreme of whose brilliance set the whole of Jetas Wood aglow approached the Blessed One and after showing respect to him stood at one side
And so standing the deity addressed the Blessed One in verses thus
Gods and men there are full many That have tried to find good omens
Which they hope will bring them safety Tell then the supreme good omen
Not consorting with the foolish Rather with the wise consorting
Honouring the honourable This is a supreme good omen
Living in befitting places Having in the past made merit
Right direction in selfguidance This is a supreme good omen
Ample learning and a craft too With a welltrained disciplining
Any speech that is well spoken This is a supreme good omen
Aid for mother and for father And support for wife and children
Spheres of work that bring no conflict This is a supreme good omen
Giving TrueIdeal conduct With support for kin provided
Unexceptionable actions This is a supreme good omen
Shrinking abstinence from evil From besotting drink refraining
Diligence in True Ideals This is a supreme good omen
Then respect and humble manner With content and grateful bearing
Hearing Truth when it is timely This is a supreme good omen

Since by working suchlike omens Men are everywhere unvanquished
And go everywhere in safety That is their supreme good omen
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard
There are these three supreme objects of confidence
Which three
Among whatever beings there may be  footless twofooted fourfooted many footed with form or formless percipient nonpercipient neither percipient nor nonpercipient  the Tathagata worthy  rightly selfawakened is considered supreme
Those who have confidence in the Awakened One have confidence in what is supreme
and for those with confidence in the supreme supreme is the result
Among whatever qualities there may be fabricated or unfabricated the quality of dispassion  the subduing of intoxication the elimination of thirst the uprooting of attachment the breaking of the round the destruction of craving dispassion cessation the realization of Unbinding  is considered supreme
Those who have confidence in the quality of dispassion have confidence in what is supreme
and for those with confidence in the supreme supreme is the result
Among whatever communities or groups there may be the Sangha of the Tathagatas disciples is considered supreme  ie the four groups of noble disciples when taken as pairs the eight when taken as persons
Those who have confidence in the Sangha have confidence in what is supreme
and for those with confidence in the supreme supreme will be the result
These monks are the three supreme objects of confidence
With confidence realizing the supreme Dhamma to be supreme
confidence in the supreme Buddha unsurpassed in deserving offerings
confidence in the supreme Dhamma the stilling of dispassion bliss
confidence in the supreme Sangha unsurpassed as a field of merit
having given gifts to the supreme one develops supreme merit
supreme long life  beauty status honor bliss  strength
Having given to the supreme the wise person centered in supreme Dhamma
whether becoming a divine or human being rejoices having attained the supreme
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā River at the root of the Bodhi tree  the tree of awakening  newly awakened
And on that occasion he sat at the root of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of release
Then with the passing of seven days after emerging from that concentration in the first watch of the night he gave close attention to dependent coarising in forward order thus
When this is that is From the arising of this comes the arising of that In other words From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness From consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform From nameform as a requisite condition come the six sense media From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving From craving as a requisite condition comes clingingsustenance From clingingsustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth From birth as a requisite condition then agingdeath sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair come into play
Such is the origination of this entire mass of suffering  stress
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
As phenomena grow clear
to the brahman  ardent in jhāna 
his doubts all vanish
when he discerns a phenomenon with its cause

And on that occasion he sat at the root of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of release
Then with the passing of seven days after emerging from that concentration in the third watch of the night he gave close attention to dependent coarising in forward and reverse order thus
When this is that is From the arising of this comes the arising of that When this isnt that isnt From the cessation of this comes the cessation of that In other words From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness From consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform From nameform as a requisite condition come the six sense media From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving From craving as a requisite condition comes clingingsustenance From clingingsustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth From birth as a requisite condition then agingdeath sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair come into play

Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
As phenomena grow clear
to the brahman  ardent in jhāna 
he stands routing Māras army
as the sun illumining the sky
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migāras mother
And on that occasion the Blessed One  it being the observance day  was sitting surrounded by the community of monks
Then Ven nanda  when the night was far advanced at the end of the first watch  got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the Blessed One paying homage with his hands placed palmtopalm over his heart and said to him Lord the night is far advanced The first watch has ended The community of monks has been sitting here long May the Blessed One recite the Pāṭimokkha to them
When this was said the Blessed One remained silent
Then a second time when the night was far advanced at the end of the middle watch Ven nanda got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the Blessed One paying homage with his hands placed palmtopalm over his heart and said to him Lord the night is far advanced The second watch has ended The community of monks has been sitting here long May the Blessed One recite the Pāṭimokkha to them
When this was said the Blessed One remained silent
Then a third time when the night was far advanced at the end of the last watch as dawn was approaching and the face of the night was beaming Ven nanda got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the Blessed One paying homage with his hands placed palmtopalm over his heart and said to him Lord the night is far advanced The last watch has ended Dawn is approaching and the face of the night is beaming The community of monks has been sitting here long May the Blessed One recite the Pāṭimokkha to the community of monks
nanda the gathering isnt pure
Then the thought occurred to Ven Mahā Moggallāna In reference to which individual did the Blessed One just now say nanda the gathering isnt pure
So he directed his mind encompassing with his awareness the awareness of the entire community of monks
He saw that individual  unprincipled evil unclean and suspect in his undertakings hidden in his actions not a contemplative though claiming to be one not leading the holy life though claiming to do so inwardly rotten oozing with desire filthy by nature  sitting in the midst of the community of monks
On seeing him he got up went over to that individual and on reaching him said Get up friend You have been seen by the Blessed One You have no affiliation with the community of monks
Then the individual remained silent
A second time
A third time Ven Mahā Moggallāna said Get up friend You have been seen by the Blessed One You have no affiliation with the community of monks And for a third time the individual remained silent
Then Ven Mahā Moggallāna grabbing that individual by the arm having expelled him through the outside door of the porch and locking the bolt approached the Blessed One and on arrival said I have expelled that individual lord
The gathering is now pure
Let the Blessed One recite the Pāṭimokkha to the community of monks
Isnt it amazing Moggallāna Isnt it astounding
how that worthless man waited until he was grabbed by the arm
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks From now on I will no longer perform the observance or recite the Pāṭimokkha
From now on you alone monks will perform the observance and recite the Pāṭimokkha
It is impossible it cannot happen that a Tathāgata would perform the observance or recite the Pāṭimokkha with an impure gathering

Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Rain soddens whats covered  doesnt sodden whats open
So open up whats covered up so that it wont get soddened by the rain
If in this faith This lesson too was taught by the Blessed One while at Sāvatthi also about a Brother who gave up persevering
For when the man was brought by the Brethren exactly as in the foregoing case the Master said You Brother who after devoting yourself to this glorious doctrine which bestows Path and Fruit are giving up persevering will suffer long like the hawker of Seri who lost a golden bowl worth a hundred thousand pieces
The Brethren asked the Blessed One to explain this to them The Blessed One made clear a thing concealed from them by rebirth
Once on a time in the kingdom of Seri five aeons ago the Bodhisatta dealt in pots and pans
and was called the Serivan In the company of another dealer in the same wares a greedy fellow who was also known as the Serivan he came across the river Telavāha and entered the city of Andhapura Apportioning the streets between the two of them he set about hawking his wares round the streets of his district
and the other did the same in his district
Now in that city there was a decayed family Once they had been rich merchants but by the time of our story they had lost all the sons and brothers and all their wealth The sole survivors were a girl and her grandmother and they got their living by working for hire
Nevertheless they had got in their house the golden bowl out of which in the old days the great merchant the head of the family used to eat but it had been thrown among the pots and pans and having been long out of use was grimed over with dirt so that the two women did not know that it was gold
To the door of their house came the greedy hawker on his round crying Waterpots to sell Waterpots to sell
And the damsel when she knew he was there said to her grandmother Oh do buy me a trinket grandmother
Were very poor dear what can we offer in exchange for it
Why heres this bowl which is no good to us Let us change that for it
The old woman had the hawker brought in and seated and gave him the bowl saying Take this sir and be so good as to give your sister something or other in exchange
The hawker took the bowl in his hand turned it over and suspecting it was gold scratched a line on the back of it with a needle whereby he knew for certain that it was real gold Then thinking that he would get the pot without giving anything whatever for it to the women he cried Whats the value of this pray Why it isnt worth half a farthing And therewithal he threw the bowl on the ground rose up from his seat and left the house
Now as it had been agreed between the two hawkers that the one might try the streets which the other had already been into the Bodhisatta came into that same street and appeared at the door of the house crying Waterpots to sell
Once again the damsel made the same request of her grandmother
and the old woman replied My dear the first hawker threw our bowl on the ground and flung out of the house What have we got left to offer now
Oh but that hawker was a harshspoken man grandmother dear whilst this one looks a nice man and speaks kindly Very likely he would take it
Call him in then
So he came into the house and they gave him a seat and put the bowl into his hands
Seeing that the bowl was gold he said Mother this howl is worth a hundred thousand pieces I havent its value with me
Sir the first hawker who came here said that it was not worth half a farthing so he threw it to the ground and went away It must have been the efficacy of your own goodness which has turned the bowl into gold Take it give us something or other for it and go your way
At the time the Bodhisatta had  pieces of money and a stock worth as much more The whole of this he gave to them saying Let me retain my scales my bag and eight pieces of money And with their consent he took these with him
and departed with all speed to the riverside where he gave his eight coins to the boatman and jumped into the boat
Subsequently that greedy hawker had come back to the house and had asked them to bring out their bowl saying he would give them something or other for it
But the old woman flew out at him with these words You made out that our golden bowl which is worth a hundred thousand pieces was not worth even a halffarthing But there came an upright hawker  who gave us a thousand pieces for it and took the bowl away
Hereupon he exclaimed He has robbed me of a golden bowl worth a full hundred thousand pieces he has caused me a terrible loss And intense sorrow came upon him so that he lost command over himself and became like one distraught His money and goods he flung away at the door of the house he threw off his upper and under cloths and armed with the beam of his scales as a club he tracked the Bodhisatta down to the riverside Finding the latter already crossing he shouted to the boatman to put back
but the Bodhisatta told him not to do so
As the other stood there gazing and gazing at the retreating Bodhisatta intense sorrow seized upon him His heart grew hot blood gushed from his lips and his heart cracked like the mud at the bottom of a tank which the sun has dried up
Through the hatred which he had contracted against the Bodhisatta he perished then and there
The Bodhisatta after a life spent in charity and other good works passed away to fare according to his deserts
When the Supreme Buddha had ended this lesson he the AllKnowing One himself uttered this stanza
If in this faith you prove remiss and fail To win the goal whereto its teachings lead
Then like the hawker called the Serivan  Full long youll rue the prize your folly lost
After having thus delivered his discourse in such a way as to lead up to Arahatship the Master expounded the Four Truths at the close whereof the fainthearted Brother was established in that highest Fruit of all which is Arahatship
And after telling the two stories the Master made the connexion linking them both together and identified the Birth by saying in conclusion In those days Devadatta was the foolish hawker and I myself was the wise and good hawker
With wings that fly not This story was told by the Master whilst on an almspilgrimage through Magadha about the goingout of a jungle fire
Once the Master whilst on an almspilgrimage through Magadha went on his morning round for alms through a certain hamlet in that country on his return after his meal he went out again followed by the company of the Brethren
Just then a great fire broke out There were numbers of Brethren both in front of the Master and behind him On came the fire spreading far and wide till all was one sheet of smoke and flame
Hereupon some unconverted Brethren were seized with the fear of death Let us make a counter fire they cried and then the big fire will not sweep over the ground we have fired And with this view they set about kindling a fire with their tindersticks
But others said What is this you do Brethren You are like such as mark not the moon in midheaven or the suns orb rising with myriad rays from the east or the sea on whose shores they stand or Mount Sineru towering before their very eyeswhen as you journey along in the company of him who is peerless among devas and men alike you give not a thought to the AllEnlightened Buddha but cry out Let us make a fire You know not the might of a Buddha Come let us go to the Master
Then gathering together from front and rear alike the Brethren in a body flocked round the Lord of Wisdom
At a certain spot the Master halted with this mighty assembly of the Brethren surrounding him
On rolled the flames roaring as though to devour them
But when they approached the spot where the Buddha had taken his stand they came no nearer than sixteen lengths but there and then went outeven as a torch plunged into water It had no power to spread over a space thirtytwo lengths in diameter
The Brethren burst into praises of the Master saying Oh how great are the virtues of a Buddha For even this fire though lacking sense could not sweep over the spot where a Buddha stood but went out like a torch in water Oh how marvellous are the powers of a Buddha
Hearing their words the Master said It is no present power of mine Brethren that makes this fire go out on reaching this spot of ground
It is the power of a former Act of Truth of mine
For in this spot no fire will burn throughout the whole of this on the miracle being one which endures for an on 
Then the Elder nanda folded a robe into four and spread it for the Master to sit on The Master took his seat
Bowing to the Buddha as he sat crosslegged there the Brethren too seated themselves around him
Then they asked him saying Only the present is known to us sir the past is hidden from us Make it known to us And at their request he told this story of the past
Once upon a time in this selfsame spot in Magadha it was as a quail that the Bodhisatta came to life once more Breaking his way out of the shell of the egg in which he was born he became a young quail about as big as a large ball 
And his parents kept him lying in the nest while they fed him with food which they brought in their beaks
In himself he had not the strength either to spread his wings and fly through the air or to lift his feet and walk upon the ground
Year after year that spot was always ravaged by a junglefire and it was just at this time that the flames swept down on it with a mighty roaring The flocks of birds darting from their several nests were seized with the fear of death and flew shrieking away The father and mother of the Bodhisatta were as frightened as the others and flew away forsaking the Bodhisatta
Lying there in the nest the Bodhisatta stretched forth his neck and seeing the flames spreading towards him he thought to himself Had I the power to put forth my wings and fly I would wing my way hence to safety
or if I could move my legs and walk I could escape elsewhere afoot
Moreover my parents seized with the fear of death are fled away to save themselves leaving me here quite alone in the world
I am without protector or helper What then shall I do this day 
Then this thought came to himIn this world there exists what is termed the Efficacy of Goodness and what is termed the Efficacy of Truth There are those who through their having realised the Perfections in past ages have attained beneath the Botree to be AllEnlightened who having won Release by goodness tranquillity and wisdom possess also discernment of the knowledge of such Release who are filled with truth compassion mercy and patience whose love embraces all creatures alike whom men call omniscient Buddhas There is an efficacy in the attributes they have won And I too grasp one truth I hold and believe in a single principle in Nature Therefore it behoves me to call to mind the Buddhas of the past and the Efficacy they have won and to lay hold of the true belief that is in me touching the principle of Nature and by an Act of Truth to make the flames go back to the saving both of myself and of the rest of the birds
Therefore it has been said
Theres saving grace in Goodness in this world Theres truth compassion purity of life
Thereby Ill work a matchless Act of Truth
Remembering Faiths might and taking thought On those who triumphed in the days gone by
Strong in the truth an Act of Truth I wrought
Accordingly the Bodhisatta calling to mind the efficacy of the Buddhas long since past away performed an Act of Truth in the name of the true faith that was in him repeating this stanza
With wings that fly not feet that walk not yet
Forsaken by my parents here I lie Wherefore I conjure thee dread Lord of Fire Primval Jātaveda turn go back
Even as he performed his Act of Truth Jātaveda went back a space of sixteen lengths
and in going back the flames did not pass away to the forest devouring everything in their path No they went out there and then like a torch plunged in water
Therefore it has been said
I wrought my Act of Truth and therewithal The sheet of blazing fire
left sixteen lengths Unscathedlike flames by water met and quenched
And as that spot escaped being wasted by fire throughout a whole on the miracle is called an onmiracle
When his life closed the Bodhisatta who had performed this Act of Truth passed away to fare according to his deserts
Thus Brethren said the Master  it is not my present power but the efficacy of an Act of Truth performed by me when a young quail that has made the flames pass over this spot iii the jungle His lesson ended he preached the Truths
at the close whereof some won the First some the Second some the Third Path while others again became Arahats
Also the Master shewed the connexion and identified the Birth by saying My present parents were the parents of those days and I myself the king of the quails
There he rises king allseeing etc This story the Master told at Jetavana about a backsliding Brother
This Brother was led by some others before the Master who asked Is it true Brother as I hear that you have backslidden  Yes Sir What have you seen that should make you do so  A woman drest up in magnificent attire
Then said the Master What wonder that womankind should trouble the wits of a man like you Even wise men who for seven hundred years have done no sin on hearing a womans voice have transgressed in a moment
even the holy become impure even they who have attained the highest honour have thus come to disgracehow much more the unholy and he told a story of the olden time
Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was king of Benares the Bodhisatta came into this world as a Peacock The egg which contained him had a shell as yellow as a kaṇikāra bud and when he broke the shell he became a Golden Peacock fair and lovely with beautiful red lines under his wings To preserve his life he traversed three ranges of hills and in the fourth he settled on a plateau of a golden hill in Daṇḍaka
When day dawned as he sat upon the hill watching the sun rise he composed a Brahma spell to preserve himself safe in his own feedingground the charm beginning There he rises
There he rises king allseeing
Making all things bright with his golden light
Thee I worship glorious being Making all things bright with thy golden light
Keep me safe I pray Through the coming day
Worshipping the sun on this wise by the verse here recited he repeats another in worship of the Buddhas who have passed away and all their virtues
All saints the righteous wise in holy lore These do I honour and their aid implore
All honour to the wise to wisdom honour be To freedom and to all that freedom has made free
Uttering this charm to keep himself from harm the Peacock went afeeding
So after flying about all day he came back at even and sat or the he hilltop to see the sun go down then as he meditated he uttered another spell to preserve himself and keep off evil the one beginning There he sets
There he sets the king allseeing He that makes all bright with his golden light
Thee I worship glorious being Making all things bright with thy golden light Through the night as through the day Keep me safe I pray
All saints the righteous wise in holy lore These do I honour and their aid implore
All honour to the wise to wisdom honour be To freedom and to all that freedom has made free
Uttering this charm to keep himself from harm the Peacock fell asleeping
Now there was a savage who lived in a certain village of wild huntsmen near Benares Wandering about among the Himalaya hills he noticed the Bodhisatta perched upon the golden hill of Daṇḍaka and told it to his son
It so befel that on a day one of the wives of the king of Benares Khemā by name saw in a dream a golden peacock holding a religious discourse This she told to the king saying that she longed to hear the discourse of the golden peacock
The king asked his courtiers about it
and the courtiers said The Brahmins will be sure to know
The Brahmins said Yes there are golden peacocks When asked where they replied The hunters will be sure to know
The king called the hunters together and asked them
Then this hunter answered O lord king there is a golden hill in Daṇḍaka and there a golden peacock lives
Then bring it herekill it not but just take it alive
The hunter set snares in the peacocks feedingground
But even when the peacock stepped upon it the snare would not close
This the hunter tried for seven years but catch him he could not and there he died
And Queen Khemā too died without obtaining her wish
The king was wroth because his Queen had died for the sake of a peacock He caused an inscription to be made upon a golden plate to this effect Among the Himalaya mountains is a golden hill in Daṇḍaka There lives a golden peacock and whoso eats of its flesh becomes ever young and immortal This he enclosed in a casket
After his death the next king read this inscription and thought he I will become ever young and immortal so he sent another hunter
Like the first this hunter failed to capture the peacock and died in the quest
In the same way the kingdom was ruled by six successive kings
Then a seventh arose who also sent forth a hunter
The hunter observed that when the Golden Peacock came into the snare it did not shut to and also that he recited a charm before setting out in search of food Off he went to the marches and caught a peahen which he trained to dance when he clapped his hands and at snap of finger to utter her cry Then taking her along with him he set the snare fixing its uprights in the ground early in the morning before the peacock had recited his charm Then he made the peahen utter a cry
This unwonted soundthe females notewoke desire in the peacocks breast leaving his charm unsaid he came towards her and was caught in the net
Then the hunter took hold of him and conveyed him to the king of Benares
The king was delighted at the peacocks beauty and ordered a seat to be placed for him
Sitting on the proffered seat the Bodhisatta asked Why did you have me caught O king 
Because they say all that eat of you become immortal and have eternal youth So I wish to gain youth eternal and immortality by eating of you said the king
So be itgranted that all who eat of me become immortal and have eternal youth But that means that I must die
Of course it does said the king
Welland if I die how can my flesh give immortality to those that eat of it
Your colour is golden therefore those who eat your flesh become young and live so for ever
Sir replied the bird there is a very good reason for my golden colour Long ago I held imperial sway over the whole world reigning in this very city I kept the Five Commandments and made all people of the world keep the same For that I was born again after death in the World of the ThirtyThree Archangels there I lived out my life but in my next birth I became a peacock in consequence of some sin however golden I became because I had aforetime kept the Commandments
What Incredible You an imperial ruler who kept the Commandments born goldcoloured as the fruit of them
A proof prithee
I have one Sire
What is it 
Well Sire when I was monarch I used to pass through midair seated in a jewelled car which now lies buried in the earth beneath the waters of the royal lake Dig it up from beneath the lake and that shall be my proof
The king approved the plan he caused the lake to be drained and dug out the chariot and believed the Bodhisatta
Then the Bodhisatta addressed him thus Sire except Nirvana which is everlasting all things else being composite in their nature are unsubstantial transient and subject to living and death Discoursing on this theme he established the king in keeping of the Commandments
Peace filled the kings heart he bestowed his kingdom upon the Bodhisatta and showed him the highest respect
The Bodhisatta returned the gift and after a few days sojourn he rose up in the air and flew back to the golden hill of Daṇḍaka with a parting word of adviceO king be careful
And the king on his part clave to the Bodhisattas advice and after giving alms and doing good passed away to fare according to his deeds
This discourse ended the Master declared the Truths and identified the Birthnow after the Truths the backsliding Brother became a Saint
nanda was the king of those days and I myself was the Golden Peacock
When many a bow etcThis story the Master told in Jetavana about a Brother who had lost all energy
The Master asked was it true that this Brother had lost his energy Yes he replied Why asked he have you slackened your energy after embracing this doctrine of salvation In days of yore wise men were energetic even in matters which do not lead to salvation and so saying he told an oldworld tale
Once on a time while Brahmadatta was king of Benares the Bodhisatta was born into the family of a forester When he grew up he took the lead of a band of five hundred foresters and lived in a village at the entrance to the forest
He used to hire himself out to guide men through it
Now one day a man of Benares a merchants son arrived at that village with a caravan of five hundred waggons Sending for the Bodhisatta he offered him a thousand pieces to be his guide through the forest
He agreed and received the money from the merchants hand and as he took it he mentally devoted his life to the merchants service
Then he guided him into the forest In the midst of the forest up rose five hundred robbers As for the rest of the company no sooner did they see these robbers than they grovelled upon their belly the head forester alone shouting and leaping and dealing blows put to flight all the five hundred robbers and led the merchant across the wood in safety
Once across the forest the merchant encamped his caravan he gave the chief forester choice meats of every kind and himself having broken his fast sat pleasantly by him and talked with him thus Tell me said he how it was that even when five hundred robbers with arms in their hands were spread all around you felt not even any fear in your heart  And he uttered the first stanza
When many a bow the shaft at speed let fly Hands grasping blades of tempered steel were nigh
When Death had marshalled all his dread array Why mid such terror felt you no dismay 
On hearing this the forester repeated the two verses following
When many a bow the shaft at speed let fly Hands grasping blades of tempered steel were nigh
When Death had marshalled all his dread array I felt a great and mighty joy this day
And this my joy gave me the victory I was resolved to die if need should be
He must contemn his life who would fulfil Heroic deeds and be a hero still 
Thus did he send forth his words like a shower of arrows and having explained how he had done heroically through being free from the desire to live he parted from the young merchant and returned to his own village where after giving alms and doing good he passed away to fare according to his deserts
When the Master had ended this discourse he declared the Truths and identified the Birthat the conclusion of the Truths the disheartened Brother attained to Sainthood
At that time I was the chief of the foresters
Mind precedes all mental states
Mind is their chief they are all mindwrought
If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts suffering follows him like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox
Mind precedes all mental states
Mind is their chief they are all mindwrought
If with a pure mind a person speaks or acts happiness follows him like his neverdeparting shadow
He abused me he struck me he overpowered me he robbed me
Those who harbor such thoughts do not still their hatred
He abused me he struck me he overpowered me he robbed me
Those who do not harbor such thoughts still their hatred
Hatred is never appeased by hatred in this world
By nonhatred alone is hatred appeased This is a law eternal
There are those who do not realize that one day we all must die
But those who do realize this settle their quarrels
Just as a storm throws down a weak tree so does Mara overpower the man who lives for the pursuit of pleasures who is uncontrolled in his senses immoderate in eating indolent and dissipated
Just as a storm cannot prevail against a rocky mountain so Mara can never overpower the man who lives meditating on the impurities who is controlled in his senses moderate in eating and filled with faith and earnest effort
Whoever being depraved devoid of selfcontrol and truthfulness should don the monks yellow robe he surely is not worthy of the robe
But whoever is purged of depravity wellestablished in virtues
Those who mistake the unessential to be essential and the essential to be unessential
Those who know the essential to be essential and the unessential to be unessential
Just as rain breaks through an illthatched house
Just as rain does not break through a wellthatched house
The evildoer grieves here and hereafter he grieves in both the worlds
He laments and is afflicted recollecting his own impure deeds
The doer of good rejoices here and hereafter he rejoices in both the worlds
He rejoices and exults recollecting his own pure deeds
The evildoer suffers here and hereafter he suffers in both the worlds
The thought Evil have I done torments him and he suffers even more when gone to realms of woe
The doer of good delights here and hereafter he delights in both the worlds
The thought Good have I done delights him and he delights even more when gone to realms of bliss
Much though he recites the sacred texts but acts not accordingly that heedless man
Little though he recites the sacred texts but puts the Teaching into practice
and filled with selfcontrol and truthfulness he indeed is worthy of the yellow robe
dwelling in wrong thoughts never arrive at the essential
dwelling in right thoughts do arrive at the essential
so passion penetrates an undeveloped mind
so passion never penetrates a welldeveloped mind
is like a cowherd who only counts the cows of others  he does not partake of the blessings of the holy life
forsaking lust hatred and delusion with true wisdom and emancipated mind
clinging to nothing of this or any other world  he indeed partakes of the blessings of a holy life
Heedfulness is the path to the Deathless Heedlessness is the path to death
The heedful die not The heedless are as if dead already
Clearly understanding this excellence of heedfulness
the wise exult therein and enjoy the resort of the Noble Ones
The wise ones ever meditative and steadfastly persevering
alone experience Nibbana the incomparable freedom from bondage
Ever grows the glory of him who is energetic mindful and pure in conduct discerning and selfcontrolled righteous and heedful
By effort and heedfulness discipline and selfmastery
let the wise one make for himself an island which no flood can overwhelm
The foolish and ignorant indulge in heedlessness
but the wise one keeps his heedfulness as his best treasure
Do not give way to heedlessness Do not indulge in sensual pleasures
Only the heedful and meditative attain great happiness
Just as one upon the summit of a mountain beholds the groundlings even so when the wise man casts away heedlessness by heedfulness and ascends the high tower of wisdom this sorrowless sage beholds the sorrowing and foolish multitude
Heedful among the heedless wideawake among the sleepy
the wise man advances like a swift horse leaving behind a weak jade
By Heedfulness did Indra become the overlord of the gods
Heedfulness is ever praised and heedlessness ever despised
The monk who delights in heedfulness and looks with fear at heedlessness
advances like fire burning all fetters small and large
The monk who delights in heedfulness and looks with fear at heedlessness
will not fall He is close to Nibbana
Just as a fletcher straightens an arrow shaft even so the discerning man straightens his mind  so fickle and unsteady so difficult to guard
As a fish when pulled out of water and cast on land throbs and quivers
even so is this mind agitated Hence should one abandon the realm of Mara
Wonderful indeed it is to subdue the mind so difficult to subdue ever swift and seizing whatever it desires
A tamed mind brings happiness
Let the discerning man guard the mind so difficult to detect and extremely subtle seizing whatever it desires
A guarded mind brings happiness
Dwelling in the cave  the mind without form wanders far and alone
Those who subdue this mind are liberated from the bonds of Mara
Wisdom never becomes perfect in one whose mind is not steadfast who knows not the Good Teaching and whose faith wavers
There is no fear for an awakened one whose mind is not sodden nor afflicted  and who has gone beyond both merit and demerit
Realizing that this body is as fragile as a clay pot and fortifying this mind like a wellfortified city fight out Mara with the sword of wisdom Then guarding the conquest remain unattached
Ere long alas this body will lie upon the earth
unheeded and lifeless like a useless log
Whatever harm an enemy may do to an enemy or a hater to a hater
an illdirected mind inflicts on oneself a greater harm
Neither mother father nor any other relative
can do one greater good than ones own welldirected mind
Thus have I heard Once the Lord was touring Kosala with a large company of some five hundred monks and coming to Salavatika he stayed there
And at that time the Brahmin Lohicca was living at Salavatika a populous place full of grass timber water and corn which had been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift and with royal powers
Just then this evil line of reasoning occurred to Lohicca Suppose an ascetic or Brahmin were to discover some good doctrine having done so he ought not to declare it to anyone else for what can one man do for another
It is just as if a man having cut through an old fetter were to make a new one I declare that such a thing is an evil deed rooted in attachment for what can one man do for another 
Then Lohicca heard it said that the ascetic Gotama had arrived at Salavatika
And indeed it is good to see such Arahants
And Lohicca said to Bhesika the barber Friend Bhesika go to the ascetic Gotama ask in my name after his health
and then say May the Reverend Gotama consent to take tomorrows meal with his order of monks from the Brahmin Lohicca
Very good sir said Bhesika and carried out the errand
The Lord signified his acceptance by silence
Then Bhesika understanding the Lords acceptance rose from his seat and passed by with his right side to the Lord He returned to Lohicca
And Lohicca as the night was ending had choice hard and soft foods prepared at his own home Then he sent Bhesika to tell the Lord that the meal was ready
And he said Lord this evil thought has occurred to the Brahmin Lohicca
It may well be so Bhesika it may well be so
So the Lord came to Lohiccas dwelling and sat down on the prepared seat
Lohicca personally served the Buddha and his order of monks with choice hard and soft food till they were contented and satisfied
When the Lord had taken his hand from the bowl Lohicca took a low stool and sat down to one side
Who shall overcome this earth this realm of Yama and this sphere of men and gods
Who shall bring to perfection the welltaught path of wisdom as an expert garlandmaker would his floral design
A striveronthe path shall overcome this earth this realm of Yama and this sphere of men and gods
The striveronthepath shall bring to perfection the welltaught path of wisdom as an expert garlandmaker would his floral design
Realizing that this body is like froth penetrating its miragelike nature
and plucking out Maras flowertipped arrows of sensuality go beyond sight of the King of Death
As a mighty flood sweeps away the sleeping village so death carries away the person of distracted mind who only plucks the flowers 
The Destroyer brings under his sway the person of distracted mind who insatiate in sense desires only plucks the flowers 
As a bee gathers honey from the flower without injuring its color or fragrance even so the sage goes on his almsround in the village
Let none find fault with others let none see the omissions and commissions of others
But let one see ones own acts done and undone
Like a beautiful flower full of color but without fragrance
even so fruitless are the fair words of one who does not practice them
Like a beautiful flower full of color and also fragrant
even so fruitful are the fair words of one who practices them
As from a great heap of flowers many garlands can be made
Not the sweet smell of flowers not even the fragrance of sandal tagara or jasmine blows against the wind
But the fragrance of the virtuous blows against the wind Truly the virtuous man pervades all directions with the fragrance of his virtue
Of all the fragrances  sandal tagara blue lotus and jasmine  the fragrance of virtue is the sweetest
Faint is the fragrance of tagara and sandal
but excellent is the fragrance of the virtuous wafting even amongst the gods
Mara never finds the path of the truly virtuous who abide in heedfulness and are freed by perfect knowledge
Upon a heap of rubbish in the roadside ditch
blooms a lotus fragrant and pleasing
Even so on the rubbish heap of blinded mortals
the disciple of the Supremely Enlightened One shines resplendent in wisdom
Then the Lord said to him Lohicca is it true that an evil line of reasoning has occurred to you 
Yes Reverend Gotama
What do you think Lohicca Dont you reside at Salavatika
Yes Reverend Gotama
Well now if anyone should say The Brahmin Lohicca resides at Salavatika
He would be a source of danger Reverend Gotama
And as such would he be solicitous for their welfare or not
He would not Reverend Gotama
And by not being solicitous for their welfare would he have a heart full of love for them or of hatred
Of hatred Reverend Gotama
And in a heart Ml of hatred is there wrong view or right view
Wrong view Reverend Gotama
But Lohicca I declare that wrong view leads to one of two destinies  hell or an animal rebirth
What do you think Lohicca Does King Pasenadi of Kosala reside at KasiKosala
He does Reverend Gotama
Well if anyone should say King Pasenadi of Kosala resides at KasiKosala and he should enjoy the entire fruits and revenues of Kosala not giving anything away to others 
It would Reverend Gotama
Then surely if anyone were to say the same of the Brahmin Lohicca
In the same way Lohicca if anyone should say Suppose an ascetic or Brahmin were to discover some good doctrine and thought he ought not to declare it to anyone else for what can one man do for another
he would be a source of danger to those young men of good family who following the Dhamma and discipline taught by the Tathagata attain to such excellent distinction as to realise the fruit of StreamEntry of OnceReturning of NonReturning of Ara hantship  and to all who ripen the seeds of a rebirth in the devaworld Being a source of danger to them he is uncom passionate and his heart is grounded in hostility and that constitutes wrong view
And if anyone were to speak thus of King Pasenadi
Lohicca these three kinds of teachers in the world are blameworthy and if anyone blames such teachers his blame is proper true in accordance with reality and faultless
Which three
Here Lohicca is a teacher who has gone forth from the household life into homelessness but who has not gained the goal of asceticism
And without having gained this goal he teaches his disciples a doctrine saying This is for your good this is for your happiness
But his pupils dont wish to hear they dont listen the dont arouse the thought of enlightenment and the teachers instructions are flouted
He should be blamed saying This venerable one has gone forth 
It is just as if a man were to persist in making advances to a woman who rejected him and to embrace her though she turned away This I declare to be an evil doctrine based on attachment for what can one man do for another
This is the first teacher who is blameworthy
Again there is a teacher who has gone forthbut who has not gained the goal of asceticism
Without having gained this goal he teaches his disciples a doctrine saying This is for your good this is for your happiness
His pupils wish to hear they listen they rouse the thought of enlightenment and the teachers instructions are not flouted
It is as if leaving his own field he should think anothers field in need of weeding I declare this to be an evil doctrine rooted in attachment
Again there is a teacher who has gone forthand who has gained the goal of asceticism
Having gone forth he teaches
He too should be blamed
This is the third teacher who is blameworthy
even so should many good deeds be done by one born a mortal
Then Lohicca said Reverend Gotama are there any teachers in the world who are not blameworthy 
Here Lohicca a Tathagata arises in the world an Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha
Whenever the pupil of a teacher attains to such excellent distinction that is a teacher who is not to be blamed in the world
And if anyone blames that teacher his blame is improper untrue not in accordance with reality and faulty
At this the Brahmin Lohicca said to the Lord Reverend Gotama it is as if a man were to seize someone by the hair who had stumbled and was falling into a pit and to set him on firm ground  just so I who was falling into the pit have been saved by the Reverend Gotama
Excellent Reverend Gotama excellent It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oillamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there
Just so the Reverend Gotama has expounded the Dhamma in various ways
I go for refuge to the Lord Gotama the Dhamma and the Sangha
May the Reverend Gotama accept me as a layfollower who has taken refuge from this day forth for as long as life shall last 
Long is the night to the sleepless long is the league to the weary
Long is worldly existence to fools who know not the Sublime Truth
Should a seeker not find a companion who is better or equal
let him resolutely pursue a solitary course there is no fellowship with the fool
The fool worries thinking I have sons I have wealth
Indeed when he himself is not his own whence are sons whence is wealth
A fool who knows his foolishness is wise at least to that extent
but a fool who thinks himself wise is a fool indeed
Though all his life a fool associates with a wise man
he no more comprehends the Truth than a spoon tastes the flavor of the soup
Though only for a moment a discerning person associates with a wise man
quickly he comprehends the Truth just as the tongue tastes the flavor of the soup
Fools of little wit are enemies unto themselves
as they move about doing evil deeds the fruits of which are bitter
Ill done is that action of doing which one repents later
and the fruit of which one weeping reaps with tears
Well done is that action of doing which one repents not later
and the fruit of which one reaps with delight and happiness
So long as an evil deed has not ripened the fool thinks it as sweet as honey
But when the evil deed ripens the fool comes to grief
Month after month a fool may eat his food with the tip of a blade of grass
but he still is not worth a sixteenth part of the those who have comprehended the Truth
Truly an evil deed committed does not immediately bear fruit like milk that does not turn sour all at once
But smoldering it follows the fool like fire covered by ashes
To his own ruin the fool gains knowledge
for it cleaves his head and destroys his innate goodness
The fool seeks undeserved reputation precedence among monks
authority over monasteries and honor among householders
Let both laymen and monks think that it was done by me
In every work great and small let them follow me 
One is the quest for worldly gain and quite another is the path to Nibbana
Clearly understanding this let not the monk the disciple of the Buddha
be carried away by worldly acclaim but develop detachment instead
such is the ambition of the fool thus his desire and pride increase
Should one find a man who points out faults and who reproves
let him follow such a wise and sagacious person as one would a guide to hidden treasure
Let him admonish instruct and shield one from wrong
Do not associate with evil companions do not seek the fellowship of the vile
He who drinks deep the Dhamma lives happily with a tranquil mind
Irrigators regulate the rivers fletchers straighten the arrow shaft
Just as a solid rock is not shaken by the storm
The good renounce everything The virtuous do not prattle with a yearning for pleasures
The wise show no elation or depression when touched by happiness or sorrow
He is indeed virtuous wise and righteous who neither for his own sake nor for the sake of another  who does not crave for sons wealth or kingdom and does not desire success by unjust means
Few among men are those who cross to the farther shore
But those who act according to the perfectly taught Dhamma
Abandoning the dark way let the wise man cultivate the bright path
Having gone from home to homelessness let him yearn for that delight in detachment so difficult to enjoy
Giving up sensual pleasures with no attachment
let the wise man cleanse himself of defilements of the mind
Those whose minds have reached full excellence in the factors of enlightenment
who having renounced acquisitiveness rejoice in not clinging to things 
rid of cankers glowing with wisdom they have attained Nibbana in this very life
It is always better and never worse to cultivate such an association
he indeed is dear to the good and detestable to the evil
Associate with the good friends seek the fellowship of noble men
The wise man ever delights in the Dhamma made known by the Noble One 
carpenters shape the wood the wise control themselves
even so the wise are not affected by praise or blame
On hearing the Teachings the wise become perfectly purified like a lake deep clear and still
The rest the bulk of men only run up and down the hither bank
will cross the realm of Death so difficult to cross
The fever of passion exists not for him who has completed the journey who is sorrowless and wholly set free and has broken all ties
The mindful ones exert themselves They are not attached to any home
like swans that abandon the lake they leave home after home behind
Those who do not accumulate and are wise regarding food
whose object is the Void the Unconditioned Freedom 
their track cannot be traced like that of birds in the air
He whose cankers are destroyed and who is not attached to food
whose object is the Void the Unconditioned Freedom 
his path cannot be traced like that of birds in the air
Even the gods hold dear the wise one whose senses are subdued like horses well trained by a charioteer
whose pride is destroyed and who is free from the cankers
There is no more worldly existence for the wise one who like the earth resents nothing who is firm as a high pillar and as pure as a deep pool free from mud
Calm is his thought calm his speech and calm his deed
who truly knowing is wholly freed perfectly tranquil and wise
The man who is without blind faith who knows the Uncreated who has severed all links
destroyed all causes  and thrown out all desires  he truly is the most excellent of men
Inspiring indeed is that place where Arahants dwell be it a village a forest a vale or a hill
Inspiring are the forests in which worldlings find no pleasure
There the passionless will rejoice for they seek no sensual pleasures
Though far away etc This story the Master told while dwelling in Jetavana about an Elder who had his mother to support
The circumstances of the event are like those of the Sāma Birth
On this occasion also the Master said addressing the Brethren Be not wroth Brethren with this man wise men there have been of old who even when born from the womb of animals being parted asunder from their mothers refused for seven days to take food pining away and even when they were offered food fit for a king did but reply Without my mother I will not eat yet took food again when they saw the mother So saying he told a story of the past
Once upon a time when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares the Bodhisatta was born as an Elephant in the Himalaya region All white he was a magnificent beast and a herd of eighty thousand elephants surrounded him
but his mother was blind
He would give his elephants the sweet wild fruit so sweet to convey to her
yet to her they gave none but themselves ate all of it
When he made enquiry and heard news of this said he I will leave the herd and cherish my mother So in the night season unknown to the other elephants taking his mother with him he departed to Mount Caṇḍoraṇa and there he placed his mother in a cave of the hills hard by a lake and cherished her
Now a certain forester who dwelt in Benares lost his way and being unable to get his bearings began to lament with a great noise
Hearing this noise the Bodhisatta thought to himself There is a man in distress and it is not meet that he come to harm while I am here  So he drew near to the man but the man fled in fear Seeing which the Elephant said to him Ho man you have no need to fear me Do not flee but say why you walk about weeping  My lord said the man I have lost my way this seven days gone  Said the Elephant Fear not O man for I will put you in the path of men  Then he made the man sit on his back and carried him out of the forest and then returned
This wicked man determined to go into the city and tell the king So he marked the trees and marked the hills and then made his way to Benares
At that time the kings state elephant had just died
The king caused it to be proclaimed by beat of drum If any man has in any place seen an elephant fit and proper for the kings riding let him declare it
Then this man came before the king and said I my lord have seen a splendid elephant white all over and excellent fit for the kings riding I will show the way send but with me the elephant trainers and you shall catch him
The king agreed and sent with the man a forester and a great troop of followers
The man went with him and found the Bodhisatta feeding in the lake
When the Bodhisatta saw the forester he thought This danger has doubtless come from none other than that man But I am very strong I can scatter even a thousand elephants in anger I am able to destroy all the beasts that carry the army of a whole kingdom But if I give way to anger my virtue will be marred So today I will not be angry not even though pierced with knives  With this resolve bowing his head he remained immovable
Down into the lotuslake went the forester and seeing the beauty of his points said Come my son Then seizing him by the trunk  he led him in seven days to Benares
When the Bodhisattas mother found that her son came not she thought that he must have been caught by the kings nobles And now she wailed all these trees will go on growing but he will be far away and she repeated two stanzas
Though far away this elephant should go Still olibane and kuṭaja will grow
Grain grass and oleander lilies white On sheltered spots the bluebells dark still blow
Somewhere that royal elephant must go Full fed by those whose breast and body show
All goldbedeckt that King or Prince may ride Fearless to triumph oer the mailclad foe 
Now the trainer while he was yet in the way sent on a message to tell the king
And the king caused the city to be decorated
The trainer led the Bodhisatta into a stable all adorned and decked out with festoons and with garlands and surrounding him with a screen of many colours sent word to the king
And the king took all manner of fine food and caused it to be given to the Bodhisatta
But not a bit would he eat Without my mother I will eat nothing said he
The king besought him to eat repeating the third stanza
Come take a morsel Elephant and never pine away
Theres many a thing to serve your king that you shall do one day 
Hearing this the Bodhisatta repeated the fourth stanza
Nay she by Mount Caṇḍoraṇa poor blind and wretched one
Beats with a foot on some treeroot without her royal son 
The king said the fifth stanza to ask his meaning
Who ist by Mount Caṇḍoraṇa what blind and wretched one
Beats with a foot on some treeroot without her royal son 
To which the other replied in the sixth stanza
My mother by Caṇḍoraṇa ah blind ah wretched one
Beats with her foot on some treeroot for lack of me her son
And hearing this the king gave him freedom reciting the seventh stanza
This mighty Elephant who feeds his mother let go free
And let him to his mother go and to all his family 
The eighth and ninth stanzas are those of the Buddha in his perfect wisdom
The Elephant from prison freed the beast set free from chain
With words of consolation went back to the hills again
Then from the cool and limpid pool where Elephants frequent
He with his trunk drew water and his mother all besprent 
The Scholiast explains that the elephant discoursed on virtue to the king then told him to be careful and departed amid the plaudits of the multitude who threw flowers upon him He then went home and fed and washed his mother To explain this the Master repeated the two stanzas
But the mother of the Bodhisatta thought it had begun to rain and repeated the tenth stanza rebuking the rain
Who brings unseasonable rainwhat evil deity
For he is gone my own my son who used to care for me 
Then the Bodhisatta repeated the eleventh stanza to reassure her
Rise mother why should you there lie your own your son has come
Vedeha Kāsis glorious king has sent me safely home 
And she returned thanks to the king by repeating the last stanza
Long live that king long may he bring his realms prosperity
Who freed that son who ever hath done so great respect to me
The king was pleased with the Bodhisattas goodness and he built a town not far from the lake and did continual service to the Bodhisatta and to his mother
Afterwards when his mother died and the Bodhisatta had performed her obsequies he went away to a monastery called Karaṇḍaka
In this place five hundred sages came and dwelt and the king did the like service for them
The king had a stone image made in the figure of the Bodhisatta and great honour he paid to this
There the inhabitants of all India year by year gathered together to perform what was called the Elephant Festival

At that time nanda was the king the lady Mahāmāyā was the sheelephant and I was myself the elephant that fed his mother
Better than a thousand useless words
is one useful word hearing which one attains peace
Better than a thousand useless verses
is one useful verse hearing which one attains peace
Better than reciting a hundred meaningless verses
is the reciting of one verse of Dhamma hearing which one attains peace
Though one may conquer a thousand times a thousand men in battle
yet he indeed is the noblest victor who conquers himself
Selfconquest is far better than the conquest of others
of a person who is selfsubdued and ever restrained in conduct
Though month after month for a hundred years one should offer sacrifices by the thousands
yet if only for a moment one should worship those of perfected minds
that honor is indeed better than a century of sacrifice
Though for a hundred years one should tend the sacrificial fire in the forest
yet if only for a moment one should worship those of perfected minds
that worship is indeed better than a century of sacrifice
Whatever gifts and oblations one seeking merit might offer in this world for a whole year
all that is not worth one fourth of the merit gained by revering the Upright Ones which is truly excellent
To one ever eager to revere and serve the elders
these four blessing accrue long life and beauty happiness and power
Better it is to live one day virtuous and meditative than to live a hundred years immoral and uncontrolled
Better it is to live one day wise and meditative than to live a hundred years foolish and uncontrolled
Better it is to live one day strenuous and resolute than to live a hundred years sluggish and dissipated
Better it is to live one day seeing the rise and fall of things than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the rise and fall of things
Better it is to live one day seeing the Deathless
Better it is to live one day seeing the Supreme Truth
Hasten to do good restrain your mind from evil
He who is slow in doing good his mind delights in evil
Should a person commit evil let him not do it again and again
Let him not find pleasure therein for painful is the accumulation of evil
Should a person do good let him do it again and again
Let him find pleasure therein for blissful is the accumulation of good
It may be well with the evildoer as long as the evil ripens not
But when it does ripen then the evildoer sees his evil deeds
It may be ill with the doer of good as long as the good ripens not
But when it does ripen then the doer of good sees his good deeds
Think not lightly of evil saying It will not come to me
Drop by drop is the water pot filled
Likewise the fool gathering it little by little fills himself with evil
Think not lightly of good saying It will not come to me
Drop by drop is the water pot filled
Likewise the wise man gathering it little by little fills himself with good
Just as a trader with a small escort and great wealth would avoid a perilous route
or just as one desiring to live avoids poison even so should one shun evil
If on the hand there is no wound one may carry even poison in it
Poison does not affect one who is free from wounds For him who does no evil there is no ill
Like fine dust thrown against the wind evil falls back upon that fool who offends an inoffensive pure and guiltless man
Some are born in the womb the wicked are born in hell
the devout go to heaven the stainless pass into Nibbana
Neither in the sky nor in midocean nor by entering into mountain clefts
nowhere in the world is there a place where one may escape from the results of evil deeds
Neither in the sky nor in midocean nor by entering into mountain clefts
nowhere in the world is there a place where one will not be overcome by death
All tremble at violence all fear death
Putting oneself in the place of another one should not kill nor cause another to kill
All tremble at violence life is dear to all
Putting oneself in the place of another one should not kill nor cause another to kill
One who oppresses with violence other beings who also desire happiness
One who does not oppress with violence other beings who also desire happiness
Speak not harshly to anyone for those thus spoken to might retort
Indeed angry speech hurts and retaliation may overtake you
If like a broken gong you silence yourself
you have approached Nibbana for vindictiveness is no longer in you
Just as a cowherd drives the cattle to pasture with a staff
so do old age and death drive the life force of beings 
When the fool commits evil deeds he does not realize 
The witless man is tormented by his own deeds like one burnt by fire
He who inflicts violence on those who are unarmed and offends those who are inoffensive
will soon come upon one of these ten states
Sharp pain or disaster bodily injury
Neither going about naked nor matted locks nor filth nor fasting nor lying on the ground
nor smearing oneself with ashes and dust nor sitting on the heels can purify a mortal who has not overcome doubt
Even though he be wellattired yet if he is poised calm controlled and established in the holy life
having set aside violence towards all beings  he truly is a holy man a renunciate a monk
Only rarely is there a man in this world who
restrained by modesty avoids reproach as a thoroughbred horse avoids the whip
Like a thoroughbred horse touched by the whip be strenuous be filled with spiritual yearning
By faith and moral purity by effort and meditation by investigation of the truth
by being rich in knowledge and virtue and by being mindful destroy this unlimited suffering
Irrigators regulate the waters fletchers straighten arrow shafts
carpenters shape wood and the good control themselves
When this world is ever ablaze why this laughter why this jubilation
Shrouded in darkness will you not see the light
Behold this body  a painted image a mass of heaped up sores
infirm full of hankering  of which nothing is lasting or stable
Fully worn out is this body a nest of disease and fragile
This foul mass breaks up for death is the end of life
These dovecolored bones are like gourds that lie scattered about in autumn
Having seen them how can one seek delight
This city is built of bones plastered with flesh and blood
within are decay and death pride and jealousy
Even gorgeous royal chariots wear out and indeed this body too wears out
But the Dhamma of the Good does not age thus the Good make it known to the good
The man of little learning grows old like a bull
He grows only in bulk but his wisdom does not grow
Through many a birth in samsara have I wandered in vain
seeking the builder of this house  Repeated birth is indeed suffering
O housebuilder you are seen You will not build this house again
For your rafters are broken and your ridgepole shattered
My mind has reached the Unconditioned I have attained the destruction of craving
Those who in youth have not led the holy life or have failed to acquire wealth
languish like old cranes in the pond without fish
Those who in youth have not lead the holy life or have failed to acquire wealth
lie sighing over the past like worn out arrows a bow
If one holds oneself dear one should diligently watch oneself
Let the wise man keep vigil during any of the three watches of the night
One should first establish oneself in what is proper
then only should one instruct others Thus the wise man will not be reproached
One should do what one teaches others to do
if one would train others one should be well controlled oneself Difficult indeed is selfcontrol
One truly is the protector of oneself who else could the protector be
With oneself fully controlled one gains a mastery that is hard to gain
The evil a witless man does by himself born of himself and produced by himself grinds him as a diamond grinds a hard gem
Just as a single creeper strangles the tree on which it grows even so a man who is exceedingly depraved
harms himself as only an enemy might wish
Easy to do are things that are bad and harmful to oneself
But exceedingly difficult to do are things that are good and beneficial
Whoever on account of perverted views scorns the Teaching of the Perfected Ones the Noble and Righteous Ones 
that fool like the bamboo produces fruits only for self destruction
By oneself is evil done by oneself is one defiled
By oneself is evil left undone by oneself is one made pure
Purity and impurity depend on oneself no one can purify another
Let one not neglect ones own welfare for the sake of another however great
Clearly understanding ones own welfare let one be intent upon the good
Follow not the vulgar way live not in heedlessness
hold not false views linger not long in worldly existence
Arise Do not be heedless Lead a righteous life
The righteous live happily both in this world and the next
Lead a righteous life lead not a base life
The righteous live happily both in this world and the next
One who looks upon the world as a bubble and a mirage him the King of Death sees not
Come Behold this world which is like a decorated royal chariot
Here fools flounder but the wise have no attachment to it
He who having been heedless is heedless no more
illuminates this world like the moon freed from clouds
He who by good deeds covers the evil he has done
illuminates this world like the moon freed from clouds
Blind is the world here only a few possess insight
Only a few like birds escaping from the net go to realms of bliss
Swans fly on the path of the sun men pass through the air by psychic powers
For a liar who has violated the one law 
who holds in scorn the hereafter there is no evil that he cannot do
Truly misers fare not to heavenly realms nor indeed do fools praise generosity
But the wise man rejoices in giving and by that alone does he become happy hereafter
Better than sole sovereignty over the earth better than going to heaven
better even than lordship over all the worlds is the supramundane Fruition of Stream Entrance
the wise are led away from the world after vanquishing Mara and his host
whose victory nothing can undo whom none of the vanquished defilements can ever pursue
in whom exists no longer the entangling and embroiling craving that perpetuates becoming
Those wise ones who are devoted to meditation and who delight in the calm of renunciation 
such mindful ones Supreme Buddhas even the gods hold dear
Hard is it to be born a man hard is the life of mortals
Hard is it to gain the opportunity of hearing the Sublime Truth and hard to encounter is the arising of the Buddhas
To avoid all evil to cultivate good
and to cleanse ones mind  this is the teaching of the Buddhas
Enduring patience is the highest austerity Nibbana is supreme say the Buddhas
He is not a true monk who harms another nor a true renunciate who oppresses others
Not despising not harming restraint according to the code of monastic discipline
moderation in food dwelling in solitude
devotion to meditation  this is the teaching of the Buddhas
There is no satisfying sensual desires even with the rain of gold coins
For sensual pleasures give little satisfaction and much pain
Having understood this the wise man finds no delight even in heavenly pleasures
The disciple of the Supreme Buddha delights in the destruction of craving
Driven only by fear do men go for refuge to many places  to hills woods groves trees and shrines
Such indeed is no safe refuge such is not the refuge supreme
Not by resorting to such a refuge is one released from all suffering
He who has gone for refuge to the Buddha the Teaching and his Order
penetrates with transcendental wisdom the Four Noble Truths 
This indeed is the safe refuge this the refuge supreme
Having gone to such a refuge one is released from all suffering
Hard to find is the thoroughbred man  he is not born everywhere
Where such a wise man is born that clan thrives happily
Blessed is the birth of the Buddhas blessed is the enunciation of the sacred Teaching
blessed is the harmony in the Order and blessed is the spiritual pursuit of the united truthseeker
He who reveres those worthy of reverence the Buddhas and their disciples
he who reveres such peaceful and fearless ones
his merit none can compute by any measure
suffering the cause of suffering the cessation of suffering
and the Noble Eightfold Path leading to the cessation of suffering
who have transcended all obstacles and passed beyond the reach of sorrow and lamentation 
Happy indeed we live friendly amidst the hostile
Amidst hostile men we dwell free from hatred
Happy indeed we live friendly amidst the afflicted 
Amidst afflicted men we dwell free from affliction
Happy indeed we live free from avarice amidst the avaricious
Amidst the avaricious men we dwell free from avarice
Happy indeed we live we who possess nothing
Feeders on joy we shall be like the Radiant Gods
Victory begets enmity the defeated dwell in pain
Happily the peaceful live discarding both victory and defeat
There is no fire like lust and no crime like hatred
There is no ill like the aggregates and no bliss higher than the peace 
Hunger is the worst disease conditioned things the worst suffering
Knowing this as it really is the wise realize Nibbana the highest bliss
Health is the most precious gain and contentment the greatest wealth
A trustworthy person is the best kinsman Nibbana the highest bliss
Having savored the taste of solitude and peace 
painfree and stainless he becomes drinking deep the taste of the bliss of the Truth
Good is it to see the Noble Ones to live with them is ever blissful
One will always be happy by not encountering fools
Indeed he who moves in the company of fools grieves for longing
Association with fools is ever painful like partnership with an enemy
But association with the wise is happy like meeting ones own kinsmen
Therefore
follow the Noble One who is steadfast wise learned dutiful and devout
One should follow only such a man who is truly good and discerning even as the moon follows the path of the stars
Giving himself to things to be shunned and not exerting where exertion is needed
a seeker after pleasures having given up his true welfare envies those intent upon theirs
Seek no intimacy with the beloved and also not with the unloved
for not to see the beloved and to see the unloved both are painful
Therefore hold nothing dear for separation from the dear is painful
There are no bonds for those who have nothing beloved or unloved
From endearment springs grief from endearment springs fear
For one who is wholly free from endearment there is no grief whence then fear
From affection springs grief from affection springs fear
For one who is wholly free from affection there is no grief whence then fear
From attachment springs grief from attachment springs fear
For one who is wholly free from attachment there is no grief whence then fear
From lust springs grief from lust springs fear
For one who is wholly free from craving there is no grief whence then fear
From craving springs grief from craving springs fear
For one who is wholly free from craving there is no grief whence then fear
People hold dear him who embodies virtue and insight who is principled has realized the truth and who himself does what he ought to be doing
One who is intent upon the Ineffable  dwells with mind inspired 
and is no more bound by sense pleasures  such a man is called One Bound Upstream
When after a long absence a man safely returns from afar
his relatives friends and wellwishers welcome him home on arrival
As kinsmen welcome a dear one on arrival even so his own good deeds will welcome the doer of good who has gone from this world to the next
One should give up anger renounce pride and overcome all fetters
Suffering never befalls him who clings not to mind and body and is detached
He who checks rising anger as a charioteer checks a rolling chariot
him I call a true charioteer Others only hold the reins
Overcome the angry by nonanger overcome the wicked by goodness
overcome the miser by generosity overcome the liar by truth
Speak the truth yield not to anger when asked give even if you only have a little
By these three means can one reach the presence of the gods
Those sages who are inoffensive and ever restrained in body
go to the Deathless State where having gone they grieve no more
Those who are ever vigilant who discipline themselves day and night
and are ever intent upon Nibbana  their defilements fade away
O Atula Indeed this is an ancient practice not one only of today
they blame those who remain silent they blame those who speak much
they blame those who speak in moderation There is none in the world who is not blamed
There never was there never will be nor is there now
a person who is wholly blamed or wholly praised
But the man whom the wise praise after observing him day after day
is one of flawless character wise and endowed with knowledge and virtue
Who can blame such a one as worthy as a coin of refined gold
Even the gods praise him by Brahma too is he praised
Let a man guard himself against irritability in bodily action let him be controlled in deed
Abandoning bodily misconduct let him practice good conduct in deed
Let a man guard himself against irritability in speech let him be controlled in speech
Abandoning verbal misconduct let him practice good conduct in speech
Let a man guard himself against irritability in thought let him be controlled in mind
Abandoning mental misconduct let him practice good conduct in thought
The wise are controlled in bodily action controlled in speech and controlled in thought
They are truly wellcontrolled
Like a withered leaf are you now deaths messengers await you
You stand on the eve of your departure yet you have made no provision for your journey
Make an island for yourself Strive hard and become wise
Rid of impurities and cleansed of stain you shall enter the celestial abode of the Noble Ones
Your life has come to an end now You are setting forth into the presence of Yama the king of death
No resting place is there for you on the way yet you have made no provision for the journey
Make an island unto yourself Strive hard and become wise
Rid of impurities and cleansed of stain you shall not come again to birth and decay
One by one little by little moment by moment
a wise man should remove his own impurities as a smith removes his dross from silver
Just as rust arising from iron eats away the base from which it arises
Nonrepetition is the bane of scriptures neglect is the bane of a home
slovenliness is the bane of personal appearance and heedlessness is the bane of a guard
Unchastity is the taint in a woman niggardliness is the taint in a giver
Taints indeed are all evil things both in this world and the next
A worse taint than these is ignorance the worst of all taints
Destroy this one taint and become taintless O monks
Easy is life for the shameless one who is impudent as a crow
is backbiting and forward arrogant and corrupt
Difficult is life for the modest one who always seeks purity
One who destroys life utters lies
takes what is not given goes to another mans wife
and is addicted to intoxicating drinks 
such a man digs up his own root even in this world
Know this O good man evil things are difficult to control
Let not greed and wickedness drag you to protracted misery
People give according to their faith or regard
If one becomes discontented with the food and drink given by others
one does not attain meditative absorption either by day or by night
But he in who this is fully destroyed uprooted and extinct
he attains absorption both by day and by night
There is no fire like lust there is no grip like hatred
there is no net like delusion there is no river like craving
Easily seen is the fault of others but ones own fault is difficult to see
Like chaff one winnows anothers faults
but hides ones own even as a crafty fowler hides behind sham branches
He who seeks anothers faults who is ever censorious 
his cankers grow He is far from destruction of the cankers
There is no track in the sky and no recluse outside 
Mankind delights in worldliness but the Buddhas are free from worldliness
There is no track in the sky and no recluse outside 
There are no conditioned things that are eternal and no instability in the Buddhas
even so their own deeds lead transgressors to states of woe
is detached and unassuming clean in life and discerning
Not by passing arbitrary judgments does a man become just
a wise man is he who investigates both right and wrong
He who does not judge others arbitrarily but passes judgment impartially according to the truth
that sagacious man is a guardian of law and is called just
One is not wise because one speaks much
He who is peaceable friendly and fearless is called wise
A man is not versed in Dhamma because he speaks much
He who after hearing a little Dhamma realizes its truth directly
and is not heedless of it is truly versed in the Dhamma
A monk is not an elder because his head is gray
He is but ripe in age and he is called one grown old in vain
One in whom there is truthfulness virtue inoffensiveness restraint and selfmastery
who is free from defilements and is wise  he is truly called an Elder
Not by mere eloquence nor by beauty of form
But he in whom these are wholly destroyed uprooted and extinct
and who has cast out hatred  that wise man is truly accomplished
Not by shaven head does a man who is indisciplined and untruthful become a monk
How can he who is full of desire and greed be a monk
He who wholly subdues evil both small and great
is called a monk because he has overcome all evil
He is not a monk just because he lives on others alms
Whoever here lives a holy life transcending both merit and demerit
and walks with understanding in this world  he is truly called a monk
Not by observing silence does one become a sage if he be foolish and ignorant
But that man is wise who as if holding a balancescale accepts only the good
The sage rejecting the evil is truly a sage
Since he comprehends both worlds he is called a sage
He is not noble who injures living beings
He is called noble because he is harmless towards all living beings
Not by rules and observances not even by much learning
nor by gain of absorption nor by a life of seclusion
should you O monks rest content until the utter destruction of cankers is reached
does a man become accomplished if he is jealous selfish and deceitful
Not by adopting outward form does one become a true monk
nor by thinking I enjoy the bliss of renunciation which is not experienced by the worldling
Of all the paths the Eightfold Path is the best of all the truths the Four Noble Truths are the best
of all things passionlessness is the best of men the Seeing One is the best
This is the only path there is none other for the purification of insight
Tread this path and you will bewilder Mara
Walking upon this path you will make an end of suffering
Having discovered how to pull out the thorn of lust I make known the path
You yourselves must strive the Buddhas only point the way
Those meditative ones who tread the path are released from the bonds of Mara
All conditioned things are unsatisfactory  when one sees this with wisdom
one turns away from suffering This is the path to purification
All things are notself  when one sees this with wisdom
one turns away from suffering This is the path to purification
The idler who does not exert himself when he should who though young and strong is full of sloth
with a mind full of vain thoughts  such an indolent man does not find the path to wisdom
Let a man be watchful of speech well controlled in mind and not commit evil in bodily action
Let him purify these three courses of action and win the path made known by the Great Sage
Wisdom springs from meditation without meditation wisdom wanes
Having known these two paths of progress and decline
let a man so conduct himself that his wisdom may increase
Cut down the forest  but not the tree from the forest springs fear
Having cut down the forest and the underbrush  be passionless O monks
For so long as the underbrush of desire even the most subtle of a man towards a woman is not cut down
his mind is in bondage like the sucking calf to its mother
Cut off your affection in the manner of a man who plucks with his hand an autumn lotus
Cultivate only the path to peace Nibbana as made known by the Exalted One
Here shall I live during the rains here in winter and summer 
thus thinks the fool He does not realize the danger 
As a great flood carries away a sleeping village so death seizes and carries away the man with a clinging mind doting on his children and cattle
For him who is assailed by death there is no protection by kinsmen None there are to save him  no sons nor father nor relatives
Realizing this fact let the wise man restrained by morality
hasten to clear the path leading to Nibbana
All conditioned things are impermanent  when one sees this with wisdom
one turns away from suffering This is the path to purification
If by renouncing a lesser happiness one may realize a greater happiness
let the wise man renounce the lesser having regard for the greater
Entangled by the bonds of hate he who seeks his own happiness by inflicting pain on others is never delivered from hatred
The cankers only increase for those who are arrogant and heedless who leave undone what should be done and do what should not be done
The cankers cease for those mindful and clearly comprehending ones who always earnestly practice mindfulness of the body who do not resort to what should not be done and steadfastly pursue what should be done
Having slain mother  father  two warriorkings 
and destroyed a country together with its treasurer  ungrieving goes the holy man
Having slain mother father two brahman kings 
and a tiger as the fifth  ungrieving goes the holy man
Those disciples of Gotama ever awaken happily
who day and night constantly practice the Recollection of the Qualities of the Buddha
Those disciples of Gotama ever awaken happily
who day and night constantly practice the Recollection of the Qualities of the Dhamma
Those disciples of Gotama ever awaken happily
who day and night constantly practice the Recollection of the Qualities of the Sangha
Those disciples of Gotama ever awaken happily
who day and night constantly practice Mindfulness of the Body
Those disciples of Gotama ever awaken happily
whose minds by day and night delight in the practice of nonviolence
Those disciples of Gotama ever awaken happily
whose minds by day and night delight in the practice of meditation
Difficult is life as a monk difficult is it to delight therein Also difficult and sorrowful is the household life
Suffering comes from association with unequals suffering comes from wandering in samsara
Therefore be not an aimless wanderer be not a pursuer of suffering
He who is full of faith and virtue and possesses good repute and wealth 
he is respected everywhere in whatever land he travels
The good shine from afar like the Himalaya mountains
But the wicked are unseen like arrows shot in the night
He who sits alone sleeps alone and walks alone who is strenuous and subdues himself alone
will find delight in the solitude of the forest
The liar goes to the state of woe also he who having done  says I did not do it
Men of base actions both on departing they share the same destiny in the other world
There are many evil characters and uncontrolled men wearing the saffron robe
These wicked men will be born in states of woe because of their evil deeds
It would be better to swallow a redhot iron ball blazing like fire
than as an immoral and uncontrolled monk to eat the alms of the people
Four misfortunes befall the reckless man who consorts with anothers wife
acquisition of demerit disturbed sleep illrepute and states of woe
Such a man acquires demerit and an unhappy birth in the future Brief is the pleasure of the frightened man and woman
and the king imposes heavy punishment Hence let no man consort with anothers wife
Just as kusa grass wrongly handled cuts the hand
even so a recluses life wrongly lived drags one to states of woe
Any loose act any corrupt observance
any life of questionable celibacy  none of these bear much fruit
If anything is to be done let one do it with sustained vigor
A lax monastic life stirs up the dust of passions all the more
An evil deed is better left undone for such a deed torments one afterwards
But a good deed is better done doing which one repents not later
Just as a border city is closely guarded both within and without
even so guard yourself Do not let slip this opportunity 
For those who let slip this opportunity grieve indeed when consigned to hell
Those who are ashamed of what they should not be ashamed of and are not ashamed of what they should be ashamed of 
upholding false views they go to states of woe
Those who see something to fear where there is nothing to fear and see nothing to fear where there is something to fear 
upholding false views they go to states of woe
Those who imagine evil where there is none and do not see evil where it is 
upholding false views they go to states of woe
Those who discern the wrong as wrong and the right as right 
upholding right views they go to realms of bliss
As an elephant in the battlefield withstands arrows shot from bows all around
even so shall I endure abuse There are many indeed who lack virtue
A tamed elephant is led into a crowd and the king mounts a tamed elephant
Best among men is the subdued one who endures abuse
Excellent are welltrained mules thoroughbred Sindhu horses
and noble tusker elephants But better still is the man who has subdued himself
Not by these mounts however would one go to the Untrodden Land 
as one who is selftamed goes by his own tamed and wellcontrolled mind
Musty during rut the tusker named Dhanapalaka is uncontrollable
Held in captivity the tusker does not touch a morsel but only longingly calls to mind the elephant forest
When a man is sluggish and gluttonous sleeping and rolling around in bed
like a fat domestic pig that sluggard undergoes rebirth again and again
Formerly this mind wandered about as it liked where it wished and according to its pleasure
but now I shall thoroughly master it with wisdom as a mahout controls with his ankus an elephant in rut
Delight in heedfulness Guard well your thoughts
Draw yourself out of this bog of evil even as an elephant draws himself out of the mud
If for company you find a wise and prudent friend who leads a good life
you should overcoming all impediments keep his company joyously and mindfully
If for company you cannot find a wise and prudent friend who leads a good life
then like a king who leaves behind a conquered kingdom or like a lone elephant in the elephant forest you should go your way alone
Better it is to live alone there is no fellowship with a fool
Live alone and do no evil be carefree like an elephant in the elephant forest
Good are friends when need arises good is contentment with just what one has
good is merit when life is at an end and good is the abandoning of all suffering 
In this world good it is to serve ones mother good it is to serve ones father
good it is to serve the monks and good it is to serve the holy men
Good is virtue until lifes end good is faith that is steadfast
good is the acquisition of wisdom and good is the avoidance of evil
The craving of one given to heedless living grows like a creeper
Like the monkey seeking fruits in the forest he leaps from life to life 
Whoever is overcome by this wretched and sticky craving
his sorrows grow like grass after the rains
But whoever overcomes this wretched craving so difficult to overcome
from him sorrows fall away like water from a lotus leaf
This I say to you Good luck to all assembled here
Dig up the root of craving like one in search of the fragrant root of the birana grass
Let not Mara crush you again and again as a flood crushes a reed
Just as a tree though cut down sprouts up again if its roots remain uncut and firm
even so until the craving that lies dormant is rooted out suffering springs up again and again
The misguided man in whom the thirtysix currents of craving strongly rush toward pleasurable objects is swept away by the flood of his passionate thoughts
Everywhere these currents flow and the creeper sprouts and grows
Seeing that the creeper has sprung up cut off its root with wisdom
Flowing in and watered by craving feelings of pleasure arise in beings
Bent on pleasures and seeking enjoyment these men fall prey to birth and decay
Beset by craving people run about like an entrapped hare
Held fast by mental fetters they come to suffering again and again for a long time
Beset by craving people run about like an entrapped hare
Therefore one who yearns to be passionfree should destroy his own craving
There is one who turning away from desire takes to the life of the forest  But after being freed from the household he runs back to it
Behold that man Though freed he runs back to that very bondage
That is not a strong fetter the wise say which is made of iron wood or hemp
But the infatuation and longing for jewels and ornaments children and wives 
that they say is a far stronger fetter which pulls one downward and though seemingly loose is hard to remove
This too the wise cut off Giving up sensual pleasure and without any longing they renounce the world
Those who are lustinfatuated fall back into the swirling current like a spider on its selfspun web
This too the wise cut off Without any longing they abandon all suffering and renounce the world
Let go of the past let go of the future let go of the present and cross over to the farther shore of existence
With mind wholly liberated you shall come no more to birth and death
For a person tormented by evil thoughts who is passiondominated and given to the pursuit of pleasure
his craving steadily grows He makes the fetter strong indeed
He who delights in subduing evil thoughts who meditates on the impurities and is ever mindful 
it is he who will make an end of craving and rend asunder Maras fetter
He who has reached the goal is fearless free from craving passionless
He who is free from craving and attachment is perfect in uncovering the true meaning of the Teaching
and knows the arrangement of the sacred texts in correct sequence  he indeed is the bearer of his final body
He is truly called the profoundly wise one the great man
A victor am I over all all have I known Yet unattached am I to all that is conquered and known
Abandoning all I am freed through the destruction of craving Having thus directly comprehended all by myself whom shall I call my teacher
The gift of Dhamma excels all gifts the taste of the Dhamma excels all tastes
the delight in Dhamma excels all delights The CravingFreed vanquishes all suffering
Riches ruin only the foolish not those in quest of the Beyond
By craving for riches the witless man ruins himself as well as others
Weeds are the bane of fields lust is the bane of mankind
Therefore what is offered to those free of lust yields abundant fruit
Weeds are the bane of fields hatred is the bane of mankind
Therefore what is offered to those free of hatred yields abundant fruit
Weeds are the bane of fields delusion is the bane of mankind
Therefore what is offered to those free of delusion yields abundant fruit
Weeds are the bane of fields desire is the bane of mankind
Therefore what is offered to those free of desire yields abundant fruit
and has plucked out the thorns of existence  for him this is the last body
Good is restraint over the eye good is restraint over the ear
good is restraint over the nose good is restraint over the tongue
Good is restraint in the body good is restraint in speech
good is restraint in thought Restraint everywhere is good
The monk restrained in every way is freed from all suffering
He who has control over his hands feet and tongue who is fully controlled
delights in inward development is absorbed in meditation keeps to himself and is contented  him do people call a monk
That monk who has control over his tongue is moderate in speech unassuming
and who explains the Teaching in both letter and spirit  whatever he says is pleasing
The monk who abides in the Dhamma delights in the Dhamma meditates on the Dhamma
and bears the Dhamma well in mind  he does not fall away from the sublime Dhamma
One should not despise what one has received nor envy the gains of others
The monk who envies the gains of others does not attain to meditative absorption
A monk who does not despise what he has received even though it be little
who is pure in livelihood and unremitting in effort  him even the gods praise
He who has no attachment whatsoever for the mind and body
who does not grieve for what he has not  he is truly called a monk
The monk who abides in universal love and is deeply devoted to the Teaching of the Buddha
attains the peace of Nibbana the bliss of the cessation of all conditioned things
Empty this boat O monk Emptied it will sail lightly
Rid of lust and hatred you shall reach Nibbana
Cut off the five abandon the five and cultivate the five
The monk who has overcome the five bonds is called one who has crossed the flood
Meditate O monk Do not be heedless Let not your mind whirl on sensual pleasures
Heedless do not swallow a redhot iron ball lest you cry when burning O this is painful 
There is no meditative concentration for him who lacks insight and no insight for him who lacks meditative concentration
He in whom are found both meditative concentration and insight indeed is close to Nibbana
The monk who has retired to a solitary abode and calmed his mind
who comprehends the Dhamma with insight in him there arises a delight that transcends all human delights
Whenever he sees with insight the rise and fall of the aggregates
he is full of joy and happiness To the discerning one this reflects the Deathless
Control of the senses contentment restraint according to the code of monastic discipline  these form the basis of holy life here for the wise monk
Let him associate with friends who are noble energetic and pure in life
let him be cordial and refined in conduct
Thus full of joy he will make an end of suffering
Just as the jasmine creeper sheds its withered flowers
The monk who is calm in body calm in speech calm in thought wellcomposed
and who has spewn out worldliness  he truly is called serene
By oneself one must censure oneself and scrutinize oneself
The selfguarded and mindful monk will always live in happiness
One is ones own protector one is ones own refuge
Therefore one should control oneself even as a trader controls a noble steed
Full of joy full of faith in the Teaching of the Buddha the monk
attains the Peaceful State the bliss of cessation of conditioned things
That monk who while young devotes himself to the Teaching of the Buddha
illumines this world like the moon freed from clouds
even so O monks should you totally shed lust and hatred
Exert yourself O holy man Cut off the stream  and discard sense desires
Knowing the destruction of all the conditioned things become O holy man the knower of the Uncreated 
When a holy man has reached the summit of two paths 
he knows the truth and all his fetters fall away
He for whom there is neither this shore nor the other shore nor yet both
he who is free of cares and is unfettered  him do I call a holy man
He who is meditative stainless and settled whose work is done and who is free from cankers
having reached the highest goal  him do I call a holy man
The sun shines by day the moon shines by night
The warrior shines in armor the holy man shines in meditation
But the Buddha shines resplendent all day and all night
Because he has discarded evil he is called a holy man Because he is serene in conduct he is called a recluse
And because he has renounced his impurities he is called a renunciate
One should not strike a holy man nor should a holy man when struck give way to anger
Shame on him who strikes a holy man and more shame on him who gives way to anger
Nothing is better for a holy man than when he holds his mind back from what is endearing
To the extent the intent to harm wears away to that extent does suffering subside
He who does no evil in deed word and thought
who is restrained in these three ways  him do I call a holy man
Just as a brahman priest reveres his sacrificial fire even so should one devoutly revere the person from whom one has learned the Dhamma taught by the Buddha
Not by matted hair nor by lineage nor by birth does one become a holy man
But he in whom truth and righteousness exist  he is pure he is a holy man
What is the use of your matted hair O witless man What of your garment of antelopes hide
Within you is the tangle  only outwardly do you cleanse yourself
The person who wears a robe made of rags who is lean with veins showing all over the body
and who meditates alone in the forest  him do I call a holy man
I do not call him a holy man because of his lineage or highborn mother
If he is full of impeding attachments he is just a supercilious man
But who is free from impediments and clinging  him do I call a holy man
He who having cut off all fetters trembles no more
who has overcome all attachments and is emancipated  him do I call a holy man
He who has cut off the thong  the band  and the rope  together with the appurtenances 
he who has removed the crossbar and is enlightened  him do I call a holy man
He who without resentment endures abuse beating and punishment
whose power real might is patience  him do I call a holy man
He who is free from anger is devout virtuous without craving
selfsubdued and bears his final body  him do I call a holy man
Like water on a lotus leaf or a mustard seed on the point of a needle
he who does not cling to sensual pleasures  him do I call a holy man
He who in this very life realizes for himself the end of suffering
who has laid aside the burden and become emancipated  him do I call a holy man
He who has profound knowledge who is wise skilled in discerning the right or wrong path
and has reached the highest goal  him do I call a holy man
He who holds aloof from householders and ascetics alike
and wanders about with no fixed abode and but few wants  him do I call a holy man
He who has renounced violence towards all living beings weak or strong
who neither kills nor causes others to kill  him do I call a holy man
He who is friendly amidst the hostile peaceful amidst the violent
and unattached amidst the attached  him do I call a holy man
He whose lust and hatred pride and hypocrisy have fallen off
like a mustard seed from the point of a needle  him do I call a holy man
He who utters gentle instructive and truthful words
who imprecates none  him do I call a holy man
He who in this world takes nothing that is not given to him be it long or short small or big good or bad  him do I call a holy man
He who wants nothing of either this world or the next
who is desirefree and emancipated  him do I call a holy man
He who has no attachment who through perfect knowledge is free from doubts
and has plunged into the Deathless  him do I call a holy man
He who in this world has transcended the ties of both merit and demerit
who is sorrowless stainless and pure  him do I call a holy man
He who like the moon is spotless and pure serene and clear
who has destroyed the delight in existence  him do I call a holy man
He who having traversed this miry perilous and delusive round of existence
has crossed over and reached the other shore who is meditative calm free from doubt
and clinging to nothing has attained to Nibbana  him do I call a holy man
He who having abandoned sensual pleasures has renounced the household life and become a homeless one
has destroyed both sensual desire and continued existence  him do I call a holy man
He who having abandoned craving has renounced the household life and become a homeless one
has destroyed both craving and continued existence  him do I call a holy man
He who casting off human bonds and transcending heavenly ties
is wholly delivered of all bondages  him do I call a holy man
He who having cast off likes and dislikes has become tranquil is rid of the substrata of existence
and like a hero has conquered all the worlds  him do I call a holy man
He who in every way knows the death and rebirth of all beings
and is totally detached blessed and enlightened  him do I call a holy man
He whose track no gods no angels no humans trace
the arahant who has destroyed all cankers  him do I call a holy man
He who clings to nothing of the past present and future
who has no attachment and holds on to nothing  him do I call a holy man
He the Noble the Excellent the Heroic the Great Sage the Conqueror

who has reached the summit of spiritual excellence  him do I call a holy man
When he heard Kisā Gotamī pronounce this Stanza he said This woman has taught me where true happiness is to be found and taking off a string of pearls he sent it to her as a present Having entered his own residence he lay down on the royal couch and as he lay there beheld the disgusting appearance of the nautchgirls asleep Heartsick he roused his courtier Channa caused his steed Kanthaka to be brought to him mounted Kanthaka and taking Channa with him as his companion and surrounded by the deities of the Ten Thousand Worlds he went forth and made the Great Retirement Proceeding to the bank of the river Anoma he retired from the world and adopted the life of a monk Having adopted the life of a monk he proceeded to Rājagaha and went about the city receiving alms Then he retired to Paṇḍava mountain and seated himself in Paṇḍava mountain cave While he was sitting there the king of Magadha came to him and offered to bestow his kingdom upon him but this offer of the king he straightway refused He promised the king however to visit his kingdom so soon as he should attain Omniscience Then he approached ḷāra and Uddaka but after following their system of discipline failed to win the Attainment which distinguishes one who has attained Arahatship Thereafter for a period of six years he engaged in the Great Struggle Early in the morning on the day of full moon of the month Visākhā he ate riceporridge presented to him by Sujāta caused his golden bowl to float on the river Nerañjarā and spent the day in Mahāvana Grove in the various degrees of Ecstatic Meditation In the evening he listened to the praise of his noble qualities bestowed upon him by Kāḷa King of the Dragons ascended the Throne of Wisdom received the bundles of grass presented to him by Sotthiya scattered the grass before him and formed the following resolution I will not abandon this posture until I have ceased utterly to care for the things of this world and my heart has thus rid itself of the Depravities Thereupon he sat down facing the east and before the sun had set overcame the host of Māra In the first watch he acquired the knowledge of previous states of existence in the second watch he acquired the knowledge of the vanishing of creatures from one state of existence and of their reappearance in another at the conclusion of the last watch he acquired the knowledge of the Causes of Existence fathoming the depths of Omniscience and acquiring the Ten Forces the Four Subjects of Confidence and all of the Noble Qualities For seven weeks he remained on the Throne of Wisdom in the eighth week he seated himself under the Goatherds Banyantree and meditated upon the depths of the Law finally arriving at misgivings as to his ability to preach the Law to others Straightway Sahampati Brahmā accompanied by the retinue of the Ten Thousand Worlds with which Mahā Brahmā is wont to be accompanied approached him and requested him to preach the Law to others Surveying the world with the eye of a Buddha he acceded to Brahmās request To whom pray shall I first preach the Law thought he Surveying the world he became aware of the death of ḷāra and Uddaka But remembering the devoted services of the Five Monks he arose from his seat and went to Kāsipura meeting Upaka by the way and talking with him On the day of full moon of the month sāḷha he arrived at Isipatana in the Deerpark at the place of residence of the Five Monks and when the Five Monks addressed him improperly he instructed them how properly to address him Then he set in motion the Wheel of the Law giving to drink of the Deathless to a hundred and eighty millions of angels but above all to the monk AññaKoṇḍañña Having set in motion the glorious Wheel of the Law on the fifth day of the halfmonth he established all those monks in Arahatship On the same day also he perceived that the noble youth Yasa possessed the dispositions requisite for Conversion and when the noble youth Yasa left his house in disgust at what he saw during the night he saw him and summoned him and made a monk of him saying Come Yasa In that same night also he caused him to attain the Fruit of Conversion and on the following day caused him to attain Arahatship Afterwards he made monks of his fiftyfour companions employing the formula Come monks And having made monks of them he caused them to attain Arahatship
There were thus sixtyone Arahats in the world Having kept residence during the season of the rains and having celebrated the terminal festival he sent out the sixty monks into all the world saying Go forth monks preaching and teaching  He himself proceeded to Uruvelā on the way thither in Kappāsika grove instructing the Thirty Youths known as the Bhaddavaggiyas
Of these the least attained the Fruit of Conversion and the greatest attained the Fruit of the Third Path
All these youths he received into the Order with the single formula Come monks And when he had so done he sent them out into all the world Arriving at Uruvelā he performed three thousand five hundred miracles  and converted UruvelāKassapa NadīKassapa and GayāKassapa These were three brothers ascetics who wore matted hair with a following of a thousand disciples These ascetics he instructed in the Law And when he had so done he received them into the Order with the single formula Come monks Seating them at Gayāsīsa he established them in Arahatship by preaching the Fire Sermon then attended by a thousand Arahats he went to Latthivana Garden near the city of Rājagaha intending to redeem the promise he had given to King Bimbisāra The Teacher has arrived went forth the cry Hearing the report King Bimbisāra approached with twelve nahutas of Brahman householders and to him the Buddha preached the Law in a pleasing manner establishing the king and eleven nahutas of Brahmans in the Fruit of Conversion and one nahuta of Brahmans in the Refuges On the following day he listened to the praise of his noble qualities by Sakka king of the gods disguised as a Brahman youth and then entered the city of Rājagaha Having eaten his meal in the royal  residence he accepted the gift of Veḷuvana monastery and took up his residence there
And there it was that Sāriputta and Moggallāna came to him
Before the Buddha appeared in the world there were two Brahman villages not far from Rājagaha named Upatissa village and Kolita village
One day a Brahmans wife named Rūpasārī who lived in Upatissa village conceived a child in her womb and on the same day a Brahmans wife named Moggalī who lived in Kolita village likewise conceived a child in her womb
We are told that for seven generations these two families had been firmly knit and bound together in the bonds of friendship they performed the Protection of the Embryo for the two expectant mothers on the same day
On the expiration of ten lunar months both women gave birth to sons
On the day appointed for the naming of the children they gave the name Upatissa to the son of the Brahman woman whose name was Sārī because he was the son of the principal family in Upatissa village  to the other boy because he was the son of the principal family in Kolita village they gave the name Kolita
As they grew up both boys attained the highest proficiency in all the arts and sciences
Whenever the youth Upatissa went to the river or the garden to disport himself five hundred golden litters accompanied him five hundred chariots drawn by thoroughbreds accompanied the youth Kolita
The two youths had retinues of five hundred boys apiece
Now there is a festival celebrated every year in Rājagaha which goes by the name of Mountaintop festival
A couch for the two youths was set up in one place
and the two youths sat together and witnessed the passing show When there was occasion to laugh they laughed when there was occasion to weep they wept when it was time to give alms they gave alms In this way they witnessed the festivities for several days
But one day when they had grown wiser there was no laugh when they might have laughed as on preceding days there were no tears when they might have wept and when their alms were sought they gave no alms
The following thought we are told occurred to the two youths Why should we look at this Before a hundred years have passed all these people will have gone hence and will no more be seen It behooves us rather to seek the Way of Release And taking this  thought to heart they sat down
Then Kolita said to Upatissa Friend Upatissa you do not appear to be pleased and delighted as on previous days Nay rather you are afflicted with melancholy What is in your mind
Friend Kolita I sit thinking There is no lasting satisfaction in looking upon these folk  this is all unprofitable it behooves me rather to seek the Way of Release for myself
But why are you melancholy
Kolita said the same thing
When Upatissa discovered that Kolitas thoughts were one with his own he said Both of us have had a happy thought It behooves us both to seek the Way of Release and to retire from the world together
Under what teacher shall we retire from the world
Now at this time a wandering ascetic named Sañjaya entered the city of Rājagaha accompanied by a large retinue of wandering ascetics
We will retire from the world and become monks under Sañjaya said Upatissa and Kolita So they dismissed five hundred retainers saying to them Take the litters and the chariots and go and together with the remaining five hundred retired from the world and became monks under Sañjaya
From the day when these two youths retired from the world and became monks under Sañjaya Sañjaya reached the pinnacle of gain and renown
In but a few days they had passed the bounds of Sañjayas teaching Therefore they asked him Teacher is this all the religious truth you know or is there something more besides
This is all there is you know all Upatissa and Kolita thought to themselves If this is the case it is profitless for us to remain pupils of this teacher any longer The Way of Release we retired from the world to seek for we certainly cannot obtain from this teacher But the Land of the Roseapple is an extensive country Let us journey through villages markettowns and royal cities We shall surely find some teacher who will expound to us the Way of Release
From that time forth wherever they heard there was a learned monk or Brahman they went to him and held converse with him
The questions Upatissa and Kolita asked the others  were not able to answer but every question the others asked Upatissa and Kolita answered
In this manner they traveled all over the Land of the Roseapple then they retraced their steps and returned to their own homes again Before they separated Upatissa said to Kolita Friend Kolita whichever of us first attains the Deathless is to inform the other  Having made this agreement they separated
While they were living under this agreement the Teacher after  traveling from place to place as has been related above arrived at Rājagaha accepted the gift of Veḷuvana monastery and took up his residence at Veḷuvana
Now after the Teacher had sent forth the sixtyone Arahats to proclaim the virtues of the Three Jewels saying Go forth monks preaching and teaching one of the Band of Five the Great Elder Assaji turned back came to Rājagaha and on the following day early in the morning taking his bowl and his robe entered Rājagaha for alms
On the same day early in the morning the wandering ascetic Upatissa ate his breakfast and proceeding to the hermitage of the wandering ascetics saw the Elder When he saw him he thought to himself Never before have I seen a monk like this monk He must be one of those monks who have attained Arahatship in this world or who have entered upon the path leading to Arahatship Suppose I were to approach this monk and ask him For whose sake brother have you retired from the world And who is your teacher And whose doctrine do you profess 
Then this thought occurred to him It is not the proper time to ask this monk questions for he is going from house to house for alms Suppose I were to follow close in the footsteps of this monk as those are wont to do who seek some favor 
Therefore observing that the monk had received a portion of alms and was on his way to a certain place and perceiving that he desired to sit down  he placed his own monks stool on the ground and offered it to him and when the monk had finished his meal offered him water from his own waterpot
Having thus performed the duties of a pupil to a teacher he exchanged pleasant greetings with the Elder after the meal was over and said to him Calm and serene brother are your organs of sense clean and clear is the hue of your skin For whose sake brother did you retire from the world And who is your teacher And whose doctrine do you profess 
The Elder thought to himself These wandering ascetics are hostile to the religion I profess therefore I will show this monk the profundity of our religion
But first he explained that he was himself a mere novice saying Brother I am as yet a mere novice no long time have I been a monk but recently did I approach this Doctrine and Discipline just now I shall not be able to expound the Law at length
Thought the wandering ascetic I am Upatissa say much or little according to your ability I will undertake to fathom the meaning in a hundred ways or a thousand ways Therefore he said 
Say little or much tell me the substance only
I have need of the substance only why utter many words
In response the Elder pronounced the first line of the Stanza Of all things that proceed from a cause of these the cause the Tathāgata hath told And also how these cease to be this too the mighty monk hath told
So soon as the wandering ascetic heard the first line he was established in the Fruit of Conversion perfect in a thousand ways  So soon as he was established in the Fruit of Conversion the Elder completed the second line
But after he had attained the Fruit of Conversion the Higher Excellence failed to appear Therefore he considered There must be a reason for this and said to the Elder Do not carry your teaching of the Law any further let this suffice Where does our Teacher reside
At Veḷuvana brother
Well then Reverend Sir you go on ahead I have a friend and he and I made the following agreement with each other Whichever of us first attains the Deathless is to inform the other
I wish first to redeem this promise I will bring my friend with me and go to the Teacher following the same path you take So saying Upatissa prostrated himself before the feet of the Elder with the Five Rests  walked thrice around him sunwise and then took leave of him and went to meet the leader of the wandering ascetics
The wandering ascetic Kolita saw him approaching from afar and said to himself Today my friends face has a hue not as on other days it must be that he has attained the Deathless Therefore he asked him at once whether he had attained the Deathless
Upatissa said in reply Yes brother I have attained the Deathless So saying he pronounced the same Stanza Assaji had pronounced
At the conclusion of the Stanza Kolita was established in the Fruit of Conversion Thereupon Kolita said Friend where does our Teacher reside
At Veḷuvana friend So I was informed by our teacher the Elder Assaji
Well then friend let us go let us see the Teacher
Now it was a distinguishing trait of the Elder Sāriputta that he always held a teacher in profound respect Therefore said he to his friend Friend let us inform our teacher the wandering ascetic Sañjaya that we have attained the Deathless  Thus will his mind be awakened and he will comprehend But should he fail to  comprehend he will at any rate believe what we say to be true and so soon as he has listened to the preaching of the Buddhas he will attain the Path and the Fruit
Accordingly the two wandering ascetics went to Sañjaya
When Sañjaya saw them he asked Friends did you succeed in finding anyone able to show you the Way to the Deathless
Yes teacher such a one have we found The Buddha has appeared in the world the Law has appeared the Order has appeared You sir are walking in vain unreality Come sir let us go to the Teacher
You may go I cannot go
For what reason
In the past I have gone about as a teacher of the multitude For me to become a pupil again would be as absurd as for a chatty to go to the well I shall not be able to live the life of a pupil 
Do not act thus teacher
Never mind friends you may go but I cannot go
Teacher from the moment of the Buddhas appearance in the world the populace will take perfumes garlands and so forth in their hands and will go and do honor to him alone Let us also go there
What do you intend to do
 Friends which are more numerous in this world the stupid or the wise
 Teacher the stupid are many the wise are few
 Well then friends let the wise men go to the wise monk Gotama and let the stupid come to stupid me  You may go but I shall not go
 You will become a famous man teacher said his two former pupils and departed
As they departed Sañjayas congregation broke up at that instant the grove was empty
When Sañjaya saw that the grove was empty he vomited hot blood
Five hundred wandering ascetics accompanied the two on their journey a little way Of these two hundred and fifty remained loyal to Sañjaya and turned back the other two hundred and fifty wandering ascetics the two received as their own pupils and took with them to Veḷuvana
As the Teacher sat in the midst of the fourfold congregation preaching the Law he saw the two wandering ascetics approaching from afar Straightway he addressed the monks Monks here come two friends Kolita and Upatissa They will become my pair of disciples my chief and noble pair
The two wandering ascetics paid obeisance to the Teacher sat down respectfully on one side and spoke thus to the Teacher Reverend Sir we should like to receive admission to the Order at the hands of the Exalted One we should like to make our full profession
 Said the Exalted One Come monks The Law has been well taught Lead the holy life to the end that all suffering may be utterly done away
 Instantly they became possessed of  bowls and robes created by supernatural power and became as it were Elders of a hundred years residence
By the acts of the company of his disciples the Teacher caused the preaching of the Law constantly to increase
With the exception of the two Chief Disciples all attained Arahatship The two Chief Disciples however did not complete the meditations leading to the Three Higher Paths
What was the reason for this
It was because of the magnitude of the Perfection of Knowledge of Chief Disciples
Now Venerable Moggallāna the Great  residing near the village Kallavāḷa in the kingdom of Magadha fell into sloth and torpor on the seventh day after the day of his reception into the Order But aroused by the Teacher he shook off sloth and torpor and applying himself to the Formula of Meditation on the Elements given him by the Tathāgata completed the meditations leading to the Three Higher Paths and attained the goal of the Perfection of Knowledge of Chief Disciples
As for the Elder Sāriputta he spent the fortnight following his reception into the Order with the Teacher residing at Sūkarakhata Cave near the same city Rājagaha Having heard an exposition of the Vedanāpariggaha Suttanta by his own sisters son the wandering monk Dīghanakha  he applied his mind to the Sutta and like a man who eats rice boiled for another man attained the goal of the Perfection of Knowledge of Chief Disciples
Surely the Venerable Sāriputta is a man of great intelligence Why then does he require a longer time than Moggallāna the Great to attain the goal of the Perfection of Knowledge of Chief Disciples
Because the preliminaries are so elaborate
We must understand that the case is analogous to that of a king who when he wishes to set out on a journey is obliged to make great preparations such as caparisoning ridingelephants On the other hand a poor man no matter where he may wish to go immediately goes there without more ado
On the very day when Sāriputta and Moggallāna were received into the Order as the shadows of evening lengthened the Teacher gathered his disciples together at Veḷuvana assigned the place of Chief Disciples to the newcomers and then recited the Pātimokkha
Here he suffers This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while in residence at Jetavana with reference to Devadatta
The story of Devadatta from the time he became a monk to the time the earth opened and swallowed him up is related in all the Jātakas
The following is a synopsis of the story While the Teacher was in residence at Anupiya Mangogrove which lies near Anupiya a markettown of the Mallas
eighty thousand  kinsmen one day recognized on him the Characteristics of a Tathāgata and eighty thousand youths asserted Let him be a king or a Buddha he will spend his days surrounded by a retinue of Warriorprinces
After all but six of these youths had retired from the world and become monks the company of princes observing that the six Sakyan princes King Bhaddiya Anuruddha nanda Bhagu Kimbila and Devadatta had not yet retired from the world We admit only our own sons to the Order But of course these six Sakyan princes are not kinsmen of the Buddha For this reason doubtless they have not retired from the world and become monks
 discussed the matter
Now one day the Sakyan prince Mahānāma approached Anuruddha and said Friend there isnt one of our family who has become a monk You become a monk and I will follow your example 
Now Anuruddha is said to have been brought up in such softness and luxury that he had never heard the word isnt before
For example one day these six Sakyan princes engaged in a game of marbles Anuruddha staked cakes on the result proved a loser and sent home for cakes His mother prepared cakes and sent them
The princes ate the cakes and resumed their play
Anuruddha lost repeatedly
Three times in all his mother sent him cakes The fourth time she sent back word There isnt cake to send
Now Anuruddha had never before heard the word isnt Therefore supposing that this must be a variety of cake he sent the man back saying to him Fetch me some isnt cakes
When his mother received the message Then my lady send me some isnt cakes she thought to herself My son has never heard the word isnt before By this means however I can teach him the meaning of it  So she took an empty golden bowl covered it with another golden bowl and sent it to her son
The guardian deities of the city thought When Anuruddha the Sakyan was Annabhāra he gave food that was his own portion to the Private Buddha Upariṭṭha making the Earnest Wish May I never hear the word isnt may I never know where food comes from  Now if he sees the empty bowl we shall never be able to enter the assembly of the gods it may even happen that our heads will split into seven pieces
So they filled the bowl with celestial cakes
As soon as the bowl was set down on the round platter uncovered the fragrance of the cakes permeated the entire city
Moreover the moment a morsel of cake was placed in the mouth it thrilled the seven thousand nerves of taste
Anuruddha thought to himself My mother does not love me all this time she has never fried this isnt cake  for me From this time forth I shall eat no other kind of cake  So he went home and asked his mother Mother do you love me or do you not
My dear son even as the eye is dear to one who possesses but one eye and even as the heart so are you exceedingly dear to me
Then dear mother why is it that all this time you have not fried isnt cake for me
Said the mother to her little page Boy is there nothing in the bowl
My lady the plate is filled to overflowing with cakes and with such cakes as I have never seen before
The mother thought to herself It must be that my son has acquired great merit it must be that he has made an Earnest Wish deities must have filled the plate with cakes and sent them
Said the son to the mother Dear mother from this time forth I will eat no other kind of cake than this henceforth I pray you fry isnt cake alone for me
From that time forth whenever her son said I should like some cakes to eat she would send a bowl absolutely empty covered with another bowl
So long as he continued to live at home during all that time deities sent him celestial cakes
Since Anuruddha was so unsophisticated as all this how could he be expected to know the meaning of the expression becoming a monk
For this reason therefore he asked his brother What is this becoming a monk  His brother replied The life of a monk involves cutting off the hair and beard sleeping with indifference whether in a thornbrake or in a fine bed and going the rounds for alms
Anuruddha replied Brother I am exceedingly delicate
I shall never be able  to become a monk
Very well my dear brother then learn farming and live the life of a householder
But at least one of us must become a monk
Then said Anuruddha What is this farming 
How could you expect a youth to know the meaning of the word farming who did not know where food comes from
For example on a certain day a discussion arose among the three princes Kimbila Bhaddiya and Anuruddha as to where food comes from
Kimbila said It comes from the barn
Bhaddiya said to him You do not know where food comes from it comes from the boiler
Anuruddha said Both of you together do not know where food comes from It comes from a golden bowl with jeweled knob 
We are told that one day Kimbila saw rice being removed from a barn and immediately formed the opinion These grains of rice were produced in the barn
Likewise one day Bhaddiya saw food being taken out of a boiler and formed the opinion It was produced  in the boiler
Anuruddha however had never seen men pounding rice or boiling it or taking it out of the boiler but had seen it only after it had been taken out of the boiler and set before him
So Anuruddha formed the opinion When one desires to eat food makes its appearance in a golden bowl
Such was the ignorance of all three princes as to where food comes from
Now when Anuruddha asked the question What is this farming  he received the following answer First the field must be plowed and after that such and such other things must be done and these things must be done year after year  Said he to himself When will the duties connected with farming ever come to an end When shall we ever have time to enjoy our possessions in peace  And because it seemed to him that the duties connected with farming would never come to an end and never cease he said to his brother Well then if this is the case you may live the life of a householder But as for me I have no use for it  Accordingly he approached his mother  and said to her Mother give me your permission I wish to become a monk  Thrice Anuruddha requested his mother to give him permission to become a monk and thrice she refused to do so Finally she said to him If your friend King Bhaddiya will become a monk then you may become a monk with him  Accordingly he approached his friend Bhaddiya and said to him Friend whether I shall become a monk or not is conditional upon your becoming a monk  Anuruddha urged his friend Bhaddiya with every argument at his command to become a monk and finally on the seventh day obtained Bhaddiyas promise to become a monk with him
So six princes of the Warrior caste Bhaddiya king of the Sakyans Anuruddha nanda Bhagu Kimbila and Devadatta accompanied by Upāli the barber as seventh man for seven days enjoyed celestial glory like gods and then set out with fourfold array as though on their way to a pleasuregarden When they reached foreign territory they turned back their army by royal command and then entered foreign territory
There each of the six princes removed his own ornaments made a bundle of them and gave them to Upāli saying Now Upāli turn back All this wealth will suffice to provide you with means of livelihood
Upāli flung himself at their feet rolled over and over on the ground and wept bitterly But not daring to disobey the order he arose and turned back
When they parted the forest wept as it were and the earth quaked as it were
When Upāli had gone a little way he thought to himself Harsh and cruel are these Sakyans they may kill me thinking I have killed their brethren
These Sakyan princes have renounced all this splendor have cast away these priceless ornaments like a mass of saliva and intend to become monks  why not I  So saying he untied the bundle hung those ornaments on a tree and said Let those who want them take them Having so done he went to the Sakyan princes and when they asked him why he had turned back told them the whole story
So the six Sakyan princes took Upāli the barber with them went to the Teacher and said to him We Reverend Sir are proud Sakyans This man has been a servitor of ours for a long time Admit him to the Order first to him first we will offer respectful salutations so will our pride be humbled  Thus first did they cause Upāli the barber to be admitted to the Order and after that entered the Order themselves
Of the six Sakyan princes Venerable Bhaddiya attained Threefold Knowledge in that very rainy season
Venerable Anuruddha attained Supernatural Vision and after listening to the Sutta entitled The Reflections of a Great Man  attained Arahatship
Venerable nanda was established in the Fruit of Conversion
Elder Bhagu and Elder Kimbila subsequently developed Spiritual Insight and attained Arahatship
Devadatta attained the lower grade of Magic Power
After a time while the Teacher was in residence at Kosambi rich gain and honor accrued to the Tathāgata and his company of disciples
Men entered the monastery bearing in their hands robes medicines and other offerings and asked Where is the Teacher Where is the Elder Sāriputta Where is the Elder Moggallāna Where is the Elder Kassapa Where is the Elder Bhaddiya Where is the Elder Anuruddha Where is the Elder nanda Where is the Elder Bhagu Where is the Elder Kimbila  So saying they went about looking at the places where sat the eighty Chief Disciples
Since no one asked Where does the Elder Devadatta sit and stand
Devadatta thought to himself I became a monk at the same time as these other monks Even as they are men of the Warrior caste who have become monks so also am I a man of the Warrior caste who have become a monk But whereas men bearing rich  offerings seek out these monks no one takes my name on his lips
With whom now can I make common cause With whom can I ingratiate myself that I may obtain gain and honor for myself 
Then the following thought occurred to him This King Bimbisāra on the day when he first saw the Buddha became established in the Fruit of Conversion together with eleven nahutas of men besides I cannot make common cause with him Neither can I make common cause with the king of Kosala
But this kings son Ajātasattu knows no ones good qualities or bad qualities I will make common cause with him
Accordingly Devadatta departed from Kosambi to Rājagaha transformed himself into a youth put four snakes on his hands and feet put one snake about his neck coiled one snake about his head as a cushionrest placed one snake on one shoulder and thus arrayed in a girdle of snakes he descended from the air and seated himself in Ajātasattus lap Ajātasattu was frightened and said Who are you  I am Devadatta  In order to dispel Ajātasattus fear Devadatta changed his form stood before Ajātasattu wearing the robe of a monk and carrying a monks bowl ingratiated himself with Ajātasattu and obtained for himself gain and honor
Overcome with the gain and honor he received Devadatta thought to himself It is I who ought to be at the head of the Congregation of Monks  Once having allowed this evil thought to spring up in his breast with the springing up of the evil thought Devadatta lost the power to work miracles Now at this time the Teacher was preaching the Law to the Congregation at Veḷuvana monastery and the king was among the Congregation While the Exalted One was preaching the Law Devadatta paid obeisance to him and then rising from his seat extended his hands in an attitude of reverent salutation and said Reverend Sir the Exalted One is now worn out stricken with years and aged let him live a pleasant life in this world free from care I will direct the Congregation of Monks commit the Congregation of Monks to my hands   The Teacher instead of consenting to the arrangement suggested by Devadatta refused his request and called him a lickspittle Therefore Devadatta was highly indignant and now for the first time conceiving hatred towards the Teacher departed
The Teacher caused public proclamation to be made concerning Devadatta at Rājagaha
Devadatta thought to himself Now I have been rejected by the monk Gotama now I will make trouble for him  With this thought in mind he approached Ajātasattu and said to him Youth aforetime  men were longlived but now they are shortlived
This makes it probable that you being a prince will soon die Well then You kill your father and become king and I will kill the Exalted One and become Buddha  So when Ajātasattu was established in his kingdom Devadatta hired men to kill the Tathāgata But the men he hired attained the Fruit of Conversion and turned back Then Devadatta himself climbed Vulture Peak and said to himself I alone will deprive the monk Gotama of life  So saying he split off a piece of rock and hurled it down But he succeeded only in drawing the Teachers blood Failing in this way also to kill him he next dispatched the elephant Nālāgiri against the Teacher
When the elephant approached the Elder nanda offered his own life in behalf of the Teacher and stood in the breach
The Teacher subdued the elephant and then departed from the city and went to the monastery After partaking of the offerings of food brought by countless thousands of lay disciples he preached in due course to the residents of Rājagaha one hundred and eighty millions in number and eightyfour thousand living beings obtained Comprehension of the Law Said the monks How noble is the Venerable nanda When so mighty an elephant approached he offered his own life  and stood in front of the Teacher  The Teacher hearing the Elder praised in this wise said Monks this is not the first time he has renounced his life for my sake he did the same thing in a previous state of existence And in response to a request of the monks he related the Culla Hasa  Mahā Hasa  and Kakkaṭa  Jātakas
Devadattas wickedness did not by any means become so notorious from his having compassed the kings death nor from his hiring murderers to kill the Tathāgata nor from his splitting off the piece of rock as it did from his letting loose the elephant Nālāgiri
For upon that the people raised a tumult and said Devadatta alone had the king killed and hired murderers and cast down the rock
But now he has turned the elephant Nālāgiri loose Behold what manner of evildoer the king has on his hands
The king then hearing the words of the populace caused Devadattas five hundred cookingvessels to be removed and did not thereafter minister to his wants Likewise the citizens did not so much as offer food to him when he came to their houses
When he had thus lost gain and honor he determined to live by  deceit Therefore he approached the Teacher and made the Five Demands But the Teacher rejected his demands saying Enough Devadatta Whoever so desires let him be a forest hermit  Brethren whose words are the nobler the words of the Tathāgata or the words which I myself have uttered Very well Reverend Sir all their life long monks should be forestdwellers beggars wearers of rags from a dustheap living at the foot of a tree eating neither fish nor flesh
Whosoever desires release from suffering let him come with me  So saying Devadatta departed 
Some monks who had but recently retired from the world and who possessed little intelligence hearing his words said Devadatta spoke fair let us join him  So they joined him
Thus Devadatta with his five hundred monks sought to persuade all manner of people both hardened and believing to accept the Five Points And living by soliciting food from various families he strove to create a schism in the Order
The Exalted One asked him Devadatta is it true as men say that you are striving to create schism and heresy in the Order  It is true replied Devadatta Said the Teacher Devadatta it is a grievous thing to create a schism in the Order  Continuing the Teacher admonished him at length But Devadatta paid no attention to the Teachers words He went forth and seeing the Venerable Elder nanda going his round for alms in Rājagaha said to him Brother nanda from this day forth I shall keep Fast and Chapter apart from the Exalted One apart from the Order
The Elder told the Exalted One
When the Teacher realized the fact he was filled with righteous indignation and said to himself Devadatta is doing that which will be of no profit to him in the Worlds of the Gods and the world of men that which will cause him to be tormented in the Avīci hell  And he reflected
Easy to do are deeds that are evil deeds that bring harm
But the deed that brings welfare the deed that is good that truly is hard to do
Having pronounced this Stanza he then breathed forth the following Solemn Utterance
Easy to do for the good is the good the good for the evil man is hard
Evil for the evil man is easy to do evil for the noble is hard
On Fastday as Devadatta sat on one side with his own retinue he said Let whoever approves of these Five Points take a ticket    Five hundred Licchavi princes novices having little gratitude took tickets Devadatta took these monks with him and went to Gayāsīsa
When the Teacher heard that he had gone there he sent forth the two Chief Disciples to bring those monks back
The Chief Disciples went there instructed the monks by performing miracles and wonders caused them to drink the Deathless and returned through the air bringing them with them
Said Kokālika Rise brother Devadatta Sāriputta and Moggallāna have carried off your monks Do you not remember my saying to you Brother trust not Sāriputta and Moggallāna
Said Devadatta Sāriputta and Moggallāna cherish evil desires are under the control of evil desires  As he spoke thus he struck the center of his heart with his knee and straightway hot blood burst forth from his mouth
When the monks saw Venerable Sāriputta surrounded by his retinue of monks soaring through the air they said Reverend Sir when Venerable Sāriputta went hence he went with but a single companion but now he is returning resplendent with a great retinue
Said the Teacher Monks it is not the first time this has happened when my son was reborn in the form of an animal then also did he return to me resplendent 
All goes well with the virtuous with those whose disposition is friendly
Behold Lakkhaṇa returning at the head of a host of relatives
Then look upon yonder Kāla without relatives
So saying he recited the Lakkhaṇa Jātaka
Again said the monks Reverend Sir they say that Devadatta seats a Chief Disciple on either side of him and imitates you saying I will preach the Law with the grace of a Buddha   Said the Teacher Monks this is not the first time he has so done in a previous state of existence also he strove to imitate me but was not able to do so
Vīraka have you seen a sweetvoiced bird
With neck like that of a peacock my husband Saviṭṭhaka
Because he tried to imitate a bird that walks both on water and on land
Saviṭṭhaka
became entangled in a sevālaplant and died
Supplying the rest of the story the Teacher related the Vīraka Jātaka On succeeding days with reference to the same subject the Teacher related the Kandagalaka  and Virocana Jātakas  
This garuḍa bird went through the woods
pecking at trees whose branches were soft and rotten
At last he came to an acaciatree whose wood is always sound
and broke his head
Your brains have run out your head is split open
All your ribs are broken today you are a pretty sight
Again one day hearing the remark Devadatta was ungrateful the Teacher related the Java Sakuṇa Jātaka 
We did you what service we could
King of beasts we render homage to you May we obtain some favor from you
Seeing that I hold you fast between my jaws I who feed upon blood
I whose nature is to kill it is a great deal that you yet live
Again with reference to Devadattas going about for the purpose of slaying he related the Kuruṅga Jātaka 
It is well known to the antelope that you let drop the fruit of the sepaṇṇi
Let us go to another sepaṇṇi your tree likes me not
Again when the discussion took this turn Devadatta fell away both from gain and honor and from the high position of a monk the Teacher said Monks this is not the first time he has so fallen away in a previous state of existence also he fell away  So saying he related the Ubhatobhaṭṭha Jātaka  
Your eyes are put out your garments are lost in your own house there is strife
Your business is ruined in both places both on water and on land
In this wise did the Teacher while he was in residence at Rājagaha relate many Jātakas about Devadatta From Rājagaha he went to Sāvatthi and took up his residence at Jetavana monastery
Devadattas sickness continued for nine months at the last desiring to see the Teacher he said to his own disciples I desire to see the Teacher make it possible for me to see him
They replied When you enjoyed good health you walked at enmity with the Teacher we will not lead you to him Said Devadatta Do not destroy me I have indeed conceived hatred towards the Teacher but the Teacher has not cherished so much as the tip of a hairs hatred towards me
And in very truth
Towards the murderer Devadatta towards the robber Aṅgulimāla
Towards Dhanapāla and Rāhula to each and all he manifested an even temper
Let me see the Exalted One begged Devadatta again and again
so finally they laid him on a litter and started out with him
When the monks heard that Devadatta was approaching they informed the Teacher of the fact saying Reverend Sir we hear that Devadatta is coming to see you
Monks he will not succeed in seeing me in this present existence
 
Reverend Sir he has reached such and such a place he has reached such and such a place
Let him do as he likes he will never succeed in seeing me again
Reverend Sir now he is only a league distant now he is only half a league distant now he is only a gavuta distant now he has reached the lotustank
Even if he enters within the Jetavana he will not succeed in seeing me 
Those who came with Devadatta set the litter down on the bank of the lotustank at the Jetavana and descended into the tank to bathe
Devadatta arose from his litter and sat down resting both feet on the ground
whereupon his feet sank into the earth
By degrees he sank into the earth first to the ankles then to the knees then to the hips then to the breast then to the neck Finally when his jawbone rested on the ground
With these bones Preeminent among men
god of gods charioteer of untamed humanity
Allseeing endowed with the auspicious marks of a hundred virtues
with these vital airs I seek refuge in the Buddha
he pronounced the following Stanza
There is a tradition that when the Tathāgata saw that matters had gone thus far he made a monk of Devadatta
And this he did because he became aware of the following If he shall remain a layman and not be received into the Order as a monk inasmuch as he has been guilty of grievous crimes it will be impossible for him to look forwards with confidence to future existence but if he shall become a monk no matter how grievous the crimes he has committed it will be possible for him to look forwards with confidence to future existence
 When Devadatta had sunk into the earth he was reborn in the Avīci hell
Since he sinned against an unchanging Buddha let him endure torture unchanging and such was the torture he suffered When he had entered the Avīci hell which is a hundred leagues in extent his body became a hundred leagues in height
His head as far as the outer ear entered an iron skull his feet as far as the ankles  entered earth of iron An iron stake as thick as the trunk of a palmyratree proceeded forth from the west wall of the iron shell pierced the small of his back came forth from his breast and penetrated the east wall Another iron stake proceeded forth from the south wall pierced his right side came forth from his left side and penetrated the north wall Another iron stake proceeded forth from the top of the iron skull pierced his skull came forth from his lower parts and penetrated earth of iron
In this position immovable he suffers this mode of torture
The monks began a discussion saying All this distance came Devadatta but failed to see the Teacher and was swallowed up by the earth
Said the Teacher Monks this was not the first time Devadatta sinned against me and was swallowed up by the earth in a previous state of existence also he was swallowed up by the earth And by way of illustrating the point he told the story of an incident in his own previous existence as king of the elephants He directed aright a man who had lost his way allowed him to mount his own back and carried him to a place of safety only to have the man return to him three successive times and saw off first the tips of his tusks then the middle and then the roots As the man passed out of sight of the Great Creature he was swallowed up by the earth
If one should give the whole earth to an ungrateful man
A man who is ever looking for an opportunity it would not satisfy him 
The discussion reverting to the same subject again and again in order to illustrate the swallowing up of Devadatta by the earth in his existence as Kalāburājā for an offense against himself in his existence as Khantivādi he related the Khantivādi Jātaka Again in order to illustrate the swallowing up of Devadatta by the earth in his existence as Mahāpatāparājā for an offense against himself in his existence as Culla Dhammapāla he related the Culla Dhammapāla  Jātaka
Now when Devadatta was swallowed up by the earth the populace was pleased and delighted and raising flags and banners and plantaintrees and setting up brimming jars held high festival saying His death is indeed our great gain
When the monks reported this incident to the Exalted One
the Exalted One said Monks this is not the first time the populace has rejoiced at Devadattas death  in times past also the populace rejoiced thereat  And when he had thus spoken to illustrate the rejoicing of the populace at the death of King Piṅgala of Benāres a man who was hated by all the people for his harshness and cruelty
All the people suffered harm at the hands of Piṅgala
so soon as he was dead they recovered confidence
Was he of the yellow eyes dear to you
Why do you weep porter
He of the yellow eyes was not dear to me
I fear to think of his return
Now that he has gone hence he may harm the king of death
and the king of death thus harmed may send him back again
he related the Piṅgala Jātaka
Finally the monks asked the Teacher Now Reverend Sir tell us where Devadatta was reborn
Monks he was reborn in the Avīci hell
Reverend Sir during his life here on earth he suffered and when he went hence he was reborn in a place of suffering
Yes monks they that abide in Heedlessness be they monks or laymen suffer in both places  So saying he pronounced the following Stanza
Here he suffers after death he suffers the evildoer suffers in both places
He suffers to think I have done evil yet more does he suffer gone to a place of suffering
It seems that before the appearance in the world of the present Buddha the king had been the servitor of a certain ruler
Now one day as this ruler was returning from his bath outside of the city a certain Private Buddha who had entered the city to receive alms came out with his bowl clean as it had been washed having received not a single morsel of food by reason of the evil influence of Māra over all the residents of the city
Indeed when the Private Buddha reached the gate of the city Māra approached him in disguise and asked him Reverend Sir did you receive anything
But have you made it possible for me to receive anything
Well then turn back and go in again Now I will make it possible for you to receive alms
I will not go back again
Had the Private Buddha returned Māra would once more have taken possession of the bodies of all the residents of the city and would have subjected him to the embarrassment of handclapping and rude laughter
Now when this ruler saw the Private Buddha returning with his bowl clean as it had been washed he asked him Reverend Sir did you receive anything
I have gone my round and am coming out brother
The ruler thought to himself His reverence does not answer the question I asked him but tells me something I did not ask about It must be that he failed to receive anything
The ruler looked at his bowl and saw that it was empty Not knowing whether the food in his house was ready or not and therefore brave though he was not daring to take his bowl he said Wait a moment Reverend Sir  So saying he went home quickly and asked Is our food ready  Receiving the answer that it was ready he said to his servitor Friend there is no one possessed of greater speed than you Make the greatest possible speed and when you reach his reverence say to him Reverend Sir give me your bowl and then take his bowl and return to me 
At the mere word of his master the servitor set out obtained the bowl and brought it back
The ruler filled the bowl with his own food and said Convey this to his reverence with all speed I make over to you the merit of this action
The servitor went quickly gave the bowl to the Private Buddha saluted him with the Five Rests and said to him Reverend Sir the time is short I went and returned with the greatest possible speed As the fruit of this speed may I obtain the five conveyances able to travel fifty sixty a hundred and a hundred and twenty leagues a day respectively As I returned and went my body was heated by the rays of the sun As the fruit of this in the various places where I shall be reborn may I possess authority equal to the power of the rays of the sun My master has made over to me the merit of this alms In consequence of this may I be a partaker of the Truth you have seen
The Private Buddha said So be it
May all youve wished and prayed for come out well
May all your aspirations be fulfilled even as the moon at the full
May all youve wished and prayed for come out well
May all your aspirations be fulfilled as by the jewel Dew of Light
 and returned thanks in these Stanzas
This was the kings deed in a previous state of existence
He was now Caṇḍa Pajjota
and in consequence of this deed he came to possess these five conveyances
Now one day the king went out to amuse himself in the garden
Nows the time to flee thought Udena So he filled several big leather sacks with gold and silver coins placed the sacks on the back of the female elephant assisted Vāsuladattā to mount and away they went
The harem guards saw what was happening and went and told the king
The king sent out a force in pursuit Go quickly said he
When Udena perceived that a force had set out in pursuit he opened a sack of gold and scattered the coins along the way His pursuers stopped to pick up the coins and then hurried along
Then he opened a sack of silver and scattered the coins along the way While his pursuers delayed because of their greed for silver Udena reached his own stockade built without the city
When his men saw him coming they surrounded him and escorted him back to Kosambi
When he arrived there he sprinkled Vāsuladattā and raised her to the rank of chief consort
This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Araññakuṭikā near Dīghalambika with reference to the youth Dīghāyu
The story goes that two Brahmans residents of the city of Dīghalambika retired from the world became members of an heretical order and for fortyeight years performed religious austerities
Finally one of them thought My line will perish I will therefore return to the world Accordingly he sold to others the merit of the austerities he had performed and with a hundred cattle and a hundred pieces of money procured him a wife and set up a household
After a time his wife gave birth to a son
Now the other monk his former companion after visiting foreign parts returned once more to that city
Hearing that he had returned the layman took son and wife and went to see him
When he met him he placed his son in the arms of the mother and himself saluted the monk Then the mother placed the child in the arms of the father and saluted the monk
Live long said the monk to them But when the son was made to salute him he held his peace
Said the father Reverend Sir why was it that when we saluted you you said Live long but when this boy saluted you you said not a word
Some disaster awaits this boy Brahman
How long will he live Reverend Sir
For seven days Brahman
Is there any way of averting this Reverend Sir
I know of no way of averting this
But who might know Reverend Sir
The monk Gotama go to him and ask him
Were I to go there I should be afraid because of having abandoned my austerities
 If you love your son think not of having abandoned your austerities but go to him and ask him 
The Brahman went to the Teacher and himself straightway saluted him
Live long said the Teacher When the boys mother saluted him he said the same But when they made the boy salute him he held his peace
Then the Brahman asked the Teacher the same question he had previously asked the monk and the Teacher made the same prediction
We are told that this Brahman not having attained omniscience united his own wisdom with omniscience but for all that discovered no way of averting his sons fate
The Brahman asked the Teacher Reverend Sir is there no way of averting this
There might be Brahman
What way might there be Reverend Sir 
If you erect a pavilion before the door of your house and set a chair in the center of it and arrange eight or sixteen seats in a circle about it and cause my disciples to sit therein and if you then cause texts to be recited for the purpose of securing protection and averting evil consequences for the space of seven days uninterruptedly in that case the danger that threatens him might be averted
Sir Gotama it is a perfectly easy matter to erect a pavilion and do all the rest but how am I to obtain the services of your disciples
If you will do all this I will send my disciples 
Very well Sir Gotama  So the Brahman completed all of the preparations at the door of his house and then went to the Teacher
The Teacher sent the monks and they went there and sat down seating the boy also on a little bench For seven nights and seven days without interruption the monks recited the usual texts and on the seventh day the Teacher came himself
When the Teacher came the deities of all the worlds assembled
But a certain ogre named Avaruddhaka who had served Vessavaṇa for twelve years and who had received the boon Seven days hence you shall receive this boy
approached and stood waiting
But when the Teacher came there and the powerful deities gathered themselves together and the weak deities drew back stepping back twelve leagues so as to make room
then Avaruddhaka stepped back also The Teacher recited the Protective Texts all night long
with the result that when the seven days had elapsed Avaruddhaka failed to get the boy
Indeed when the dawn of the eighth day rose they brought the boy and caused him to make obeisance to the Teacher
Said the Teacher Live long
Sir Gotama how long will the boy live
For a hundred and twenty years Brahman
So they gave him the name of Ladwhoseyearsincreased yuvaḍḍhana
When the youth grew up he went about surrounded by five hundred lay disciples
One day the monks began a discussion in the Hall of Truth Just think brethren The youth yuvaḍḍhana would have died on the seventh day but now he is destined to live for a hundred and twenty years There he goes surrounded by five hundred lay disciples There must therefore be some reason why the term of life of living beings here in the world increases
The Teacher approached and asked them Monks what are you sitting here now talking about  When they told him he said Monks it is not a matter of years alone Living beings here in the world who respect and reverence the virtuous increase in four matters obtain release from danger and abide in safety unto the end of their days  So saying he joined the connection and preaching the Law pronounced the following Stanza
If a man have the habit of reverence if he alway respect the aged
Four things increase for him age beauty happiness power
Though one should recite a hundred Stanzas This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana concerning Kuṇḍalakesī 
A rich merchant of Rājagaha it seems had an only daughter who was about sixteen years of age and she was exceedingly beautiful and fair to see
Her mother and father lodged her on the topmost floor of a sevenstoried palace in an apartment of royal splendor
and gave her only a single slavewoman to wait upon her
Now one day a young man of station was caught in the act of robbery They bound his hands behind his back and led him to the place of execution scourging him with lashes at every crossroads
The merchants daughter heard the shouts of the crowd said to herself What is that  looked down from the top of the palace and saw him  Straightway she fell in love with him So great in fact was her longing for him that she took to her bed and refused to eat
Her mother asked her What does this mean my dear daughter
If I can have that young man who was caught in the act of committing robbery and who was led through the streets life will be worth living
if not life is not worth living I shall die here and now
Do not act in this manner my dear daughter you shall have some one else for your husband some one who is our equal in birth and family and wealth
I will have no one else if I cannot have this man I shall die
The mother unable to pacify her daughter told the father
but the father likewise was unable to pacify his daughter What is to be done  thought he He sent a thousand pieces of money to the kings officer who had captured the robber and who was accompanying him to the place of execution saying Take this money and send the robber to me
Very well said the kings officer He took the  money released the robber had another man put to death and sent word to the king The robber has been executed your majesty 
The merchant gave his daughter in marriage to the robber
She resolved to win the favor of her husband and from that time on adorned with all her adornments she prepared her husbands meals with her own hand After a few days the robber thought to himself When can I kill this woman take her jewels and sell them and so be able to take my meals in a certain tavern
This is the way He took to his bed and refused to eat She came to him and asked Are you in pain
Not at all wife  Then perhaps my mother and father are angry with you
They are not angry with me wife
What is the matter then
Wife that day when I was bound  and led through the streets I saved my life by vowing an offering to the deity that lives on Robbers Cliff likewise it was through his supernatural power that I gained you for my wife I was wondering how I could fulfill my vow of an offering to the deity
Husband do not worry I will see to the offering tell me what is needed
Rich riceporridge flavored with honey and the five kinds of flowers including the lāja flower
Very well husband I will make ready the offering  Having prepared the whole offering she said to her husband Come husband let us go
Very well wife let your kinsmen remain behind put on your costly garments and adorn yourself with your precious jewels and we will go gayly laughing and disporting ourselves
She did as she was told
When they reached the foot of the mountain the robber said to her Wife from this point on let us two go alone we will send back the rest of the company in a conveyance you take the vessel containing the offering and carry it yourself
She did as she was told
The robber took her in his arms and climbed the mountain to the top of Robbers Cliff
One side of this mountain men can climb but the other side is a precipitous cliff
from the top of which robbers are flung
being dashed to pieces before they reach the bottom
therefore it is called Robbers Cliff
Standing on the top of the mountain she said Husband present the offering
Her husband made no reply
Again  she spoke Husband why do you remain silent  Then he said to her I have no use for the offering I deceived you in bringing you here with an offering
Then why did you bring me here husband
To kill you seize your jewels and escape
Terrified with the fear of death she said to him  Husband both my jewels and my person belong to you why do you speak thus
Over and over again she pleaded with him Do not do this but his only reply was I will kill you
After all what will you gain by killing me
Take these jewels and spare my life henceforth regard me as your mother or else let me be your slavewoman and work for you  So saying she recited the following Stanza
Take these golden bracelets all set with beryls
Take all and welcome call me your slavewoman
The robber hearing this said to her Despite what you say were I to spare your life you would go and tell your mother and father all I will kill you That is all Lament not with vehement lamentation  So saying he recited the following Stanza
Lament not overmuch tie up your possessions quickly
You have not long to live I shall take all your possessions 
She thought to herself Oh what a wicked deed is this
However wisdom was not made to be cooked and eaten but rather to make men look before they leap I shall find a way of dealing with him And she said to him Husband when they caught you in the act of committing robbery and led you through the streets I told my mother and father and they spent a thousand pieces of money in ransoming you and they gave you a place in their house
and from that time on I have been your benefactress today do me the favor of letting me pay obeisance to you
Very well wife said he granted her the favor of paying obeisance to him and then took his stand near the edge of the cliff
She walked around him three times keeping him on her right hand and paid obeisance to him in the four places Then she said to him Husband this is the last time I shall see you Henceforth you will see me no more neither shall I see you any more  And she embraced him both before and behind Then remaining behind him as he stood off his guard near the edge of the cliff she put one hand to his shoulder and the other to the small of his back and flung him over the cliff
Thus was the robber hurled into the abyss of the mountain and dashed to pieces when he reached the bottom
The deity that dwelt on the top of Robbers Cliff observed the actions of the two and applauding the woman uttered the following Stanza
Wisdom is not always confined to men
A woman too is wise and shows it now and then  
Having thrown the robber over the cliff the woman thought to herself If I go home they will ask me Where is your husband  and if in answer to their question I say I have killed him they will pierce me with the knives of their tongues saying We ransomed the scoundrel with a thousand pieces of money and now you have killed him  If on the other hand I say He sought to kill me for my jewels they will not believe me Im done with home She cast off her jewels went into the forest and after wandering about for a time came to a certain hermitage of nuns She reverently bowed and said Sister receive me into your Order as a nun
So they received her as a nun
After she had become a nun she asked Sister what is the goal of your Religious Life
Sister the development of spiritual ecstasy through the employment of the ten Kasiṇas or else the memorizing of a thousand articles of faith this is the highest aim of our Religious Life
Spiritual ecstasy I shall not be able to develop Reverend Sister but I will master the thousand articles of faith
When she had mastered the thousand articles of faith they said to her You have acquired proficiency now go throughout the length and breadth of the Land of the RoseApple and look for some one able to match question and answer with you  So placing a branch of roseapple in her hands  they dismissed her with these words Go forth sister if any one who is a layman is able to match question and answer with you become his slave if any monk enter his Order as a nun
Adopting the name Nun of the RoseApple she left the hermitage and went about from place to place asking questions of everyone she saw
No one was able to match question and answer with her
in fact such a reputation did she acquire that whenever men heard the announcement Here comes the Nun of the RoseApple  they would run away
Before entering a town or village for alms she would scrape a pile of sand together before the village gate and there plant her roseapple branch Then she would issue her challenge Let him that is able to match question and answer with me trample this roseapple branch under his feet  So saying she would enter the village
No one dared to pass beyond that spot
When one branch withered she would procure a fresh one  Traveling about in this way she arrived at Sāvatthi planted the branch before the city gate issued her challenge in the usual way and went in to seek alms
A number of young boys gathered about the branch and waited to see what would happen
Just then the Elder Sāriputta who had made his round and eaten his breakfast and was on his way out of the city saw those boys standing about the branch and asked them What does this mean
The boys explained matters to the Elder
Said the Elder Go ahead boys trample that branch under your feet
We are afraid to Reverend Sir 
I will answer the question you go ahead and trample the branch under your feet
The Elders words supplied the boys with the necessary courage Forthwith they trampled the branch under their feet shouting and kicking up the dust
When the nun returned she rebuked them and said I dont intend to bandy question and answer with you how did you come to trample the branch under your feet
Our noble Elder told us to
Reverend Sir did you tell them to trample my branch under their feet
Yes sister
Well then match question and answer with me
Very well I will do so 
As the shades of evening drew on she went to the Elders residence to put her questions The entire city was stirred up
The people said to each other Let us go and hear the talk of the two learned persons  Accompanying the nun from the city to the Elders residence they bowed to the Elder and seated themselves respectfully on one side
The nun said to the Elder Reverend Sir I wish to ask you a question
Ask it sister
So she asked him the thousand articles of faith Every question the nun asked the Elder answered correctly
Then he said to her You have asked only these few questions are there any others
These are all Reverend Sir
You have asked many questions I will ask you just one will you answer me
Ask your question Reverend Sir 
Then the Elder asked her the following question What is One 
She said to herself This is a question I should be able to answer but not knowing the answer she inquired of the Elder What is it Reverend Sir
That is the Buddhas question sister
Tell me also the answer Reverend Sir
If you will enter our Order I will tell you the  answer
Very well admit me to the Order
The Elder sent word to the nuns and had her admitted
After being admitted to the Order she made her full profession took the name Kuṇḍalakesī and after a few days became an Arahat endowed with the Supernatural Faculties
In the Hall of Truth the monks began a discussion of the incident Kuṇḍalakesī heard little of the Law and yet she succeeded in being admitted to the Order moreover she came here after fighting a fierce battle with a robber and defeating him
 The Teacher came in and asked them Monks what is it that you are sitting here discussing now  They told him Monks measure not the Law I have taught as being little or much  There is no superior merit in a hundred sentences that are meaningless but one Sentence of the Law is better
He that defeats all other robbers wins no victory at all but he who defeats the robbers that are his own Depravities his is victory indeed  Then he joined the connection and preaching the Law pronounced the following Stanzas
Though one should recite a hundred Stanzas composed of meaningless sentences
Yet one Sentence of the Law were better which if a man hear he is at peace
Though one should conquer a thousand times a thousand men in battle
Yet would he be the mightiest conqueror who should conquer one himself
Though one should live a hundred years This religious instruction was given by the Teacher at Jetavana with reference to Kisā Gotamī
Once upon a time the story goes a merchant worth four hundred millions lived at Sāvatthi Suddenly all of his wealth turned into charcoal
The merchant overwhelmed with grief refused to eat and took to his bed
One day a certain friend of his came to see him and asked him Sir why are you so sorrowful  The merchant told him what had happened Said his friend Sir give not yourself over to sorrow  I know a way out of the difficulty if you will but make use of it
Well sir what am I to do 
Said his friend Spread matting in your shop and pile the charcoal on it and sit down as if you were selling it People will come along and say to you Most merchants sell such things as clothing and oil and honey and molasses but you are sitting here selling charcoal
Then you must say to them If I cant sell what belongs to me what am I to do
But again some one may say Most merchants sell such things as clothing and oil and honey and molasses but you are sitting here selling yellow gold
Then you must say Wheres any yellow gold
Your customer will say There it is Then say Let me have it  Your customer will bring you a handful of charcoal Take it cover it with your hands
and presto it will turn into yellow gold
Now if your customer be a maiden marry her to your son turn over your four hundred millions to her and live on what she gives you
But if your customer be a youth marry your daughter to him as soon as she reaches marriageable age turn over your four hundred millions to him and live on what he gives you 
A fine plan indeed said the merchant  So he piled the charcoal up in his shop and sat down as if he were selling it
People  came along and said to him Most merchants sell such things as clothing and oil and honey and molasses but you are sitting here selling charcoal
To such as asked this question he replied as follows If I cant sell what belongs to me what am I to do 
There came one day to the door of his shop a certain maiden the daughter of a povertystricken house Her name was Gotamī but by reason of the leanness of her body she was generally known as Kisā Gotamī She came to buy something for herself but when she saw the merchant she said to him My good sir most merchants sell such things as clothing and oil and honey and molasses but you are sitting here selling yellow gold
Maiden where is there any yellow gold
Right there where you are sitting  Let me have some of it maiden
She took a handful of the charcoal and placed it in his hands No sooner had it touched his hands than presto it turned into yellow gold
Then said the merchant to her Which is your house maiden  Said she Such and such sir  The merchant perceiving that she was unmarried married her to his own son He then gathered up his wealth  and gave the four hundred millions into her charge
In time she became pregnant
and after ten lunar months gave birth to a son
But the child died as soon as he was able to walk
Now Kisā Gotamī had never seen death before Therefore when they came to remove the body for burning she forbade them to do so Said she to herself I will seek medicine for my son  Placing the dead child on her hip she went from house to house inquiring Know ye aught that will cure my son 
Everyone said to her Woman thou art stark mad that thou goest from house to house seeking medicine for thy dead child
But she went her way thinking Surely I shall find someone that knoweth medicine for my child 
Now a certain wise man saw her and thought to himself This my daughter hath no doubt borne and lost her first and only child nor death hath seen before I must help her  So he said to her Woman as for me I know not that wherewith to cure your child but one there is that knoweth and him I know
Sir who is it that doth know
Woman the Teacher doth know go ask him
Good sir I will go ask him   So she went to the Teacher paid obeisance to him stood at his side and asked him Venerable Sir is it true as men say that thou dost know that wherewith to cure my child
Yea that know I
What shall I get
A pinch of white mustard seed
That will I Venerable Sir
But in whose house shall I get it
In whose house nor son nor daughter nor any other hath yet died
Very well Venerable Sir said she and paid obeisance to him Then she placed the dead child on her hip entered the village stopped at the door of the very first house and asked Have ye here any white mustard seed  They say it will cure my child  Yea  Well then give it me
They brought grains of white mustard seed and gave to her She asked Friends in the house wherein ye dwell hath son or daughter yet died  What sayest thou woman
As for the living they be few only the dead be many  Well then take back your mustard seed that is no medicine for my child  So saying she gave back the mustard seed
After this manner going from house to house she plied her quest
Never a house wherein she found the mustard seed she sought and when the evening came she thought Ah tis a heavy task I took upon myself I thought twas I alone had lost a child but in every village the dead are more in number than the living
The while she thus reflected hard became the heart the which erewhile was soft with mothers love
She took the child and in a forest laid him down and going to the Teacher paid obeisance to him and beside him took her stand
Said the Teacher Didst thou get the single pinch of mustard seed
Nay that did I not Venerable Sir In every village the dead are more in number than the living
Said the Teacher Vainly didst thou imagine that thou alone hadst lost a child But all living beings are subject to an unchanging law and it is this
The Prince of Death like to a raging torrent  sweeps away into the sea of ruin all living beings still are their longings unfulfilled  And instructing her in the Law he pronounced the following Stanza
Whoso hath set his heart on sons or flocks and herds To worldly pleasures given oer whose thoughts 
Even as a torrent sweeps away a sleeping town So him the Prince of Death doth take and bear away
As the Teacher uttered the last word of the Stanza Kisā Gotamī was established in the Fruit of Conversion Likewise did many others also obtain the Fruit of Conversion and the Fruits of the Second and  Third Paths
Kisā Gotamī requested the Teacher to admit her to the Order accordingly he sent her to the community of nuns and directed that she be admitted
Afterwards she made her full profession and came to be known as the nun Kisā Gotamī
One day it was her turn to light the lamp in the Hall of Confession Having lighted the lamp she sat down and watched the tongues of flame Some flared up and others flickered out She took this for her Subject of Meditation and meditated as follows Even as it is with these flames so also is it with living beings here in the world some flare up while others flicker out they only that have reached Nibbāna are no more seen 
The Teacher seated in his Perfumed Chamber sent forth an apparition of himself and standing as it were face to face with her spoke and said Even as it is with these flames so also is it with living beings here in the world some flare up while others flicker out they only that have reached Nibbāna are no more seen Therefore better is the life of him that seeth Nibbāna though he live but for an instant than the lives of them that endure for a hundred years and yet see not Nibbāna  And joining the connection he instructed her in the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza
Though one should live a hundred years the region of the deathless never seeing
Twould be in vain instead twould better be To live a single day the region of the deathless seeing
At the conclusion of the discourse Kisā Gotamī even as she sat there attained Arahatship and the Supernatural Faculties
Though one should live a hundred years This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while in residence at Jetavana with reference to the nun Paṭācārā
Paṭācārā we are told was the daughter of a wealthy merchant of Sāvatthi Her father was worth four hundred millions and she was exceedingly beautiful
When she was about sixteen years old her parents provided quarters for her in a palace seven stories high and there they kept her on the topmost floor surrounded by guards
But in spite of these precautions she misconducted herself and it was with her own page  
Now it so happened that her father and mother had promised her in marriage to a certain young man who was her social equal and finally they set the weddingday
When the day was close at hand she said to the page My parents tell me that they intend to give me in marriage to a young man who comes of such and such a family Now you know very well that when I am once inside of my husbands house you may bring me presents and come to see me all you like but you will never never get inTherefore if you really love me dont delay an instant but find some way or other of getting me out of this  place
Very well my love
this is what I will do tomorrow early in the morning I will go to the citygate and wait for you at such and such a spot you manage somehow or other to get out of this place and meet me there  On the following day he went to the appointed place and waited
Paṭācārā got up very early in the morning put on soiled garments disheveled her hair and smeared her body with red powder Then in order to outwit her keepers she took a waterpot in her hand surrounded herself with slavemaidens and set out as if she intended to fetch water Escaping from the palace she went to the appointed place and met her lover
Together they went a long way off and took up their abode in a certain village The husband tilled the soil and gathered firewood and leaves in the forest
The wife fetched water in her waterpot and with her own hand pounded the rice did the cooking and performed the other household duties Thus did Paṭācārā reap the fruit of her own sin
By and by she became pregnant
and when the time for her delivery was near at hand she made the following request to her husband Here I have no one to help me But a mother and father always have a soft spot in their heart for their child Therefore take me home to them that I may give birth to my child in their house 
But her husband refused her request saying to her My dear wife what say you If your mother and father were to see me they would subject me to all manner of tortures It is out of the question for me to go
Over and over again she begged him and each time he refused her One day when her husband was away in the forest she went to the neighbors and said Should my husband ask you where I have gone when he returns tell him that I have gone home to my parents  And having so said she closed the door of her house and went away
When her husband returned and observed that she was not there he inquired of the neighbors and they told him what had happened I must persuade her to return thought he and set out after her Finally he caught sight of her and overtaking her begged her to return with him But try as he might he was unable to persuade her to do so
When they reached a certain place the birthpains came upon her
Said she to her husband Husband the birthpains are come upon me  So saying she made her way into a clump of bushes laid herself upon the ground and there with much tossing about and pain she  gave birth to a son Then she said What I set out to go home for is over  So back again to their house she went with him and once more they lived together
After a time she became pregnant again
When the time for her delivery was at hand she made the same request of her husband as before and received the same answer So she took her child upon her hip and went away just as she had before Her husband followed her overtook her and asked her to return with him This she refused to do
Now as they went on their way a fearful storm arose out of due season  The sky was ablaze with flashes of lightning and rent asunder as it were with thunderclaps and there was an incessant downpour of rain
At that moment the birthpains came upon her
She said to her husband Husband the birthpains are come upon me I cannot stand it find me a place out of the rain 
Her husband went hither and thither axe in hand seeking materials for a shelter Seeing some brushwood growing on the top of an anthill he set about to chop it down
Hardly had he begun his work when a poisonous snake slipped out of the anthill and bit him
Instantly his body was burned up as it were by flames of fire shooting up within him his flesh turned purple and in the place wherein he stood there he fell down dead
Paṭācārā suffering intense pain watched for her husband to return but in vain Finally she gave birth to a second son
The two children unable to withstand the buffeting of the wind and the rain screamed at the top of their lungs
The mother took them to her bosom and crouching upon the ground with her hands and knees pressed together remained in this posture all night long
Her whole body looked as though there were no blood left in it and her flesh had the appearance of a sere and yellow leaf
When the dawn rose she took her newborn son his flesh as red as a piece of meat and placed him on her hip Then she gave the older boy one of her fingers to hold and with the words Come dear child your father has left us set out along the same path her husband had taken  When she came to the anthill there on top of it she saw her husband lying dead his flesh purple his body rigid All on account of me said she my husband has died upon the road and wailing and lamenting she continued her journey
When she came to the river Aciravatī she observed that by reason of the rain which had lasted all night long the river was swollen kneedeep and in places waistdeep She was too weak to wade  across the stream with the two children therefore she left the older boy on the near bank and carried the younger across to the far side Breaking off a branch of a tree and spreading it out she laid the child on it Then thinking to herself I must return to my other child she took leave of the younger boy and turned to recross the stream But she could hardly bring herself to leave the little one and again and again she turned around to look at him
She had barely reached midstream when a hawk caught sight of the child and mistaking him for a piece of meat swooped down from the sky after him
The mother seeing the hawk swoop down after her child raised both her hands and screamed with a loud voice Begone begone  Three times she screamed
but the hawk was so far away that he failed to hear her and seizing the boy flew up into the air with him
When the older boy who had been left on the near bank saw his mother stop in the middle of the river and raise her hands and heard her scream with a loud voice he thought to himself She is calling me  And in his haste he fell into the water
In this wise was her younger son carried off by a hawk and her older son swept away by the river
And she wailed and lamented saying One of my sons has been carried off by a hawk the other swept away by the water by the roadside my husband lies dead   And thus wailing and lamenting she went on her way As she proceeded on her way she met a certain man coming from Sāvatthi She asked him Sir where do you live
In Sāvatthi my good woman
In the city of Sāvatthi in such and such a street lives such and such a family Do you know them sir
Yes my good woman I know them But pray dont ask me about that family Ask me about any other family you know
Sir I have no occasion to ask about any other This is the only family I wish to ask about
Woman you give me no opportunity to avoid telling you Did you observe that it rained all last night 
Indeed I did sir In fact I am the only person the rain fell on all night long
How it came to rain on me I will tell you by and by But just tell me what has happened to the family of this wealthy merchant and I will ask you no further questions
My good woman last night the storm overturned that house and it fell on the merchant and his wife and his son and they perished all three and their neighbors and kinsmen are even now burning their bodies on one funeral pyre
Look there my good woman You can see the smoke now  
Instantly she went mad Her clothing fell off from her body but she knew not that she was naked  And naked as at her birth  weeping and wailing and lamenting
Both my sons are dead my husband on the road lies dead
My mother and father and brother burn on one funeral pyre
 she wandered round and round
Those who saw her yelled Crazy fool Crazy fool Some flung rubbish at her others showered dust on her head others pelted her with clods of earth
It so happened that at this time the Teacher was in residence at Jetavana monastery As he sat there in the midst of his disciples preaching the Law he saw Paṭācārā approach from afar and recognized in her one who for a hundred thousand cycles of time had fulfilled the Perfections one who had made her Earnest Wish and attained it
We are told that in the dispensation of the Buddha Padumuttara she had seen the Teacher Padumuttara take a certain nun by the arm and assign her preeminence among those that are versed in the Canon Law It seemed as if the Teacher were opening the heaven of Indra and admitting the nun to the Garden of Delight So she formed her resolve and made this prayer May I also obtain from a Buddha like you preeminence among nuns versed in the Canon Law
The Buddha Padumuttara extending his consciousness into the future and perceiving that her prayer would be fulfilled made the following prophecy In the dispensation of a Buddha to be known as Gotama this woman will bear the name Paṭācārā and will obtain preeminence among nuns versed in the Canon Law 
So when the Teacher beheld Paṭācārā approaching from afar her prayer fulfilled her Earnest Wish attained he said There is none other that can be a refuge to this woman but only I And he caused her to draw near to the monastery
The moment his disciples saw her they cried out Suffer not that crazy woman to come hither
But he said to them Depart from me forbid her not  And when she was come nigh he said to her Sister return to your right mind
Instantly through the supernatural power of the Buddha she returned to her right mind
At the same moment she became aware that her clothing had fallen from off her body and recovering at once her sense of modesty and fear of mortal sin she crouched upon the ground
A certain man threw her his cloak
She put it on and approaching the Teacher prostrated herself before his golden feet with the Five Rests Having so done she said Venerable Sir be thou my refuge be thou my support
One of my sons has been carried off by a hawk the other swept away by the water by the roadside my husband lies dead my fathers house has been wrecked by the wind and in it have perished my mother and father and brother and even now their bodies are burning on one funeral pyre 
The Teacher listened to what she had to say and replied Paṭācārā be no more troubled Thou art come to one that is able to be thy shelter thy defense thy refuge
What thou hast said is true One of thy sons has been carried off by a hawk the other swept away by the water  by the roadside thy husband lies dead thy fathers house has been wrecked by the wind and in it have perished thy mother and father and brother But just as today so also all through this round of existences thou hast wept over the loss of sons and others dear to thee shedding tears more abundant than the waters of the four oceans  And he uttered the following Stanza
But little water do the oceans four contain
Compared with all the tears that man hath shed
By sorrow smitten and by suffering distraught
Woman why heedless dost thou still remain
In this wise did the Teacher discourse on the round of existences without conceivable beginning
As he spoke the grief which pervaded her body became less intense Perceiving that her grief was become less intense he continued his discourse as follows Paṭācārā to one that is on his way to the world beyond nor sons nor other kith and kin can ever be a shelter or a refuge How much less can you expect them to be such to you in this present life He that is wise should clarify his conduct and so for himself make clear the path that leadeth to Nibbāna  So saying he instructed her in the Law by pronouncing the following Stanzas
Nor sons nor father can a refuge be nor kith and kin
In them to him whom death assails no refuge remains
Knowing this power of circumstances the wise man restrained by the moral precepts
Should straightway clear the path that leads to Nibbāna 
At the conclusion of the discourse Paṭācārā obtained the Fruit of Conversion and the Depravities within her as numerous as the  particles of dust on the whole wide earth were burned away Many others likewise obtained the Fruit of Conversion and the Fruits of the Second and Third Paths
Paṭācārā having obtained the Fruit of Conversion requested the Teacher to admit her to the Order
The Teacher sent her to the community of nuns and directed that she be admitted
Afterwards she made her full profession and by reason of her happy demeanor came to be known as Paṭācārā
One day she filled her waterpot with water and pouring out water bathed her feet As she poured out the water she spilled some on the ground The water ran a little way and disappeared
The second time it went a little farther
The third time a little farther yet
So she took this very incident for her Subject of Meditation and fixing accurately in her mind the three occurrences she meditated thus Even as the water I spilled the first time ran a little way and disappeared so also living beings here in the world are dying in youth Even as the water I spilled the second time ran a little farther so also living beings here in the world are dying in the prime of life Even as the water I spilled the third time ran a little farther yet so also living beings here in the world are dying in old age 
The Teacher seated in his Perfumed Chamber sent forth an apparition of himself and standing as it were face to face with her spoke and said Paṭācārā twere better far to live but a single day aye but a single moment and see the rise and set of the Five Elements of Being than to live a hundred years and not see   And joining the connection he instructed her in the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza
Though one should live a hundred years twere all in vain Did one not see that all that is doth wax and wane
Instead twere better far to live a single day And know that all the world contains doth rise and pass away
At the conclusion of the discourse Paṭācārā attained Arahatship together with the Supernatural Faculties
As sweet as honey thinks a fool this religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the nun Uppalavaṇṇā
We are told that Uppalavaṇṇā made her Earnest Wish at the feet of the Buddha Padumuttara and that after performing works of merit for a hundred thousand cycles of time as she passed from birth to birth among gods and men she passed from the World of the Gods in the dispensation of the present Buddha and was reborn in Sāvatthi as the daughter of a rich merchant
The hue of her skin was like the hue of the calyx of the blue lotus and therefore they gave her the name Uppalavaṇṇā
When she reached marriageable age all the princes and merchants in the Land of the RoseApple sent to the merchant her father asking him to give them his daughter in marriage
without a single exception
Thereupon the merchant thought to himself I shall not be able to satisfy the wishes of all but I shall find some way out of the difficulty  So he summoned his daughter and said to her You might become a nun
Now she was in her last existence before attaining Nibbāna and therefore his words were to her as it were oil a hundred times refined sprinkled on her head
Therefore she replied Dear father I will become a nun
So he prepared rich gifts in her honor and conducting her to the Community of Nuns had her admitted to the Order
Not long after she had been admitted to the Order her turn came to unlock and lock the Hall of Confession
After she had lighted the lamp and swept the Hall her attention was attracted to the flame of the lamp And standing there she looked repeatedly at the flame and concentrating her attention on the element of fire entered into a state of trance Consummating the trance she attained Arahatship together with the Supernatural Faculties and Powers
Some time later she went on a pilgrimage for alms in the country and on her return entered a dark forest
At that time it was not forbidden for nuns to reside in a forest
There they built her a hut set up a bed and hung curtains round
From the forest she went to Sāvatthi to receive alms and then set out to return to her hut
Now a cousin of hers a young Brahman named nanda had been in love with her ever since she lived in the world
and when he heard where she had gone he went to the forest ahead of the nun entered the hut and hid under the bed On her return the nun entered the hut closed the door and sat down on the bed unable to see in the dark because she had just come in out of the sunlight Hardly had she seated herself on the bed when the youth crawled out from under and climbed on top The nun cried out Fool do not ruin me Fool do not ruin me But the youth overcame her resistance worked his will of her and went his way
As if unable to endure his wickedness the great earth burst asunder
and he was swallowed up and reborn in the Great Hell of Avīci
The nun told the other nuns what had happened
and the nuns told the monks
and the monks told the Exalted One
Having heard this the Teacher addressed the monks as follows Monks the simpleton whoever he may be whether monk or nun or lay disciple male or female who commits an act of sin acts with as much joy and happiness with as much pleasure and delight as though he  were eating honey or sugar or some other sweettasting substance  And joining the connection and instructing them in the Law he pronounced the following Stanza
As sweet as honey thinks a fool an evil deed so long as it bears no fruit
But when it bears fruit then the fool comes to grief
Some time later the throng assembled in the Hall of Truth began to discuss the incident Even those that have rid themselves of the Depravities like the pleasures of love and gratify their passions Why should they not They are not kolapatrees or anthills but are living creatures with bodies of moist flesh Therefore they also like the pleasures of love and gratify their passions
The Teacher drew near and asked them Monks what are you sitting here now talking about  They told him Then he said Monks they that have rid themselves of the Depravities neither like the pleasures of love nor gratify their passions
For even as a drop of water which has fallen upon a lotusleaf does not cling thereto or remain thereon but rolls over and falls off even as a grain of mustardseed does not cling to the point of an awl or remain thereon but rolls over and falls off precisely so twofold love does not cling to the heart of one who has rid himself of the Depravities or remain there  And joining the connection he instructed them in the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza found in the Brāhmaṇa Vagga
Even as water does not cling to a lotusleaf nor a grain of mustardseed to the point of an awl
Whoso in like manner clings not to the pleasures of sense him I call a Brahman
Now the Teacher summoned King Pasenadi Kosala and said to him Your majesty in this Religion young women of family as well as young men of family renounce many kinsfolk and much wealth retire from the world and take up residence in the forest
In case women reside in the forest it is possible that evilminded men inflamed by lust may conduct themselves towards them with disrespect and arrogance do them violence and bring their religious life to naught Therefore a place of residence for the Community of Nuns should be erected within the city
The king agreed to this and had a place of residence for the Community of Nuns erected on one side of the city
From that time on the nuns resided only within the city
Though one should live a hundred years This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Bahuputtikā
In a certain household at Sāvatthi we are told were seven sons and seven daughters
All of them married as soon as they were old enough and were happy as was indeed their nature
After a time their father died
But the mother the eminent female lay disciple even after the death of her husband did not for some time relinquish control  of his property
One day her sons said to her Mother now that our father is dead what is the use of your retaining his property Can we not support you
She listened to their words but said nothing After they had spoken to her several times about the matter she thought to herself My sons will look after me why need I keep the property separate for myself  So she divided the estate into two parts and distributed them among the children
After a few days had passed the wife of her oldest son said to her Apparently this is the only house our excellent mother visits she acts as though she had given both parts of her estate to her oldest son
In like manner did the wives of her other sons address her
So likewise did her daughters address her whenever she entered their houses from the oldest to the youngest
With such disrespect was she treated that finally she said to herself Why should I live with them any longer I will enter the Order and live the life of a nun So she went to the nuns convent  and asked to be admitted to the Order
They received her into the Order
and when she had made her full profession she went by the name of Bahuputtikā the nun
Since I have entered the Order in old age thought she as she performed the major and minor duties assigned to nuns it behooves me to be heedful I will therefore spend the whole night in meditation  On the lower terrace putting her hand on a pillar she guided her steps thereby and meditated Even as she walked along fearful that in the dark places she might strike her head against a tree or against some other object she put her hand on a tree and guided her steps thereby and meditated Resolved to observe only the Law taught by the Teacher she considered the Law and pondered the Law and meditated
The Teacher seated in the Perfumed Chamber sent forth a radiant image of himself and sitting as it were face to face with her talked with her saying Bahuputtikā though one should live a hundred years did he not behold the Law I have taught and meditate thereon it were better that he live but a moment and behold the Law I have taught  And joining the connection and teaching the Law he pronounced the following Stanza
Though one should live a hundred years did he not behold the Law Supreme
It were better that he live but a single day and behold the Law Supreme
At the conclusion of the Stanza Bahuputtikā became an Arahat possessed of the Supernatural Faculties
It is a city made of bones This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the nun JanapadaKaḷyānī Rūpanandā
The story goes that one day JanapadaKaḷyānī thought to herself My eldest brother has renounced the glory of dominion has become a monk and has now become the foremost being in the world even the Buddha his son Rāhula Kumāra has become a monk my husband has become a monk so also has my mother become a nun Seeing that all these kinsfolk of mine have adopted the religious life why should I continue any longer to live the houselife I too will become a nun
Accordingly she went to the community of nuns and became a nun not at all because of faith but solely because of love for her kinsfolk Because of her wondrous beauty she became known as RūpaNandā 
One day she heard that the Teacher had said Beauty of form is impermanent involved in suffering unreal so likewise are sensation perception the aggregate of mental states consciousness impermanent involved in suffering unreal  Thereupon she said to herself In that case he would find fault even with my own form so beautiful to look upon and so fair to see  Therefore she avoided meeting the Teacher face to face
Now the residents of Sāvatthi having given alms early in the morning took upon themselves the obligations of fastday In the evening clad in spotless upper garments and bearing garlands and flowers in their hands they assembled at Jetavana to hear the Law
And the community of nuns also desiring to hear the Law went to the monastery and heard the Law
And having heard the Law they entered the city praising the virtues of the Teacher as they entered
For there are four standards of judgment prevailing among persons who dwell together in the world However there are very few persons in whom the sight of the Tathāgata does not arouse a feeling of satisfaction
Those who judge by what they see look upon  the goldenhued body of the Tathāgata adorned with the Major Marks and the Minor Marks and are satisfied with what they see  Those who judge by what they hear listen to the report of the Teachers virtues through many hundreds of births and to his voice endowed with the Eight Excellences in the preaching of the Law and are satisfied with what they hear Those who judge by austerities are satisfied with his austere robes and so forth Those whose standard of judgment is righteousness reflect Such is the uprightness of the Possessor of the Ten Forces such is his tranquillity such is his wisdom in uprightness and tranquillity and wisdom the Exalted One is without an equal is without a peer Thus they also are satisfied
Indeed those who praise the virtues of the Tathāgata lack words wherewith to tell their praises
Rūpanandā listened to the nuns and the female lay disciples as they recited the praises of the Tathāgata and having listened said to herself In extravagant terms do they tell the praises of my brother
Suppose he were to find fault with my beauty of form during one single day How much could he say in that length of time
Suppose I were to go with the nuns and without letting myself be seen look upon the Tathāgata hear him preach the Law and then return 
So she said to the nuns Today I too will go and hear the Law
Said the nuns It has taken a long time to arouse in Rūpanandā a desire to wait upon the Teacher Today by reason of her the Teacher will preach the Law with details many and various  And with delighted hearts taking her with them they set out
From the moment Rūpanandā started out she kept thinking to herself I will not let him see who I am
The Teacher thought to himself Today Rūpanandā will come to pay her respects to me what manner of lesson will do her the most good  As he considered the matter further he came to the following conclusion This woman thinks a great deal of her beauty of form and is deeply attached to her own person It will therefore be of advantage to her if I crush out the pride she feels in her beauty of form by beauty of form itself even as one draws out one thorn with another thorn  Accordingly when it was time for her to enter the monastery the Teacher put forth his supernatural power and created a young woman about sixteen years of age Surpassing beauty did she possess she wore crimson garments she was adorned with all her ornaments and stood before the Teacher with fan in hand swinging the fan back and forth
Now both the Teacher and Rūpanandā beheld this woman
As Rūpanandā entered the monastery with the nuns she took her place behind the nuns saluted the Teacher with the Five Rests and sat down among the nuns Having so done she surveyed from head to foot the person of the Teacher richly brilliant with the Major Marks resplendent with the Minor Marks surrounded by a halo a fathom in extent Then she saw the phantom of a woman standing near the Teacher and surveyed her face glorious as the full moon
Having surveyed this woman she surveyed her own person and compared herself to a crow standing before a royal goose of golden hue
For from the moment she looked upon this phantom created by supernatural power her eyes rolled back and forth
Oh how beautiful is her hair Oh how beautiful is her forehead she exclaimed She was fascinated by the glorious beauty of every part of her body and she became possessed with intense desire for equal beauty herself
The Teacher observing that she was fascinated by the beauty of the woman proceeded to teach her the Law First he transformed the woman from a maiden about sixteen years of age to a woman about twenty years of age
Rūpanandā surveyed her form again was quickly filled with a feeling of disappointment and said to herself This form is by no means the same as it was before
Gradually the Teacher transformed her first into a woman who had given birth to one child then into a woman of middle life finally into a decrepit old woman
Rūpanandā watched every stage of the transformation saying to herself Now this has disappeared now that has disappeared  When however she saw her transformed into a decrepit old woman and surveyed her standing there teeth broken hair gray body bent crooked as a Ashaped rafter forced to lean on a cane trembling in every limb she was filled with utter disgust
Then the Teacher caused disease to overmaster the woman
Casting away her cane and her palmleaf fan she screamed aloud fell upon the ground and rolled over and over wallowing in her own urine and excrement
Rūpanandā looked upon her and was filled with utter disgust
Then the Teacher showed the death of that woman
Straightway her body began to bloat From its nine woundlike openings oozed pus in the shape of lampwicks and also worms Crows and dogs fell on her and tore her
Rūpanandā looked and thought In this very place this woman has come to old age has come to disease has come to death Even so to this body of mine  will come old age disease and death Thus did she come to behold her own body in its impermanence
and as a result of beholding her own body in its impermanence she likewise saw her body as involved in suffering and the unreality thereof
Straightway the Three Modes of Existence like houses set on fire or like carrion tied to her neck uprose before her and her mind sprang forth to meditation
The Teacher perceiving that she had beheld her own body in its impermanence considered within himself Will she or will she not by herself be able to get a firm footing  Straightway he became aware of the following She will not be able she must have support from without  Accordingly out of consideration for her welfare he taught her the Law by pronouncing the following Stanzas
Behold Nandā this assemblage of elements called the body It is diseased impure putrid
it oozes and leaks yet it is desired of simpletons
As is this body so also was that as is that body so also will this body be
Behold the elements in their emptiness go not back to the world
Cast away desire for existence and thou shalt walk in tranquillity 
Thus with reference to the nun Nandā did the Exalted One pronounce these Stanzas
Directing her thoughts in a way conformable to his teaching Nandā attained the Fruit of Conversion
Thereupon the Teacher desiring that she should dwell upon the Three Paths and the Three Fruits and desiring to teach her to meditate upon the Void said to her Nandā think not that there is reality in this body
for there is not the least reality in this body This body is but a city of bones made by building up three hundred bones  So saying he pronounced the following Stanza
It is a city made of bones plastered with flesh and blood
Where lodge old age and death and pride and deceit
At the conclusion of the lesson the nun attained Arahatship the multitude also profited by the lesson
They that are dyed with lust  This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to Khemā chief consort of King Bimbisāra
Khemā we are told as the result of an Earnest Wish which she made at the feet of the Buddha Padumuttara was exceedingly beautiful and fair to look upon
But she had heard it said that the Teacher found fault with beauty of form and therefore refrained from entering his presence
The king knowing that she was drunk with the intoxication of her own beauty caused songs to be composed in praise of Veḷuvana and had these songs turned over to actors
As Khemā listened to the songs sung by these singers Veḷuvana seemed to her like a place she had never seen before or heard of before
What grove are you singing about  she asked the singers Your majesty we are singing about your own Grove Veḷuvana they replied Forthwith she desired to go to the Grove
The Teacher knowing that she was coming created even as he sat in the midst of the Congregation preaching the Law the phantom of a woman of surpassing beauty standing at his side and fanning him with a palmyra fan
When Queen Khemā entered and saw that woman she thought to herself I have always been told that the Supremely Enlightened One finds fault with beauty of form But here in his presence stands a woman fanning him I  do not come even within a sixteenth part of her beauty Indeed I have never seen so beautiful a woman before They misrepresent the Teacher I doubt not  And hearing not even the sound of the Teachers voice as he preached the Law she stood there her gaze riveted on that woman
The Teacher noticing how much she thought of this phantom transformed the phantom from a woman of youth and beauty into a decrepit old woman in the manner related above showing her finally as a mere bag of bones
Khemā seeing her reflected In but a moment a form even so beautiful as this has attained decay and death Verily there is no reality in this  material form
The Teacher perceived the course of her thoughts and said to her Khemā you falsely think There is reality in beauty of form  Behold now the unreality thereof So saying he pronounced the following Stanza
Khemā behold this aggregation of elements diseased impure decaying
Trickling and oozing desired of simpletons
At the conclusion of the Stanza Khemā was established in the Fruit of Conversion
Then said the Teacher to her Khemā living beings here in the world dyed with lust corrupted with hatred deluded with delusion cannot cross the stream of their own craving but stick fast therein  And preaching the Law he pronounced the following Stanza
They that are dyed with lust follow the stream of the passions
As a spider runs down the web he has spun for himself
Wise men by cutting this bond and going forth from the world
Win freedom from desire and leave behind all suffering
At the conclusion of the lesson Khemā was established in Arahatship the multitude also profited by the lesson
Said the Teacher to the king Great king Khemā ought either to retire from the world or to pass into Nibbāna
The king replied Reverend Sir admit her to the Order as for Nibbāna never
She retired from the world and became one of the Teachers foremost female lay disciples
This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Sāvatthi with reference to Elder Pūtigatta Tissa
A certain youth of station who lived at Sāvatthi heard the Teacher preach the Law yielded the breast to religion retired from the world and after admission as a full member of the Order became known as Elder Tissa
As time went on an eruption broke out on his body
At first appeared pustules no bigger than mustardseeds
but as the disease progressed they assumed successively the size of kidneybeans chickpeas jujube seeds emblic myrobalans and vilva fruits Finally they burst open and his whole body became covered with open sores
In this way he came to be called Elder Pūtigatta Tissa
After a time his bones began to disintegrate
and no one was willing to take care of him
His under and upper garments which were stained with dried blood looked like netcakes
His fellowresidents unable to care for him cast him out
and he lay down on the ground without a protector
Now the Buddhas never fail to survey the world twice a day
At dawn they survey the world looking from the rim of the world towards the Perfumed Chamber taking cognizance of all they see In the evening they survey the world looking from the Perfumed Chamber and taking cognizance of all that is without
Now at this time the Elder Pūtigatta Tissa appeared within the net of the Exalted Ones knowledge
The Teacher knowing that the monk Tissa was ripe for Arahatship thought to himself This monk has been abandoned by his associates at the present time he has no other refuge than me  Accordingly the Teacher departed from the Perfumed Chamber and pretending to be making the rounds of the monastery went to the hall where the fire was kept He washed the boiler placed it on the brazier waited in the fireroom for the water to boil
and when he knew it was hot went and took hold of the end of the bed where that monk was lying At that time the monks said to the Teacher Pray depart Reverend Sir we will carry him in for you  So saying they took up the bed and carried Tissa into the fireroom
The Teacher caused a measure to be brought and sprinkled hot water He then caused the monks to take Tissas upper garment wash it thoroughly in hot water and lay it in the sunshine to dry
Then he went and taking his stand near Tissa moistened his body with hot water and rubbed and bathed him At the end of his bath his upper garment was dry
The Teacher caused him to be clothed in his upper garment and caused his under garment to be washed thoroughly in hot water and laid in the sun to dry
As soon as the water had evaporated from his body his under garment was dry
Thereupon Tissa put on one of the yellow robes as an under garment and the other as an upper garment and with body refreshed and mind tranquil lay down on the bed
The Teacher took his stand at Tissas pillow and said to him Monk consciousness will depart from you your body will become useless and like a log will lie on the ground  So saying he pronounced the following Stanza
In no long time this body will lie on the ground
Despised with consciousness departed like a useless log
At the conclusion of the lesson Elder Pūtigatta Tissa attained Arahatship and passed into Nibbāna
The Teacher performed the funeral rites over his body and taking the relics caused a shrine to be erected
The monks asked the Teacher Reverend Sir where was Elder Pūtigatta Tissa reborn
He has passed into Nibbāna monks
Reverend Sir how did it happen that such a monk predestined to attain Arahatship came to have a diseased body Why did his bones disintegrate Through what deed in a former birth did he obtain the dispositions requisite for the attainment of Arahatship
Monks all these things happened solely because of deeds he committed in a previous existence
But Reverend Sir what did he do
Well then monks listen
In the dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa Tissa was a fowler He used to catch birds in large numbers and most of these he served to royalty
Most of those he did not give to royalty he used to sell Fearing that if he killed and kept the birds he did not sell they would rot and desiring to prevent his captive birds from taking flight he used to break their legbones and wingbones and lay them aside piling them in a heap On the following day he would sell them
When he had too many he would have some cooked also for himself
One day when wellflavored food had been cooked for him a monk who was an Arahat stopped at the door of his house on his round for alms
When Tissa saw the Elder he made his mind serene and thought I have killed and eaten many living creatures A noble Elder stands at my door and an abundance of wellflavored food is in my house I will therefore give him alms So he took the monks bowl and filled it and having given him wellflavored food saluted the monk with the Five Rests and said Reverend Sir may I obtain the highest fruit of the Law you have seen
Said the Elder returning thanks So be it
Monks it was through the meritorious deed Tissa then did that this fruit accrued to him It was because he broke the bones of birds that his members became diseased and his bones disintegrated It was because he gave wellflavored food to the Arahat that he attained Arahatship
This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a question asked by Elder nanda
We are told that as the Elder sat in his dayquarters he thought to himself The Teacher has described the mothers and fathers of the Seven Buddhas their length of life the tree under which they got Enlightenment their company of disciples their Chief Disciples and their principal supporter All this the Teacher has described But he has said nothing about their mode of observance of Fastday Was their mode of observance of Fastday the same as now or was it different
Accordingly he approached the Teacher and asked him about the matter
Now in the case of these Buddhas while there was a difference of time there was no difference in the Stanzas they employed
The Supremely Enlightened Vipassī kept Fastday every seven years
but the admonition he gave in one day sufficed for seven years
Sikhi and Vessabhu kept Fastday every six years Kakusandha and Koṇāgamana every year
Kassapa Possessor of the Ten Forces kept Fastday every six months
but the admonition of the latter sufficed for six months
For this reason the Teacher after explaining to the Elder this difference of time explained that their observance of Fastday was the same in every case These are the very Stanzas they employed in giving admonition said he quoting the following Stanzas 
The shunning of all evil the doing of good
The cleansing of the heart this is the Religion of the Buddhas
Patience longsuffering is the highest form of asceticism
Nibbāna the Buddhas declare to be the highest of all things
For one who strikes another is no true religious
Nor is he a monk who injures another
Not blaming not harming restraint under the Law
Moderation in food a remote lodging
Dwelling on lofty thoughts this is the Religion of the Buddhas
and that concerning the Blessed Lord Gotama a good report had been spread about 
and told him of the Lords acceptance
And Bhesika the barber followed the Lord close at hand
Truly Lord this is what the Brahmin Lohicca has been thinking
and he should enjoy the entire fruits and revenues of Salavatika not giving anything away to others 
would not anyone who spoke like that be a source of danger to your tenants
would not anyone who spoke like that be a source of danger to his tenants
Would he not have a heart full of hatred
and would that not be wrong view
that would be wrong view
which leads tohell or an animal rebirth
he would be a source of danger to the Kings tenants yourself and others
than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the Deathless
than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the Supreme Truth
Then the venerable Kassapa the Great addressed the monks saying Once upon a time your reverences I was going along the highroad from Pāvā to Kusināra together with a large Order of monks with at least five hundred monks
Then I your reverences stepping aside from the way sat down at the root of a certain tree
Now at that time a certain Naked Ascetic having picked up a flower of the Coral Tree at Kusināra was going along the highroad to Pāvā
Then I your reverences saw that Naked Ascetic coming in the distance
and seeing him I spoke thus to him Do you your reverence not know about our Teacher
 He said Yes I know your reverence
the recluse Gotama attained nibbāna a week ago
Because of that I picked up this flower of the Coral Tree
Your reverences of those monks who were not passionless some stretching forth their arms wailed they fell down hurting themselves they reeled backwards and forwards saying Too soon has the Lord attained nibbāna too soon has the Wellfarer attained nibbāna too soon has the Eye in the World disappeared
 But those monks who were passionless these mindful circumspect bore it saying Impermanent are compounded thingswhat is here possible because of this
Then I your reverences spoke thus to these monks Enough your reverences do not grieve do not lament
for has it not already been explained by the Lord Of every single thing that is dear and beloved there is variation separation becoming otherwise
What is here possible your reverences because of this that whatever is born has become is composite is liable to dissolution Indeed thinking Let not that be dissolvedsuch a situation does not exist
Then at that time your reverences one named Subhadda who had gone forth when old was sitting in that assembly
Then your reverences Subhadda who had gone forth when old spoke thus to these monks Enough your reverences do not grieve do not lament
we are well rid of this great recluse We were worried when he said This is allowable to you this is not allowable to you
 But now we will be able to do as we like and we wont do what we dont like
Come let us your reverences chant dhamma and discipline
before what is not dhamma shines out and dhamma is withheld before what is not discipline shines out and discipline is withheld before those who speak what is notdhamma become strong and those who speak dhamma become feeble before those who speak what is not discipline become strong and those who speak discipline become feeble
Well then honoured sir let the elder select monks
 Then the venerable Kassapa the Great selected five hundred perfected ones less one
Monks spoke thus to the venerable Kassapa the GreatHonoured sir this nanda although he is still a learner could not be one to follow a wrong course through desire anger delusion fear
and he has mastered much dhamma and discipline under the Lord
Well now honoured sir let the elder select the venerable nanda as well
 Then the venerable Kassapa the Great selected the venerable nanda as well
Then it occurred to the monks who were elders Now where should we chant dhamma and discipline
 Then it occurred to the monks who were elders There is great resort for alms at Rājagaha and lodgings are abundant Suppose that we spending the rains at Rājagaha should chant dhamma and discipline 
and that no other monks were to come up to Rājagaha for the rains
Then the venerable Kassapa the Great informed the Order saying
Your reverences let the Order listen to me
If it seems right to the Order the Order may agree upon these five hundred monks to chant dhamma and discipline while they are spending the rains in Rājagaha and that the rains should not be spent in Rājagaha by any other monks
This is the motion
Your reverences let the Order listen to me
The Order is agreeing upon these five hundred monks to chant dhamma and discipline while they are spending the rains in Rājagaha and that the rains should not be spent in Rājagaha by any other monks
If the agreement upon these five hundred monks to chant dhamma and discipline while they are spending the rains in Rājagaha and that the rains should not be spent in Rājagaha by any other monks is pleasing to the venerable ones you should be silent he to whom it is not pleasing should speak
These five hundred monks are agreed upon by the Order to chant dhamma and discipline while they are spending the rains in Rājagaha and that the rains should not be spent in Rājagaha by any other monks
It is pleasing to the Order therefore it is silent Thus do I understand this 
Then the monks who were elders went to Rājagaha to chant dhamma and discipline
Then it occurred to the monks who were elders Now repairs to broken and dilapidated parts were praised by the Lord
Come let us during the first month make repairs to the broken and dilapidated parts having assembled in the middle month we will chant dhamma and discipline
 Then the monks who were elders made repairs to the broken and dilapidated parts during the first month
Then the venerable nanda thinking Tomorrow is the assembly Now it is not suitable in me that I being a learner should go to the assembly and having passed much of that night in mindfulness as to body when the night was nearly spent thinking I will lie down he inclined his body
but his head had touched the mattress and while his feet were free from the ground
in that interval his mind was freed from the cankers with no residuum remaining
Then the venerable nanda being a perfected one went to the assembly
Then the venerable Kassapa the Great informed the Order saying
Your reverences let the Order listen to me
If it seems right to the Order I could question Upāli on discipline
 Then the venerable Upāli informed the Order saying
Honoured sirs let the Order listen to me
If it seems right to the Order I questioned on discipline by the venerable Kassapa the Great could answer
 Then the venerable Kassapa the Great spoke thus to the venerable Upāli Where reverend Upāli was the first offence involving defeat laid down 
At Vesālī honoured sir
Regarding whom 
Regarding Sudinna the Kalandaka 
On what subject 
On sexual intercourse 
Then the venerable Kassapa the Great questioned the venerable Upāli as to the subject of the first offence involving defeat and he questioned him as to its provenance and he questioned him as to the individual and he questioned him as to what was laid down and he questioned him as to what was further laid down and he questioned him as to what was an offence and he questioned him as to what was no offence
Then reverend Upāli where was the second offence involving defeat laid down 
In Rājagaha honoured sir 
Regarding whom 
Regarding Dhaniya the potters son 
On what subject 
On taking what is not given
Then the venerable Kassapa the Great questioned the venerable Upāli as to the subject of the second offence involving defeat and he questioned him as to its provenance and he questioned him  as to what was no offence
Then reverend Upāli where was the third offence involving defeat laid down 
At Vesālī honoured sir 
Regarding whom 
Regarding several monks 
On what subject 
On human beings 
Then the venerable Kassapa the Great questioned the venerable Upāli as to the subject of the third offence involving defeat and he questioned him as to its provenance and he questioned him  as to what was no offence
Then reverend Upāli where was the fourth offence involving defeat laid down 
At Vesālī honoured sir 
Regarding whom 
Regarding the monks on the banks of the Vaggumudā 
On what subject 
On conditions of furthermen 
Then the venerable Kassapa the Great questioned the venerable Upāli as to the subject of the fourth offence involving defeat and he questioned him as to its provenance and he questioned him as to  what was no offence
In this same way he questioned him about both the disciplines
Constantly questioned the venerable Upāli answered
Then the venerable Kassapa the Great informed the Order saying
Honoured sirs let the Order listen to me
If it seems right to the Order I could question nanda about dhamma
 Then the venerable nanda informed the Order saying
Honoured sirs let the Order listen to me
If it seems right to the Order I questioned on dhamma by the venerable Kassapa the Great could answer
 Then the venerable Kassapa the Great spoke thus to the venerable nanda Where reverend nanda was the Brahmajāla spoken 
Honoured sir between Rājagaha and Nālandā in the royal resthouse at Ambalaṭṭhikā 
With whom 
Suppiya the wanderer and Brahmadatta the brahmin youth
 Then the venerable Kassapa the Great questioned the venerable nanda as to the provenance of the Brahmajāla and he questioned him as to the individual
But where reverend nanda was the Sāmaññaphala spoken 
In Rājagaha honoured sir in Jīvakas mango grove 
With whom 
With Ajātasattu the son of the Videhan  
Then the venerable Kassapa the Great questioned the venerable nanda as to the provenance of the Sāmaññaphala and he questioned him as to the individual
In this same way he questioned him about the five Nikāyas
Constantly questioned the venerable nanda answered
Then the venerable nanda spoke thus to the monks who were elders The Lord honoured sirs spoke thus to me at the time of his attaining nibbāna If the Order nanda after my death is willing the lesser and minor rules of training may be abolished 
But did you reverend nanda ask the Lord saying But which Lord are the lesser and minor rules of training 
No I honoured sirs did not ask the Lord saying But which Lord are the lesser and minor rules of training 
Some elders spoke thus Except for the rules for the four offences involving defeat the rest are lesser and minor rules of training
 Some elders spoke thus Except for the rules for the four offences involving defeat except for the rules for the thirteen offences entailing a Formal Meeting of the Order the rest are lesser and minor rules of training
 Some elders spoke thus Except for the rules for the four offences involving defeat  except for the rules for the two undetermined offences the rest are lesser and minor rules of training
 Some elders spoke thus Except for the rules for the four offences involving defeat  except for the rules for the thirty offences of expiation involving forfeiture the rest are lesser and minor rules of training
 Some elders spoke thus Except for the rules for the four offences involving defeat  except for the rules for the ninetytwo offences of expiation the rest are lesser and minor rules of training
 Some elders spoke thus Except for the rules for the four offences involving defeat  except for the rules for the four offences which ought to be confessed the rest are lesser and minor rules of training 
Then the venerable Kassapa the Great informed the Order saying
Your reverences let the Order listen to me
There are rules of training for us which affect householders
and householders know concerning us This is certainly allowable for the recluses sons of the Sakyans this is certainly not allowable
 If we were to abolish the lesser and minor rules of training there would be those who would say At the time of his cremation a rule of training had been laid down by the recluse Gotama for disciples
while the Teacher was amongst them these trained themselves in the rules of training
but since the Teacher has attained nibbāna among them they do not now train themselves in the rules of training
 If it seems right to the Order the Order should not lay down what has not been laid down nor should it abolish what has been laid down It should proceed in conformity with and according to the rules of training that have been laid down
This is the motion
Your reverences let the Order listen to me
There are rules of training for us  
 these do not now train themselves in the rules of training
 The Order is not laying down what has not been laid down nor is it abolishing what has been laid down It is proceeding in conformity with and according to the rules of training that have been laid down
If the not laying down of what has not been laid down if the not abolishing of what has been laid down if the proceeding in conformity with and according to the rules of training that have been laid down are pleasing to the venerable ones they should be silent he to whom they are not pleasing should speak
The Order is not laying down what has not been laid down it is not abolishing what has been laid down it is proceeding in conformity with and according to the rules of training that have been laid down
It is pleasing to the Order therefore it is silent Thus do I understand this 
Then the monks who were elders spoke thus to the venerable nanda This reverend nanda is an offence of wrongdoing for you in that you did not ask the Lord saying But which Lord are the lesser and minor rules of training
 Confess that offence of wrongdoing 
I honoured sirs out of unmindfulness did not ask the Lord saying But which Lord are the lesser and minor rules of training
 I do not see that as an offence of wrongdoing yet even out of faith in the venerable ones I confess that as an offence of wrongdoing 
This too is an offence of wrongdoing for you reverend nanda in that you sewed the Lords cloth for the rains after having stepped on it
Confess that offence of wrongdoing 
But I honoured sirs not out of disrespect sewed the Lords cloth for the rains after having stepped on it
I do not see  but even out of faith in the venerable ones I confess that as an offence of wrongdoing 
This too is an offence of wrongdoing for you reverend nanda in that you had the Lords body first of all honoured by women because these were weeping the Lords body was defiled by tears
Confess that offence of wrongdoing 
But I honoured sirs thinking Do not let these be at a wrong time had the Lords body honoured first of all by women
I do not see that as an offence of wrongdoing  but even out of faith 
This too is an offence of wrongdoing for you reverend nanda in that you a broad hint was being given a palpable sign was being made did not ask the Lord saying Let the Lord remain for a lifespan let the wellfarer remain for a lifespan for the welfare of the manyfolk for the happiness of the manyfolk out of compassion for the world for the good the welfare the happiness of devas and mankind
 Confess that offence of wrongdoing 
But I honoured sirs because my mind was obsessed with Māra did not ask the Lord saying Let the Lord remain  the happiness of devas and mankind
 I do not see  out of faith 
This too is an offence of wrongdoing for you reverend nanda in that you made an effort for the going forth of women in the dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Truthfinder
Confess this offence of wrongdoing 
But I honoured sirs made an effort for the going forth of women in the dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Truthfinder thinking This Gotamid Pajāpatī the Great is the Lords aunt fostermother nurse giver of milk for when the Lords mother passed away she suckled him
 I do not see that as an offence of wrongdoing but even out of faith in the venerable ones I confess that as an offence of wrongdoing 
Now at that time the venerable Purāṇa was walking on almstour in the Southern Hills together with a large Order of monks with at least five hundred monks
Then the venerable Purāṇa having stayed in the Southern Hills for as long as he found suiting after the monks who were elders had chanted dhamma and discipline  approached Rājagaha the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding place and the monks who were elders having approached having exchanged friendly greetings with the monks who were elders he sat down at a respectful distance
The monks who were elders spoke thus to the venerable Purāṇa as he was sitting down at a respectful distance Reverend Purāṇa dhamma and discipline have been chanted by monks who are elders
Submit yourself to this chanting 
Your reverences well chanted by the elders are dhamma and discipline
but in that way that I heard it in the Lords presence that I received it in his presence in that same way will I bear it in mind
Then the venerable nanda spoke thus to the monks who were elders Honoured sirs the Lord at the time of attaining nibbāna spoke thus to me Well now nanda after I am gone let the Order enjoin the higher penalty for the monk Channa 
But did you reverend nanda ask the Lord But what Lord is the higher penalty 
I honoured sirs did ask the Lord But what Lord is the higher penalty
 He said nanda Channa may say whatever he likes to monks
but the monk Channa must neither be spoken to nor exhorted nor instructed by monks
Well then reverend nanda do you yourself enjoin the higher penalty on the monk Channa 
But how can I honoured sirs enjoin the higher penalty on the monk Channa That monk is fierce and rough 
Well then reverend nanda go along together with many monks 
Very well honoured sirs and the venerable nanda having answered these monks in assent having together with a large Order of monks with at least five hundred monks disembarked at Kosambī from a boat going upstream sat down at the root of a certain tree not far from King Udenas pleasure grove
Now at that time King Udena was amusing himself in his pleasure grove together with his concubines
Then King Udenas concubines heard It is said that our teacher master nanda is sitting at the root of a certain tree not far from the pleasure grove
 Then King Udenas concubines spoke thus to King Udena Sire they say that our teacher  not far from the pleasure grove
We sire want to see master nanda 
Well then do you see the recluse nanda
 Then King Udenas concubines approached the venerable nanda having approached having greeted the venerable nanda they sat down at a respectful distance
The venerable nanda gladdened rejoiced roused delighted King Udenas concubines with talk on dhamma as they were sitting down at a respectful distance
Then King Udenas concubines gladdened  delighted by the venerable nanda with talk on dhamma bestowed five hundred inner robes on the venerable nanda
Then King Udenas concubines pleased with the venerable nandas words having thanked him rising from their seats having greeted the venerable nanda having kept their right sides towards him approached King Udena
King Udena saw the concubines coming in the distance
seeing them he spoke thus to the concubines Did you see the recluse nanda
We sire did see master nanda 
But did not you give anything to the recluse nanda 
We gave sire five hundred inner robes to master nanda
 King Udena looked down upon criticised spread it about saying How can this recluse nanda accept so many robes
Will the recluse nanda set up trade in woven cloth or will he offer for sale in a shop
 Then King Udena approached the venerable nanda having approached he exchanged greetings with the venerable nanda
having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy he sat down at a respectful distance
As he was sitting down at a respectful distance King Udena spoke thus to the venerable nanda Did not our concubines come here good nanda
Your concubines did come here your majesty 
Did they not give anything to the honourable nanda 
They gave me five hundred inner robes your majesty 
But what can you honourable nanda do with so many robes 
I will share them your majesty with those monks whose robes are worn thin 
But what will you do good nanda with those old robes that are worn thin 
We will make them into upper coverings your majesty 
But what will you do good nanda with those upper coverings that are old 
We will make these into mattress coverings your majesty 
But what will you do good nanda with those mattress coverings that are old 
We will make them into ground coverings your majesty 
But what will you do good nanda with those ground coverings that are old 
We will make them into footwipers your majesty 
But what will you do good nanda with those footwipers that are old 
We will make them into dusters your majesty 
But what will you do good nanda with those dusters that are old 
Having torn them into shreds your majesty having kneaded them with mud we will smear a plasterflooring 
Then King Udena thinking These recluses sons of the Sakyans use everything in an orderly way and do not let things go to waste bestowed even another five hundred woven cloths on the venerable nanda
Therefore this was the first time that a thousand robes had accrued to the venerable nanda as an alms of robes
Then the venerable nanda approached Ghositas monastery having approached he sat down on an appointed seat
Then the venerable Channa approached the venerable nanda having approached having greeted the venerable nanda he sat down at a respectful distance
The venerable nanda spoke thus to the venerable Channa as he was sitting down at a respectful distance The higher penalty has been enjoined on you reverend Channa by the Order 
But what honoured nanda is the higher penalty 
You reverend Channa may say what you please to the monks
but you must neither be spoken to nor exhorted nor instructed by the monks
Saying Am I not honoured nanda destroyed because I may be neither spoken to nor exhorted nor instructed by the monks  he fell down fainting at that very place
Then the venerable Channa being troubled about the higher penalty being ashamed of it loathing it dwelling alone aloof zealous ardent selfresolute having soon realised here and now by his own superknowledge that supreme goal of the Brahmafaring for the sake of which young men of family rightly go forth from home into homelessness entering on it abided in it and he understood
Destroyed is birth lived is the Brahmafaring done is what was to be done now there is no more of being this or that
 And so the venerable Channa became another of the perfected ones
Then the venerable Channa having attained perfection approached the venerable nanda having approached he spoke thus to the venerable nanda Honoured nanda now revoke the higher penalty for me 
From the moment that you reverend Channa realised perfection from that moment the higher penalty was revoked for you
Now because five hundred monksnot one more not one lesswere at this chanting of the discipline
this chanting of the discipline is in consequence called that of the Five Hundred
Told is the Eleventh Section that on the Five Hundred
At one time the Awakened One the Lord was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan monastery
Then the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord she stood at a respectful distance
As she was standing at a respectful distance the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great spoke thus to the Lord Lord it were well that women should obtain the going forth from home into homelessness in this dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Truthfinder 
Be careful Gotami of the going forth of women from home into homelessness in this dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Truthfinder
And a second time  And a third time did the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great speak thus to the Lord Lord it were well 
Be careful Gotami of the going forth of women from home into homelessness in this dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Truthfinder 
Then the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great thinking The Lord does not allow women to go forth from home into homelessness in the dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Truthfinder afflicted grieved with a tearful face and crying having greeted the Lord departed keeping her right side towards him
Then the Lord having stayed at Kapilavatthu for as long as he found suiting set out on tour for Vesālī
Gradually walking on tour he arrived at Vesālī
The Lord stayed there in Vesālī in the Great Grove in the Gabled Hall
Then the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great having had her hair cut off having donned saffron robes set out for Vesālī with several Sakyan women
and in due course approached Vesālī the Great Grove the Gabled Hall
Then the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great her feet swollen her limbs covered with dust with tearful face and crying stood outside the porch of the gateway
The venerable nanda saw the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great standing outside the porch of the gateway her feet swollen her limbs covered with dust with tearful face and crying
seeing her he spoke thus to the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great Why are you Gotami standing  and crying 
It is because honoured nanda the Lord does not allow the going forth of women from home into homelessness in the dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Truthfinder 
Well now Gotami stay here a moment until I have asked the Lord for the going forth of women from home into homelessness in the dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Truthfinder 
Then the venerable nanda approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord he sat down at a respectful distance
As he was sitting down at a respectful distance the venerable nanda spoke thus to the Lord Lord this Gotami Pajāpatī the Great is standing outside the porch of the gateway her feet swollen her limbs covered with dust with tearful face and crying and saying that the Lord does not allow the going forth of women from home into homelessness in the dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Truthfinder
It were well Lord if women might obtain the going forth from home  by the Truthfinder 
Be careful nanda of the going forth of women from home  by the Truthfinder
And a second time  And a third time the venerable nanda spoke thus to the Lord It were well Lord if women might obtain the going forth  proclaimed by the Truthfinder 
Be careful nanda of the going forth of women from home into homelessness in the dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Truthfinder
Then the venerable nanda thinking The Lord does not allow the going forth of women from home into homelessness in the dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Truthfinder Suppose now that I by some other method should ask the Lord for the going forth of women from home into homelessness in the dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Truthfinder
Then the venerable nanda spoke thus to the Lord Now Lord are women having gone forth from home into homelessness in the dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Truthfinder able to realise the fruit of streamattainment or the fruit of oncereturning or the fruit of nonreturning or perfection 
Women nanda having gone forth  are able to realise  perfection 
If Lord women having gone forth  are able to realise  perfectionand Lord the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great was of great service she was the Lords aunt fostermother nurse giver of milk for when the Lords mother passed away she suckled himit were well Lord that women should obtain the going forth from home into homelessness in the dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Truthfinder
If nanda the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great accepts eight important rules that may be ordination for her
A nun who has been ordained for a century must greet respectfully rise up from her seat salute with joined palms do proper homage to a monk ordained but that day
And this rule is to be honoured respected revered venerated never to be transgressed during her life
A nun must not spend the rains in a residence where there is no monk
This rule too is to be honoured  during her life
Every half month a nun should desire two things from the Order of monks the asking of the Observance day and the coming for the exhortation
This rule too is to be honoured  during her life
After the rains a nun must invite before both Orders in respect of three matters what was seen what was heard what was suspected
This rule too is to be honoured  during her life
A nun offending against an important rule must undergo mānatta for half a month before both Orders
This rule too must be honoured  during her life
When as a probationer she has trained in the six rules for two years she should seek ordination from both Orders
This rule too is to be honoured  during her life
A monk must not be abused or reviled in any way by a nun
This rule too is to be honoured  during her life
From today admonition of monks by nuns is forbidden admonition of nuns by monks is not forbidden
This rule too is to be honoured respected revered venerated never to be transgressed during her life
If nanda the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great accepts these eight important rules that may be ordination for her 
Then the venerable nanda having learnt the eight important rules from the Lord approached the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great having approached he spoke thus to the Gotami Pajāpatī the GreatIf you Gotami will accept eight important rules that will be the ordination for you
a nun who has been ordained for a century 
From today admonition of monks by nuns is forbidden 
never to be transgressed during your life
If you Gotami will accept these eight important rules that will be the ordination for you
Even honoured nanda as a woman or a man when young of tender years and fond of ornaments having washed head having obtained a garland of lotus flowers or a garland of jasmine flowers or a garland of some sweetscented creeper having taken it with both hands should place it on top of his headeven so do I honoured nanda accept these eight important rules never to be transgressed during my life 
Then the venerable nanda approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord he sat down at a respectful distance
As he was sitting down at a respectful distance the venerable nanda spoke thus to the Lord Lord the eight important rules were accepted by the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great 
If nanda women had not obtained the going forth from home into homelessness in the dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Truthfinder the Brahmafaring nanda would have lasted long true dhamma would have endured for a thousand years
But since nanda women have gone forth  in the dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Truthfinder now nanda the Brahmafaring will not last long
true dhamma will endure only for five hundred years
Even nanda as those households which have many women and few men easily fall a prey to robbers to potthieves even so nanda in whatever dhamma and discipline women obtain the going forth from home into homelessness that Brahmafaring will not last long
Even nanda as when the disease known as mildew attacks a whole field of rice that field of rice does not last long even so nanda in whatever dhamma and discipline women obtain the going forth  that Brahmafaring will not last long
Even nanda as when the disease known as red rust attacks a whole field of sugarcane that field of sugarcane does not last long even so nanda in whatever dhamma and discipline  that Brahmafaring will not last long
Even nanda as a man looking forward may build a dyke to a great reservoir so that the water may not overflow even so nanda were the eight important rules for nuns laid down by me looking forward not to be transgressed during their life
Told are the Eight Important Rules for Nuns
Then the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord she stood at a respectful distance
As she was standing at a respectful distance the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great spoke thus to the Lord Now what line of conduct Lord should I follow in regard to these Sakyan women
Then the Lord gladdened rejoiced roused delighted the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great with talk on dhamma
Then the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great gladdened  delighted by the Lord with talk on dhamma having greeted the Lord departed keeping her right side towards him
Then the Lord on this occasion having given reasoned talk addressed the monks saying I allow monks nuns to be ordained by monks 
Then these nuns spoke thus to the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great The lady is notordained neither are we ordained for it was thus laid down by the Lord nuns should be ordained by monks 
Then the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great approached the venerable nanda having approached having greeted the venerable nanda she stood at a respectful distance
As she was standing at a respectful distance the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great spoke thus to the venerable nanda Honoured nanda these nuns spoke to me thus The lady is not ordained neither are we ordained for it was thus laid down by the Lord nuns should be ordained by monks 
Then the venerable nanda approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord he sat down at a respectful distance
As he was sitting down at a respectful distance the venerable nanda spoke thus to the Lord Lord the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great spoke thus Honoured nanda these nuns spoke to me thus  nuns should be ordained by monks 
At the time nanda when the eight important rules were accepted by the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great that was her ordination 
Then the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great approached the venerable nanda having approached having greeted the venerable nanda she stood at a respectful distance
As she was standing at a respectful distance the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great spoke thus to the venerable nanda I honoured nanda am asking one boon from the Lord
It were well Lord if the Lord would allow greeting standing up for salutation and the proper duties between monks and nuns according to seniority
Then the venerable nanda approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord he sat down at a respectful distance
As he was sitting down at a respectful distance the venerable nanda spoke thus to the Lord Lord the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great spoke thus I honoured nanda am asking one boon 
according to seniority
This is impossible nanda it cannot come to pass that the Truthfinder should allow greeting standing up for salutation and the proper duties between monks and nuns according to seniority
nanda these followers of other sects although liable to poor guardianship will not carry out greeting standing up for salutation and proper duties towards women so how should the Truthfinder allow greeting  and proper duties towards women
 Then the Lord on this occasion having given reasoned talk addressed the monks saying Monks one should not carry out greeting rising up for salutation and proper duties towards women
Whoever should carry out  there is an offence of wrongdoing 
Then the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord she stood at a respectful distance
As she was standing at a respectful distance the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great spoke thus to the Lord Lord those rules of training for nuns which are in common with those for monks what line of conduct should we Lord follow in regard to these rules of training 
Those rules of training for nuns Gotami which are in common with those for monks as the monks train themselves so should you train yourselves in these rules of training 
Those rules of training for nuns Lord which are not in common with those for monks what line of conduct should we Lord follow in regard to these rules of training 
Those rules of training for nuns Gotami which are not in common with those for monks train yourselves in the rules of training according as they are laid down 
Then the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord she stood at a respectful distance
As she was standing at a respectful distance the Gotami Pajāpatī the Great spoke thus to the Lord Lord it were well if the Lord would teach me dhamma in brief so that I having heard the Lords dhamma might live alone aloof zealous ardent selfresolute 
Whatever are the states of which you Gotami may know these states lead to passion not to passionlessness they lead to bondage not to the absence of bondage they lead to the piling up  not to the absence of piling up they lead to wanting much not to wanting little they lead to discontent not to contentment they lead to sociability not to solitude they lead to indolence not to the putting forth of energy they lead to difficulty in supporting oneself not to ease in supporting oneselfyou should know definitely Gotami this is not dhamma this is not discipline this is not the Teachers instruction
But whatever are the states of which you Gotami may know these states lead to passionlessness not to passion  the opposite of the preceding  they lead to ease in supporting oneself not to difficulty in supporting oneselfyou should know definitely Gotami this is dhamma this is discipline this is the Teachers instruction 
Now at that time the Pātimokkha was not recited to nuns
They told this matter to the Lord He said I allow you monks to recite the Pātimokkha to the nuns
Then it occurred to the nuns Now by whom should the Pātimokkha be recited to nuns
They told this matter to the Lord
He said I allow monks the Pātimokkha to be recited to nuns by monks 
Now at that time monks having approached a nunnery recited the Pātimokkha to nuns
People looked down upon criticised spread it about saying These are their wives these are their mistresses now they will take their pleasure together  Monks heard these people who  spread it about
Then these monks told this matter to the Lord
He said  Monks the Pātimokkha should not be recited to nuns by monks
Whoever should recite it there is an offence of wrongdoing
I allow monks the Pātimokkha to be recited to nuns by nuns 
The nuns did not know how to recite the Pātimokkha
They told this matter to the Lord
He said I allow you monks to explain to the nuns through monks saying The Pātimokkha should be recited thus 
Now at that time nuns did not confess offences
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks an offence should not be not confessed by a nun
Whoever should not confess it there is an offence of wrongdoing
The nuns did not know how to confess offences
They told this matter to the Lord
He said I allow you monks to explain to the nuns through monks saying An offence should be confessed thus 
Then it occurred to monks Now by whom should nuns offences be acknowledged
They told this matter to the Lord
He said I allow you monks to acknowledge nuns offences through monks 
Now at that time nuns having seen a monk on a carriageroad and in a culdesac and at crossroads having laid down her bowl on the ground having arranged her upper robe over one shoulder having sat down on her haunches having saluted with joined palms confessed an offence
People  spread it about saying These are their wives these are their mistresses having treated them contemptuously during the night now they are asking for forgiveness
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks nuns offences should not be acknowledged by monks
Whoever should acknowledge  there is an offence of wrongdoing
I allow monks nuns offences to be acknowledged by nuns
The nuns did not know how to acknowledge offences
They told this matter to the Lord
He said I allow you monks to explain to the nuns through monks saying An offence should be acknowledged thus 
Now at that time acts were not carried out for nuns
They told this matter to the Lord
He said I allow monks a act to be carried out for nuns
Then it occurred to monks Now by whom should acts for nuns be carried out
They told this matter to the Lord
He said I allow monks acts for nuns to be carried out by monks 
Now at that time nuns on whose behalf acts had been carried out having seen a monk on a carriageroad and in a culdesac and at crossroads having laid down her bowl on the ground having arranged her upper robe over one shoulder having sat down on her haunches having saluted with joined palms asked forgiveness thinking Surely it should be done thus
As before people  spread it about saying These are their wives these are their mistresses having treated them contemptuously during the night now they are asking for forgiveness
They told this matter to the Lord
He said  Monks a act on behalf of nuns should not be carried out by monks
Whoever should carry one out there is an offence of wrongdoing
I allow monks nuns to carry out acts on behalf of the nuns
Nuns did not know how acts should be carried out
They told this matter to the Lord
He said I allow you monks to explain to the nuns through monks saying A act should be carried out thus 
Now at that time nuns in the midst of an Order striving quarrelling falling into disputes wounding one another with the weapons of the tongue
were not able to settle that legal question
They told this matter to the Lord
He said I allow you monks to settle nuns legal questions by monks
Now at that time monks were settling a legal question for nuns
but as that legal question was being investigated there were to be seen both nuns who were entitled to take part in a act and those who had committed an offence
The nuns spoke thus It were well honoured sirs if the ladies themselves could carry out acts for nuns if the ladies themselves could acknowledge an offence of nuns but it was thus laid down by the Lord Nuns legal questions should be settled by monks
They told this matter to the Lord
He said I allow you monks having cancelled the carrying out by monks of nuns acts to give it into the charge of nuns to carry out nuns acts by nuns having cancelled by monks of nuns offences to give it into the charge of nuns to acknowledge nuns offences by nuns 
Now at that time the nun who was the pupil of the nun Uppalavaṇṇā had followed after the Lord for seven years mastering discipline
but because she was of confused mindfulness what she had learnt she forgot
That nun heard it said that the Lord wished to come to Sāvatthī
Then it occurred to that nun For seven years I have followed the Lord mastering discipline
but because I am of confused mindfulness what I have learnt is forgotten
Hard it is for a woman to follow after a teacher for as long as her life lasts
What line of conduct should be followed by me
Then that nun told this matter to the nuns
The nuns told this matter to the monks
The monks told this matter to the Lord
He said I allow monks discipline to be taught to nuns by monks 
Then the Lord having stayed in Vesālī for as long as he found suiting set out on tour for Sāvatthī
Gradually walking on tour he arrived at Sāvatthī
The Lord stayed there at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time the group of six monks sprinkled nuns with muddy water thinking Perhaps they may be attracted to us
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks nuns should not be sprinkled with muddy water by monks
Whoever should sprinkle them there is an offence of wrongdoing
I allow you monks to inflict a penalty on that monk
Then it accurred to monks Now how is the penalty to be inflicted
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks that monk is to be made one who is not to be greeted by the Order of nuns 
Now at that time the group of six monks having uncovered their bodies  thighs  private parts showed them to nuns they offended nuns they associated with nuns thinking Perhaps they may be attracted to us
They told this matter to the Lord
He said  Monks a monk having uncovered his body  thighs  private parts should not show them to nuns he should not offend nuns he should not associate together with nuns
Whoever should associate there is an offence of wrongdoing
I allow you monks to inflict a penalty on that monk
Then it occurred to monks

Then it occurred to monks Now is it allowable to carry out Observance together with a nun whose exhortation has been suspended or is it not allowable
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks Observance should not be carried out together with a nun whose exhortation has been suspended so long as that legal question is not settled 
Now at that time the venerable Upāli having suspended exhortation set out on tour
Nuns looked down upon criticised spread it about saying How can the master Upāli having suspended exhortation set out on tour
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks having suspended exhortation one should not set out on tour
Whoever should set out there is an offence of wrongdoing 
Now at that time ignorant inexperienced suspended exhortation
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks exhortation should not be suspended by an ignorant inexperienced 
Whoever should suspend it there is an offence of wrongdoing 
Now at that time monks suspended exhortation without ground without reason
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks exhortation should not be suspended without ground without reason
Whoever should suspend it there is an offence of wrongdoing 
Now at that time monks having suspended exhortation did not give a decision
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks having suspended exhortation you should not not give a decision
Whoever should not give  there is an offence of wrongdoing 
Now at that time nuns did not go for exhortation
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks nuns should not not go for exhortation
Whoever should not go should be dealt with according to the rule
Now at that time the entire Order of nuns went for exhortation
People looked down upon criticised spread it about saying These are their wives these are their mistresses now they will take their pleasure together
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks the entire Order of nuns should not go for exhortation
If it should go thus there is an offence of wrongdoing
I allow monks four or five nuns to go for exhortation

If they should go thus there is an offence of wrongdoing
I allow monks two or three nuns to go for exhortation
having approached one monk having arranged her upper robe over one shoulder having honoured his feet having sat down on her haunches having saluted with joined palms they should speak to him thus Master the Order of nuns honours the feet of the Order of monks and asks about coming for exhortation may the Order of nuns master hear what is coming for exhortation

Now at that time ordained women were to be seen without sexual characteristics and who were defective in sex and bloodless and with stagnant blood and who were always dressed and dripping and deformed and female eunuchs and manlike women and those whose sexuality was indistinct and those who were hermaphrodites
They told this matter to the Lord
He said I allow you monks to question a woman who is being ordained about twentyfour things that are stumblingblocks
And thus monks should she be questioned You are not without sexual characteristics  You are not a hermaphrodite
Have you diseases like this leprosy boils eczema consumption epilepsy
Are you a human being Are you a woman Are you a free woman Are you without debts You are not in royal service
Are you allowed by your mother and father by your husband
Have you completed twenty years of age Are you complete as to bowl and robe What is your name What is the name of your woman proposer 
Now at that time monks asked nuns about the things which are stumblingblocks
Those wishing for ordination were at a loss they were abashed they were unable to answer
They told this matter to the Lord
He said I allow monks ordination in the Order of monks after she has been ordained on the one side and has cleared herself in the Order of nuns 
Now at that time nuns asked those wishing for ordination but who were not instructed about the things which are stumblingblocks
Those wishing for ordination were at a loss they were abashed they were unable to answer
They told this matter to the Lord
He said I allow them monks having instructed first afterwards to ask about the things which are stumblingblocks 
They instructed just there in the midst of the Order
As before those wishing for ordination were at a loss they were abashed they were unable to answer
They told this matter to the Lord
He said I allow them monks having instructed aside to ask about the things which are stumblingblocks in the midst of the Order
And thus monks should she be instructed
First she should be invited to choose a woman preceptor
having invited her to choose a woman preceptor a bowl and robes should be pointed out to her  This is a bowl for you this is an outer cloak this is an upper robe this is an inner robe this is a vest this is a bathingcloth go and stand in such and such a place
Ignorant inexperienced instructed them
Those wishing for ordination but who were not instructed were at a loss they were abashed they were unable to answer
They told this matter to the Lord
He said  Monks they should not be instructed by ignorant inexperienced 
Whoever should instruct them there is an offence of wrongdoing
I allow them monks to instruct by means of an experienced competent  
Those who were not agreed upon instructed
They told this matter to the Lord
He said  Monks they should not be instructed by one who is not agreed upon
Whoever should instruct there is an offence of wrongdoing
I allow them monks to instruct by means of one who is agreed upon
And thus monks should she be agreed upon oneself may be agreed upon by oneself or another may be agreed upon by another
And how is oneself to be agreed upon by oneself
The Order should be informed by an experienced competent nun saying Ladies let the Order listen to me
Soandso wishes for ordination through the lady Soandso

The shadow should be measured at once the length of the season should be explained the portion of the day should be explained the formula should be explained the nuns should be told Explain the three resources to her and the eight things which are not to be done 
Now at that time nuns being uncertain as to seats in a refectory let the time go by
They told this matter to the Lord

having come back again she asked the nuns for ordination
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks whatever nun wearing the saffron robes goes over to the fold of a sect on coming back should not be ordained 
Now at that time nuns being scrupulous did not consent to greeting by men to their cutting hair to their cutting nails to their dressing a sore
They told this matter to the Lord
He said I allow them monks to consent to  
Now at that time nuns were sitting down crosslegged consenting to the touch of heels
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks nuns should not sit down crosslegged
Whoever should sit down there is an offence of wrongdoing 
Now at that time a certain nun was ill
There was no comfort for her if she was not crosslegged
They told this matter to the Lord
He said I allow monks the half crosslegged for nuns 
Now at that time nuns relieved themselves in a privy
the group of six nuns caused abortion there
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks nuns should not relieve themselves in a privy
Whoever should do so there is an offence of wrongdoing
I allow them monks to relieve themselves where it is open underneath covered on top 
Now at that time nuns bathed with chunam
People looked down upon criticised spread it about saying Like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks nuns should not bathe with chunam
Whoever should bathe there is an offence of wrongdoing
I allow them monks the red powder of rice husks and clay 
Now at that time nuns bathed with scented clay
People  spread it about saying Like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses
They told this matter to the Lord
He said  Monks nuns should not bathe with scented clay
Whoever should bathe there is an offence of wrongdoing
I allow them monks ordinary clay 
Now at that time nuns bathing in a bathroom created a disturbance
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks nuns should not bathe in a bathroom
Whoever should bathe  there is an offence of wrongdoing 
Now at that time nuns bathed against the stream consenting to the touch of the current
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks nuns should not bathe against the stream
Whoever should bathe there is an offence of wrongdoing 
Now at that time nuns bathed not at a ford
men of abandoned life seduced them
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks nuns should not bathe not at a ford
Whoever should bathe there is an offence of wrongdoing 
Now at that time nuns bathed at a ford for men
People  spread it about saying Like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks nuns should not bathe at a ford for men
Whoever should bathe there is an offence of wrongdoing
I allow them monks to bathe at a ford for women
At one time the Awakened One the Lord was staying at Anupiyā Anupiyā is a little town of the Mallas
Now at that time many distinguished Sakyan young men had gone forth in imitation of the Lord who had gone forth
Now at that time Mahānāma the Sakyan and Anuruddha the Sakyan were two brothers
Anuruddha the Sakyan was delicately nurtured
He had three palaces one for the cold weather one for the hot one for the rains
Being waited on for four months in the palace for the rains by female musicians he did not come down from that palace
Then it occurred to Mahānāma the Sakyan At present many distinguished Sakyan young men have gone forth in imitation of the Lord who has gone forth
but no one from our family has gone forth from home into homelessness
Suppose I should go forth or Anuruddha
Then Mahānāma the Sakyan approached Anuruddha the Sakyan having approached he spoke thus to Anuruddha the Sakyan At present dear Anuruddha many distinguished Sakyan young men 
but no one from our family has gone forth from home into homelessness
Well now either you go forth or I will go forth
But I have been delicately nurtured I am not able to go forth from home into homelessness
You go forth 
Come along dear Anuruddha I will instruct you in what belongs to the household life
First the fields have to be ploughed
having had them ploughed they must be sown
having had them sown water must be led in to them
having had water led in to them the water must be led away
having led the water away you must have the weeds dug up
having had the weeds dug up you must get the crop reaped
having had the crop reaped you must have it harvested
having had it harvested you must have it made into stooks
having had it made into stooks you must have it threshed
having had it threshed you must have the straw winnowed
having had the straw winnowed you must have the chaff winnowed
having had the chaff winnowed you must have it sifted
having had it sifted you must have it brought in
having had it brought in it is to be done just the same the next year and it is to be done just the same the next year
The operations do not stop
no end to the operations is to be seen
When will the operations stop
When will an end to the operations be seen
When will we possessed of and provided with the fivefold strand of sense pleasures amuse ourselves unconcernedly 
But dear Anuruddha the operations do not stop
no end to the operations is to be seen
Even when our fathers and grandfathers passed away the operations were not stopped 
Well now you understand just what belongs to the household life
I will go forth from home into homelessness 
Then Anuruddha the Sakyan approached his mother having approached he spoke thus to his mother
Consent to my going forth from home into homelessness
When he had spoken thus the mother of Anuruddha the Sakyan spoke thus to Anuruddha the Sakyan You two boys dear Anuruddha are dear to me beloved agreeable
In the case of your death I would be unwillingly separated from you
So how can I while you are still living allow a going forth from home into homelessness
And a second time  And a third time Anuruddha the Sakyan spoke thus to his mother I mother want to go forth from home into homelessness
Consent to my going forth from home into homelessness
Now at that time Bhaddiya the Sakyan chieftain was ruling over the Sakyans
and was a friend of Anuruddha the Sakyan
Then the mother of Anuruddha the Sakyan thinking Now this Bhaddiya  is a friend of Anuruddha he will not be able to go forth from home into homelessness spoke thus to Anuruddha the Sakyan If dear Anuruddha Bhaddiya the Sakyan chieftain goes forth from home into homelessness you can go forth likewise 
Then Anuruddha the Sakyan approached Bhaddiya the Sakyan chieftain having approached he spoke thus to Bhaddiya the Sakyan chieftain My going forth friend is dependent on yours 
If your going forth friend is dependent on mine let it be independent I with you  Go forth according to your wish 
Come friend we will both go forth from home into homelessness 
I friend am not able to go forth from home into homelessness
Whatever else I am able to do for you that will I do
You go forth 
My mother friend spoke thus to me If dear Anuruddha Bhaddiya the Sakyan chieftain goes forth from home into homelessness you can go forth likewise
But friend these words were spoken by you
If your going forth is dependent on mine let it be independent I with you  Go forth according to your wish
Come friend we will both go forth from home into homelessness 
Now at that time people were speakers of truth pledged to the truth
Then Bhaddiya the Sakyan chieftain spoke thus to Anuruddha the Sakyan Wait friend for seven years
After seven years we will both go forth from home into homelessness 
Seven years are too long friend
I am not able to wait for seven years 
Wait friend for six years  live  four  three  two years  for one year
After one year we will both go forth from home into homelessness 
One year is too long friend
I am not able to wait one year 
Wait friend for seven months
After seven months we will both go forth from home into homelessness 
Seven months are too long friend
I am not able to wait seven months 
Wait friend for six  five  four  three  two months  one month  for half a month
after half a month we will both go forth from home into homelessness 
Half a month is too long friend
I am not able to wait half a month 
Wait friend for seven days until I hand over the kingdom to my sons and brothers 
Seven days are not too long friend I will wait 
Then Bhaddiya the Sakyan chieftain and Anuruddha and nanda and Bhagu and Kimbila and Devadatta with Upāli the barber as the seventh as they had often previously gone out to a ground in a pleasure grove with a fourfold army so did they go out with a fourfold army
Having gone far having sent back the army having passed into other territory having taken off their ornaments having tied them up into a bundle with their upper robes they spoke thus to Upāli the barber Come good Upāli return this will be enough for your livelihood
Then it occurred to Upāli the barber as he was going back The Sakyans are fierce Thinking This one has made the young men come forth they may even kill me
But if these young Sakyan men will go forth from home into homelessness
why should not I 
Having loosened the bundle having hung the goods up on a tree and having said Whoever sees it it is given  let him take it he approached the young Sakyan men
These young Sakyan men saw Upāli the barber coming in the distance
having seen him then spoke thus to Upāli the barber Why have you good Upāli returned 
Now it occurred to me young gentlemen as I was going back The Sakyans are fierce  they may even kill me
But if these young Sakyan men will go forth from home into homelessness
why should not I
So I young gentlemen having loosened the bundle   let him take it returned again from there 
You did well good Upāli in that you did not go back
The Sakyans are fierce  they might even have killed you
Then these young Sakyan men taking Upāli the barber approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord they sat down at a respectful distance
As they were sitting down at a respectful distance these young Sakyan men spoke thus to the Lord We Lord are Sakyans we are proud
Lord this barber Upāli has been our attendant for a long time
May the Lord let him go forth first
We will greet him rise up before him salute him with joined palms and do the proper duties
Thus will the Sakyan pride be humbled in us Sakyans
Then the Lord let Upāli the barber go forth first and afterwards these young Sakyan men
Then the venerable Bhaddiya within one year realised the threefold knowledge
the venerable Anuruddha obtained devasight
the venerable nanda realised the fruit of stream attainment
Devadatta acquired ordinary psychic power
Now at that time the venerable Bhaddiya dwelling in a forest and at the root of a tree and in an empty place constantly uttered this utterance Ah what happiness Ah what happiness
Then several monks approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord they sat down at a respectful distance
As they were sitting down at a respectful distance these monks spoke thus to the Lord Lord the venerable Bhaddiya dwelling in a forest utters this utterance Ah what happiness Ah what happiness
Doubtless Lord the venerable Bhaddiya fares the Brahmafaring dissatisfied
and dwelling in a forest and at the root of a tree and in an empty place he utters this utterance Ah what happiness Ah what happiness while he is recalling the former joys of kingship 
Then the Lord addressed a certain monk saying Come you monk in my name address the monk Bhaddiya saying The Teacher reverend Bhaddiya is summoning you 
Very well Lord and that monk having answered the Lord in assent approached the venerable Bhaddiya having approached he spoke thus to the venerable Bhaddiya The Teacher reverend Bhaddiya is summoning you 
Very well your reverence and the venerable Bhaddiya having answered that monk in assent approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord he sat down at a respectful distance
The Lord spoke thus to the venerable Bhaddiya as he was sitting down at a respectful distance Is it true as is said that you Bhaddiya dwelling in a forest and at the root of a tree and in an empty place are constantly uttering this utterance Ah what happiness Ah what happiness 
Yes Lord 
What circumstances were you Bhaddiya taking into account when dwelling in a forest and at the root of a tree and in an empty place you constantly uttered this utterance Ah what happiness Ah what happiness 
Formerly Lord when I was a ruler there was a fully appointed guard both within my private quarters and outside my private quarters there was a fully appointed guard both within the town and outside the town and there was a fully appointed guard within the country districts
But I Lord although being guarded and warded thus dwelt afraid anxious fearful alarmed
But now I Lord dwelling in a forest and at the root of a tree and in an empty place am unafraid not anxious not fearful not alarmed I am unconcerned unruffled dependent on others with a mind become as a wild creatures
This Lord was the circumstance I was taking into account when dwelling in a forest and at the root of a tree and in an empty place I constantly uttered this utterance Ah what happiness Ah what happiness
Then the Lord having understood this matter at that time uttered this utterance
In whom there inly lurk no spites Who has overcome becoming and not becoming thus or thus
Him gone past fear blissful sorrowless The devas do not win to see 
Then the Lord having stayed at Anupiyā for as long as he found suiting set out on almstour for Kosambī
Gradually walking on tour he arrived at Kosambī
The Lord stayed there at Kosambī in Ghositas monastery
Then as Devadatta was meditating in private a reasoning arose in his mind thus Whom now could I please so that because he is pleased with me much gain and honour would accrue 
Then it occurred to Devadatta This Prince Ajātasattu is young and also has an auspicious future
What now if I were to make Prince Ajātasattu pleased
so that because he is pleased with me much gain and honour would accrue  
Then Devadatta having packed away his lodging taking his bowl and robe set out for Rājagaha
in due course he arrived at Rājagaha
Then Devadatta having thrown off his own form having assumed the form of a young boy clad in a girdle of snakes became manifest in Prince Ajātasattus lap
Then Prince Ajātasattu was afraid anxious fearful alarmed
Then Devadatta spoke thus to Prince Ajātasattu Are you prince afraid of me 
Yes I am afraid
Who are you 
I am Devadatta 
If you honoured sir are really master Devadatta please become manifest in your own form
Then Devadatta having thrown off the young boys form stood wearing his outer cloak and robes and carrying his bowl before Prince Ajātasattu
Then Prince Ajātasattu greatly pleased with this wonder of psychic power on Devadattas part morning and evening went to wait on him with five hundred chariots and five hundred offerings of rice cooked in milk were brought as a gift of food
Then there arose to Devadatta overcome by gains honours and fame his mind obsessed by them some such longing as this It is I who will lead the Order of monks
But at the very occurrence of this thought Devadatta declined in his psychic power
Now at that time Kakudha the Koliyan the venerable Moggallāna the Greats attendant had just died and had arisen in a certain mindmade body
and such was the reinstatement of his individuality that it was like two or three Magadhan village fields
yet even with that reinstatement of individuality he injured neither himself nor another
Then Kakudha the young deva approached the venerable Moggallāna the Great having approached having greeted the venerable Moggallāna the Great he stood at a respectful distance
As he was standing at a respectful distance the young deva Kakudha spoke thus to the venerable Moggallāna the Great To Devadatta honoured sir overcome by gains honours and fame his mind obsessed by them some such longing as this arose It is I who will lead the Order of monks
But honoured sir at the very occurrence of this thought Devadatta declined in his psychic power
Thus spoke Kakudha the young deva
Having spoken thus having greeted the venerable Moggallāna the Great keeping his right side towards him he vanished then and there
Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord he sat down at a respectful distance
As he was sitting down at a respectful distance the venerable Moggallāna the Great spoke thus to the Lord Kakudha the Koliyan Lord my attendant has just died and has arisen in a certain mindmade body 
Then Kakudha the young deva approached me 
keeping his right side towards me he vanished then and there 
But Moggallāna does Kakudha the young deva so compass your mind with his mind
for you to know that whatever Kakudha the young deva says all that is so and not otherwise 
Lord Kakudha the young deva so compasses my mind with his mind
for me to know that whatever Kakudha the young deva says all that is so and not otherwise 
Mind what you say Moggallāna
mind what you say Moggallāna
This foolish man will now betray himself by himself
Moggallāna these five teachers are found in the world
What five
This is a case Moggallāna when some teacher not pure in moral habit pretends I am pure in moral habit and he says My moral habit is pure clean untarnished
Disciples know this about him This worthy teacher not pure in moral habit pretends  untarnished
But they think If we should tell this to householders he would not like it
and how could we carry out what he would not like
Moreover he consents to the requisites of robes almsfood lodgings and medicines for the sick Whatever anyone shall do even by that shall he be known
Moggallāna disciples protect such a teacher in regard to moral habit and such a teacher expects protection from disciples in regard to moral habit
And again Moggallāna this is a case when some teacher not pure in mode of livelihood pretends 
 not pure in teaching of dhamma pretends 
not pure in exposition 
not pure in knowledge and vision pretends 
Moggallāna disciples protect such a teacher in regard to knowledge and vision and such a teacher expects protection from disciples in regard to knowledge and vision
These Moggallāna are the five teachers found in the world
But I Moggallāna am pure in moral habit I acknowledge that I am pure in moral habit that my moral habit is pure clean untarnished
And disciples do not protect me in regard to moral habit and I do not expect protection from disciples in regard to moral habit
I am pure in mode of livelihood  I am pure in dhamma teaching  I am pure in exposition  I am pure in knowledge and vision I acknowledge that I am pure in knowledge and vision that my knowledge and vision are pure clean untarnished
And disciples do not protect me in regard to knowledge and vision and I do not expect protection from disciples in regard to knowledge and vision 
Then the Lord having stayed at Kosambī for as long as he found suiting set out on a tour for Rājagaha
Gradually walking on tour he arrived at Rājagaha
The Lord stayed there at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels feeding place
Then several monks approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord they sat down at a respectful distance
As they were sitting down at a respectful distance these monks spoke thus to the Lord Prince Ajātasattu Lord goes morning and evening to wait on Devadatta with five hundred chariots and five hundred offerings of rice cooked in milk are brought as a gift of food 
Do not monks envy Devadattas gains and honours and fame
For as long monks as Prince Ajātasattu goes morning and evening to wait on Devadatta with five hundred chariots and five hundred offerings of rice cooked in milk are brought as a gift of food there may be expected for Devadatta decline in skilled mental states not growth
It is as if monks they were to throw a bladder at a fierce dogs noseas that dog monks would become much fiercer even so monks for as long as Prince Ajātasattu goes morning and evening  there may be expected for Devadatta decline in skilled mental states not growth
Devadattas gains honours and fame bring about his own hurt Devadattas gains honour and fame bring about his destruction
As monks a plantain bears fruit to its own hurt bears fruit to its destruction even so monks do Devadattas gains honours and fame bring about his own hurt do Devadattas gains honours and fame bring about his destruction
As monks a bamboo 
a reed bears fruit to its own hurt  even so monks do Devadattas gains honours and fame bring about  his destruction
As monks a shemule conceives to her own hurt conceives to her destruction even so monks do Devadattas gains honours and fame bring about  his destruction
Truly its fruit the plantain does destroy Its fruit the bamboo its fruit the reed
So honour does destroy the fool Just as its embryo the mule 
Told is the First Portion for Repeating
Now at that time the Lord was sitting down teaching dhamma surrounded by a large company by a company which included the king
Then Devadatta rising from his seat having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder having saluted the Lord with joined palms spoke thus to the Lord Lord the Lord is now old worn stricken in years he has lived his span and is at the close of his life
Lord let the Lord now be content to live devoted to abiding in ease here and now let him hand over the Order of monks to me
It is I who will lead the Order of monks 
Enough Devadatta please do not lead the Order of monks
And a second time  And a third time Devadatta spoke thus to the Lord Lord the Lord is now old worn stricken in years 
It is I who will lead the Order of monks 
I Devadatta would not hand over the Order of monks even to Sāriputta and Moggallāna How then could I to you a wretched one to be vomited like spittle 
Then Devadatta thinking The Lord in an assembly which included a king disparaged me by the term one to be vomited like spittle while he extolled Sāriputta and Moggallāna angry displeased having greeted the Lord departed keeping his right side towards him
And this was the first time that Devadatta felt malice towards the Lord
Then the Lord addressed the monks saying Well then monks let the Order carry out a act of Information against Devadatta in Rājagaha to the effect that whereas Devadattas nature was formerly of one kind now it is of another kind
and that whatever Devadatta should do by gesture and by voice in that neither the Awakened One nor dhamma nor the Order should be seen but in that only Devadatta should be seen
And thus monks should it be carried out
The Order should be informed by an experienced competent monk saying
Honoured sirs let the Order listen to me
If it seems right to the Order let the Order carry out an act of Information against Devadatta in Rājagaha to the effect that whereas Devadattas nature was formerly of one kind now it is of another kind
and that whatever Devadatta should do  in that only Devadatta should be seen
This is the motion
Honoured sirs let the Order listen to me
The Order is carrying out the act of Information against Devadatta in Rājagaha to the effect that 
in that only Devadatta should be seen
If the carrying out of the act of Information against Devadatta in Rājagaha to the effect that  in that only Devadatta should be seen is pleasing to the venerable ones they should be silent he to whom it is not pleasing should speak
The act of Information against Devadatta in Rājagaha to the effect that 
in that only Devadatta should be seen is carried out by the Order
It is pleasing to the Order therefore it is silent Thus do I understand this 
Then the Lord addressed the venerable Sāriputta saying Well then do you Sāriputta inform against Devadatta in Rājagaha 
Formerly Lord I spoke praise of Devadatta in Rājagaha saying Godhis son is of great psychic power Godhis son is of great majesty
How can I Lord inform against Devadatta in Rājagaha 
Was not the truth spoken by you Sāriputta when you spoke praise of Devadatta in Rājagaha saying Godhis son is of  great majesty 
Yes Lord 
Even so Sāriputta when you inform against Devadatta in Rājagaha it will be just as true 
Very well Lord the venerable Sāriputta answered the Lord in assent
Then the Lord addressed the monks saying Well then monks let the Order agree for Sāriputta to inform against Devadatta in Rājagaha saying Formerly Devadattas nature was of such a kind now it is of another kind
and that whatever Devadatta should do by gesture and by voice in that neither the Awakened One nor dhamma nor the Order should be seen but in that only Devadatta should be seen
And thus monks should Sāriputta be agreed upon
First Sāriputta should be asked
having been asked the Order should be informed by an experienced competent monk saying
Honoured sirs let the Order listen to me
If it seems right to the Order the Order may agree for the venerable Sāriputta to inform against Devadatta in Rājagaha saying Formerly Devadattas nature was of one kind 
in that only Devadatta should be seen
This is the motion
If the agreement upon Sāriputta to inform against Devadatta in Rājagaha saying Formerly Devadattas nature was of one kind 
in that only Devadatta should be seen is pleasing to the venerable ones they should be silent he to whom it is not pleasing should speak
The venerable Sāriputta is agreed upon by the Order to inform against Devadatta in Rājagaha saying Formerly Devadattas nature was of one kind 
in that only Devadatta should be seen 
It is pleasing to the Order therefore it is silent Thus do I understand this 
The venerable Sāriputta agreed upon having entered Rājagaha together with several monks informed against Devadatta in Rājagaha to the effect that Formerly Devadattas nature was of one kind now it is of another kind
and that whatever Devadatta should do by gesture and by voice in that neither the Awakened One nor dhamma nor the Order should be seen but in that only Devadatta should be seen
Those people who were of little faith not believing who were of poor intelligence spoke thus These recluses sons of the Sakyans are jealous they are jealous of Devadattas gains and honours
But those people who had faith and were believing who were wise intelligent spoke thus This can be no ordinary matter in that the Lord has Devadatta informed against in Rājagaha
Then Devadatta approached Prince Ajātasattu having approached he spoke thus to Prince Ajātasattu Formerly prince people were longlived nowadays they are shortlived
and it is possible that you while still a prince might pass away
Well now do you prince having slain your father become king
I having slain the Lord will become the Awakened One
And Prince Ajātasattu thinking Now master Devadatta is of great psychic power of great majesty master Devadatta must know  having fastened a dagger against his thigh at an early hour afraid anxious fearful alarmed entered the private quarters forcibly
But the chief ministers in attendance in the private quarters saw Prince Ajātasattu at an early hour afraid anxious fearful alarmed entering the private quarters forcibly Seeing him they laid hold of him
These examining him and having seen the dagger bound against his thigh spoke thus to Prince Ajātasattu What is it that you prince want to do 
I want to slay my father 
By whom are you being incited 
By master Devadatta
Some chief ministers gave this opinion The Prince should be slain and Devadatta and all the monks should be slain
Some chief ministers gave this opinion The monks should not be slain
for the monks are not giving offence
but the Prince should be slain and Devadatta
Some chief ministers gave this opinion The Prince should not be slain nor Devadatta
the monks should not be slain
The king should be told
and we will do whatever the king says 
Then these chief ministers taking Prince Ajātasattu approached King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha having approached they told this matter to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha
He said What opinion my good men have the chief ministers formed 
Some chief ministers Sire gave this opinion 
Some chief ministers gave this opinion 
Some chief ministers gave this opinion The Prince should not be slain nor Devadatta
the monks should not be slain
The king should be told
and we will do whatever the king says 
What my good men can the Awakened One or dhamma or the Order have to do 
Has not the Lord already had Devadatta informed against in Rājagaha to the effect that formerly Devadattas nature was of one kind now it is of another kind
and that whatever Devadatta may do by gesture or by speech in that neither the Awakened One nor dhamma nor the Order is to be seen but in that only Devadatta should be seen 
Those chief ministers who had given their opinion thus The Prince should be slain and Devadatta and all the monks should be slain these he discharged
Those chief ministers who had given their opinion thus The monks should not be slain for the monks do not give any offence but the prince should be slain and Devadatta these he set in lowly positions
Those chief ministers who had given their opinion thus The prince should not be slain nor Devadatta nor should the monks be slain The king should be told and we will do whatever the king says these he set in high positions
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha spoke thus to Prince Ajātasattu Why do you prince want to slay me 
Sire I have need of a kingdom 
If it be that you prince have need of a kingdom this kingdom is yours and he handed over the kingdom to Prince Ajātasattu
Then Devadatta approached Prince Ajātasattu having approached he spoke thus to Prince Ajātasattu Your Majesty command your men so that they deprive the recluse Gotama of life
Then Prince Ajātasattu commanded his men saying My good men do whatever master Devadatta says
Then Devadatta enjoined the men saying Go along friends the recluse Gotama is staying at a certain place
Having deprived him of life come back by a certain road
and he set two men on that road saying Whatever man comes alone along this road having deprived him of life come back by this road
and having set four men on that road saying Whatever couple of men come along by this road having deprived them of life come back by this road
and having set eight men on that road saying Whatever four men come along by this road come back by this road
and having set sixteen men on that road he said Whatever eight men come along by this road having deprived them of life come back 
Then that man who was alone having grasped a sword and shield having bound on a bow and quiver approached the Lord having approached when he was quite near the Lord he stood still his body quite rigid afraid anxious fearful alarmed
The Lord saw that man standing still his body quite rigid afraid  alarmed
and seeing him he spoke thus to that man Come friend do not be afraid
Then that man having put his sword and shield to one side having laid down his bow and quiver approached the Lord having approached having inclined his head to the Lords feet he spoke thus to the Lord Lord a transgression has overcome me foolish misguided wrong that I was in that I was coming here with my mind malignant my mind on murder
Lord may the Lord acknowledge for me the transgression as a transgression for the sake of restraint in the future 
Truly friend a transgression overcame you foolish misguided wrong that you were in that you were coming here with your mind malignant your mind on murder
But if you friend having seen the transgression as a transgression confess according to the rule we acknowledge it for you
for friend in the discipline of the noble this is growth whoever having seen a transgression as a transgression confesses according to the rule he attains restraint in the future 
Then the Lord talked a progressive talk to this man that is to say talk on giving talk on moral habit talk on heaven he declared the drawbacks degradation  corruption of sensuality and the rewards of renunciation
Then when the Blessed One knew that his mind was ready malleable free from hindrances elevated  clear he then gave the Dhammatalk peculiar to Awakened Ones ie stress origination cessation  path sorrow its uprising stopping the Way
Just as a clean cloth without black specks will take a dye easily even so on that very seat did dhammavision dustless stainless arise to that man that whatever is of a nature to arise all that is of a nature to stop
Then that man as one who has seen dhamma attained dhamma known dhamma plunged into dhamma having crossed over doubt having put away uncertainty having attained without anothers help to full confidence in the Teachers instruction spoke thus to the Lord Excellent Lord Lord it is excellent
It is as if one were to set upright what has been upset  thus is dhamma explained in many a figure by the Lord
So I Lord am going to the Lord for refuge and to dhamma and to the Order of monks
May the Lord accept me as a layfollower going for refuge from this day forth for as long as life lasts 
Then the Lord spoke thus to that man Do not you friend go by that road Go by this road and he sent him off by another road
Then those two men thinking Why is that man who is alone so slow in coming  going along to meet him saw the Lord sitting at the root of a tree
Seeing him they approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord they sat down at a respectful distance
The Lord talked a progressive talk to these  to full confidence in the Teachers instruction spoke thus to the Lord Excellent Lord  May the Lord accept us as layfollowers going for refuge from this day forth for as long as life lasts 
Then the Lord spoke thus to these men Do not you friends go by that road Go by this road and he sent them off by another road
Then those four men thinking Why are these two men so slow in coming   Then those eight men thinking  Then those sixteen men thinking Why are these eight men so slow in coming
May the Lord receive us as layfollowers going for refuge from this day forth for as long as life lasts 
Then the Lord spoke thus to these men Do not you friends go by that road Go by this road and he sent them off by another road
Then that one man approached Devadatta having approached he spoke thus to Devadatta Honoured sir I am not able to deprive that Lord of life that Lord is of great psychic power of great might 
All right friend do not you deprive the recluse Gotama of life
I myself will deprive the recluse Gotama of life
Now at that time the Lord was pacing up and down in the shade of Mount Vulture Peak
Then Devadatta having climbed Mount Vulture Peak hurled down a great stone thinking With this I will deprive the recluse Gotama of life
But two mountain peaks having met crushed that stone
and a fragment of it having fallen down drew blood on the Lords foot
Then the Lord having looked upwards spoke thus to Devadatta You have produced great demerit foolish man in that you with your mind malignant your mind on murder drew the Truthfinders blood
Then the Lord addressed the monks saying This monks is the first deed whose fruit comes with no delay accumulated by Devadatta since he with his mind malignant his mind on murder drew the Truthfinders blood 
Monks heard It is said that Devadatta schemed to murder the Lord
and so these monks paced up and down on every side of the Lords dwellingplace doing their studies together with a loud noise with a great noise for the protection defence and warding of the Lord
The Lord heard the loud noise the great noise the noise of studying
and hearing it he addressed the venerable nanda saying What on earth nanda is this loud noise this great noise this noise of studying 
Lord the monks heard that Devadatta schemed to murder the Lord
and so Lord these monks are pacing up and down  for the protection defence and warding of the Lord
This Lord is the loud noise the great noise the noise of studying 
Well now nanda address these monks in my name saying The Teacher is summoning the venerable ones 
Very well Lord and the venerable nanda having answered the Lord in assent approached those monks having approached he spoke thus to those monks The Teacher is summoning the venerable ones 
Very well your reverence and these monks having answered the venerable nanda in assent approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord they sat down at a respectful distance
The Lord spoke thus to these monks as they were sitting down at a respectful distance
This is impossible monks it cannot come to pass that anyone could deprive a Truthfinder of life by aggression
monks Truthfinders attain nibbāna not because of an attack
Monks there are these five teachers found in the world
What five
 and I do not expect protection from disciples in respect of knowledge and vision
This is impossible monks it cannot come to pass that anyone could deprive a Truthfinder of life by aggression
monks Truthfinders attain nibbāna not because of an attack
Go monks to your own dwellingplaces
Truthfinders monks do not need to be protected
Now at that time there was a fierce elephant in Rājagaha a manslayer called Nālāgiri
Then Devadatta having entered Rājagaha having gone to the elephant stable spoke thus to the mahouts We my good fellows are relations of the king We are competent to put in a high position one occupying a lowly position and to bring about an increase in food and wages
Well now good fellows when the recluse Gotama is coming along this carriage road then having let loose this elephant Nālāgiri bring him down this carriage road 
Very well honoured sir these mahouts answered Devadatta in assent
Then the Lord having dressed in the morning taking his bowl and robe entered Rājagaha for almsfood together with several monks
Then the Lord went along that carriage road
Then those mahouts saw the Lord coming along that carriageroad
seeing him having let loose the elephant Nālāgiri they brought him down that carriageroad
The elephant Nālāgiri saw the Lord coming from afar
seeing him having lifted up his trunk he rushed towards the Lord his ears and tail erect
Those monks saw the elephant Nālāgiri coming in the distance
seeing him they spoke thus to the Lord Lord this elephant Nālāgiri coming along this carriageroad is a fierce manslayer
Lord let the Lord turn back let the wellfarer turn back
Wait monks do not be afraid
this is impossible monks it cannot come to pass that anyone should deprive a Truthfinder of life by aggression
monks Truthfinders attain nibbāna not because of an attack
And a second time  And a third time these monks spoke thus to the Lord Lord this elephant Nālāgiri 
let the wellfarer turn back
Wait monks 
Truthfinders attain nibbāna not because of an attack
Now at that time people having mounted up on to the long houses and the curved houses and the roofs waited there
Those people who were of little faith not believing who were of poor intelligence these spoke thus This great recluse is indeed lovely he will be hurt by the bull elephant
But those people who had faith and were believing who were wise and intelligent these spoke thus Soon good sirs the bullelephant will come into conflict with the elephant  
Then the Lord suffused the elephant Nālāgiri with lovingkindness of mind
Then the elephant Nālāgiri suffused by the Lord with lovingkindness of mind having put down his trunk approached the Lord having approached he stood in front of the Lord
Then the Lord stroking the elephant Nālāgiris forehead with his right hand addressed the elephant Nālāgiri with verses
Do not elephant strike the elephant  for painful elephant is the striking of the elephant 
For there is no good bourn elephant for a slayer of the elephant when he is hence beyond
Be not proud be not wanton for the wanton reach not a good bourn
Only that should you do by which you will go to a good bourn 
Then the elephant Nālāgiri having taken the dust of the Lords feet with his trunk having scattered it over his head moved back bowing while he gazed upon the Lord
Then the elephant Nālāgiri having returned to the elephant stable stood in his own place
and it was in this way that the elephant Nālāgiri became tamed
Now at that time people sang this verse
Some are tamed by stick by goads and whips
The elephant was tamed by the great seer without a stick without a weapon 
People looked down upon criticised spread it about saying How evil is this Devadatta how inauspicious in that he tried to murder the recluse Gotama who is of such great psychic power of such great might
and Devadattas gains and honours declined
the Lords gains and honours increased
Now at that time Devadatta gains and honours lost ate with his friends having asked and asked among households
People looked down upon criticised spread it about saying How can these recluses sons of the Sakyans eat having asked and asked among households
Who is not fond of wellcooked things Who does not like sweet things 
Monks heard these people who  spread it about
Those who were modest monks  spread it about saying How can Devadatta eat with his friends having asked and asked among households 
They told this matter to the Lord He said Is it true as is said that you Devadatta ate with your friends having asked and asked among households 
It is true Lord  Having rebuked him having given reasoned talk he addressed the monks saying Well now monks I will lay down for monks the eating by a triad among householdsfounded on three reasons for the restraint of evilminded individuals for the living in comfort of well behaved monks lest those of evil desires should split the Order by means of a faction out of compassion for families
In eating a group meal one should be dealt with according to the rule 
Then Devadatta approached Kokālika Kaṭamorakatissaka the son of the lady Khaṇḍā and Samuddadatta having approached he spoke thus to Kokālika Kaṭamorakatissaka the son of the lady Khaṇḍā and Samuddadatta Come we your reverences will make a schism in the recluse Gotamas Order a breaking of the concord
When he had spoken thus Kokālika spoke thus to Devadatta But your reverence the recluse Gotama is of great psychic power of great might
How can we make a schism in the recluse Gotamas Order a breaking of the concord 
Come we your reverence having approached the recluse Gotama will ask for five items saying Lord the Lord in many a figure speaks in praise of desiring little of being contented of expunging  of being punctilious of what is gracious of decrease  of putting forth energy
Lord these five items are in many a way conducive to desiring little to contentment to expunging  to being punctilious to what is gracious to decrease  to putting forth energy
It were good Lord if the monks for as long as life lasted might be forestdwellers whoever should betake himself to the neighbourhood of a village sin would besmirch him
For as long as life lasts let them be beggars for alms whoever should accept an invitation sin would besmirch him
For as long as life lasts let them be ragrobe wearers whoever should accept a robe given by a householder sin would besmirch him
For as long as life lasts let them live at the root of a tree whoever should go under cover sin would besmirch him
For as long as life lasts let them not eat fish and flesh whoever should eat fish and flesh sin would besmirch him 
The recluse Gotama will not allow these
Then we will win over the people by means of these five items
It is possible your reverence with these five items to make a schism in the recluse Gotamas Order a breaking of the concord
For your reverence people esteem austerity 
Then Devadatta together with his friends approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord he sat down at a respectful distance
As he was sitting down at a respectful distance Devadatta spoke thus to the Lord Lord the Lord in many a figure speaks in praise of desiring little 
whoever should eat fish and flesh sin would besmirch him
Enough Devadatta he said
Whoever wishes let him be a forestdweller whoever wishes let him stay in the neighbourhood of a village
whoever wishes let him be a beggar for alms whoever wishes let him accept an invitation
whoever wishes let him be a ragrobe wearer whoever wishes let him accept a householders robes
For eight months Devadatta lodging at the root of a tree is permitted by me Fish and flesh are pure in respect of three points if they are not seen heard or suspected  
Then Devadatta thinking The Lord does not permit these five items joyful elated rising from his seat with his friends having greeted the Lord departed keeping his right side towards him
Then Devadatta having entered Rājagaha with his friends taught the people by means of the five items saying We friends having approached the recluse Gotama asked for five items saying Lord the Lord in many a figure speaks in praise of desiring little 
whoever should eat fish and flesh sin would besmirch him
The recluse Gotama does not allow these five items
but we live undertaking these five items
Those people who were there of little faith not believing who were of poor intelligence these spoke thus These recluses sons of the Sakyans are punctilious are expungers 
but the recluse Gotama is for abundance and strives after abundance
But those people who had faith and were believing who were wise and intelligent these looked down upon criticised spread it about saying How can this Devadatta go forward with a schism in the Lords Order with a breaking of the concord 
Monks heard these people who  spread it about
Those who were modest monks  spread it about saying How can this Devadatta go forward with a schism in the Order a breaking of the concord 
Then these monks told this matter to the Lord He said Is it true as is said that you Devadatta went forward with a schism in the Order a breaking of the concord 
It is true Lord 
Enough Devadatta
do not let there be a schism in the Order
for a schism in the Order is a serious matter Devadatta
Whoever Devadatta splits an Order that is united he sets up demerit that endures for an aeon he is boiled in hell for an aeon
but whoever Devadatta unites an Order that is split he sets up sublime merit he rejoices in heaven for an aeon
Enough Devadatta
do not let there be a schism in the Order
for a schism in the Order is a serious matter Devadatta 
Then the venerable nanda having dressed in the morning taking his bowl and robe entered Rājagaha for almsfood
Devadatta saw the venerable nanda walking in Rājagaha for almsfood
seeing him he approached the venerable nanda having approached he spoke thus to the venerable nanda Now from this day forth will I reverend nanda carry out Observance both in contradistinction to the Lord and in contradistinction to the Order of monks and will carry out acts of the Order
Then the venerable nanda having walked in Rājagaha for almsfood on returning from the almsround after his meal approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord he sat down at a respectful distance
As he was sitting down at a respectful distance the venerable nanda spoke thus to the Lord Just now Lord I having dressed in the morning taking my bowl and robe entered Rājagaha for almsfood
Devadatta Lord saw me walking in Rājagaha for almsfood
seeing me he came up having come up he spoke thus to me Now from this day forth will I  carry out acts of the Order
Today Lord Devadatta will split the Order 
Then the Lord having understood this matter at that time uttered this utterance
Easy is good for the good good for the evil is hard
Evil for the evil is easy evil for the noble ones is hard 
Told is the Second Portion for Repeating
Then Devadatta on that Observance day rising from his seat gave out voting tickets saying We your reverences having approached the recluse Gotama asked for five items 
The recluse Gotama does not allow these
but we live undertaking these five items
If these five items are pleasing to the venerable ones let each one take a voting ticket
Now at that time as many as five hundred monks Vajjis of Vesālī were newly ordained and were not properly versed
and these thinking This is the rule this is discipline this is the Teachers instruction took voting tickets
Then Devadatta having split the Order set out for Gayā Head taking as many as the five hundred monks
Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord they sat down at a respectful distance
As he was sitting down at a respectful distance the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus to the Lord Devadatta Lord having split the Order is setting out for Gayā Head with as many as five hundred monks 
Can there not be for you Sāriputta and Moggallāna compassion for these newly ordained monks
Go you along Sāriputta and Moggallāna before these monks fall into trouble and distress 
Very well Lord and Sāriputta and Moggallāna having answered the Lord in assent rising from their seats having greeted the Lord keeping their right sides towards him approached Gayā Head
Now at that time a certain monk was standing weeping not far from the Lord
Then the Lord spoke thus to that monk Why are you monk weeping 
Even those Lord who are the Lords chief disciplesSāriputta and Moggallānaeven these are going to Devadatta approving of Devadattas dhamma 
This is not possible monk it cannot come to pass that Sāriputta and Moggallāna should approve Devadattas dhamma They have merely gone so as to convince the monks 
Now at that time Devadatta surrounded by the large company was teaching dhamma sitting down
Then Devadatta saw Sāriputta and Moggallāna coming in the distance
seeing them he addressed the monks saying You see monks how well taught is dhamma by me that even these who are the recluse Gotamas chief disciplesSāriputta and Moggallānathat even these are coming to me
approving of my dhamma
When he had spoken thus Kokālika spoke thus to Devadatta Reverend Devadatta do not put your trust in Sāriputta and Moggallāna
Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires and are under the influence of evil desires 
Enough your reverence
let us give a welcome to these since they approve of my dhamma
The Devadatta invited the venerable Sāriputta to half his seat saying Come reverend Sāriputta sit here
No your reverence and the venerable Sāriputta having taken another seat sat down at a respectful distance
and the venerable Moggallāna too having taken another seat sat down at a respectful distance
Then Devadatta having gladdened rejoiced roused delighted the monks far into the night with talk on dhamma asked the venerable Sāriputta saying The Order of monks reverend Sāriputta is without sloth or drowsiness
may a talk on dhamma occur to you reverend Sāriputta for the monks My back aches and I will stretch it 
Very well your reverence the venerable Sāriputta answered Devadatta in assent
Then Devadatta having laid down his outer cloak folded in four lay down to sleep on his right side
and as he was tired forgetful and inattentive he fell asleep that very moment
Then the venerable Sāriputta exhorted instructed the monks with dhammatalk by means of an instruction on the wonders of thoughtreading
the venerable Moggallāna exhorted instructed the monks with dhammatalk by means of an instruction on the wonders of psychic power
Then as the monks were being exhorted instructed by the venerable Sāriputta with dhammatalk by means of an instruction on the wonders of thoughtreading were being exhorted instructed by the venerable Moggallāna with dhammatalk by means of an instruction on the wonders of psychic power dhammavision dustless stainless arose to them that whatever is of the nature to uprise all that is of the nature to stop
Then the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks saying We are going your reverences to the Lord
Whoever approves of this Lords dhamma let him come along
Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna taking those five hundred monks approached the Bamboo Grove
Then Kokālika wakened Devadatta saying Wake up reverend Devadatta those monks have been led away by Sāriputta and Moggallāna
Now did I not say to you reverend Devadatta Reverend Devadatta do not put your trust in Sāriputta and Moggallāna
Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires and are under the influence of evil desires
Then at that very place hot blood issued from Devadattas mouth
Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord they sat down at a respectful distance
As they were sitting down at a respectful distance the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus to the Lord It were well Lord if the monks who were partisans of the schismatics could be ordained again 
Be careful Sāriputta
about any reordination of monks who were partisans of the schismatics
But do you Sāriputta make the monks who were partisans of the schismatics confess a grave offence
But what line of conduct Sāriputta did Devadatta follow in regard to you 
Even Lord as the Lord having gladdened rejoiced roused delighted monks with dhammatalk far into the night he asked me The Order of monks Sāriputta is without sloth or drowsiness may a talk on dhamma occur to you Sāriputta for the monks My back aches and I will stretch it  Just this Lord was the line of conduct which Devadatta followed 
Then the Lord addressed the monks saying Formerly monks there was a great pond in a stretch of forest
bull elephants lived near it
and these having plunged into that pond having tugged out the lotus fibres and stalks with their trunks having washed them well and having chewed them free of mud swallowed them
Thus there came to be for them both beauty and strength
and not for this reason did they incur death or suffering like unto death
But monks among these great bull elephants were young elephant calves
and these imitating them having plunged into that pond having tugged out the lotus fibres and stalks with their trunks but not having washed them well having chewed them with the mud swallowed them
Thus there came to be for them neither beauty nor strength
and for this reason they incurred death or suffering like unto death
Likewise monks Devadatta will die a wretched creature copying me
While the great beast is shaking the earth grazing on lotus stalks keeping alert among the waters
Copying me the wretched creature will die like a calf having eaten mire
Monks a monk who is possessed of eight qualities is fit to go a message
What are the eight
Herein monks a monk is a hearer and one who makes others hear and a learner and an instructor and a knower and an expounder and one skilled in conformity and nonconformity and not a maker of quarrels Monks if a monk is possessed of these eight qualities he is fit to go a message
Monks because he is possessed of these eight qualities Sāriputta is fit to go a message
What are the eight
Herein monks Sāriputta is a learner  and not a maker of quarrels Monks because Sāriputta is possessed of these eight qualities he is fit to go a message
Who to some high assembled council come Wavers not
nor in discourse fails nor hides The teaching
nor speaks in doubtfulness And who being questioned is not agitated
A monk like this is fit to go a message
Monks Devadatta overcome and his mind controlled by eight wrong conditions is doomed to the Downfall to Niraya Hell staying there for an aeon incurable
What eight
Devadatta monks overcome and his mind controlled by gain is doomed to the Downfall  incurable Devadatta monks overcome and his mind controlled by lack of gain   by fame   by lack of fame   by honours   by lackof honours   by evil desire   by evil friendship is doomed to the Downfall  incurable Monks Devadatta overcome and his mind controlled by these eight wrong conditions is doomed to the Downfall to Niraya Hell staying there for an aeon incurable
Monks it is well that a monk should live constantly overcoming gain that has arisen lack of gain that has arisen fame that has arisen lack of fame that has arisen honours that have arisen lack of honours that has arisen evil desire that has arisen evil friendship that has arisen
And why monks for what good purpose should a monk live constantly overcoming gain  evil friendship that has arisen
Monks if a monk live not constantly overcoming gain that has arisen the cankers that are destructive and consuming may arise but if he lives constantly overcoming gain that has arisen then it follows that the cankers that are destructive and consuming will not be in him
 if he lives constantly overcoming evil friendship that has arisen then it follows that the cankers destructive and consuming will not be in him
It is for this good purpose monks that a monk should live constantly overcoming gain that has arisen  evil friendship that has arisen
Wherefore monks saying We will live constantly overcoming gain that has arisen  evil friendship that has arisenthus it is that you monks should train
Monks Devadatta overcome and his mind controlled by three wrong conditions is doomed to the Downfall to Niraya Hell staying there for an aeon incurable
What three
Evil desire evil friendship the coming to a halt midway in his career because his special attainments are of trifling value Monks a monk who is overcome  by these three wrong conditions is  incurable
Never let anyone of evil desires arise in the world
And know it by this as the bourn of those of evil desires
Known as sage held as one who made the self become
Devadatta stood shining as with fameI heard tell
He falling into recklessness assailing the Truthfinder
Attained Avīci Hell fourdoored frightful
For he who would injure one without hatred not doing an evil deed
That evil touches only him of mind of hate contemptuous
Who should think to pollute the sea with pot of poison
He would not pollute it with that for sublime is the great ocean
So he who with abuse afflicts the Truthfinder
Who has rightly gone his mind tranquilon him the abuse has no effect
A wise man should make a friend of such a one and follow him
A monk following the way of him should achieve destruction of ill 
Then the venerable Upāli approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord he sat down at a respectful distance
As he was sitting down at a respectful distance the venerable Upāli spoke thus to the Lord Lord as to the words Dissension in an Order dissension in an Order
to what extent Lord is there dissension in an Order but not schism in an Order
And then to what extent is there dissension in an Order as well as schism in an Order
If Upāli there is one on one side and two on another and if a fourth speaks out and offers a voting ticket saying This is the rule this is discipline this is the Teachers instruction take this  approve of this
this Upāli is dissension in an Order but not schism in an Order
If Upāli there are two on one side and two on another and if a fifth speaks out 
two on one side and three on another and if a sixth speaks out 
three on one side and three on another and if a seventh speaks out 
three on one side and four on another and if an eighth speaks out and offers a voting ticket saying This is the rule this is discipline this is the Teachers instruction take this  approve of this
this Upāli is dissension in an Order but not schism in an Order
If Upāli there are four on one side and four on another and a ninth speaks out 
this Upāli is dissension in an Order as well as schism in an Order
Dissension in an Order Upāli as well as schism in an Order is nine or more than nine
Upāli a nun does not split an Order even if she goes forward with a schism a probationer  a novice  a woman novice  a layfollower  a woman layfollower does not split an Order even if she goes forward with a schism
Only a regular monk Upāli belonging to the same communion staying within the same boundary splits an Order 
Lord as to the words Schism in an Order schism in an Order
to what extent Lord can an Order become split 
As to this Upāli monks explain non dhamma as dhamma they explain dhamma as nondhamma they explain nondiscipline as discipline they explain discipline as nondiscipline they explain what was not spoken not uttered by the Truthfinder as spoken uttered by the Truthfinder they explain what was spoken uttered by the Truthfinder as not spoken not uttered by the Truthfinder they explain what was not practised by the Truthfinder as practised by the Truthfinder they explain what was practised by the Truthfinder as not practised by the Truthfinder they explain what was not laid down by the Truthfinder as laid down by the Truthfinder they explain what was laid down by the Truthfinder as not laid down by the Truthfinder they explain what is no offence as an offence they explain an offence as no offence they explain a slight offence as a serious offence they explain a serious offence as a slight offence they explain an offence that can be done away with as an offence that cannot be done away with they explain an offence that cannot be done away with as an offence that can be done away with they explain a bad offence as not a bad offence they explain not a bad offence as a bad offence
These in regard to these eighteen points draw away and separate  they carry out a separate Observance they carry out a separate Invitation they carry out a separate act of the Order
To this extent Upāli does an Order become split 
Lord as to the words Harmony in an Order harmony in an Order
to what extent Lord does an Order come to be harmonious 
As to this Upāli monks explain nondhamma as nondhamma they explain dhamma as dhamma  they explain not a bad offence as not a bad offence
These in regard to these eighteen points do not draw away do not separate  they do not carry out a separate Observance they do not carry out a separate Invitation they do not carry out a separate act of the Order
To this extent Upāli an Order comes to be harmonious 
But Lord having split an Order that was harmonious what does he set up 
Now Upāli having split an Order that was harmonious he sets up demerit that endures for an aeon and he is boiled in hell for an aeon
A schismatic in the Order doomed to the Downfall to Niraya Hell for an aeon
To disharmony prone standing on nondhamma falls away from peace from bondage
Having split an harmonious Order he boils for an aeon in hell 
But Lord having united an Order that was split what does he set up 
Now Upāli having united an Order that was split he sets up sublime merit and he rejoices in heaven for an aeon
Blessed is harmony for an Order and the friend of those who are harmonious
To harmony prone standing on dhamma falls not away from peace from bondage
Making an Order harmonious he rejoices for an aeon in heaven
Now could it not be Lord that a schismatic in the Order is doomed to the Downfall to Niraya Hell remaining there for an aeon incurable 
It could be Upāli that a schismatic in the Order is doomed to the Downfall  incurable 
But could it be Lord that a schismatic in the Order is not doomed to the Downfall not to Niraya Hell not remaining there for an aeon not incurable 
It could be Upāli that a schismatic in the Order is not doomed to the Downfall  not incurable 
But which schismatic in an Order Lord is doomed to the Downfall to Niraya Hell remaining there for an aeon incurable 
This is a case Upāli where a monk explains non dhamma as dhamma
if he has the view that in this there is nondhamma if he has the view that in schism there is nondhamma misrepresenting opinion misrepresenting approval misrepresenting pleasure misrepresenting intention and if he speaks out and offers a voting ticket saying This is rule this is discipline this is the Teachers instruction take this  approve of this
this schismatic in the Order Upāli is doomed to the Downfall to Niraya Hell remaining there for an aeon incurable
And again Upāli if a monk explains nondhamma as dhamma
if he has the view that in this there is nondhamma if he has the view that in schism there is dhamma misrepresenting opinion 
incurable
And again Upāli if he explains nondhamma as dhamma
if he has the view that in this there is nondhamma if he is doubtful as to a schism 
if he has the view that in this there is dhamma if he has the view that in schism there is nondhamma 
if he has the view that in this there is dhamma if he is doubtful as to a schism 
if he is doubtful as to this  if he has the view that in schism there is nondhamma 
if he is doubtful as to this  if he has the view that in schism there is dhamma 
if he is doubtful as to this  if he is doubtful as to a schism misrepresenting opinion 
incurable 
But which schismatic in the Order Lord is not doomed to the Downfall nor to Niraya Hell not remaining there for an aeon not incurable 
This is a case Upāli where a monk explains nondhamma as dhamma
if he has the view that in this there is dhamma if he has the view that in schism there is dhamma yet not misrepresenting opinion not misrepresenting approval not misrepresenting pleasure not misrepresenting intention he speaks out and offers a voting ticket saying This is rule this is discipline this is the Teachers instruction take this  approve of this
even this schismatic in the Order Upāli is not doomed to the Downfall not doomed to Niraya Hell not remaining there for an aeon not incurable
And again Upāli a monk explains dhamma as nondhamma  explains a not bad offence as a bad offence
but he has the view that in this there is dhamma the view that in schism there is dhamma yet not misrepresenting opinion 
not incurable 
Told is the Third Portion for Repeating
Told is the Seventh Section that on Schism in an Order
Then the Gracious One having dwelt at Gayās Head for as long as he liked left on walking tour for Rājagaha together with a great Community of monks with a thousand monks all of whom were formerly yogis
Then the Gracious One walking gradually on walking tour went and entered Rājagaha
There the Gracious One dwelt near Rājagaha by the Suppatiṭṭha Shrine in the Palmyra Wood
The Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra heard The ascetic Gotama the Sakyan Son who has gone forth from the Sakya family has arrived in Rājagaha and is dwelling near Rājagaha by the Suppatiṭṭha Shrine in the Palmyra Garden
But about that Gracious One Gotama this beautiful report has gone round Such is he the Gracious One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha the one endowed with understanding and good conduct the Fortunate One the one who understands the worlds the unsurpassed guide for those people who need taming the Teacher of gods and men the Buddha the Gracious One 
This world with its gods Māra and Brahmā this generation with its ascetics and brāhmaṇas princes and men he makes known after gaining deep knowledge for himself
He teaches the Dhamma good in the beginning good in the middle good in the end with its meaning with its phrasing and explains the spiritual life which is complete full and pure
But the sight of such Worthy Ones is good 
Then the Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra surrounded by twelve myriads of brāhmaṇas and householders from Magadha approached the Gracious One and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One he sat down at one side
Of those twelve myriads of brāhmaṇas and householders from Magadha some after worshipping the Gracious One sat down on one side Some exchanged greetings with the Gracious One and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings sat down on one side Some after raising their hands in respectful salutation to the Gracious One sat down on one side Some after announcing their name and family to the Gracious One sat down on one side Some while keeping silent sat down on one side
Then this occurred to those twelve myriads of brāhmaṇas and householders from Magadha How is it does the Great Ascetic live the spiritual life under Uruvelakassapa or does Uruvelakassapa live the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic 
Then the Gracious One knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in the minds of the Magadhan brāhmaṇas and householders addressed the venerable Uruvelakassapa with a verse
Having seen what did you one of Uruvelā Who spoke of austerity give up the sacrificial fire
I ask you the reason for this Kassapa Why did you give up the fire sacrifice 
The sacrifices speak of forms sounds
And also tastes sensuality and women
Having understood that in the attachments this is a stain
I therefore take no delight in offerings and sacrifices 
If your mind takes no delight Kassapa said the Gracious One
In forms sounds and also tastes
Then where in the world with its gods and men
Does your mind take delight Kassapa speak about this 
Having seen the state of peace free of attachments
 nothingness unattached to the sensual realm
The Unchangeable unknown to others
I therefore take no delight in offerings and sacrifices 
Then the venerable Uruvelakassapa after rising from his seat arranging his outer robe on one shoulder and falling with his head at the feet of the Gracious One said to the Gracious One  The Gracious One is my Teacher venerable Sir I am his disciple the Gracious One is my Teacher venerable Sir I am his disciple
Then this occurred to those twelve myriads of brāhmaṇas and householders from Magadha Uruvelakassapa lives the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic 
Then the Gracious One knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in the minds of the Magadhan brāhmaṇas and householders spoke about the gradual teaching to them that is to say talk about giving talk about virtue talk about heaven the danger degradation and defilement of sensual desires and the advantages of renunciation he explained
When the Gracious One knew that they had ready minds pliable minds open minds uplifted minds confident minds he explained to them the Dhamma teaching the Awakened Ones have discovered themselves Suffering Origination Cessation Path
Just as it is known that a clean cloth without a stain will take the dye well just so to eleven myriads of the Magadhan brāhmaṇas and householders  with Bimbisāra at their head on that very seat the dustfree stainless VisionoftheDhamma arose Whatever has the nature of arising all that has the nature of ceasing 
and one myriad made known their state as layfollowers
Then the Māgadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra having seen the Dhamma attained the Dhamma understood the Dhamma penetrated the Dhamma crossed over uncertainty being without doubts having attained full confidence having become independent of others in the Teachers teaching said this to the Gracious One Formerly venerable Sir when I was a boy I had five wishes which are fulfilled for me now
Formerly venerable Sir when I was a boy this occurred to me Oh may I be anointed in the Kingdom  this was my first wish venerable Sir which has been fulfilled for me now
May a Worthy One a Perfect Sambuddha enter into my realm  this was my second wish venerable Sir which has been fulfilled for me now
May I attend on that Gracious One  this was my third wish venerable Sir which has been fulfilled for me now
May that Gracious One teach me the Dhamma  this was my fourth wish venerable Sir which has been fulfilled for me now
May I understand that Gracious Ones Dhamma  this was my fifth wish venerable Sir which has been fulfilled for me now
Formerly venerable Sir when I was a boy I had these five wishes and these I am successful in now
Excellent venerable Sir Excellent venerable Sir Just as venerable Sir one might set upright what has been overturned or open up what has been closed or show a path to one who is lost or carry an oil lamp into the darkness  those with vision will see forms just so has the Dhamma been explained by the Gracious One in countless ways
I go venerable Sir to the Gracious One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Community of monks
Please bear it in mind Gracious One that I am a lay follower who has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as I have the breath of life May the Gracious One consent reverend Sir to me a meal on the morrow together with the Community of monks 
The Gracious One consented by maintaining silence
Then the Māgadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra having understood the Gracious Ones consent after rising from his seat worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One went away
Now while Venerable Sāriputta was in seclusion he thought this For which Buddhas for which Masters did the spiritual life not last long For which Buddhas for which Masters did the spiritual life last long 
Then in the evening Venerable Sāriputta came out of seclusion and approached the Master He paid homage to him sat down to one side
and said this Just now Master as I was in seclusion I thought this For which Buddhas 
last long
Sāriputta the spiritual life established by Master Vipassī Master Sikhī and Master Vesabhū did not last long
But the spiritual life established by Master Kakusandha Master Konāgamana and Master Kassapa did last long 
And what Master is the reason why the spiritual life established by Master Vipassī Master Sikhī and Master Vesabhū did not last long 
Sāriputta Master Vipassī Master Sikhī and Master Vessabhū were disinclined to teach the Dhamma in detail to their disciples
They had few discourses in prose and in prose and verse few expositions verses inspired utterances quotationsbirthstoriesamazing accounts and analyses
and training rules were not laid down
and a Pātimokkha was not recited
After the disappearance of those Buddhas those Masters after the disappearance of the disciples enlightened under those Buddhasthose who were the last disciplesof various names clans and social strata who had gone forth from various familiescaused that spiritual life rapidly to disappear
It is just like various flowers lying on a flat piece of wood without being tied together by a thread are scattered about whirled about and destroyed by the wind
Why is that
Because they are not held together by a thread
Even so at the disappearance of those Buddhas those Masters at the disappearance of the disciples enlightened under those Buddhas those who were the last disciplesof various names clans and social strata who had gone forth from various familiescaused that spiritual life rapidly to disappear
Instead those Masters were untiring in exhorting their disciples after reading their minds with their own
Formerly Sāriputta while staying in a certain frightening jungle thicket Master Vessabhū the arahant the fully Awakened One exhorted and admonished a Sangha of a thousand monks reading their minds with his own saying Think like this not like this pay attention like this not like this forsake this having attained this abide in it
 Then when those thousand monks had been exhorted and admonished by Master Vessabhū the arahant the fully Awakened One their minds were freed from the corruptions without grasping
But if anyone not devoid of desire should enter that frightening junglethicket usually their hair would stand on end
This is the reason why the spiritual life established by Master Vipassī Master Sikhī and Master Vesabhū did not last long 
But what Master is the reason why the spiritual life established by Master Kakusandha Master Konāgamana and Master Kassapa lasted long 
Sāriputta Master Kakusandha Master Konāgamana and Master Kassapa were diligent in teaching the Dhamma in detail to their disciples
They had many discourses in prose and in prose and in verse many expositions verses inspired utterances quotations birth stories amazing accounts and analyses and training rules for their disciples were laid down and a Pātimokkha was recited
At the disappearance of those Buddhas those Masters at the disappearance of the disciples who were enlightened under those Buddhas those who were the last disciplesof various names clans and social strata who had gone forth from various familiesestablished that spiritual life for a long time
It is just like various flowers lying on a piece of wood but being well tied together by a thread are not scattered about whirled about or destroyed by the wind
Why is that
Because they are well tied together by the thread
Even so at the disappearance of those Buddhas those Masters at the disappearance of the disciples who were enlightened under those Buddhas those who were the last disciplesof various names clans and social strata who had gone forth from various familiesestablished that spiritual life for a long time
This is the reason why the spiritual life established by Master Kakusandha Master Konāgamana and Master Kassapa lasted long 
Then Venerable Sāriputta got up from his seat put his robe over one shoulder put the palms of his hands together and said to the Master This is the right time Master
to lay down training rules and recite a Pātimokkha so that this spiritual life may persist and last for a long time 
Hold on Sāriputta
the Tathāgata will know the right time for that
The teacher does not lay down training rules for his disciples and recite a Pātimokkha until the causes of corruption appear in the Sangha
And they do not appear until the Sangha has attained long standing
great size
great learning
But when this happens then the Teacher lays down training rules for his disciples and recites a Pātimokkha in order to ward off those causes of corruptions
Sāriputta the Sangha of monks is devoid of immorality devoid of danger stainless purified established in the essence
The most backward of these five hundred monks is a streamenterer not liable to be reborn in any state of misery assured bound for awakening
At one time the enlightened one the Lord was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time several monks friends and associates entered on the rains in a certain residence in the Kosala country
Then it occurred to these monks Now by what means can we all together on friendly terms and harmonious spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of almsfood 
Then it occurred to these monks If we should neither address one another nor converse but whoever should return first from the village for almsfood should make ready a seat should put out water for the feet a footstool a footstand having washed a refusebowl should set it out should set out drinking water and water for washing Whoever should return last from the village for almsfood if there should be the remains of a meal and if he should so desire he may eat them but if he does not so desire he may throw them away where there is but little green grass or he may drop them into water where there are no living creatures he should put up the seat he should put away the water for the feet the footstool the footstand he should put away the refusebowl having washed it he should put away the drinking water and the water for washing he should sweep the refectory Whoever should see a vessel for drinking water or a vessel for washing water or a vessel for rinsing after evacuation void and empty should set out  if it is impossible for him he should set out by signalling with his hand having invited a companion by a movement of his hand but he should not for such a reason break into speech Thus may we all together on friendly terms and harmonious spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of almsfood 
Then these monks neither addressed one another nor conversed
Whoever returned first from the village for almsfood made ready a seat put out water for the feet a footstool a footstand set out a refusebowl having washed it set out drinking water and water for washing
Whoever returned last from the village for almsfood if there were the remains of a meal ate them if he so desired if he did not so desire he threw them away where there was but little green grass or he dropped them into water where there were no living creatures he put up the seat he put away the water for the feet the footstool the footstand he put away the refusebowl having washed it he put away the drinking water and the water for washing he swept the refectory
Whoever saw a vessel for drinking water or a vessel for washing water or a vessel for rinsing after evacuation void and empty set out water
If it was impossible for him he set out water by signalling with his hand having by a movement of his hand invited a companion  but not for such a reason did he break into speech
Now it was the custom for monks who had kept the rains to go and see the Lord
Then these monks having kept the rains at the end of the three months packed away their lodgings and taking their bowls and robes set out for Sāvatthī
In due course they approached Sāvatthī the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery and the Lord Having approached having greeted the Lord they sat down at a respectful distance
Now it is the custom for awakened ones for Lords to exchange friendly greetings with incoming monks
Then the Lord spoke thus to these monks I hope that you were well monks I hope that you kept going I hope that all together on friendly terms and harmonious you passed a comfortable rainy season and did not go short of almsfood
We were well Lord we kept going Lord
and we Lord all together on friendly terms and harmonious passed a comfortable rainy season and did not go short of almsfood 
Now Truthfinders ask knowing and knowing do not ask
they ask knowing the right time  and they do not ask knowing the right time 
Truthfinders ask about what belongs to the goal not about what does not belong to the goal
there is bridgebreaking for Truthfinders in whatever does not belong to the goal
In two ways do awakened ones Lords question monks either Shall we teach dhamma or Shall we lay down a rule of training for disciples
Then the Lord spoke thus to these monks But in what way did you monks all together on friendly terms and harmonious spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of almsfood
In that connection did we Lord several friends and associates enter on the rains in a certain residence in the Kosala country
Then it occurred to us Lord Now by what means can we all together on friendly terms and harmonious spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of almsfood
 Then it occurred to us Lord If we should neither address one another  Thus could we all together on friendly terms and harmonious spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of almsfood
 So we Lord neither addressed one another nor conversed
Whoever returned first from the village for almsfood made ready a seat  but not for such a reason did he break into speech
Thus did we Lord all together on friendly terms and harmonious spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of almsfood
Then the Lord addressed the monks saying Indeed monks these foolish men having spent an uncomfortable time pretend to have spent an equally comfortable time
Indeed monks these foolish men having spent communion like beasts pretend to have spent an equally comfortable time
Indeed  like sheep pretend to have spent an equally comfortable time
Indeed  having spent communion in indolence pretend to have spent an equally comfortable time
How monks can these foolish men observe an observance of members of sects the practice of silence
It is not monks for pleasing those who are not pleased  Having rebuked them having given reasoned talk he addressed the monks saying  Monks an observance of members of other sects the practice of silence should not be observed
Whoever should observe it there is an offence of wrongdoing
I allow monks monks who have kept the rains to invite in regard to three matters what has been seen or heard or suspected
That will be what is suitable for you in regard to one another a removal of offences an aiming at the discipline
And thus monks should one invite
The Order should be informed by an experienced competent monk saying
Honoured sirs let the Order listen to me
Today is an Invitation day
If it seems right to the Order the Order may invite
 A monk who is an elder having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder having sat down on his haunches having saluted with joined palms should speak to it thus Your reverences I invite the Order in respect of what has been seen or heard or suspected
Let the venerable ones speak to me out of compassion
and seeing I will make amends
And a second time 
And a third time your reverences I invite the Order in respect of what has been seen or heard or suspected
Let the venerable ones speak to me out of compassion
and seeing I will make amends
 A newly ordained monk having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder  having saluted with joined palms should speak to it thus Honoured sirs I invite the Order in respect of what has been seen 
And a second time  And a third time 
and seeing I will make amends
Now at that time the group of six monks remained on seats while monks who were elders sitting down on their haunches were themselves inviting
Those who were modest monks  spread it about saying How can this group of six monks remain on seats while monks who are elders sitting down on their haunches are themselves inviting
 Then these monks told this matter to the Lord He said Is it true as is said monks that the group of six monks remained on seats  were themselves inviting 
It is true Lord
The awakened one the Lord rebuked them saying How monks can these foolish men remain on seats  are themselves inviting
It is not monks for pleasing those who are not pleased  And having rebuked them having given reasoned talk he addressed the monks saying Monks you should not remain on seats while monks who are elders sitting down on their haunches are themselves inviting
I allow you monks to invite while each and every one is sitting down on his haunches
Now at that time a certain elder feeble with age thinking Until all have invited while sitting down on his haunches and waiting fell down in a faint
They told this matter to the Lord
He said I allow you monks to sit down on his haunches during the period until he invites and having invited to sit down on a seat
Now at that time many distinguished Licchavis sitting together assembled in a motehall were in many a figure speaking praise of the awakened one praise of dhamma praise of the Order
Now at that time the general Sīha a disciple of the Jains came to be sitting in that company
Then it occurred to the general Sīha Undoubtedly this will be a Lord a perfected one a wholly awakened one since these distinguished Licchavis sitting together assembled in the motehall are in many a figure speaking praise of the awakened one praise of dhamma praise of the Order
Suppose I were to go up to see this Lord perfected one wholly awakened one 
Then the general Sīha approached Nātaputta the Jain having approached he spoke thus to Nataputta the Jain I want honoured sir to go along to see the recluse Gotama 
But how can you Sīha being one who asserts an ought tobedone go along to see the recluse Gotama who asserts an oughtnottobedone
For Sīha the recluse Gotama asserts an oughtnottobedone he teaches a doctrine of an oughtnottobedone and in that he trains disciples
Then that which had been the strong aspiration of general Sīha for going to see the Lord abated
Then a second time did the distinguished Licchavis sitting together assembled in the motehall 
And a second time did it occur to the general Sīha Undoubtedly this will be a Lord a perfected one 
Suppose I were to go up to see this Lord perfected one wholly awakened one
And a second time did the general Sīha approach Nātaputta the Jain 
and in that trains disciples
And a second time did that abate which had been the strong aspiration of the general Siha for going to see the Lord
And a third time it occurred to the general Sīha Undoubtedly this will be a Lord perfected one wholly awakened one since these distinguished Licchavis sitting together assembled in the motehall are in many a figure speaking praise of the awakened one praise of dhamma praise of the Order
What can these Jains do to me whether I have asked for permission or have not asked for permission
Suppose that I although I have not asked for permission from the Jains were to go along to see this Lord perfected one wholly awakened one 
Then the general Sīha with some five hundred chariots departed from Vesālī in broad daylight to see the Lord
Having gone by vehicle as far as the ground was for a vehicle having alighted from the vehicle he approached the Lord on foot having approached having greeted the Lord he sat down at a respectful distance
As he was sitting down at a respectful distance general Sīha spoke thus to the Lord Lord I have heard this The recluse Gotama affirms an oughtnottobedone he teaches a doctrine of an oughtnottobedone and in that trains disciples
I assume that these Lord who say The recluse Gotama affirms an oughtnottobedone  and in that trains disciples
are Lord asserting what the Lord affirms and are not misrepresenting the Lord by what is not fact but are putting forth a doctrine which conforms to his doctrine I assume that no one who is his fellow dhammaman a holder of his views comes to a position incurring blame
Indeed we Lord do not want to misrepresent the Lord 
There is Sīha a way in which one speaking truly of me could say The recluse Gotama asserts an oughtnottobedone he teaches a doctrine of an oughtnottobedone and in this he trains disciples
 There is Sīha a way in which one speaking truly of me could say The recluse Gotama asserts an oughttobedone  trains disciples
 There is Sīha a way in which one speaking truly of me could say The recluse Gotama asserts annihilation  trains disciples
 There is Sīha a way in which one speaking truly of me could say The recluse Gotama is one who detests he teaches a doctrine of detestation and in this he trains disciples
 There is Sīha a way in which one speaking truly of me could say The recluse Gotama is a leader away he teaches a doctrine of leading away and in this he trains disciples
 There is Sīha a way in which one speaking truly of me could say The recluse Gotama is a burner up he teaches a doctrine of burning up and in this he trains disciples
 There is Sīha a way in which one speaking truly of me could say The recluse Gotama is not destined to another becoming he teaches a doctrine of no other kind of becoming and in this he trains disciples
There is Sīha a way in which one speaking truly of me could say The recluse Gotama is confident he teaches a doctrine of confidence and in this he trains disciples 
And what Sīha is the way in which one speaking truly of me could say The recluse Gotama is one who asserts an oughtnottobedone he teaches a doctrine of an oughtnottobedone and in this he trains disciples
Indeed I Sīha assert of misconduct in body speech and thought that it ought not to be done I assert of manifold evil and wrong states that they ought not to be done
This is the way Sīha in which one speaking truly of me could say The recluse Gotama asserts what oughtnottobedone he teaches a doctrine of what oughtnottobedone and in this he trains disciples 
And what Sīha is the way in which one  could say The recluse Gotama asserts what oughttobedone  trains disciples
Indeed I Sīha assert of good conduct in body speech and thought that it ought to be done of manifold right states that they ought to be done
This is the way Sīha 
And what Sīha is the way in which one  could say The recluse Gotama asserts annihilation  trains disciples
Indeed I Sīha assert the annihilation of passion hatred stupidity I assert the annihilation of manifold evil and wrong states 
This is the way Sīha 
And what Sīha is the way in which one  could say The recluse Gotama is one who detests he teaches a doctrine of detestation and in this he trains disciples
Indeed Sīha I detest misconduct in body speech and thought I teach a doctrine of detestation for entering upon manifold evil wrong states 
This is the way Sīha 
And what Sīha is the way in which one  could say The recluse Gotama is one who is a leader away he teaches a doctrine of leading away and in this he trains disciples
Indeed I Sīha teach a doctrine of the leading away of passion hatred stupidity I teach a doctrine of the leading away of manifold evil wrong states 
This is the way Sīha 
And what Sīha is the way in which one  could say The recluse Gotama is one who is a burnerup he teaches a doctrine of burning up and in this he trains disciples
Indeed I Sīha speak of evil wrong states which are searing misconduct in body speech and thought
He for whom Sīha evil wrong states that axe searing are destroyed cut off at the root made like a palmtree so utterly done away with that they can come to no future existencehim I call one who is a burnerup
For a Truthfinder Sīha evil wrong states that are searing  existence
This is the way Sīha in which one  could say The recluse Gotama is one who is a burnerup he teaches a doctrine of burningup and in this he trains disciples 
And what Sīha is the way in which one  could say The recluse Gotama is one who is not destined to another becoming he teaches a doctrine of no other becoming and in this he trains disciples
He for whom Sīha future conception in a womb becoming again and rebirth are destroyed cut off at the root made like a palmtree so utterly done away with that they can come to no future existencehim I call one not destined to another becoming
For a Truthfinder Sīha future conception  can come to no future existence
This is the way Sīha 
And what Sīha is the way in which one speaking truly of me could say The recluse Gotama is one who is confident he teaches a doctrine of confidence and in this he trains disciples
Indeed I Sīha am confident with the highest confidence I teach a doctrine of confidence and in this I train disciples
This is the way Sīha in which one speaking truly of me could say The recluse Gotama is confident he teaches a doctrine of confidence and in this he trains disciples 
And when he had spoken thus Sīha the general spoke thus to the Lord Excellent Lord Excellent Lord  May the Lord accept me as a layfollower going for refuge from this day forth for as long as life lasts 
Now Sīha make a proper investigation Proper investigation is good in the case of wellknown men like yourself 
I Lord am even exceedingly pleased satisfied with that which the Lord said to me Now Sīha make a proper investigation  like yourself
 For if Lord members of other sects had secured me as a disciple they would have paraded a banner all round Vesālī saying Sīha the general has joined our disciplehood
 But then the Lord spoke to me thus Now Sīha make a proper investigation  like yourself
 So I Lord go for a second time to the Lord for refuge and to dhamma and to the Order of monks
May the Lord accept me as a layfollower going for refuge from this day forth for as long as life lasts 
For a long time Sīha your family has been a wellspring to the Nigaṇṭhas You will bethink you to give alms to those who approach you
 I Lord am even exceedingly pleased satisfied with that which the Lord said to me For a long time Sīha your family  those who approach you
I have heard Lord The recluse Gotama speaks thus Gifts should be given to me only not to others should gifts be given gifts should be given to my disciples only not to the disciples of others should gifts be given What is given to me is alone of great fruit what is given to others is not of great fruit what is given to my disciples is alone of great fruit what is given to the disciples of others is not of great fruit
 But then the Lord urged upon me giving to the Nigaṇṭhas too
Indeed Lord we shall know the right time for that
So I Lord go for a third time to the Lord for refuge and to dhamma and to the Order of monks
May the Lord accept me as a layfollower going for refuge from this day forth for as long as life lasts 
Then the Lord talked a progressive talk to Sīha the general that is to say talk on giving talk on moral habit talk on heaven he explained the peril the vanity the depravity of pleasures of the senses the advantage in renouncing  When the Lord knew that the mind of Siha the general was ready malleable devoid of the hindrances uplifted pleased then he explained to him that teaching on dhamma which the awakened ones have themselves discovered ill uprising stopping the Way And as a clean cloth without black specks will easily take dye even so as he was on that very seat dhammavision dustless stainless arose to Sīha the general that whatever is of the nature to uprise all that is of the nature to stop Then Sīha the general as one who had seen dhamma attained dhamma known dhamma plunged into dhamma who had crossed over doubt put away uncertainty who had attained without anothers help to full confidence in the teachers instruction spoke thus to the Lord Lord may the Lord consent to a meal with me on the morrow together with the Order of monks
 The Lord consented by becoming silent
Then Sīha the general having understood the Lords consent rising from his seat departed keeping his right side towards him
Then Sīha the general enjoined a certain man saying Go good fellow find out if there is meat to hand
 Then Sīha the general towards the end of that night having had sumptuous food solid and soft prepared had the time announced to the Lord saying It is time Lord the meal is ready
 Then the Lord having dressed in the morning taking his bowl and robe approached the dwelling of Sīha the general having approached he sat down on the appointed seat together with the Order of monks
Now at that time many Nigaṇṭhas waving their arms were moaning from carriage road to carriage road from cross road to cross road in Vesālī Today a fat beast killed by Sīha the general is made into a meal for the recluse Gotama the recluse Gotama makes use of this meat knowing that it was killed on purpose  that the deed was for his sake
 Then a certain man approached Sīha the general having approached he whispered into Sīha the generals ear Please honoured sir you should know that many of these Nigaṇṭhas waying their arms are moaning from carriage road to carriage road from cross road to cross road in Vesālī Today a fat beast  the deed was for his sake 
Enough master for a long time now these venerable ones have been desiring dispraise of the awakened one have been desiring dispraise of dhamma have been desiring dispraise of the Order But these venerable ones bad vain lying do not harm this Lord because they are misrepresenting him by what is not factwhy even we for the sake of our livelihood would not intentionally deprive a living thing of life 
Then Sīha the general having with his own hand served and satisfied the Order of monks with the enlightened one at its head with sumptuous food solid and soft when the Lord had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from his bowl sat down at a respectful distance
Then the Lord having gladdened rejoiced roused delighted Sīha the general with talk on dhamma as he was sitting down at a respectful distance rising from his seat departed
Then the Lord on this occasion having given reasoned talk addressed the monks saying  Monks one should not knowingly make use of meat killed on purpose 
Whoever should make use of it there is an offence of wrongdoing
I allow you monks fish and meat that are quite pure in three respects if they are not seen heard suspected 
At that time the awakened one the Lord was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time as many as thirty monks of Pāvā all forestdwellers all almsmen all wearers of ragrobes all wearers of the three robes going to Sāvatthī so as to see the Lord when the beginning of the rains was approaching were unable to reach Sāvatthī for the beginning of the rains they entered upon the rains on the way at Sāketa
They spent the rains in a state of longing thinking The Lord is staying close to us six yojanas from here but we are not getting a chance to see the Lord 
Then these monks having after the lapse of three months kept the rains after the Invitation had been carried out while the god was raining while waters were gathering while swamps were forming with drenched robes and in a state of weariness approached Sāvatthī the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord they sat down at a respectful distance
Now it is the custom for awakened ones for Lords to exchange friendly greetings with incoming monks
So the Lord spoke thus to these monks I hope monks that things went well with you I hope you had enough to support life I hope that in unity being on friendly terms and harmonious you spent a comfortable rainy season and did not go short of almsfood 
Things did go well with us Lord we had enough to support life Lord and in unity we Lord being on friendly terms and harmonious spent the rainy season and did not go short of almsfood
Here are we Lord as many as thirty monks of Pāvā coming to Sāvatthī so as to see the Lord when the beginning of the rains was approaching we were unable to reach Sāvatthī for the beginning of the rains we entered on the rains on the way at Sāketa
We spent the rains Lord in a state of longing for you thinking The Lord is staying close to us six yojanas from here but we are not getting a chance to see the Lord
Then we Lord having after the lapse of three months kept the rains and after the Invitation had been carried out while the god was raining while waters were gathering while swamps were forming with drenched robes and in a state of weariness came along on the journey 
Then the Lord on this occasion having given dhammatalk addressed the monks saying I allow you monks to make up kaṭhinacloth when monks have completed the rains
Five will be allowable to you monks when the kaṭhinacloths have been made up going without having asked for permission walking not taking the three robes a groupmeal a as many robes as you require and whatever robematerial accrues there that will be for them
These five will be allowable to you monks when the kaṭhinacloths have been made
And thus monks should kaṭhinacloth be made
The Order should be informed by an experienced competent monk saying
Honoured sirs let the Order listen to me
This material for kaṭhinacloth has accrued to the Order
If it seems right to the Order the Order should give this material for kaṭhinacloth to the monk so and so for making kaṭhinacloth
This is the motion
Honoured sirs let the Order listen to me
This material for kaṭhinacloth has accrued to the Order
The Order is giving this material for kaṭhinacloth to the monk so and so for making kaṭhinacloth
If the giving of this material for kaṭhinacloth to the monk so and so for making kaṭhinacloth is pleasing to the venerable ones let them be silent He to whom it is not pleasing should speak
This material for kaṭhinacloth is given by the Order to the monk so and so for making kathiṇacloth
It is pleasing to the Order therefore they are silent Thus do I understand this 
Monks kaṭhinacloth becomes made thus not made thus
And how monks does kaṭhinacloth become not made
kaṭhinacloth does not become made only by marking it kaṭhinacloth does not become made only by washing it kaṭhinacloth does not become made only by calculating robes  kaṭhinacloth does not become made only by cutting it kaṭhinacloth does not become made only by tacking it kaṭhinacloth does not become made only by making the lengths kaṭhinacloth does not become made only by marking with a piece of cloth kaṭhinacloth does not become made only by strengthening the work kaṭhinacloth does not become made only by making a braiding kaṭhinacloth does not become made only by making a binding kaṭhinacloth does not become made only by patching kaṭhinacloth does not become made only by dyeing the garment kaṭhinacloth does not become made by insinuation kaṭhinacloth does not become made by roundabout talking kaṭhinacloth does not become made by its being temporary kaṭhinacloth does not become made by postponement kaṭhinacloth does not become made if it has to be abandoned kaṭhinacloth does not become made if it is not made allowable kaṭhinacloth does not become made if it is except for the outer cloak kaṭhinacloth does not become made if it is except for the upper robe kaṭhinacloth does not become made if it is except for the inner robe kaṭhinacloth does not become made unless five parts or more than five parts are cut out are hemmed together on that same day kaṭhinacloth does not become made unless the making is by an individual And even if kaṭhinacloth comes to be quite properly made but if no one gives thanks for it standing outside the boundary thus also kaṭhinacloth comes to be not made
And thus monks does kaṭhinacloth come to be not made
And how monks does kaṭhinacloth come to be made
Kaṭhinacloth comes to be made when it is unsoiled kaṭhinacloth comes to be made when what is allowable is unsoiled kaṭhinacloth comes to be made when it is out of pieces of cloth kaṭhinacloth comes to be made when it is out of ragrobes kaṭhinacloth comes to be made when it is out of a shop kaṭhinacloth comes to be made if there is no insinuation kaṭhinacloth comes to be made if there is no roundabout talking kaṭhinacloth comes to be made if it is not temporary kaṭhinacloth comes to be made if there is no postponement kaṭhinacloth comes to be made if it has not to be abandoned kaṭhinacloth comes to be made if it is made allowable kaṭhinacloth comes to be made if there is the outer cloak kaṭhinacloth comes to be made if there is the upper robe kaṭhinacloth comes to be made if there is the inner robe kaṭhinacloth comes to be made if five parts or more than five parts are cut out are hemmed together on that same day kaṭhinacloth comes to be made if the making is by an individual And if kaṭhinacloth comes to be quite properly made and if one gives thanks for it standing on the boundary kaṭhinacloth thus also comes to be made
And thus monks does kaṭhinacloth come to be made
And how monks do the kaṭhina become removed
Monks there are these eight grounds for the removal of the kaṭhina  that depending on going away that depending on being settled that depending on his resolves  that depending on being lost that depending on his hearing  the disappointment of his expectation  that depending on his having crossed the boundary the removal together with 
Then the Gracious One while walking gradually on walking tour arrived at Uruvelā
Then at that time at Uruvelā there lived three yogis known as Uruvelakassapa Nadīkassapa and Gayākassapa
Of these the yogi Uruvelakassapa was the leader guide chief director and instructor of five hundred yogis
The yogi Nadīkassapa was the leader guide chief director and instructor of three hundred yogis
The yogi Gayākassapa was the leader guide chief director and instructor of two hundred yogis
Then the Gracious One approached the yogi Uruvelakassapas ashram and after approaching he said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa If it is not troublesome to you Kassapa we  would stay for one night in the sacrificial firehouse
It is not troublesome to me Great Ascetic there is a fierce venomous poisonous DragonKing here having psychic power he should not harass you 
For a second time the Gracious One said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa If it is not troublesome to you Kassapa we would stay for one night in the sacrificial firehouse
It is not troublesome to me Great Ascetic there is a fierce venomous poisonous DragonKing here having psychic power he should not harass you 
For a third time the Gracious One said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa If it is not troublesome to you Kassapa we would stay for one night in the sacrificial firehouse
It is not troublesome to me Great Ascetic there is a fierce venomous poisonous DragonKing here having psychic power he should not harass you 
It is all right he will not harass me come now Kassapa allow me the sacrificial firehouse
Dwell  Great Ascetic according to your pleasure
Then the Gracious One after entering the sacrificial firehouse and preparing a grass covering sat down folded his legs crosswise set his body straight and established mindfulness at the front
Then the Dragon saw that the Gracious One had entered and after seeing  pained depressed he belched out smoke
Then this occurred to the Gracious One Now what if I without having destroyed this Dragons tegument skin flesh muscle bone or bonemarrow were to overcome power with power
Then the Gracious One so arranged it with his psychic powers that he belched out smoke
Then that Dragon unbearably angry blazed forth
The Gracious One having attained the fireelement also blazed forth
and both of them burned so bright it was as if the sacrificial firehouse was on fire in flames was burning down
Then those yogis having surrounded the sacrificial firehouse said this The Great Ascetic is surely intelligent but he is harassed by the Dragon
Then the Gracious One with the passing of that night without harming that Dragons tegument skin flesh muscle bone or bonemarrow after overcoming power with power and dropping him into his bowl showed to the yogi Uruvelakassapa  This is your Dragon Kassapa his power was overcome by power 
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic since he can overcome this fierce venomous poisonous DragonKings psychic power with power but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am 
Then the Gracious One not far from the yogi Uruvelakassapas ashram dwelt in a certain jungle thicket
Then the Four Great Kings towards the end of the night having lit up the whole of that jungle thicket with their surpassing beauty approached the Gracious One and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One they stood at the four directions like a great mass of fire
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa with the passing of that night approached the Gracious One and after approaching he said this to the Gracious One It is time Great Ascetic the meal is ready
Who were those Great Ascetic towards the end of the night who having lit up the whole of that jungle thicket with their surpassing beauty approached you and after approaching and worshipping you stood at the four directions like a great mass of fire 
Those Kassapa were the Four Great Kings who approached me to listen to the Dhamma
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic since even the Four Great Kings will approach him to listen to the Dhamma but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then the Gracious One having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapas food dwelt on in that very jungle thicket
The Second Miracle 
Then Sakka the Lord of the Gods towards the end of the night having lit up the whole of that jungle thicket with his surpassing beauty approached the Gracious One and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One he stood at one side like a great mass of fire more brilliant and more excellent than the former colours
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa with the passing of that night approached the Gracious One and after approaching he said this to the Gracious One It is time Great Ascetic the meal is ready
Who was that Great Ascetic towards the end of the night who having lit up the whole of that jungle thicket with his surpassing beauty approached you and after approaching and worshipping you stood at one side like a great mass of fire more brilliant and more excellent than the former colours
That Kassapa was Sakka the Lord of the Gods who approached me to listen to the Dhamma 
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic since even Sakka the Lord of the Gods will approach him to listen to the Dhamma but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then the Gracious One having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapas food dwelt on in that very jungle thicket
The Third Miracle 
Then Brahmā Sahampati towards the end of the night having lit up the whole of that jungle thicket with his surpassing beauty approached the Gracious One and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One he stood at one side like a great mass of fire more brilliant and more excellent than the former colours
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa with the passing of that night approached the Gracious One and after approaching he said this to the Gracious One It is time Great Ascetic the meal is ready
Who was that Great Ascetic who towards the end of the night having lit up the whole of that jungle thicket with his surpassing beauty approached you and after approaching and worshipping you stood at one side like a great mass of fire more brilliant and more excellent than the former colours
That Kassapa was Brahmā Sahampati who approached me to listen to the Dhamma 
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic since even Brahmā Sahampati will approach him to listen to the Dhamma but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then the Gracious One having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapas food dwelt on in that very jungle thicket
The Fourth Miracle 
Then at that time the yogi Uruvelakassapa had arranged for a great sacrifice and almost the whole of Aṅga and Magadha having gathered abundant food and drinks had a desire to attend
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa Now I have arranged for a great sacrifice and almost the whole of Aṅga and Magadha having gathered abundant food and drinks will attend
If the Great Ascetic performs a powerful miracle in the midst of the people his gain and honour will increase and my gain and honour will decrease
Surely the Great Ascetic should not come on the morrow 
Then the Gracious One knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in the yogi Uruvelakassapas mind after approaching Northern Kuru gathering alms from there and eating them at lake Anotatta made his dwelling right there for the day
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa with the passing of that night approached the Gracious One and after approaching he said this to the Gracious One It is time Great Ascetic the meal is ready
Why did you not come yesterday Great Ascetic
we remembered you  Why does the Great Ascetic not come
A portion of the food and drinks was set aside for you
Didnt this occur to you Kassapa Now I have arranged for a great sacrifice and almost the whole of Aṅga and Magadha having gathered abundant food and drinks will attend If the Great Ascetic performs a powerful miracle in the midst of the people his gain and honour will increase and my gain and honour will decrease Surely the Great Ascetic should not come on the morrow
Then I Kassapa knowing with my mind the reflection that had arisen in your mind after approaching Northern Kuru gathering alms from there and eating them at lake Anotatta made my dwelling right there for the day 
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic since he can even know mind with mind but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then the Gracious One having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapas food dwelt on in that very jungle thicket
The Fifth Miracle 
Then at that time there was a ragrobe that had arisen to the Gracious One
Then this occurred to the Gracious One Now where can I wash this ragrobe
 Then Sakka the Lord of the Gods knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in the Gracious Ones mind having dug a lake with his hand said this to the Gracious One May the Gracious One venerable Sir wash the ragrobe here 
Then this occurred to the Gracious One Now on what can I beat this ragrobe
Then Sakka the Lord of the Gods knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in the Gracious Ones mind set up a great rock  May the Gracious One venerable Sir beat the ragrobe here 
Then this occurred to the Gracious One Now having grabbed hold of what can I emerge 
Then a god who was living in an Arjuna   knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in the Gracious Ones mind bent down a branch  May the Gracious One venerable Sir having grabbed hold here emerge  
Then this occurred to the Gracious One Now on what can I stretch out this ragrobe 
Then Sakka the Lord of the Gods knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in the Gracious Ones mind set up a great rock  May the Gracious One venerable Sir stretch out the ragrobe here 
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa with the passing of that night approached the Gracious One and after approaching he said this to the Gracious One It is time Great Ascetic the meal is ready
Now how is it Great Ascetic this lake was not here formerly this lake is here
This rock was not set up here formerly
this rock was set up by whom
This branch of the Arjuna was not bent down formerly this branch is bent down 
Here Kassapa a ragrobe arose to me
Then Kassapa this occurred to me Now where can I wash this ragrobe
Then Sakka the Lord of the Gods Kassapa knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in my mind having dug a lake with his hand said this to me May the Gracious One venerable Sir wash the ragrobe here
the lake was dug by the divine being himself with his own hand
Then this Kassapa occurred to me Now on what can I beat this ragrobe
Then Sakka the Lord of the Gods Kassapa knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in my mind set up a great rock  May the Gracious One venerable Sir beat the ragrobe here
the rock was set up by the divine being himself
Then Kassapa this occurred to me Now having grabbed hold of what can I emerge 
Then Kassapa a god who was living in an Arjuna  knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in my mind bent down a branch  May the Gracious One venerable Sir having grabbed hold here emerge 
this Arjuna gave a hand himself
Then Kassapa this occurred to me Now on what can I stretch out this ragrobe 
Then Kassapa Sakka the Lord of the Gods knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in my mind set up a great rock  May the Gracious One venerable Sir stretch out the ragrobe here
the rock was set up by this divine being himself 
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic since even Sakka the Lord of the Gods does service but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then the Gracious One having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapas food dwelt on in that very jungle thicket
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa with the passing of that night approached the Gracious One and after approaching he announced the time  It is time Great Ascetic the meal is ready
You go ahead Kassapa I am coming  After sending away the yogi Uruvelakassapa picking a fruit from the RoseApple  the RoseApple Island is named and arriving earlier he sat down in the sacrificial firehouse
The yogi Uruvelakassapa saw the Gracious One sitting in the sacrificial firehouse and after seeing  he said this to the Gracious One By what path Great Ascetic did you come
I set out earlier than you you arriving earlier are sitting down in the sacrificial firehouse
Here Kassapa after sending you away picking a fruit from the RoseApple  the RoseApple Island is named and arriving earlier I sat down in the sacrificial firehouse
This is the RoseApple fruit Kassapa endowed with colour scent and taste
if you wish you can eat 
Enough Great Ascetic you surely brought it you should surely eat it 
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic since after sending me away earlier picking a fruit from the RoseApple  the RoseApple Island is named and arriving earlier he can sit down in the sacrificial firehouse but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then the Gracious One having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapas food dwelt on in that very jungle thicket
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa with the passing of that night approached the Gracious One and after approaching he announced the time  It is time Great Ascetic the meal is ready
You go ahead Kassapa I am coming  After sending away the yogi Uruvelakassapa picking a fruit from a Mango  from Emblic Myrobalan  from Yellow Myrobalan not far from the RoseApple  the RoseApple Island is named  going to the Tāvatisa  picking a Coral tree flower and arriving earlier he sat down in the sacrificial firehouse
The yogi Uruvelakassapa saw the Gracious One sitting in the sacrificial firehouse and after seeing  he said this to the Gracious One By what path Great Ascetic did you come
I set out earlier than you you arriving earlier are sitting down in the sacrificial firehouse
Here Kassapa after sending you away going to the Tāvatisa  picking a Coral tree flower and arriving earlier I sat down in the sacrificial firehouse
This is the Coral tree flower Kassapa endowed with colour and scent if you wish you can take 
Enough Great Ascetic you surely brought it you should surely take it
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic since after sending me away earlier going to the Tāvatisa  picking a Coral tree flower and arriving earlier he can sit down in the sacrificial firehouse but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am 
Then at that time those yogis who wanted to tend the sacred fires were not able to chop the firewood
Then this occurred to those yogis No doubt it is because of the Great Ascetics psychic power that we are not able to chop the firewood
Then the Gracious One said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa Let the firewood be chopped Kassapa
Let it be chopped Great Ascetic
and more than five hundred pieces of firewood were chopped
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic since firewood can be chopped but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then at that time those yogis who wanted to tend the sacred fires were not able to light the fires
Then this occurred to those yogis No doubt it is because of the Great Ascetics psychic power that we are not able to light the sacred fires
Then the Gracious One said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa Let the sacred fires be lit Kassapa
Let them be lit Great Ascetic
and more than five hundred sacred fires were lit
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic since sacred fires can be lit but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then at that time those yogis after tending the sacred fires were not able to put the sacred fires out
Then this occurred to those yogis No doubt it is because of the Great Ascetics psychic power that we are not able to put out the sacred fires
Then the Gracious One said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa Let the sacred fires be put out Kassapa
Let them be put out Great Ascetic
and more than five hundred sacred fires were put out
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic since sacred fires can be put out but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then at that time those yogis in the cold Winter nights in between the eights at the time of the snowfall in the river Nerañjarā were plunging in and plunging out were plunging in and out
Then the Gracious One created about five hundred coalpans where those yogis after emerging warmed 
Then this occurred to those yogis No doubt it is because of the Great Ascetics psychic power that these coalpans were created 
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic since he can create so many coalpans for them but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am 
Then at that time a great cloud poured down out of season and a great floodwater arose
and in that area where the Gracious One was living the place became submerged with water
Then this occurred to the Gracious One Now what if I having risen above the water on all sides were to walk in the middle on dusty ground
Then the Gracious One having risen above the water on all sides walked in the middle of dusty ground
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa  May the Great Ascetic not be carried away by water  with a boat and a great many yogis went to that place in the area where the Gracious One was living
The yogi Uruvelakassapa saw that the Gracious One having risen above the water on all sides was walking in the middle of dusty ground and after seeing  he said this to the Gracious One Are you here Great Ascetic
It is I Kassapa and after rising up into the sky he reappeared in the boat
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic since even the water cannot carry him away but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am 
Then this occurred to the Gracious One For a long time this will occur to that foolish fellow Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am  Now what if I were to cause spiritual anxiety to this yogi
Then the Gracious One said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa You are certainly not a Worthy One Kassapa Nor have you entered the path to Worthiness
This practice of yours is not one whereby you could be a Worthy One or one who has entered the path to Worthiness 
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa having fallen with his head at the Gracious Ones feet said this to the Gracious One May I receive the goingforth venerable Sir in the presence of the Gracious One may I receive the full ordination
But you Kassapa are the leader guide chief director and instructor of five hundred yogis
you should them give permission and they can do whatever they are thinking
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa approached those yogis and after approaching he said this to those yogis I wish to live the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic you dear friends can do whatever you are thinking
They replied For a long time friend we have had confidence in the Great Ascetic if you friend will live the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic all of us will live the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic 
Then those yogis after throwing their hair  locks pole and basket and sacred fire equipment into the water approached the Gracious One and after approaching and falling with their heads at the feet of the Gracious One they said this to the Gracious One May we receive the goingforth venerable Sir in the presence of the Gracious One may we receive the full ordination 
Come monks said the Gracious One the Dhamma has been wellproclaimed live the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering
That was these venerable ones full ordination
The yogi Nadīkassapa saw the hair locks pole and basket and sacred fire equipment floating in the water and after seeing  this occurred to him Let there be no danger for my brothers
and he sent yogis  Go and find out about my brothers
and he together with three hundred yogis approached the venerable Uruvelakassapa and after approaching he said this to the venerable Uruvelakassapa Is this better Kassapa
Yes friend this is better 
Then those yogis after throwing their hair locks pole and basket and sacred fire equipment into the water approached the Gracious One and after approaching and falling with their heads at the feet of the Gracious One they said this to the Gracious One May we receive the goingforth venerable Sir in the presence of the Gracious One may we receive the full ordination 
Come monks said the Gracious One the Dhamma has been wellproclaimed live the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering
That was these venerable ones full ordination
The yogi Gayākassapa saw the hair locks pole and basket and sacred fire equipment floating in the water and after seeing  this occurred to him Let there be no danger for my brothers
and he sent yogis  Go and find out about my brothers
and he together with two hundred yogis approached the venerable Uruvelakassapa and after approaching he said this to the venerable Uruvelakassapa Is this better Kassapa
Yes friend this is better
Then those yogis after throwing their hair locks pole and basket and sacred fire equipment into the water approached the Gracious One and after approaching and falling with their heads at the feet of the Gracious One they said this to the Gracious One May we receive the goingforth venerable Sir in the presence of the Gracious One may we receive the full ordination
Come monks said the Gracious One the Dhamma has been wellproclaimed live the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering
That was these venerable ones full ordination
Through the Gracious Ones determining five hundred pieces of firewood that were not chopped were chopped fires that were not lit were lit that were not put out were put out five hundred coalpans were created
In this way there were three and a half thousand miracles
Then the Gracious One having dwelt at Uruvelā for as long as he liked left on walking tour for Gayās Head together with a great Community of monks with a thousand monks all of whom were formerly yogis
There the Gracious One dwelt near Gayā on Gayās Head together with a thousand monks
his instructions are flouted
He should be blamed saying This venerable one has gone forth
This is the second teacher who is blameworthy
But his pupils dont wish to hear him his instructions are flouted
Just as if having cut through an old fetter one were to make a new one I declare that this is an evil doctrine rooted in attachment for what can one man do for another
And these are the three kinds of teacher that I spoke of as blameworthy
Now the turn has come for a commentary on the Jewel Sutta which begins with the words  Whatever beings and is placed in the Minor Readings next to the GoodOmen Sutta
So after stating the purpose of its inclusion here then We do so in order to showas it were how to descend to the waters of a river a lake etc by way of a perfectly pure landingplacehow to descend to the meaning of this Discourse by way of a purified Source
By whom twas spoken when where why Are matters that we next descry
Whereafter when the time falls due We comment on the meaning too
Herein as regards the foregoing stanza what was shown by the GoodOmen Sutta was selfprotection and the countering of such taints as are a condition both for doing what is not good and for not doing what is good This Sutta however accomplishes the protection of others and the countering of such taints as are a condition for the unwanted presence of nonhuman beings etc and that would be a purpose for placing it here
So this to start with is the purpose for which it was placed here
Now as to the questions By whom twas spoken when where why  it may be asked here By whom was this Sutta delivered When where and why was it delivered
It was delivered by the Blessed One himself not by disciples etc
and that was when Vesll was being plagued by famine etc and the Blessed One had been asked for by the Licchavis and had been brought from Rjagaha to Vesli and it was delivered by him then at Vesali for the purpose of countering those plagues
These are the summary answers
When it comes to detail however the Ancients comment after first giving the story of the origin of Vesli
Now here is the commentary A child it seems was conceived in the womb of a king of Benares chief queen When she came to know this she informed the king who gave her the childprotection ceremony
With the child thus well protected by the ceremony she entered the maternity home when the child was ripe for birth
Now the emergence of the child takes place in the morning in the case of the meritorious
and she was one of those So it was in the morning that she gave birth but what was born was a piece of flesh like a lump of lac or like hybiscus flowers
As a consequence she thought They might criticize me before the king saying that the other queens give birth to children like golden statues but the chief queen has given birth to a piece of flesh Thinking to escape such criticism she put the piece of flesh in a vase had it covered and sealed with the royal seal and then set it afloat in the Ganges
Deities arranged for the guarding of what human beings had rejected
and after inscribing in vermilion on a gold label the words Offspring of the king of Benares chief queen  they tied it on the vase
After that the vase floated on the current of the Ganges untroubled by danger from waves and so on
On that occasion a certain ascetic was living in dependence on a cowherds family by the banks of the Ganges
Early one morning he went down to the Ganges and seeing the vase coming by he picked it up regarding it as flotsam
Then he saw the written label and the royal seal on it He opened it and found the piece of flesh When he saw that he thought  It might be a living foetus and that is why there is no bad smell of decay about it
and so he brought it to his hermitage and put it in a clean place
Then at the end of a fortnight there were two pieces of flesh
When the ascetic saw that he put them in a better place At the end of another fortnight five swellings for the hands feet and head appeared on each piece
Then at the end of another fortnight one piece of flesh became a boy like a golden statue and the other a girl
Childlove sprang up in the ascetic then
and milk was produced from his thumb
After that when he obtained milkrice he ate the rice and sprinkled the milk on the childrens mouths
Whatever entered their stomachs was as visible as if it were inside a crystal jug
so skinless were they
some others have said however that their skins adhered to each other as if stitched together
At any rate they became known by the name of Licchavi either because of their skinlessness or because of their skins adherence 
With his nursing of the children the ascetic was late in going to the village for alms and when he returned the day was already advanced
When the cowherds came to know about his interest in the children they said  Venerable sir nursing children is an impediment to those gone forth from the house life Give us the children We will nurse them You do your own work
The ascetic agreed
So next day the cowherds levelled the road and after strewing it with flowers and hoisting flags and banners they came to the hermitage playing musical instruments
The ascetic told them  The children have great merit Educate them carefully  and when they have been educated see that they are married to see that they are married to each other with the two ceremonies Then make a present of the five products of the cow to the king and obtain from him a tract of land Have a town built on it and anoint the boy there  and that done he gave them the children
They agreed and so they brought the children away and looked after them
As the children grew up they played with the cowherds children and in the course of quarrels they cuffed and kicked them The cowherds children wept
and when asked by their parents  What are you crying for  they said These orphans the ascetic used to nurse are hitting us too much 
Then their parents said  These children are bullying and hurting the other children they must not be kept company with they must be kept away from 
and after that it seems the place three hundred leagues in extent was called Vajji  which was how the people of those parts came to be called Vajjians
Then the cowherds made a present to the king and took over that place
after which they had a town built there The boy who was now sixteen years old they anointed king
and they married him to the girl Then they made an agreement that no girls were to be brought in from outside and that no girls were to be given out from there
 From their first cohabitation two children were born a daughter and a son Sixteen times there were two born in this way
Then when the children had eventually grown up and when there came to be insufficient room to contain the wealth of gardens parks dwellingplaces and retainers they three times built a curtainwall round it each time a quarterleagues distance outside the last Because of that repeated enlargement the town came to be called Vesli
This is the story of Vesli
Now at the time when the Blessed One had appeared in the world Vesli was prosperous and enjoying abundance
And there were seven thousand seven hundred and seven regents there
and likewise junior regents generals custodians and so on
according as it is said
 Now on that occasion Vesli was prosperous flourishing populous crowded with people with a plentiful food supply and there were seven thousand seven hundred and seven palaces and seven thousand seven hundred and seven upper chambers and seven thousand seven hundred and seven parks and seven thousand seven hundred and seven pools  
But on another occasion it ran short of food through suffering droughts and bad harvests
First the poor people died and their bodies were thrown outside
Owing to the corpsestench of dead men nonhuman beings gained entry to the city After that many more died
So great was the repulsiveness that a  snakebreath pest broke out among creatures
Vesli being thus plagued by the three fears of famine nonhuman beings and pest the citizens approached the principal regent and said Great king a threefold fear has made its appearance in this city This has never happened before as far back as seven royal dynasties Perhaps it has happened now because some illegality in your title is in question
The regent assembled them all in the city hall and told them to investigate his title
They investigated the entire lineage but found nothing
So finding no defect in the regent they wondered  How shall this fear be allayed 
Some suggested the six teachers Prana Kassapa and the others sayingIt will be allayed as soon as they arrive
Others said An Enlightened One has appeared in the world it seems That Blessed One teaches a True Idea for the benefit of creatures He is mighty and powerful All fears will be allayed as soon as he arrives
At that they were pleased and they asked  Where is that Blessed One living now If we ent for him would he come 
Then others said Enlightened Ones are compassionate Why should he not come That Blessed One is living at Rjagaha now and king Bimbisara attends upon him Perhaps he would not let him come
 Then let us get the king to agree to have him brought  So they despatched two Licchavi regents to the king with a sumptuous present backed by a large military force telling them  Get Bimbisara to agree to your bringing the Blessed One here 
They went and gave the king the present and informed him of what was happening saying  Great king send the Blessed One to our city 
Instead of agreeing the king said  Find out for yourselves
So they approached the Blessed One and after paying homage they said Venerable sir three fears have arisen in our city If the Blessed One would come we should be safe
The Blessed One adverted to the matter and perceiving that When the Jewel Sutta is pronounced at Vesli that protection will pervade a hundred thousand myriads of worldsystems and at the end of the Sutta eightyfour thousand breathing things will attain to the True Idea he assented
When king Bimbisara heard that the Blessed One had assented he had it proclaimed in the city  The Blessed One has consented to go to Vesli and then he went to the Blessed One and asked Venerable sir did you agree to go to Vesli
 Yes great king
Then venerable sir wait till we have had the road prepared
So king Bimbisra had the ground levelled in the fiveleague interval between Rjagaha and the Ganges and at a distance of every league he had a dwellingplace built after which he informed the Blessed One that it was time for him to depart
The Blessed One set out surrounded by five hundred bhikkhus
All along the fiveleaguelong road the king had flowers of the five colours strewed kneedeep and flags banners and pennants etc hoisted He had two white parasols held above the Blessed One and one above each bhikkhu Then doing honour to the Blessed One with flowers incense etc accompanied by his own retinue he had the Blessed One reside in each one of the dwellings making at each a fullscale almsgiving In this manner he conducted the Blessed One to the Ganges in five days
There he had a boat adorned with every kind of decoration and he sent a letter to the inhabitants of Vesli  The Blessed One has arrived Prepare a road Let all come out to meet the Blessed One
They decided to do double the honour and so after they had had the ground levelled in the threeleague interval between the Ganges and Vesli they had four white parasols made for the Blessed One and two for each bhikkhu and to do honour to them they came and stood on the north bank of the Ganges
Bimbisra had two boats joined and a pavilion built on them decorated with festoons of flowers etc and there he had an Enlightened Ones throne made of every kind of jewel prepared The Blessed One took his seat upon it
and the five hundred bhikkhus boarded the boat each taking the seat that became him
Then the king followed the Blessed One down into the river till the water was up to his neck and he said  Venerable sir I shall reside here on the banks of the Ganges till the Blessed One comes  and he turned back
Deities as far up as the realm of the Akanittha Divinities in the Pure Abodes did honour to him from above
and Kambala and Assatara Nga Serpents and others living in the Ganges did honour to him from below
When the Blessed One had travelled on the Ganges for one league with this great honour he crossed the Veslians boundary
Then honouring the Blessed One twice as much as Bimbisra had done the Licchavi regents came to meet him till the water was up to their necks
At that moment at that very instant a great cloud the darkness of whose broad summit was laced with lightning flashes began to rain down in torrents in the four directions
Then scarcely had the Blessed One set his foot upon the Ganges bank than a  lotus  downpour began
but only those got wet who wanted to get wet and no one got wet who did not want to get wet
Everywhere the water flowed kneedeep thighdeep waistdeep neckdeep and all the corpses were swept into the Ganges by the water till the land was left quite clean
At each interval of a league the Licchavis had the Enlightened One reside and there they gave a great almsgiving Thus in three days doing double the honour that Bimbisra had done they conducted him to Vesli
As soon as the Blessed One arrived at Vesli Sakka Ruler of Gods came heralded by a community of gods
With the arrival of gods possessing such great influence most of the nonhuman beings fled
The Blessed One stopped at the city gate and he addresssed the venerable nanda thus  nanda learn this Jewel Sutta and with the Licchavi princes perform a Safeguard Ceremony in procession round the intervals between the three city walls taking with you the material for making the ceremonial offerings And then he delivered the Jewel Discourse
That is how the answers to the questions By whom was this discourse delivered When and why was it delivered  are given in detail by the Ancients starting with the Vesli story
So while this Jewel Discourse the purpose of which was to counter those plagues was being delivered there at the city gate on the very day of the Blessed Ones arrival at Vesli the venerable nanda learnt it And then in reciting it afterwards as a Safeguard Ceremony he took water with him in the Blessed Ones bowl and proceeded around the whole city aspersing it with the water
As soon as the words  No matter what were uttered by the Elder the nonhuman beings who had not already fled and were lurking in middens and behind walls and in such places fled towards the four gates
But the gates could not accommodate them all and so some who were unable to escape through the gates broke through the walls in their flight
The sickness in mens limbs was cured
They came out and did honour to the Elder with all kinds of flowers incense and so on
A multitude sprinkled the city hall in the centre of the city with all kinds of scents made a canopy decorated with every kind of ornament and when they had prepared an Enlightened Ones throne they conducted the Blessed One to it
The Blessed One entered the city hall and sat down on the seat prepared
and the Community of bhikkhus and the regents and the people sat down in the places allotted them
And Sakka Ruler of Gods together with an assembly of gods presided above in the two worlds of deities and other gods as well And when the Elder nanda had proceeded round the whole of Vesli and had performed the Safeguard Ceremony he came with the citizens of Vesli and sat down at one side
There the Blessed One pronounced that same Jewel Discourse to all of them
At this point what was set out in the Schedule namely By whom twas spoken when where why Are matters that we next descry  has been given in detail in all aspects
After thus showing how helpful human beings are to deities henow began an invocation of a TruthUtterance in the way beginning Whatever to be prized doing so for the purpose of eliminating their plagues and for the purpose of gods and mens hearing the True Idea by means of an exposition of the special qualities of the Enlightened One and the rest
Hereinwhatever    is found embraces without remainder indefinitely whatever is suitable for trading here or there
What is To be prized is riches
for that produces the prize of prosperity thus it is to be prized 
Here or demonstrates the human world
Beyond demonstrates the rest of the world besides that Now although this latter can extend to include the whole world except the human nevertheless since  or in the heavens  is said next both the human and heavenly worlds being thus excluded what has to be understood by beyond  is the inclusion of the remaining world of Ngas Supannas and so on
So what is demonstrated by these two words  here and beyond is any thingtobeprized that is suitable for human beings  here and capable of use as an ornament such as gold silver pearl crystal beryl coral ruby emerald etc and it is anythingtobeprized belonging to the Ngas Supannas etc  beyond  that has arisen in those realms with their manyhundredleaguewide jewelmade divine mansions standing on ground strewed with sands of pearl and crystal
Or in the heavens  in the sensualsphere and formsphere worlds of gods
for by means of creditable action they are arrived at are gone to  thus they are heavens 
or they are quite the foremost thus they are heavens 
What what either has an owner or is ownerless
Jewel  it induces  brings generates  weal  thus it is a jewel 
this is a designation for whatever is admired greatly valuable inestimable rarely seen and used by superb creatures
according as it is said
Much admired and great in value Inestimable rarely seen
Superb creatures make use of it This is what the word  jewel  can mean
Rare  supreme best not little
So what is indicated by this line is any jewel with an owner such as a SudhammaHall the Vejayanta Palace etc which are divine mansions made of all kinds of jewels and many hundred leagues in size and also any jewel with no owner either such as belongs to divine mansions left vacant when creatures are reborn downwards to fill the states of deprivation during a period destitute of an Enlightened One or any ownerless jewel lying in the earth in the ocean in the Himalayas and so on
None is there equal to a Perfect One no is a negation
One is for emphasis
Equal  comparable
To a Perfect One  to an Enlightened One
What is meant
It is that whatever the thingtobeprized and jewel exhibited there is not even one here to resemble the BuddhaJewel
Now any jewel may be defined in the sense of its being much admired For example a WheelTurning Monarchs WheelJewel or GemJewel which being arisen most people have no admiration for anything else and no one goes any more with flowers incenseetcto a spirits or to a nonhuman beings place of worship but rather all people admire only the WheelJewel and the GemJewel and honour them aspiring to some boon or other and sometimes succeeding in what they aspire to even such a jewel as that is never the equal of the BuddhaJewel
If a jewel is definable in the sense of its being admired then only a Perfect One is really a jewel
for when a Perfect One has arisen whatever gods and men there are with great influence they show admiration for nothing else and do honour to none else
Indeed the High Divinity Sahampati did honour to the Perfect One with a jewel garland as big as Sineru and other gods did likewise according to their means besides such human beings as King Bimbisra King Pasenadi of Kosala Anthapindika and so on
And after the Blessed One had finally attained extinction King Asoka renounced ninetysix kotis for his sake and founded eightyfour thousand monasteries throughout the whole of Jambudipa  So what need is there to mention other admirers
Who else indeed is there finally attained to extinction if not the Blessed One for the sake of whose places of Birth of Enlightenment of Turning the Wheel of the True Idea and of Extinction or for the sake of whose images shrines etc such admiration and respect was manifested
That is how there is no jewel the equal of a Perfect One in the sense of its being admired
Likewise any jewel may be defined in the sense of its great value
for example Ksi cloth
according as it is said Bhikkhus Ksi cloth even when old has a good appearance and is soft to touch and of great value  but even such a jewel as that is never the equal of the BuddhaJewel
If a jewel is definable in the sense of its great value then only a Perfect One is really a jewel
for no matter whose refuserag robe a Perfect One accepts that act of theirs is greatly fruitful and beneficial for them as for instance for King Asoka His great value consists in this
And as to the term  great value  it should be understood that the following Sutta passage establishes the absence of any defect in this argument
No matter whose robes alms food resting place or requisite of medicine as cure for the sick he accepts that is greatly fruitful and beneficial for them
that I say is his great value
As that Ksi cloth is of great value so is this kind of person I say 
That is how there is no jewel the equal of a Perfect One in the sense of its great value
Likewise any jewel may be defined in the sense of its inestimability
For example the WheelJewel that appears for a WheelTurning Monarch Its hub is of sapphire its thousand spokes are made of the seven kinds of gems its rim of coral its joints of red gold and after each ten spokes there is one headspoke whose purpose is to make a sound by catching the wind the sound made by which is like the sound of the fivefactored music most skilfully played  Then on each side of its hub is a lions head and inside there is a hollow as there is in that of a cart wheel
It has no maker and no one has had it made  it originates with natural temperature and with action for its conditions
And when the king has completed the tenfold duty of a WheelTurner and it being the Uposatha Day of the Fifteenth and a fullmoon day he has bathed his head undertaken the Uposatha observances and gone up to the private apartments in the upper palace then while he is seated engaged in purifying his virtues he sees it rising like the full moon or the sun and the sound of it is audible for twelve leagues around and its appearance is visible for a league Then it is that most people on seeing it create a great uproar saying  One would fancy a second moon or sun was rising and it passes above the city till it arrives at the east side of the royal palace where it stops as though axlelocked in a place neither too high nor too low that is suitable for the many to do honour to it with incense and flowers and so on
And following upon that the ElephantJewel appears all white with polished feet and sevenfold stance possessing supernormal powers flying through the air and he comes from the Uposatha Clan or from the Chaddanta Clan when coming from the Uposatha Clan he is the eldest of all that clanbut when coming from the Chaddanta Clan he is the youngest of all that clanfully trained and tamed Then with an assembly twelve leagues broad the King tours with the ElephantJewel the whole of Jambudipa and returns before the morning meal to his own royal capital
And following upon that the HorseJewel appears all white with polished hooves ravenblack head and mwryagrasslike mane and he comes from the royal horseclan called Valhaka
The rest is the same as in the case of the ElephantJewel
And following upon that the GemJewel appears
It is a fine beryl gem of purest water eightfaceted well cut and as broad as a wheels hub It comes from the Vepulla Rock
When it is mounted above the royal standard it glows for a league around even in the darkness possessing the four factors and owing to the glow people think it is day and set about their work and they can see even down to the very ants
And following upon that the WomanJewel appears She is normally the chief queen and she comes either from the Uttarakurus or from the Maddarja Clan She escapes the six defects beginning with being too tall  she surpasses human appearance without reaching divine appearance for the king her limbs are warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather while her touch is like that of cotton a hundred times beaten from her body there exhales the fragrance of sandalwood and from her mouth the fragrance of lotuses and she possesses the several special qualities beginning with rising before the WheelTurning Monarch
Following upon that the StewardJewel appears He is normally a banker in the royal employ in whom the heavenly eye has become manifest as soon as the WheelJewel appears By that means he sees hidden treasure with or without owner for as much as a hundred leagues around and he approaches the king and offers his services thus  Sire you may remain inactive I shall do with money what should be done with money
And following upon that the CounsellorJewel appears He is normally the Kings eldest son
who has come to possess the quality of extraordinary understanding as soon as the WheelJewel appears and by penetrating with his mind the minds of the assembly twelve leagues across he is capable of curbing and rousing them He approaches the King and offers his services thus  Sire you may remain inactive I shall counsel your government 
Now with this or any other such jewel defined in the sense of inestimability on which no value can be set by estimation or adjudgment that it is worth a hundred thousand or a myriad
not even a single jewel is there among them ever the equal of the BuddhaJewel
If a jewel is definablein the sense of inestimability then only a Perfect One is really a Jewel
for a Perfect One cannot be delimited by anyone who tries to estimate and adjudge him as to virtue or as to concentration or as to any one among the things beginning with understanding thus One who has precisely so many special qualities on being compared with him is found to be his counterpart
That is how there is no jewel the equal of a Perfect One in the sense of inestimability
Likewise any jewel may be defined in the sense of its being rarely seen For example notwithstanding the rarity of the manifestation of a WheelTurning Monarch and his seven jewels even such a jewel as that is never the equal of the BuddhaJewel
If a jewel is definable in the sense of its being rarely seen then only a Perfect One is a Jewel How indeed can a WheelTurning Monarch and the rest be a jewel
since many arise in a single aeon
But the world can be vacant of a Perfect One for even an incalculable aeon So that is why because of his arising only from time to time a Perfect One is rarely seen
And this was said by the Blessed One on the occasion of his final extinction 
Deities are protesting nanda  We have come far indeed to see a Perfect One Only From time to time does a Perfect One arise in the world accomplished and fully enlightened And tonight towards dawn there will be a Perfect Ones final extinction And this eminent bhikkhu is standing in front of the Blessed One hiding him so that at the last moment we shall not be able to see the Perfect One  
That is how there is no jewel the equal of a Perfect One in the sense of its being rarely seen
Likewise any jewel can be defined in the sense of use by a superb creature
For example a WheelTurning Monarchs WheelJewel and the rest That kind is not generated for the use even in a dream of inferior men of such lowbred clans as those of outcastes wickerworkers hunters cartwrights and scavengers for all that they may possess riches amounting to a hundred thousand kotis and live on the grand floor of a sevenstoried palace
It is only generated for the use of a king of WarriorNoble caste well born on both sides who has completed the tenfold duties of a WheelTurning Monarch But even such a jewel as that is never the equal of the BuddhaJewel
If a jewel is definable in the sense of use by a superlative creature then only a Perfect One is a jewel
for a Perfect One is not for the use even in a dream of the six teachers beginning with Prana Kassapaand others like them who for all that they may be reputed in the world to be superb creatures have not yet perfected the basis for enlightenment and whose seeing is distorted
However he is for the use of such as Bhiya Druciriya  etc and other great disciples hailing from the great clans who have perfected the basis for enlightenment and are capable of reaching Arahantship at the end of a single fourline stanza and whose knowledge and seeing is penetrative of the four Noble Truths For they make use of him in one way or another by accomplishing the Unsurpassables of Seeing Hearing Service and the rest 
That is how there is no jewel the equal of a Perfect One in the sense of its use by a superlative creature
Also any jewel is without distinction a jewel in the sense of its generating weal 
For example a king is elated as soon as he sees the WheelTurning Monarchs WheelJewel and so it generates weal in him
Again a WheelTurning Monarch takes a golden jug in his left hand and with his right hand asperses the WheelJewel saying Roll on good WheelJewel triumph good WheelJewel
After that the WheelJewel goes in the eastern direction through the air emitting as sweet a sound as the fiveconstituent music And in its wake travelling by its might the WheelTurning Monarch goes with a fourconstituent army of elephants cavalry chariots and infantry twelve leagues in breadth He goes not too high and not too low below the tops of the high trees and above the tops of the low trees taking presents from the hands of those among his retinue who come with presents of flowers fruits leaves etc gathered from among the trees in passing and as he goes he instructs the local kings who come and profess the profoundest obedience thus Come great king etc telling them Breathing things are not to be killed  and so on
But wherever the king desires to eat or to take a rest by day there the WheelJewel alights from the air and remains as though axlelocked on a level piece of ground that will accommodate all the functions beginning with that of the water ablution
Then when the king is minded to proceed it moves on sounding as before and as soon as the twelveleaguebroad assembly hears that it too mounts into the air
Eventually the WheelJewel plunges into the eastern ocean and when it does that the water recedes for as much as a league and stands back like a wall
The multitudes gather up as much as they want of the seven kinds of jewels
Then when the king has taken the golden jug and said Thus far extends my kingdom and aspersed it it turns back
The army is now in front the WheelJewel behind and the king in the middle
The water fills in again each place in the sea bed as the WheelJewel withdraws from it
In like manner too it goes into the southern the western and the northern oceans
When it has thus toured the four directions the WheelJewel mounts into the sky to a height of three hundredleagues
There the king stops and surveys as though it were a whitelotus pool in full bloom the worldsystem adorned as it is with its four great continents and two thousand lesser islands that is to say Pubbavideha in the east seven thousand leagues round Uttarakuru in the north eight thousand leagues round Aparagoyna in the west seven thousand leagues round and Jambudipa in the south ten thousand leagues round each of which with its five hundred lesser islands has been conquered by the might of the WheelJewel
And as he surveys it thus no little weal arises in him and so that WheelJewel is a generator of weal for the king
But even such a jewel as that is never the equal of the BuddhaJewel
If a jewel is definable in the sense of generating weal  then only a Perfect One is really a jewel How will a WheelJewel be able to compete with that
For a WheelTurning Monarchs weal even when generated by all the jewels beginning with the Wheel does not count beside is not even a fraction of or part of a fraction of any kind of heavenly weal And a Perfect One generates weal that is loftier than superior to even that since in the countless gods and men who carry out his own instructions he generates the weal of the first jhana the weal of the second third fourth and fifth jhanas the weal of the base consisting of infiniteness of space the weal of the bases consisting of infiniteness of consciousness of nothingness and of neither perception nor nonperception the weal of the StreamEntry Path the weal of the fruition of Stream Entry and the weal of the paths and fruitions of OnceReturn NonReturn and Arahantship
That is how there is no jewel equal to a Perfect One in the sense of generating weal 
Furthermore this jewel is twofold as with consciousness and without consciousness
Herein the kind of jewel without consciousness is the WheelJewel the Gem Jewel or other kind not bound up with faculties such as gold silver and so on That with consciousness is those beginning with the ElephantJewel and ending with the CounsellorJewel or any other such kind bound up with faculties
And of the two kinds thus the jewel with consciousness is accounted the foremost
Why
Because those without consciousness consisting of gold silver crystal pearl etc are used for the decoration of those with consciousness beginning with the ElephantJewel
The Jewel with consciousness is also twofold as animal and human
Herein the human jewel is accounted the foremost
Why
Because the animal jewel is used for the human jewels conveyance
The human jewel is also twofold as the woman jewel and the man jewel
Herein the man jewel is accounted the foremost
Why
Because the woman jewel performs service for the man jewel
The man jewel is also twofold as the houseliving jewel and the homeless jewel
Herein the homeless jewel is accounted the foremost
Why
Because although a WheelTurning Monarch is the foremost of the houseliving jewels nevertheless by his paying homage with the fivefold prostration to the homeless jewel who is associated with the qualities of virtue etc and by his waiting on and reverencing him he eventually reaches heavenly and human excellence till in the end he reaches the excellence of extinction
The homeless jewel is also twofold as the Noble One and the ordinary man
And the Noble jewel is also twofold as the Initiate and the Adept
And the Adept is also twofold as the bareinsight worker and the one whose vehicle is quiet
The one whose vehicle is quiet is also twofold as one who has reached the Disciples Perfections and one who has not
Herein one who has reached the Disciples Perfections is accounted the foremost
Why
Because of the greatness of his qualities
Also a Hermit Enlightened One is accounted foremost in comparison with one who has reached the Disciples Perfections
Why
Because of the greatness of his qualities
for even several hundred disciples like Sariputta and Moggallna are not to be compared to a hundredth part of a Hermit Enlightened Ones qualities
Also a Fully Enlightened One is accounted foremost in comparison with a Hermit Enlightened One
Why
Because of the greatness of his qualities
for even if Hermit Enlightened Ones were seated all over Jambudipa crosslegged and with knees touching each other not even all together would they count beside exhibit a fraction or a part of a fraction of a single Fully Enlightened Ones qualities
And this is said by the Blessed One  Bhikkhus in so far as there are creatures without legs or with two legs or    a Perfect One is accounted the foremost of them  and so on
Thus no jewel is ever the equal of a Perfect One in any way at all
Hence the Blessed One said None is there equal to a Perfect One 
When the Blessed One had thus stated how the BuddhaJewel is unequalled by other jewels he now in order to dispel for those creatures the plagues that had arisen invoked a TruthUtterance namely  This jewel rare is in the Enlightened One So may thereby this very truth be safety  which TruthUtterance does not have for its support either birth or race or appearance but on the contrary has for its support the BuddhaJewels unequalledness in the world that begins with the Avici Hell and ends with the Acme of Existence namely the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception unequalledness that is in the matter of such special qualities as the Categories of Virtue Concentration Understanding Deliverance and Knowledge and Seeing of Deliverance 
The meaning of that is as follows There is this which because of its unequalledness in the already mentioned special qualities by anythingtobeprized or jewel whatever either here or beyond or in the heavensjewel rare in the Enlightened One 
so if that is true then by this very truth for these breathing things may there be safety hotu may there be existence of creditable things for them freedom from pest and freedom from plagues
Now just as in such passages as nanda the eye is void of self or of what belongs to self the meaning is Voidof selfnessor of belongingtoselfness
otherwise  it would not thereby be excluded  that the eye was self or belonged to self
so too it has to be understood that the expression this jewel rare means rarejewelness rarejewelhood
otherwise it would not be established that the Enlightened One in whom it is was a jewel
For it is not established that that in which there is a jewel is also a jewel
But that in which there is the meaning of beingadmired etc called jewelness connected there within one way or another is there by established as a jewel owing to the existence in it of that jewelness
Or alternatively the meaning of the words This jewel  in the Enlightened One  can be understood as for this reason the Enlightened One is a jewel
No sooner had this stanza been uttered by the Blessed One than the royal clans safety was assured and the fears were allayed
And the command in this stanza was obeyed by nonhuman beings in a hundred thousand myriad worldsystems
After expressing truth in this way by means of the special qualities of the Enlightened One he now began to express it with the words  such waning fading doing so by means of the special quality of the True Idea as extinction
Herein because lust etc have waned  quite waned  with the realization of extinction and because that is this bare exhaustion as cessationbynonarising and because that is divorced from lust etc both associatively and objectively or else because when it is realized lust etc are entirely faded out driven out abolished therefore thatextinction is called waning and fading 
Then since in this case  no arising is evident no subsidence is evident no otherness  of what is present is evident therefore taking it that it neither is born nor ages nor dies  it is called deathless 
and it is called rarest in the sense of supremacy in the sense of nolittleness
Such  found  which he found  experienced obtained realized with the power of his own knowledge
The Sakyan Sage  Sakyan because of his coming of a Sakyan clan Sage because of his possession of the ideal of Stillness  the Sakyan himself as a sage is the  Sakyan Sage  
In concentration  with cognizance concentrated by means of the concentration which is a factor of the Noble Path
That True Ideal no equal has at all  That True Ideal which bears the names  waning  etc and was gained by the Sakyan Sage has no kind of ideal that is its equal at all
that is why it is said next in the Sutta quoted in    Bhikkhus in so far as there are True Ideals whether determined or undetermined fading out is accounted the foremost of them and so on
When the Blessed One had thus stated how extinction as the True Ideal is unequalled by other ideals he now in order to dispel for those creatures the plagues that had arisen invoked a TruthUtterance namely This Jewel rare is in the True Idea So may there by this very truth be safety which truthutterance has for its support the unequalledness of extinction as the True Idealunequalledness that is in the matter of such special qualities as waning fading deathlessness and rarity
Its meaning should be understood in the same way as in the preceding stanza 
And the command in this stanza was also obeyed by nonhuman beings in a hundred thousand myriad worldsystems
After expressing truth in this way by means of the special quality of the True Ideal as extinction he now began to express it with the words The Enlightened One most high a pureness praised doing so by means of the special qualities of the True Ideal as the path
Herein the term Enlightened One is explained in the way beginning  He is the discoverer of the truths   and he is most high since he is supreme and praiseworthy he is enlightened and he is most high thus he is the Enlightened One most high Or alternatively among those enlightened by another who are called Enlightened Ones  he is the most high thus he is  the Enlightened One most high
Such   praised  such as that Enlightened One most high commended and expounded in various instances in the way beginning The eightfold is the best of paths For it leads safe to Deathlessness and  Bhikkhus I shall expound to you the Noble Right Concentration with its support and requisite equipment 
Pureness  entire cleansing owing to its severance of the staining of defilement
Calling it concentration straightresulting  and which he called  straightresulting concentration since it produces its fruit quite certainly straightway next to its own occurrence
for when pathconcentration has arisen there is no obstacle whatever that can prevent the arising of its fruit
according as it is said
And were this person already entered upon the way to realization of the fruit of Stream Entry and were it the time for the aeon to be consumed by fire still the aeon would not be consumed by fire until that person had realized the fruit of Stream Entry This type of person is called a  holderup of an aeon 
and all those possessed of a path are holdersup of an aeon 
No equal is there to such concentration  to such pureness praised by the Enlightened One most high as  straightresulting concentration no formsphere concentration or formlesssphere concentration is there that is its equal at all
Why
Because even if someone is reborn somewhere or other in the world of High Divinity owing to the maintenance of these kinds of mundane concentration in being that still implies his liability to be reborn again perhaps in the hells etc and because when this kind of person is ennobled by maintenance of the Arahants supramundane concentration in being that implies the elimination of all rebirth
That is why it is said next in the Sutta quoted in    Bhikkhus in so far as there are determined True Ideals the Noble Eightfold Path is accounted the foremost of them   and so on
When the Blessed One had thus stated how this straightresulting concentration is unequalled by any other kinds of concentration he now in the way already stated  invoked a TruthUtterance namely This in the True Idea  which has for its support the unequalledness of the path as the True Ideal
Its meaning should be understood in the way already stated
And the command in this stanza was also obeyed by nonhuman beings in a hundred thousand myriad worldsystems
After expressing truth in this way by means of the special qualities of the Path as the True Ideal he now began to express it with the words Whom Those At Peace extol are the Eight Persons  doing so by means of the special qualities of the Community
Herein taking the meaning of this first line as follows  Whom Those At Peace extol are the Eight Persons whom is an indefinite indication
Persons are creatures
Are the eight is their numerical delimitation
for the four who have entered upon the way and the four who stand in the fruition of the way make eight
Those At Peace extol  praised by the true men  namely Enlightened Ones Hermit Enlightened Ones and Enlightened Ones disciples and by others both gods and men
Why
Because of their association with the conascent special qualities of virtue and the rest
For these have the conascent special qualities of virtue concentration etc just as campaka or vakula flowers etc have conascent colour scent etc and so are as dear and welcome to the wise as are flowers with excellent scent and so on to gods and men
That is why it is said  Whom Those At Peace extol are the Eight Persons
Or alternatively taking this line to mean instead The eight and a hundred persons who are extolled who is an indefinite indication
Persons are creatures
But in this interpretation eight and a hundred  is the numerical delimitation
For reckoning firstly those who stand in the fruitions of the four paths there are  kinds of Stream Enterer namely the SingleGerm the ClantoClan and the SevenatMost 
and then there are  kinds of OnceReturner according as they have attained their fruition in the sensualdesire existence  or in the existence with form or in the existence without form
And these multiplied by the four kinds of WayofProgress make 
Again in the Aviha lowest Pure Abode there are  kinds of NonReturner namely One who Attains Extinction Early in that next existence One who Attains Extinction More than Halfway through that next existence One who Attains Extinction Prompted by Determination One who Attains Extinction Unprompted by Determination and One who is Going Upstream Bound for the Akaniitha Gods 
and likewise in the Atappa the Sudassa and the Sudassi Pure Abodes
though in the Akanittha highest Pure Abode where there is not the last kind of NonReturner there are only four kinds so that the total of NonReturners is 
Lastly there are two kinds of Arahants namely the bareinsight worker and the one whose vehicle is quiet 
Then in addition there are the  who stand upon the paths
These all total  which if multiplied by  according to whether they have had faith for their charge or understanding for their charge  make a grand total of 
The rest is as already stated
Which are four pairs  all of these eightor one hundred and eightpersons indicated above in detail are in brief four pairs making him who stands upon the path of Stream Entry and him who stands upon the fruition of Stream Entry one pair and so on up to the pair consisting of him who stands upon the path of Arahantship and him who stands upon the fruition of Arahantship
They merit offerings  here they is the definite demonstrative for what was earlier indicated indefinitely by the word  whom
The persons who in detail were eightor a hundred and eightbut in brief are called the  four pairs they all merit offerings  are worthy of an offering
And an offering  is a thing to be given when it is given with faith in action and in the ripening of action without any expectation that  This  Persons associated with the special qualities of virtue etc are worthy of that and these are of that sort that is why it is said that they merit offerings 
The Sublime Ones true disciples  the Blessed One is sublime because of his association with a creditable manner of going  and because of his having gone only to a creditable place  and because of his having gone rightly  and because of his enunciating rightly 
Now all these are disciples of that Sublime One since they hear him
Of course others hear him too but when they have heard him they fail to do the task to be done These however when they have heard him reach the paths and fruitions by doing the task to be done in putting into practice the ideas that accord with the True Idea  which is why they are called  disciples 
Gifts given them repay a rich reward even small gifts given to disciples of the Sublime One repay a rich reward because they acquire that kind of purifiedness of offerings that is due to the purity of the receiver 
That is why it is said next in the Sutta quoted in  
Bhikkhus in so far as there are communities or societies the Community of the Perfect Ones disciples is accounted the foremost of them that is to say the four pairs of men the eight persons This community of the Blessed Ones disciples is    foremost in the ripening it gives 
When the Blessed One had thus stated a special quality of the CommunityJewel as all those who stand upon the paths and the fruitions of the paths he now invoked a TruthUtterance namely This   in the Community  which has for its support the special quality already mentioned
Its meaning should be understood in the way already stated
And the command in this stanza was also obeyed by nonhuman beings in a hundred thousand myriad worldsystems
After expressing truth in this way by means of the special qualities of the Path as the True Ideal he now began to express it with the words Whom Those At Peace extol are the Eight Persons  doing so by means of the special qualities of the Community

The Sublime Ones true disciples  the Blessed One is sublime because of his association with a creditable manner of going  and because of his having gone only to a creditable place  and because of his having gone rightly  and because of his enunciating rightly 
Now all these are disciples of that Sublime One since they hear him
Of course others hear him too but when they have heard him they fail to do the task to be done These however when they have heard him reach the paths and fruitions by doing the task to be done in putting into practice the ideas that accord with the True Idea  which is why they are called  disciples 
Gifts given them repay a rich reward even small gifts given to disciples of the Sublime One repay a rich reward because they acquire that kind of purifiedness of offerings that is due to the purity of the receiver

Bhikkhus in so far as there are communities or societies the Community of the Perfect Ones disciples is accounted the foremost of them that is to say the four pairs of men the eight persons This community of the Blessed Ones disciples is    foremost in the ripening it gives 
When the Blessed One had thus stated a special quality of the CommunityJewel as all those who stand upon the paths and the fruitions of the paths he now invoked a TruthUtterance namely This   in the Community  which has for its support the special quality already mentioned
Its meaning should be understood in the way already stated
And the command in this stanza was also obeyed by nonhuman beings in a hundred thousand myriad worldsystems
After expressing truth in this way by means of the special qualities of the Community that stands upon the paths and fruitions he now began to express it with the words  Such as by strength of mind in true vocation doing so by means of the special qualities of only those certain persons from among them who experience fruition with the exhaustion of all taints
Herein such as is an indefinite indication
In true vocation  they are thoroughly yoked  the meaning is that having abandoned the various kinds of improper search  they have begun to yoke themselves to insight supported by a livelihood purified from improper search for requisites
Or alternatively those who are called  in true vocation are those possessed of purified means consisting in body and speech  Thereby he shows their Virtue Category
By strength of mind manas dalhenadalhena manas showing dalha as adj by placing it before mano the meaning is with cognizance yoked by strong concentration
Thereby he shows their Concentration Category
Desireless dwell  being without regard for body and for life they have effected the departure from all defilements by means of energy harnessed to understanding
Thereby he shows their Understanding Category perfected by energy
In Gotamas dispensation  in only the dispensation of the Perfect One who was by race a Gotama
Thereby he shows the absence of any departure from defilements in the case of those who perform the various kinds of deathless penances outside that dispensation because of the absence in them of the special qualities of true vocation and so on
They is a definite demonstrative referring back to the indefinite indication  such above 
Have reached their goal  what ought to be readied is the goal  and what ought to be reached is what is worthy of being reached having reached which they are entirely safe from bondage This is a designation for the fruition of Arahantship They have  reached their goal by reaching that goal
The Deathless is extinction
By encountering  by encountering it as object
Gained laddhlabhitv 
Free from loss  without expense by not incurring even a farthings worth of expense
Quenching  the attainment of fruition wherein the disturbance of defilement is tranquillized
Savour  experience
What is meant
It is this Such as in this Gotamas dispensation are in the true vocation because their virtue is perfected and as are by strength of mind because their concentration is perfected desireless because their understanding is perfected such as they are said to have reached their goal when by encountering the Deathless by means of this right way they savour the fruitionattainment called quenching having gained it without loss
When the Blessed One had thus stated a special quality of the CommunityJewel as the persons whose taints are exhausted and who experience the bliss of that fruitionattainment he now invoked a TruthUtterance namely This   in the Community  which has for its support that alreadymentioned special quality
Its meaning should be understood in the way already stated
And the command in this stanza was also obeyed by nonhuman beings in a hundred thousand myriad worldsystems
After expressing truth in terms of  the Community in this way by means of the special quality of persons whose taints are exhausted he now began to express it with the words As a lockingpost doing so by means of the special quality of the Stream Enterer which is manifestly evident in the majority
Herein as is a term of comparison
A lockingpost  this is a term for the post made of heartwood hammered in after digging out the earth to a depth of eight or ten hands in the middle of the threshold of a city gateway its purpose being to holdfast the double gates of a city
The earth  the ground
Deepplanted in  set by entering into
Would be siybhaveyya alternative grammatical form
By the four winds blast  by the winds coming from the four directions
Unshaken  incapable of being shaken or moved
So too indeed  in suchwise
Is the True Man  the supreme man 
I say  I declare
That sees the Noble Truths by undergoing  who sees the four truths with understanding by having fully apprehended them
Herein the four truths should be understood in the way stated in the Visuddhimagga 
But here is the meaning of these lines in brief Just as a lockingpost deepplanted because of the depth of its base in the earth would be unshakable by the four winds so too I say is this true man who sees the Noble Truths by undergoing
Why
Because just as a lockingpost is unshaken by the four winds so he too is unshaken by all othersectarian winds and is incapable of being shaken or made to fall from that seeing by anyone at all
That is why it is said in a Sutta
 Bhikkhus suppose there were an iron post or lockingpost with a deep base well dug in immovable unshakable then if fierce gales and rain came from the eastern direction 
western    southern    northern direction they could never make it shake or shiver or shift
Why is that
Because the base was deep and because the lockingpost was well dug in
so too bhikkhus any monks or divines who have understood according as it is that This is suffering  that  This is the origin of suffering  that This is the cessation of suffering  and that  This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering  nevermore scan the face of another monk or divine in the expectation that  Surely this worthy one really knows and really sees
Why is that
Because the four Noble Truths have been well seen by them 
When the Blessed One had thus stated a special quality of the CommunityJewel as that of the Stream Enterer manifestly evident in the majority he now invoked a TruthUtterance namely This   in the Community which has for its support that same special quality
Its meaning should be understood in the way already stated
And the command in this stanza was also obeyed by nonhuman beings in a hundred thousand myriad worldsystems
After expressing the truth in this way in terms of the Community by means of the special quality of the Stream Enterer in general he now began to express it with the words Such as clearly discern the Noble Truths  by means of the special quality of the Sevenatmost
according as it is said
Here a certain person with the destruction of three fetters  is a Stream Enterer after generating only one existence he makes an end of suffering this one is a Singlegerm 
and likewise  After travelling and trudging through existences in two or three clans he makes an end of suffering this one is a Clantoclan
and likewise  After travelling and trudging through existences  among gods and men seven times he makes an end of suffering this one is a Sevenatmost 
He is the most junior of all the three kinds of Stream Enterer namely the Singlegerm the Clantoclan and the Sevenatmost
Herein such and Noble Truths are as already stated 
As clearly evince  they make exposed and evident to themselves by dispelling with the light of understanding the darkness of defilement that hides the truth
By Him Profound in Understanding  by him who owing to the measurelessness of his understanding has understanding that is founded on what is unobtainable by the knowledge belonging to the world with its gods what is meant is by him of omniscient knowledge
Well taught  properly taught by such and such methods namely by compound and resolution by whole and part and so on
Although they may be mightily neglectful  these persons who have clearly evinced the Noble Truths although they may be mightily neglectful owing to such opportunities for negligence as enjoyment of divine kingship or WheelTurning kingship still even in that case with the cessation and disappearance of a measure of actionresultant name and form that might beyond the seven existences specified have gone on arising in the beginningless round of rebirths were it not for the measure of cessation of determinativeact consciousness brought about by StreamEntry knowledge they can never take an eighth existence  But it is only in the seventh existence that they so develop insight as to reach Arahantship
When the Blessed One had thus stated a special quality of the CommunityJewel as that of the Sevenatmost he now invoked a TruthUtterance namely This   in the Community which has for its support that special quality just stated
Its meaning should be understood in the way already stated
And the command in this stanza was also obeyed by nonhuman beings in a hundred thousand myriad worldsystems
After expressing truth in this way in terms of the Community by means of the special quality of the  Sevenatmost that consists in not taking an eighth existence he now began to express it with the words  Along too with doing so by means of the special quality that even though he does take seven existences distinguishes him from other persons who have not abandoned the taking of existences 
Herein Along too with means together with 
His  of a certain one among those stated thus Still they can never take an eighth existence
Excellence in seeing  the excellence of the StreamEntry Path
for the StreamEntry Path is called seeing since it is first of all in the actual seeing of extinction which constitutes the excellence in the task to be done by seeing extinction  The manifestation of that in oneself is excellence in seeing along with that excellence in seeing
He comes to have abandoned three ideas  here the word su is merely a particle for filling out the line as in such passages as Idamsu me Sriputta mahvikata bhojanasmim  
consequently the meaning here is along with the excellence of his seeing he comes to have abandoned three ideas comes to have rejected them This is the meaning here
Now in order to show the ideas abandoned he said view of embodiment uncertainty and misapprehending virtue and duty all 
Herein there being a body it is the twentybased view about the factual pentad of categories of what is affected by clinging called a  body   that is the embodiment view  Or else an existent view about the body is also the embodiment view the meaning is then that it is a factual view about a body of the kind stated iethe view not its object is factual
Or again a view about an existent body is the embodiment view the meaning is then a view that has occurred about a factual body of the kind already stated taking it thus  It is form etc that is called  self   
With the abandoning of that all kinds of wrong view are abandoned too
since that is their root 
Understanding is called  wish to be cured  because it allays the sickness of defilement From that has departed this wishtobecured as understanding or that has departed from this wishtobecured as understanding thus it is uncertainty 
this is a designation for the eightbased indecision stated in the way beginning  He doubts about the teacher
With the abandoning of that all kinds of uncertainties are abandoned
since that is their root
The virtue consisting in oxvirtue dogvirtue  etc and the duty consisting in oxduty and dogduty etc which are stated in the texts about monks and divines outside this dispensation in the way beginning Purification by virtue  purification by duty  are called virtue and duty  With the abandoning of that all kinds of deathless penance beginning with nakedness and shavenness are abandoned
since that is their root It is because of that because the three mentioned are the roots of all kinds that all is said at the end of the three
And here it can be known that the embodiment view is abandoned through excellence in seeing suffering uncertainty through excellence in seeing the origin of suffering and misapprehension of virtue and duty through excellence in seeing the path and extinction
Having thus shown his abandoning of the Round of Defilement he now said immune from the four states of deprivation  pointing out the abandoning also of the Round of Actions Ripening which has to be when the Round of Defilement is
Herein the four states of deprivation  are the hells animals the ghost realm and the body of Asuras 
The meaning is that even if he takes seven existences he is nevertheless immune from rebirth among them
Having thus shown his abandoning of the Round of Actions Result he now said he cannot do the major six wrongdoings  pointing out the abandoning of the RoundofAction which is the root of that RoundofActionsResult
Major wrong doings are gross wrongdoings These which he cannot do are six
They are stated in the Book of Ones in the way beginning  Bhikkhus it is impossible it cannot happen that a person perfected in his view should deprive his mother of life   and they should be understood as the actions consisting in matricide parricide Arahanticide drawing the blood of a Perfect One causing schism in the Community and choosing someone other than the Enlightened One for ones teacher
They are mentioned more for the purpose of condemning the ordinary mans state since actually a Noble Disciple whose view is perfected does not even deprive an ant of life 
for an ordinary man does do even such greatly reprehensible major wrongdoings because his view is not perfected  but one whose seeing is perfected is unable to do them
The incapability is mentioned here in order to show that he does not do them even in the next existence
for in the next existence even if he does not know about his own noblediscipleship he does not in virtue of the essential idea of his nature do either these six or incur the five risks beginning with normal killing of breathing things which amount to six wrongdoings with the appointing of another than the Enlightened One for ones teacher on which latter account some read cha chbhithnni instead of cha cbhithnni
And the illustration here is the story of the boys who were noble disciples taking the dead fish  and so on
When the Blessed One had thus stated a special quality of the CommunityJewel as the special quality that even if he takes seven more existences distinguishes a noble disciple from other persons who have not abandoned being  he now invoked a TruthUtterance namely This   in the Community which has for its support that same special quality
Its meaning should be understood in the way already stated
And the command in this stanza was also obeyed by nonhuman beings in a hundred thousand myriad worldsystems
After expressing truth in this way in terms of the Community by means of the special quality that even if he takes seven more existences distinguishes a noble disciple from other persons who have not abandoned being  he now began to express it with the words  though he can still perform an evil action doing so by means of the special quality of absence of concealment of what he has done which is found in one whose seeing is perfected  even if he is negligent pointing out that not only is one whose seeing is perfected unable to do the six major wrongdoings but that he is unable after having done even the smallest evil action to conceal it
Here is the meaning He that is one perfected in his seeing though owing to his abiding in negligence due to forgetfulness he can still perform by body even an evil action  namely such reprehensible transgressions of training rules made known as are called  recoiled from by Enlightened ones for example having a hut built for himself without consulting the Community  sleeping in the same room as one not fully admitted to the Community  etc but at the same time always other than and excepting the kind of intentional action reprehended in the world and referred to by the Blessed One thus  My disciples do not transgress even for lifes sake a training rule made known to disciples by me  and though he can still perform evil actions by speech such as reciting the True Idea with explanations word byword together with one not fully admitted  teaching more than five or six phrases of the True Idea to a woman with no intelligent man present gossip and harsh speech and though he can still perform evil actions by mind such as occasional arousing of greed and hate as accepting gold and silver and as use of robes and the other three requisites without reviewing the purpose of using them
yet nevertheless he cannot conceal it he does not knowing that  This is unallowable should not be done  conceal such an action even for an instant but that very moment by revealing it to the teacher or to wise companions in the divine life he acts according to the True Idea restraining himself in what requires restraint thus  I shall not do that again
Why is that
Because this fact proclaims him that has seen the State of Peace  this fact of his inability to conceal such an evil act proclaims a person who has seen the State of Extinction and whose seeing is thereby perfected 
How
Bhikkhus just as a young tender prostrate infant at once draws back when he puts his hand or foot on a live coal so too this is essential to the idea of a person perfected in his view that although he may commit an offence of a kind from which a way of emergence has been made known
still he at once confesses reveals and discloses it to the teacher or to wise companions in the divine life and having done that he enters upon restraint for the future
When the Blessed One had thus stated a special quality of the CommunityJewel as the special quality of absence of concealment of what has been done which is found in one with excellence of seeing even if negligent he now invoked a TruthUtterance namely This  in the Community which has for its support that same special quality
Its meaning should be understood in the way already stated
And the command in this stanza was also obeyed by nonhuman beings in a hundred thousand myriad worldsystems
After expressing truth in this way in terms of the CommunityJewel by means of the several aspects in the special qualities of the types of persons included in the Community he now began to express truth with the words  As a tall forest tree with blossom crowned  doing so in terms of the Enlightened One and taking for its support that True Idea as Text that had already been taught by him when indicating the special qualities of the Three Jewels here in brief and elsewhere in detail 
Herein a  forest is a mass of trees defined as growing close together When matured in roots heartwood sapwood bark branches and foliage a tree  is a  talltree  A talltree in a forest is a tall forest tree  and it is that vanappagumbo that is called anappagumbe  for it is allowable to state it in this way as is done in such passages as Atthi savitakkasavicdre atthi avitakkavicramatte and Sukhe dukkhejive 
As is a term of comparison
With blossom crowned  phussitni aggni assaphussitaggo  the meaning is that it has produced flowers on all its twigs and branches
That normal form is here replaced by phussitagge in the way stated above for vanappagumbe
In the warm summer month the early heat  in one out of the four summer months
If it is asked In which month
 the answer is In the early heat the meaning is  in the month of Citta 
for that is also called the Early Heat and the New Aestival as well
From here onward the wordmeaning is evident
Now here is the meaning in brief Just as in the New Aestival named the Early Heat a  maturebush so named by using for it the metaphor of a young treeshrub  with its topmost branches in full blossom in a jungle forest of many sorts of trees is of extraordinary splendour so too with his displaying of the extinctionleading path which is such owing to the extraordinary splendour of its flowers classed under the different meanings of the Categories  Bases  etc the Foundations of Mindfulness  Right Endeavours  etc and the Categories of Virtue Concentration etc he displayed the glorious Ideal that consists of the texts and is extinctionleading  doing so not for the sake of gain or for the sake of worship etc but rather with his heart moved simply by the Great Compassion for the weal supreme of creatures
In the compound paramamhitya the nasal m is inserted for easier scansion of the stanza
the meaning being paramahitya nibbnya adesayi 
When the Blessed One had thus stated the True Idea consisting of the text comparing it to a tall forest tree crowned with blossom he now invoked a TruthUtterance in terms of the Enlightened One namely Thisin the Enlightened One which has for its support that same True Idea
Its meaning should be understood in the way already stated
only that it should be construed as follows This jewel rare called the  Ideal that consists of the text of the kind stated is in the Enlightened One
And the command in this stanza was obeyed by nonhuman beings in a hundred thousand myriad worldsystems
After expressing truth in this way in terms of the Enlightened One by means of the textual True Idea he now began to express it with the words  Glorious knower  doing so by means of the supramundane True Idea
Herein glorious is what is wished for by those bent on the rare thus  Oh that we might be like that  or else glorious because of association with glorious special qualities the meaning is supreme best
Knower  knower of extinction
for extinction is glorious as the supreme goal of all ideals  and he knew it by penetrating it for himself at the root of the Tree of Enlightenment
Giver siding with penetration of the Truths and siding with morality in the cases of the bhikkhus of the Group of Five or the young men of the Auspicious Group or the MattedHair Ascetics  and of others both gods and men
Bringer of glory  he is called  bringer of glory  because the glorious path was brought to light by him
For this Blessed One in fulfilling the whole thirty Perfections  from the time of his resolution made at the feet of the former Enlightened One Dipankara broughtto light the glorious ancient path travelled by former Fully Enlightened Ones  and that is why he is called bringer of glory
Furthermore he is glorious by his obtainment of omniscient knowledge  he is the knower of glory by his realizing extinction he is the giver of glory by his gift to creatures of the pleasure of deliverance and he is the bringer of glory by his bringing the supreme way
and with these supramundane special qualities he is peerless because of their absence in anyone else at all
Another method he is glorious with the fulfilment of his resolve to gain peace he is the knower of glory with the fulfilment of his resolve to gain understanding he is the giver of glory with the fulfilment of his resolve to gain generosity and he is the bringer of glory with the fulfilment of his resolve to gain truth since he brought the glorious PathTruth
Analagously he is glorious by his support of merit he is the knower of glory by his support of understanding he is the giver of glory by his bestowal of the means to Buddhahood upon those who seek that and he is the bringer of glory by his bringing the means to Hermit Buddhahood to those who seek that Being peerless owing to his having no like in these several ways or being himself selftaught without a teacher he taught a glorious True Ideal as a teacher of others because of his teaching of a glorious True Idealwhich is associated with the special qualities of being  well proclaimed  etcfor the purpose of bringing discipleship to those who seek that
The rest is as before
When the Blessed One had thus stated a special quality of his own as the ninefold supramundane True Ideal he now invoked a TruthUtterance in terms of the Enlightened One namely This    in the Enlightened One which has for its support that same special quality
Its meaning should be understood in the way already stated
only that it should be construed as follows This glorious supramundane True Ideal which he knew and gave and brought and taught this jewel rare is in the Enlightened One
And the command in this stanza was also obeyed by nonhuman beings in a hundred thousand myriad worldsystems
After expressing truth in this way with two stanzas in terms of the Enlightened One with the textual True Ideal and the supramundane True Ideal for its support he now began to express truth with the words  Consumed the old doing so once more in terms of the Community and taking for its support that special quality of reaching the element of extinction without residue of clinging left  which is the final goal of those who have already arrived at the ninefold supramundane True Ideal by practising the way according as they have heard it in hearing that textual True Ideal
Herein consumed is quite severed
The old  the prior 
The new  that occurring right now 
No more gives being  that without factual manifestation
From cognizance lust faded  lust has departed from their cognizance
For new being  for renewed being in the future extent
They  those bhikkhus with taints exhausted for whom the old is used up and the new no more gives being and from whose cognizance lust for new being has faded
The germ consumed  their germ of future being is cut off
Have no more zeal for growth  devoid of zeal for growth
They go out  they stop burning
Steadfast  those perfected in steadfastness 
As did this lamp yathayam padipo like this lamp
What is meant
It is this The old pasttime action is although it has already arisen and ceased still unconsumed for ordinary creatures since it is still capable of inducing their rebirthlinking owing to their not having abandoned the germsoftening moisture of craving but there are those in whom the moisture of craving has been dried out by the Arahant path and for whom that old action is thus consumed like germs burnt up by fire since it is no more capable of giving any ripening in the future
then any action of theirs occurring right now as honouring the Enlightened One etc is called  the new but they are those for whom it no more gives being  since owing to the abandonment of craving it is no more capable of fruiting in the future than the flower of a plant whose roots have been cut and these from whose cognizance lust for new being has faded with the abandoning of craving are the bhikkhus with taints consumed called with the germ consumed  because the actionresultant rebirthlinking consciousness stated thus Action is the field consciousness is the seed  has been consumed with the consumption of action
and then because the zeal that there formerly was for the renewal of being called  growth 
has been abandoned precisely by abandoning the origin of suffering they have no more zeal for growth as they formerly had because no more being is given at the time of death And because they are steadfast with perfection of steadfastness they go out as did this lamp with the ceasing of the final consciousness They go beyond any mode of description again such as  with form formless and so on 
And it seems one lamp among those that had been lit to honour the city deities on that occasion actually went out and it was with reference to that that he said  as did this lamp
When the Blessed One had thus stated the special quality of extinction without residue of clinging left as the final goal of those who have arrived at the ninefold supramundane True Ideal  by penetration in accordance with what they had learnt after learning the textual True Ideal both stated in the two preceding stanzas  he now concluded the teaching by invoking a TruthUtterance in terms of the Community namely This    in the Community which has for its support that same special quality
Its meaning should be understood in the way already stated
only that it should be construed as follows This jewel rare called the taintexhausted bhikkhus extinction of the kind already stated is in the Community
And the command in this stanza was obeyed by nonhuman beings in a hundred thousand myriad worldsystems
Then Sakka Ruler of Gods thought  Safety has been brought to the city by the Blessed Ones invocation of a TruthUtterance that has for its support the special quality of the Three Jewels Now something must be said by me for the citys safety supported by the special quality of the Three Jewels  and so he uttered these final stanzas  Whatever beings there are Herein the Enlightened One is called thusgone  since he has thus come to what has to become to by those who undertake activity for the sake of the benefit of the world and since he has thus gone to what has to be gone to by them and since he has thus known what has to be known by them and since he has enunciated only what is real 
And then he is exceedingly honoured by the aid generated by gods and men outwardly with flowers incense etc and by that generated in themselves with practice according to the True Idea and so on Consequently Sakka Ruler of Gods associated the whole assembly of gods with himself in saying Come let us laud the Enlightened One thus gone Honoured of gods and men may there be safety 
Then in the case of the True Idea first the True Idea as the Path is called thusgone  since as what has to be gone by means of the power of quiet and insight coupled together  it is thus gone by one who is shedding what favours defilement
and then the True Idea as extinction is called  thus gone  since it is gone by Enlightened Ones etc in such a way that being gone and penetrated by understanding in that way  it ensures the abolition of all suffering
Then the Community is called  thus gone since it has thus gone by the respective four paths which have to be gone by those practising the way of ones own welfare
Consequently in the two remaining stanzas he said respectively    the True Idea thusgone Honoured of gods and men may there be safety and  the Community thusgone Honoured of gods and men may there be safety
The rest is as already stated 
When Sakka Ruler of Gods had uttered this trio of stanzas he departed keeping the Blessed One on his right and he went to the city of the gods with his godly assembly
But the Blessed One preached that same Jewel Discourse on the following day too and again eightyfour thousand breathing things attained to the True Ideal And so too he preached it up till the seventh day and each day there occurred a like attainment to the True Ideal
When the Blessed One had lived at Vesli for a fortnight he announced his departure to the regents
Thereupon the regents conducted him to the banks of the Ganges in three days with redoubled worshipping
The royal Ngas born in the Ganges thought Human beings are worshipping the Perfect Oneso why should not we  and so they had boats built of gold and silver and gems and they had them fitted out with thrones made of gold and silver and gems as well Then they had the water covered over with lotuses of the five colours When this was done they went to the Blessed One and said  Do us the favour
The Blessed One consented He boarded a jewelled boat and each of the five hundred bhikkhus boarded a jewelled boat for himself
The royal Ngas took the Blessed One and the five hundred bhikkhus into the Nga Realm
where the Blessed One spent the whole night in teaching the True Idea to an assembly of Ngas
On the following day they made a great almsgiving with heavenly eatables and comestibles The Blessed One gave his blessing and then he came forth from the realm of the Nga 
Thereupon the earth deities thought  Human beings and Ngas are worshipping the Perfect One so why should not we  and they raised parasols and superparasols on the tall forest trees and the rocks and so on
And it so happened that there was a grand ceremonial worshipping right up as far as the NotJunior Realm in the Pure Abodes in the world of High Divinity
And then Bimbisra with twice the worshipping accorded by the Licchavis at the time of his coming to them
conducted the Blessed One to Rjagaha in five days in the way already described
After the Blessed One had arrived back at Rjagaha when the bhikkhus were gathered in the meetinghall after the meal the following talk meanwhile arose among them  Oh how mighty the Blessed One is for whose sake the ground high and low on both banks of the Ganges is levelled and strewed with sand and covered with flowers for a distance of eight leagues and the water of the Ganges is covered with manycoloured lotuses for the distance of a league and parasols and superparasols are raised right up as far as the NotJunior Realm
The Blessed One knew what was happening So he came forth from the Scented Cell and travelling by means of a marvel suited to the moment he went to the meetinghall and sat down on the glorious Enlightened Ones seat made ready
When he had done so he asked Bhikkhus for what talk are you gathered here now 
The bhikkhus told him all The Blessed One said  Bhikkhus the occurrence of this grand ceremonial honour is not due to any might of mine as an Enlightened One nor is it due to the might of Ngas gods or High Divinities Rather is its occurrence due to the might of former acts of giving up what is of relative value 
The bhikkhus said Venerable sir we have no knowledge of the giving up of what is of relative value Venerable sir it would be good if the Blessed One would tell about it so that we may have knowledge of it
The Blessed One said  Bhikkhus at Taxila there was once a Divine called Sankha
and he had a son called Susima a sixteenyearold student
One day Susima went to his father and stood at one side
His father asked  What is it my dear Susima 
  I want to go to Benares and learn the priestly craft he replied
  Then my dear Susima there is the Divine named soandso there who is a friend of mine Go and learn from him  He gave him a thousand kahpanas
The son took the money and after paying homage to his father and mother he set out Eventually he arrived at Benares where he approached the teacher in a manner conforming with the accepted formalities and after paying homage to him he announced his identity
The teacher accepted the student as the son of his friend and accorded him every hospitality
As soon as the student had rested from the fatigue of his journey he placed the thousand kahpanas at his teachers feet and asked for permission to learn the craft
The teacher gave his permission and proceeded to teach him
He learnt quickly and much and whatever he learnt he retained without loss just as though it had been lion oil kept in a gold vessel In a few months he finished what would normally have been a twelveyear course
 However whilst saying it over he found that he saw only a beginning and a middle but no end
Then he went to his teacher and said  I see a beginning and a middle of this craft but I see no end 
  I too am just the same my dear  his teacher said
 Then who is there now who knows the end of this craft
  There are Seers at lsipatana my dear they might know
  I shall go and ask
 Ask as you please my dear 
 He went to lsipatana and he approached the Hermit Enlightened Ones and asked  Do you know a beginning and a middle and an end
  Yes friend we know
  Train me in that too
  In that case friend you will have to go forth into homelessness No one who has not gone forth can do that training
  Good venerable sirs Give me the Going Forth Do whatever is necessary to have me know the end
 They gave him the Going Forth Not being able to instruct him in a meditation subject as a Fully Enlightened One could have done they had him train in the simple essentials of good conduct in the way beginning You should wear the waistcloth like this you should put on the upper robe like this 
He trained in that and since he had within him the already perfected support for progress in understanding it was not long before he discovered Hermit Buddhahood
He became known throughout Benares as the Hermit Buddha Susima he attained the summit of gain and fame and he had an excellent following
However since action that he had performed in the past was of a kind that led to a short lifespan he soon attained final extinction
The Hermit Buddhas and a great body of people saw to the disposal of his physical frame and they took the relics and built a monument for them at the citygate
 Then Sankha the Divine thought  My son has been gone a long time and I know nothing of what has happened to him  So wanting to see his son he set out from Taxila and eventually came to Benares He saw a large crowd gathered and thinking  Surely one at least among so many will know what has happened to my son  he went up to the crowd and asked  There is a student called Susima who came here Perhaps you may know what has happened to him 
 They said  Yes Divine we know He became expert in the three Vedas under a divine of this city and then he went forth into homelessness under the Hermit Buddhas and eventually attained extinction by the element of extinction without residue of clinging left This monument was built for him 
Weeping and lamenting he struck the ground with his hand Then he went to the shrineterrace He weeded it of grass in his own cloak he brought sand which he strewed on the Hermit Buddhas shrineterrace and he watered it with a wateringpot Then he did honour to the shrine with wild woodland flowers hung up a cloth banner and fixed his own parasol above the shrine After that he departed
When the Blessed One had thus shown the past history he gave the bhikkhus a discourse on the True Idea in order to provide the sequence connecting that former birth with the present
 Bhikkhus you might think  Doubtless someone else was Sankha the Divine on that occasion  but it should not be so regarded I was Sankha the divine on that occasion It was by me that Susima the Hermit Buddhas shrineterrace was weeded of grass and as the outcome of that action of mine the eightleague path was cleared of stumps and thorns levelled and cleaned
It was by me that the sand was strewn there and as the outcome of that action of mine they strewed the eightleague path with sand
It was by me that honour was done there with wild woodland flowers and as the outcome of that action of mine they made a flowercovering with many kinds of flowers on the nineleague path by land and water
It was by me that the ground there was watered with a wateringpot and as the outcome of that action of mine it rained down in torrents on Vesli
It was by me that the cloth banner was hung upon his monument and the parasol fixed above it and as the outcome of that action of mine banners were hung up and parasols and super parasols raised right up as far as the NotJunior Gods Realm
So bhikkhus the occurrence of this grand ceremonial honour is not due to any might of mine as the Enlightened One nor is it due to the might of Ngas Gods or High Divinities rather is its occurrence due to the might of former acts of giving up what is of relative value
At the end of this discourse on the True Idea he uttered this stanza
Now if a man should see full pleasure In giving up relative pleasure
Then let him give up relative pleasure Seeing steadfast full pleasure there 
And the Lord having risen early and taken his robe and bowl went with his order of monks to Salavatika
As the elder listened closely to this teaching on the development of the enlightenment factors it is said the thought occurred to him When I penetrated the truths on the seventh day of my going forth these enlightenment factors became manifest 
Thinking The Masters teaching is indeed emancipating his blood became clear his bodily humours were purified and the disease departed from his body like a drop of water fallen on a lotas leaf
Evaṃ me sutaṃ thus is ḷavaka Sutta 
What is the origin
Its origin will become āvi  even in the manner of elucidating the meaning
Again in the elucidation of the meaning Evaṃ me sutaṃ ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā  this meaning has but been spoken of
ḷaviyaṃ vihar ati ḷavakassa yakkhassa bhavane thus here however which ḷavī Moreover why did the Blessed One dwell in the bhavana of that yakkha  Should it be said
By saying ḷavīthus it may be the kingdom also and the city which have been spoken of both of them also befit here
Although indeed dwelling near the city of ḷavī ḷaviyaṃ viharati  thus it is spoken of
In the not faroff vicinity of that city as well or a distance to the extent of a gāvuta is that bhavana  residing in the kingdom of ḷavī it is stated as ḷaviyaṃ viharati   This bhavana is in the kingdom of ḷavī
 Since however king ḷavaka after having deserted the enjoyment of different varieties of dancing damsels used to go game hunting on each and every seventh day for the purpose of keeping away raglike robbers  of restraining rival rulers and of exerting himself  he one day made a pledge mutually with his fighting forces to this effectHe by whose side the game animal escapes is himself even responsible 
 Later the deer fled by the side of that sovereign himself even the speedy sovereign after having caught hold of his bow pursued that beast for three leagues on foot even 
The deer of eṇī category are with their speedlimit of three leagues only
Later the king killed that deer which had kept itself standing after having entered a lake of water when its momentum had become allround exhausted  cut it into two parts and kept on coming back bringing the same with him by means of a carrying pole for the purpose of escaping any discredit with such a remark asHe was not able to capture the deer  although he was not in need of meat  after having sighted a huge banyan tree with heavy leafy foliage not far from his city the king approached its foot for the purpose of removing his fatigue 
At that nigrodha as well the ogre ḷāvaka after having gained the priviledge from the presence of Mahārāja took his proper residence  devouring living beings whichever had entered the space which had been touched by the shade of that tree at noontide 
That ogre after having sighted the king  approached the latter to devour him
Then the king made his pledge mutually with that ogre thusYou should set ne free to you daily I shall send a human being as well as a thālipāka 
The ogre did not give freedom sayingHaving been intoxicated with royal enjoyment you will betray yourself on the other hand I am not allowed to eat any one who has not approached  my dwelling as well as what has not been agreed upon  that I would lose you also
 After having granted himself thusOn that day when I do not send what I promised to you  you should seize me and devour me the king on having been set free by thr ogre went in the direction of his city
 The body of troops who had remained after having pitched a camp  on the side of the road  sighted the king welcomed the latter after having gone forward to meet him asking their sovereign thusO great king Why did you tire yourself in this way from your fear of mere desrepute 
 The king did not inform his army of that incident  went to city had his breakfast  called the nagaraguttika and informed hin this matter 
The officerincharge of the city enquired of his monarch thusYour Majesty What time limit has been made 
 The king replied thusO my minister It has not been made
 The reaction wasYour majesty It has been badly done  indeed nonhumanbeing gain to the extent of having been made limitted even when the limit has not been made there will become ailment of the district
let it be your majesty Though you have done in this way whatsoever you should enjoy the bliss of sovereighty without worry  I shall carry out what ought to be done here
He rose up even early in the morning went to the bandhanāgāra  and suggested thusLet him who likes to live come out  hinting at there and those who were vajjhā 
He sent him who come out first and formost saying Go and give this thālipāka to the ogre after having led him to his home had him bathed and made him eat his meal as well
the oger  after having created his frightful body and devoured him even immediately on his entry into the base of the tree as if mūlakanda 
It is said that owing to ānubhāva of an ogre the whole body of humanbeings beginning from the hair of the head etc becomes like a lump of fresh butter 
After having seen that maneating ogre people who had to go along to have the food taken to the ogre  had become full of fear and accordingly informed about it to their friends
Thereafter beginning from that event people abstained from acts of theft sayingThe king gave the thieves to the ogre after having had them arrested 
 Thereafter on the subsequent occasion with the absence of new thieves and all round exhaustion of old robbers the prisons became empty
 Then the nagaraguttika reported to the king
The monarch had his own wealth discarde on the carriage roads of the city Perhaps it may be possible that someone would collect out of greed 
No one touched that wealth with the tip of his toe even
Not getting thieves that king informed his ministers
The ministers suggested thusWe should send the aged one after another on the serial order of families  that aged person ordinarily also moves towards the mouth of death 
The monarch made his prohibition thusPeople will agitate sayingthe sovereign sent our father and our grand father do not set your mind on this
The ministers put up their alternative proposal thus Well then your majesty We should send a babyboy who lies on its back  to such a babyboy in deed as that there does not exist any such affectionate attachment as My mother my father
The king gave his royal approval 
they did likewise
In the city mothers of baby boys caught hold of their sons of pregnant ladies fled from  made their baby boys grow up in another district and brought them back
In this way all that had happened also had lasted for twelve years
 Thereafter one day after having made an investigating search all over the city the ministers did not get a single baby boy even and made their report to their monarch thusYour majesty After having left aside your son prince ḷāvaka in the innercity there does not exist any baby boy in the city
The king gave his orders thusAccording as my son is affectionate to me in the same manner of the whole world  however there is none dearer than oneself you should go after having given him also you should protect my life
On that occasion as well the mother of prince ḷāvaka had her babyboy bathed dressed up decoratively and was seated after having made him sleep on her lap after having made a pillow of very fine cloth
the royal retainers under orders of the king went there caught hold of that baby prince and took their departure along with his wet nurse while the mother of that prince along with sixteen thousand women were wailing sayingThe prince will become the eatable tomorrow
On that day as well the Blessed One got up again at dawn  entered upon mahākaruṇāsamāpatti in his fragrant chamber at the massive monastery of jetavana kept looking at the world again and saw the upanissaya for attaining to the fruition of anāgāmi of the babyprince ḷāvaka and the upanissaya sotāpatti of the ogre as well and for the proper gain of spiritual eye of eighty four thousand living beings at the end of his teaching of the truth 
Therefore when the night dawned into daybreak after having done his forenoon duty  without having finished doing his afternoon duty even  when the Sabbath day of the waning half was turning out to be  when the sun had gone down  took his bowl and robe all alone without any companion  went on foot even to a distance of thirty leagues from Sāvatthi and entered the dwelling of that ogre 
On that account it has been told thusḷavakassa yakkhassa bhavane  
 Should it be asked thus  what however was it Did the Blessed One take up his residence at the foot of that banyan tree in which was the dwelling if ḷavaka or in the very dwelling itself
The answer is in the very dwelling itself
Indeed even according as ogres see their own dwelling  likewise did the Blessed One also
The latter went there and stood at the door of the dwelling 
At that time it so happened that ḷavaka had gone to the meeting of ogres in the Himavanta 
consequent upon that the ogre named Gadrabha the doorkeeper of ḷavaka approached the Blessed One  whom he paid his homage and asked thus Venerable sir Why has the Blessed One come at the wrong time
 The reply was O Gadrabha Yes I have come
if it is not troublesome to you  I would stay a night in the dwelling of ḷavaka
 The doorkeeper responded thus Venerable Sir It is not troublesome to me all the same indeed that ogre is kakkhala  pharusa  he does not do the paving of homage etc even to his mother and father do not set the mind of the Blessed One on his stay here
 Buddhas reply was O Gadrabha I know about the state of his being cruel  there will not be any danger  if it does not inconvenience you I would stay a night
 For the second time also the ogre Gadrabha spoke thus to the Blessed One  Venerable sir ḷavaka is similar to a kapāla heated by fire  he does not understand whether one is his mother or his father or a monk or a brahmin nor does he understand what the truth is he makes cittakkhepa of those who had come here he breaks their heart  after having seized them by their legs also he throws them either to the other ocean or another universe 
 For the second time also the Blessed One spoke thus O Gadrabha I do know of it should it not trouble you I would stay a night
 For the third time also the ogre Gadrabha spoke of this to the Blessed One  Venerable Sir ḷavaka resembles a kapāla heated by fire whether she is his mother or whether he is his father or whether he is a monk or a brahmin or whether it is the truth  he does not understand he makes madness also of those who have arrived here he has their hearts broken also after having held them by their legs he throws them away to a different ocean or to another universe 
For the third time also the Blessed One said thus O Gadrabha I know about it if it does not inconvenience you I would stay a night
 Gadrabha replied thus It is no trouble to me all the same indeed that ogre would deprive me giving you permission without having informed him of my life venerable sir I am going to inform him
 Buddha responded saying O Gadrabha According as you are happy you should do so 
 Gadrabha reacted saying Venerable Sir Well then you yourself should understand after having paid his homage to the Blessed One took his departure in the direction of Himavanta 
The door of the dwelling also even by itself gave an opening for ingress to the Blessed One
The Blessed One entered the inside of the dwelling  sat down on that very divinely gemdecorated pedestal where lavaka took his seat and enjoyed himself the glory on the specially earmarked auspicious days  and released his gold radiance 
After having seen that splendour  the ladies of the ogre came over paid their homage to the Blessed One and sat themselves down after having surrrounded the Blessed One
The latter made a miscellanious teaching to them in such a manner as starting with Formerly  after offering charity having taken upon yourselves the observance of moral precepts  made respectful offering to those who were worthy of honour you have achieved this prosperity  now also you should do in that very manner do not dwell having been overwhelmed by issā and macchariya mutually
After having heard the sweet speech of the Blessed One they as well kept themselves seated even after having offered their thousands of thankful congratulations to the Blessed One whom they kept surrounded
Gadrabha also reached Himavanta and informed to ḷavaka thus O dear friend  yagghe and you would know  in your dwelling  the Blessed One has been seated
 ḷavaka showed his gesture to Gadrabha thus Be silent  I shall go and do what should be done
 It is said that ḷavaka became embaressed owing to his manly pride  therefore he made that prohibition thus Do not let anyone hear in the midst of the audience  
 At that time Sātāgira and himavata after having paid their homage to the Blessed One at Jetavana even went through the sky on different varieties of vehicles along with their retinue  saying to themselves We shall go to the meeting of the ogres 
 In the sky as well there does not exist for the ogres a road everywhere after having taken care of the vimāna  there is right of way only at the region for road 
One the other hand the dwelling was one which stood on the earth  well watched  surrounded by a wall well furnished with gateways watchtowers and citygates wellcovered above with bronze nets similar to a mañjūsā  three leagues in height
above it was the road
Those were not able to go after having reached that region 
Indeed no one is able to go above the seated site of Buddhas until the highest heaven is reached till then
After having reflected upon thus Why is this  they sighted the Blessed One descended from the sky similar to dropping down of a clod of earth which had been thrown up into the sky paid their homage to Buddha whose teaching of the truth they listened to and whom they circumambulated and proceeded to the meeting of ogres praising Buddha with three vatthu and sayingO Blessed One We are going to the meeting of ogres 
 ḷavaka met the two of them and made room for them after having moved back saying You should sit here
They communicated to lavaka thus Gain is to you O ḷavaka In that dwelling of yours the Blessed One is staying  O friend You should go and attend upon the Blessed One
 in this way the Blessed One stayed in the dwelling even not at the foot of that nigrodha which was the residence of ḷavaka 
therefore it has been stated thus Ekaṃ samayaṃ Bhagavā ḷaviyaṃ viharati ḷāvakassa yakkhassa bhavane 
 Then indeed ḷavaka  said this to the Blessed One Nikkhama samaṇa 
if asked  Why however did this one say this 
  The answer is owing to the condition of the ogres desire to make angry 
There in this way starting from the beginning sambandha should be understood Indeed since this saddhākathā is dukkathā to one who is without pious faith similar to sīlādikathā  therefore after having heard of the praise of the Blessed One from the presence of those ogres ḷavaka became one whose heart was in a state of frenzy owing to his internal anger  similar to salt and sugar which have been thrown into the fire and asked thus Who is he known as the Blessed One  who had entered my dwelling 
Those made their reply thus O friend Do you not know our Master the Blessed One It was He who after having abided in the Tusita mansion took five types of great look  in the manner starting thus after having spoken about the thirtytwo foreshadowing signs starting with conception until his teaching of Dhammacakkappavattana  the two of them urgingly enquired ḷavaka after it thus O friend Did you not see these wonders also
Although he had seen them ḷavaka replied I did not see under the influence of anger 
The two made their remark thus O friend ḷavaka Whether you have seen or not what is the matter with you either by seeing or by not seeing What will you do to our Master You who are compared with him seem to be similar to a recently born calf near a big bull which has a quivering hump  similar to a young of an elephant near an enormous elephant which has three types of breaches to be in rut  resembling an aged jackal in the vicinity of king of beasts who has bright hanging down mane and beautified back similar to a small son of a crow with its wings cut off close to a wellwinged birdking with its welldeveloped body of the size of one hundred and fifty leagues go and do that which should be done by you
 On having been told in this way the angered ḷavaka rose up stood on the surface of manosilā on his left leg and trod upon the peak of Kelāsa hill which was sixty leagues in height by means of his right foot saying You should see now whether your Master is greatly powerful or I am  That hill released its splinters like lumps of iron which had been blown off having been hit by an iron hammer 
He stood there and proclaimed thus I am ḷavaka the sound spread over the entire island of Jambu 
 Cattāro kira saddā It is said that four sorts of sounds were heard in the entire island of Jambu   the sound which Puṇṇaka the commanderinchief of the army of ogres  after having defeated the king known as Dhanañcayakorabya in the playing at dice shouted out thus Ahaṃ jini  after having clapped his hands  the sound which Sakka the sovereign of divine beings at the time when the sāsana of the Blessed One Kassapa was waning all round made the young divinebeing Vissakamma assume the appearance of a dog and had him shouted out thus I am devouring evil monks and bad bhikkhunīs as well as wiched male and female devotees and those adhammavādī also  the sound which the great man shouted out thus Ahaṃ Sīhassarakusa mahārājā  in Kusajātaka when the city was beseiged by seven sovereigns who came to claim Pabhāvatī after he had come out of the city along with Pabhāvatī whom he brought making her ride on the back of his elephant the sound which ḷavaka after having stood on the top of Kelāsa hill thus I am ḷavaka
 Indeed at that time it looked like that the shouting out had been made after having stood at every doorway in the entire island of Jambu  Even himavā hill which had a height of three thousand yojamas as well shook owing to the power of the ogre 
 That ogre ḷavaka raised Vātamaṇḍalaṃ saying By means of this even I shall make the monk run away 
 Those winds classified as the east wind etc rose broke asunder such hillpeaks as were half a league a full league two leagues and three leagues in height  rooted out forests of bushy shrubs trees etc went to the city of ḷavī kept on crushing into powder wornout elephent sheds  etc and made the rooftiles roll in the sky
The Blessed One made his resolution thus Let there be no uparodha to any and every one
Those whirlwinds  after having reached Dasabala were not able to have the mere mergin of the robe even
Thereafter the ogre ḷavaka raised mahāvassaṃ saying I shall kill the monk by submerging him in rainwaters 
 Owing to his ānubhāva rainclouds classified as a hundred sheets a thousand linings one above the other rose up and poured down the rainshower  with the speed of the showers of rain  there became erosions of earth the formidable flood which above forests of trees etc did come but was not able to moistem even to the extent of a dewdrop in the robe of Dasabala Buddha
Thereafter the ogre ḷavaka raised pāsānavassaṃ  big and massive mountainpeaks which kept on sending out smoke and burning ablaze came through the sky reached Dasabala Buddha and became a divine cluster of garlands 
Thereafter the ogre ḷavaka promoted paharaṇavassaṃ  shower from one and shower from both of smoking and blazing swords spears razors arrows etc came through the sky reached Dasabala and became divine flowers
Thereafter the ogre promoted aṅgāra vassaṃ  burning embers bearing the colour of the flameoftheforest flowers came through the sky and scattered themselves after having become divine flowers at the base of the feet of the Dasabala
Thereafter the ogre promoted the Kukkulavassaṃ  excessively hot ash came through the sky and fell down at the base of the feet of Dasabala after having become sweetscented sandal powder
Thereafter promoted vālukāvassaṃ  extremely subtle sandgrains smoking and blazing came through the sky and fell down at the base of the feet of Dasabala after having become celestial flowers
Thereafter promoted kalalavassaṃ  that smoking and blazing shower of mud came through the sky and fell down at the base of the feet of Dasabala after having become heavenly perfume 
Thereafter promoted andhakāraṃ saying After having frightened him I shall make the monk run away
 That darkness became similar to that sort of darkness which was endowed with four characteristic  reached Dasabala and the dardness disappeared as if it was dispelled by the bright light of the sun
 In this way the ogre not being able to make the Blessed One run away by means of these nine sorts of showers wind rain stone hit ember ash sand mud and darkness went forward himself even with an army of four divisions jumbled together with hordes of superhuman beings with many a manner of visible forms  holding different varieties of striking weapons  to the Blessed One
Those hordes of bhūta after having made many manners of changes were as if they had been coming above the Blessed One saying You should seize you should slaughter   moreover they looked like flies  blown off iron balls  but they were not able even to adhere to the Blessed One
In spite of being in this way according as Māra made his retreat even by the time he reached bodhimaṇḍa  in that manner the did not turn back but made themselves perplexed to the extent of half a night
Not being able to make the Blessed One shake even by showing many a manner of definitely dreadful objects to the extent of half a night ḷavaka thought thusWhat if I were to release dussāvudha which is unconquerable by any one 
 It is said that four weapons Cattāri kira āvudhāni are the most excellent in the worldthe diamond weapon of Sakka  the iron club weapon of Vessavaṇa  the eye weapon of Yama  and the woven textile weapon of ḷavaka
Indeed if Sakka the angered would hit his diamond weapon at the top of mount Meru  it would peircingly penetrate into mount Meru which is sixtyeight thousand over and above a hundred thousand leagues and go in the direction below 
the released iron club of Vessavaṇa at the time when he was a puthujjana usually stood within handreach  having come back again after having beheaded many thousands of ogres
on being merely looded at by enraged Yama with his eyeweapon many a thousand of Kumbhaṇḍa who would be vibrating get destroyed similar to sesame seeds in a heated frying pan 
should ḷavaka in his fury release his weapon of woven ware into the sky there would be no fall of rainshower for twelve years
should he release it on to the earth all trees reeds and grass etc would dry up and would not grow again within twelve years
should he release it in to the ocean all the water would evaporate like a drop of water in a heated frying pan 
should he release it on to a mountain resembling mount Meru even that mountain would break into pieces and scatter 
That ogre ḷavaka took off his thus highly powerful weapon of woven ware which he had converted to be his cloak and collected it 
Generally the divine beings if ten thousand lokadhātu speedily assembled together saying Today the Blessed One will subdue ḷavaka we should listen to the teaching of the truth there
 The divinebeings who were desirous of seeing the fighting also assembled together
In this way the entire sky also was allround full with divinebeings 
 Then ḷavaka after having wandered about higher and higher above in the vicinity of the Blessed One released his weapon of wearing apparel 
that weapon kept on making frightening noise smoking and blazing in the sky similar to lightning and after having reached the Blessed One dropped down at the base of the feet of the Blessed One after having become a torn piece of cloth for wiping feet for the purpose of crushing the pride of the ogre
After having noticed it ḷavaka became devoid of splendour and deprived of intoxication with his flag of pride fallen down like a bovine bull whose horns have been cut off  and similar to a snake whose fangs had been pulled out  and thought thus Even my weapon of wearing attire did not overwhelm the monk what indeed is the cause 
 This the reason  The monk is devoted to dwelling with loving kindness  now I am going to adequately apply with loving kindness after having made him angry 
 By means of this sambandha this statement has been made Atha kho ḷavako yakkho yena Bhagavā  nikkhama samaṇa where the Blessed One was  O monk Do come out
There this is the significance Why do you enter my dwelling without having had my permission and have been seated in the midst of my harem as if you were the owner of my house without having been approved of by me Is this not befitting for a monk this  namely enjoyment of what has not been offered  as well as mixing with ladies Therefore you who are established in the performance of monks duties should come out O monk
Some scholars on the other hand which constitute pharusa words made this statement 
 Then after having understood thus Since it is not possible to discipline an obdurate one by means of retaliatory obduracy  indeed when the retaliatory obduracy is being done just as for example  if one were to break the pitta at the nose of a quicktempered dog it would become all the more fierce to a greater extent  in the same manner he is going to be more obdurate  with mildness however it is possible to discipline him the Blessed One came out after having accepted his word by saying sweetly thus very well  O friend
Therefore it has been told thus Sādhāvuso ti bhagavā nikkhami 
 Consequent upon that ḷavaka became mildminded saying to himself thus Affable  indeed is this monk he has come out even with my single saying  in this way however it is easier to make him come out even without any rhyme or reason  I attacked him the whole night by giving him battle  again the ogre thought thus Presently for the time being it is not possible to understand as to whether he has come out owing to his being affable or because of his anger  I am going to test him now
 Consequent upon that the ogre said Pavisa samaṇa 
 Then again also the Blessed One entered saying sweetly thus Sādhāvuso  for the purpose of making decision on his mildmindedness as Suvaco 
 Testing again and again that very condition of being affable ḷavaka for the second and third time also said thus Nikkhama pavīsa 
 The Blessed One also did likewise
If the Blessed One would not do the mind of the ogre which was normally obdurate  after having become worse in obduracy and would not turn out to be a receptacle for the teaching of the truth 
according as a mother appeases her crying child after having given of done that which the latter desires in that manner in order to appease the ogre who had been weeping with the cry of kilesa the Blessed One did that which he spoke of
Again according as a wet nurse makes a child who refuses to have itself nourished with her breast feeding to suckle her breatmilk after having coaxed the child by having given it something  likewise in order to make the ogre during the supramundane spiritual milk  the Blessed One did in this way winning him over by doing according to his wishful word in this way
Again according as a man who is desirous of keeping his catumadhura of four ingredients such as honey molasses etc in alābu cleanses its inner inside  in the same manner in order to keep the sweet of four ingredients  in the same manner the Blessed One made his exit and entrance up to the third time in order to cleanse by getting rid of the impurity of anger right inside of that ogre being desirous of putting in to the full the supramundane catumadhura of four ingredients including honey and molasses in the mind of the ogre 
 Then ḷavaka said thus Nikkhama samaṇa  for the fourth time after having caused an evil intention to arise thus Affable is this monk on having been told to come out he did so on having been told to enter he did accordingly what if I were to make this monk tired in this and that manner throughout the whole night seize him by his feet and throw him to the further shore of the river 
 After having found it out the Blessed One replied thus Na khwāhaṃ taṃ 
 Also having come to know thus also On having been told in reply in this way seeking what should be done  he will think of a question which is to be asked that question will become the mukha of teaching of the truth  the Blessed One said thusNa khvāhaṃ taṃ that
 There na is thus in the sense of rejection  Kho is thus in the sense of avadhāraṇa 
Ahaṃ is thus in the sense of attanidassana  taṃ is thus in the sense of hetu 
By that here the meaning should be seen in this nammer as follows Since you have planned in this way therefore O friend I shall not come out even you should do that which should be done by you
 Consequent upon that since ḷavaka formerly also used to be hostile to ascetics and paribbājaka who were possessed of magical powers when they came to his mansion in this way at the time of their coming through the sky they said to themselves thus How is it Is this indeed a gold mansion or else one or other mansion of silver or of gems come now  we are going to see it  by asking them a question and when they were unable to answer it by doing cittakkhepa 
How
Indeed nonhumanbeings either by showing frightening forms or by allround crushing the hadayavatthu  thus by means of two manners their madness was created 
this ogre  on the other hand since he had come to know thus Those who are possessors of magical powers do not shiver at the sight of frightful forms  used to create himself by means of his own magical powers of mignt into a subtly minute body  enter their inside and crush their hadayavatthu  consequent upon that the cittasantati does not become settled  on its being unsettled  they become mad men and khittacitta 
in this way he sued to split open the chest also of these demented individuals after having seized them by their legs  he used to throw them to the other bank of the river saying  Do not be again such people as had come to my dwelling  therefore after having remembered those questions the ogre ḷavaka after having thought thus What if I were to be hostile to this monk now in this way said thus starting with Pañhaṃ taṃ samaṇa 
 From where however are those questions of his
It is said that his mother and father after having attended upon the Blessed One acquired by learning eight questions along with their answers 
At the time of his boyhood they made ḷavaka learn thoruoghly 
with the lapse of time he forgot the answer
Consequent upon that he said to himself thus Let not these questions also fall into oblivion   had them written on gold plates with vermilion and deposited it in his mansion
In this way these Buddha pañhā are Buddha visaya or power even
After having heard him the Blessed One said thus Na khvāhaṃ taṃ vuso passāmi sadevakeloke in order to show him the unique power of Buddha in the world owing to which no one whosoever is able to do such things as antarāya or to the life of Buddhas neither can they make any paṭithāta of the Omniscient knowledge and of the fathomlength radiating rays of Buddhas
 There the meaning of these words in this way starting with Sadevakavacanena pañcakāmāvacaradevaggahanaṃ Sadevaka  there is taking of the five sensual spheres  that which is in brief has been spoken of  it is not the statement at length by means of such series as anusandhi and yojanā 
This is that which has been said Indeed by the expression of Sadevaka although when the whole divine world has been taken from the point of view of the highest allround limit  for the purpose of removing the doubt of those divinebeings who had assembled there and who had such uncertainty when the crowd of devas had met together as saying to themselves Māra is of great power  the sovereign ruler of the six sensual spheres  a wielder of power  capable of being an enemy  demonstrator of deeds  one who keeps himself occupied with cruelities  how is it indeed that the Māra also would not make the derangement of his mind The Blessed One said thus Samārake
 Over and above that  for the purpose of warding away the bewilderment of them who were saying to themselves thus The brahmā is of great power  by means of a single finger he provides light  to a thousand universes with two  and with ten fingers he can be the light supplier in ten thousand universes  he appropriately enjoys the unsurpassed bliss of jhānasamāpatti  how is it that that brahmā also would not do the Blessed One said thus Sa brahmake 
Then for the purpose of dispelling the doubt of those to whom there was this idea Many monks and brahmins who are adverse to the sāsana  who are enemies and who are endowed with such vigorous strength as starting with manta  how is it those brahmās also would not do  the Blessed One said thus Sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiyā pajāya
In this way after having shown the absence of any one in the most excellent regions  now by means of the expressions Sadevamanussāya the Blessed One pointed out the absence of any one in the remaining world of livingbeings also even by way of the highest allround limit with reference to those sammuti devas as well as the remaining humanbeing thus the meaning in its serial order of anusandhi and yojanā should be understood here in this way
Its meaning is Do ask should you so desire  there is no trouble to me in answering question
In other words You should ask  I shall answer all those questions which you so eagerly desire  thus the Blessed One made such an invitation as said to be sabbaññu pavāraṇaṃ  not shared by silent Buddhas chief disciples and senior disciples 
Indeed they make their say thus O friend  you should ask  after having heard  we shall let you know
 Buddhas however say in other words thus O friend You should ask as and when you do desire to do so 
In other words O Vāsava  You should ask me any such question as is desired in your mind 
In other words opportunities have been made either for Bāvarī the brahmin or for you as well
you should ask about all the doubts of every one whichever you desire in your minds 
By means of the method which begins in this way Buddhas make their invitations sabbaññupavāraṇā to divine and human beings
This is not wonderful namely that the Blessed One after having attained to Buddhabhūmi would make his invitation in this way He who was happening to be in padesañāṇa upon Bodhisattatabhūmi 
O koṇḍañña You should answer the questions hermits who are sādhurūpā make their request to you 
O Koṇḍañña This dhamma towards those who have been born as humanbeings which comes having increased  is this troublesome 
Having been requested by the hermits in this way
Opportunities have been made for you  let the good people put questions  any such question as is specially wished for mentally 
indeed I shall answer whatever may be your question since I have myself understood this world as well as the other 
thus at the time when the Blessed One was a hermit named Sarabhaṅga in this way in the Sambhava jātaka as well after having thrice wandered about in the entire Jambudīpa  the brabmin Sucirata could not discover any one who could put an end to questions was then seven years of age a grown up child who was seen as keeping on playing the childrens game of soft earth  on having been asked by that brahmin at the side of the road for vehicular traffic 
Surely I would tell you  according as also I am clever  in that manner
the king as well knows it whether he will do or not 
Thus made such an invitation as sabbaññupavāraṇaṃ in this way
There Kiṃ thus is the expression for question 
Su thus is a nipāta for mere padapūraṇa 
Idha thusis in this world 
Vittaṃ  thus is vidati he makes what is much beyond  thus vittaṃ  this is the adhivacana of dhana 
Suciṇṇaṃ thus is sukataṃ 
Sukhaṃ that is sata physical or mental 
vahāti thus is āvahati  āneti  deti  appeti  thus it is what has been stated Have thus is a nipāta in the sense of daḷha 
Sādutaraṃ thus is excessively sweet or pleasant 
Thus is such a reading as Sādhuteraṃ also
Rasānaṃ means of the things which have been named tastes 
Kathaṃ means how in what manner  Kathaṃ jīvijīvitaṃ means to one who is living him is life  for the purpose of convenience in composing the stanza  however sānunāsika the ridge belonging to the nose has been stated
There is an alternative reading as  Kathaṃjīviṃ jīvataṃ
its meaning is How is the leading of life of those who are living 
 The rest here is but clear 
In this way by means of this stanza ḷavaka asked thses four questions  Kiṃ su idha loke purisassa vittaṃ seṭṭhaṃ   Keṃ su suciṇṇaṃ sukhamāvaha   kiṃ rasānaṃ sādutaraṃ   Kathaṃ jāvino jīvitaṃ seṭṭhamāhau 
Then the Blessed One spoke this stanza thus Saddhīdha vittaṃ in order to answer to that ogre even in the same manner as had been answered by the Dasabala Kassapa
There according as the wealth starting with hirañña and suvaṇṇa brings the bliss of upabhoga and paribhoga  it wards off the misery of hunger and thirst  etc it makes the cessation of poverty  it become the cause of the proper gain of gems and jewels beginning with pearl  it gives worldly familiarity  as well in the same manner mundane and supramundane pious faith also brings the bliss of the mundane and supramundane fruition according as the latter comes into being  it wards off the misery of birth and old age etc of those who have made proper performance with the load of saddhā  it causes the cessation of the paucity of good quality  it becomes the cause of the proper gain such jewel gems as begun with satisambojjhaṅga 
He who is of pious faith endowed with moral precepts well reputed endowed with belongings
is honoured here and there even whichever region he approaches
Thus owing to this word of Buddha it beings intimacy with the world as well thus after having done it has been told as Vittaṃ 
 Since however this wealth of pious faith is anugāmika  not shared by others  is the cause of every properity  it is the nidāna of such wealth also as hirañña suvaṇṇa  etc which is mundane 
Indeed One who is with pious faith even after having performed such acts of merit as beginning with dāna  achieves wealth  the wealth of one who is without saddhā  becomes as much as it is nonbeneficial  therefore it has been spoken of as seṭṭhaṃ 
Purisassa thus is the desanā the zenith of the limit  Therefore not wholly of the male man but also of the woman etc also the wealth of pious faith is the best  thus it should be understood
According as Buddha had said
Even the water runs away owing to the assertion of truth Wise people kill poison also by means of speaking the truth
Over the declaration of truth the rain pours down its shower resounding with thunder  having abided by the truth people wish for immortal peace 
Speaking the truth is sweeter than some of these tastes which exist as being delicious in this world 
monks as well as brahmins who have abided by the truth cross over to the further shore of the sea of rebirths old age and death
Sādutaraṃ means sweeter and more exalted 
Rasānaṃ means such sorts of savoury as these in the manner starting with Mūla raso khandharaso  such types as blameworthy talk taste and the rest of letters  etc in the manner beginning with Anujānāmi bbikkhave sabbaṃ phalarasaṃ  arasarūpo bhavaṃ Gotamo to be lasteless  Ye te brahmaṇa rūparasā saddarasā anāpatti rasarase  ayaṃ dhammavinayo ekaraso vimuttiraso  bhāgīvā bhagavā attarasassa dhammarasassa  are spoken of as Rasā   saccaṃ have sādhutaraṃ means among those tastes the truth even is sweeter in other words the latter is sādhutara seṭṭhatara and uttamatara 
Indeed tastes of roots etc make the body expand  they give such bliss as is stainful soiled
In the case of the taste of truth the taste of the truth of abstinence and that of the truth of speech make the mind develop by means of samatha and vipassanā  etc they give such bliss as is stainless  the taste of clear escape is sweet owing to the condition of paribhāvita the taste of absolute benefit of truth  also owing to the fact that the attharasa and dhammarasa have been turned out to be depending upon the meaning and the text which had become the means of achieving it
 Paññājāviṃ means here however the living of thet leader of the life of wisdom who is an individual with two types of eyes out of such categories of individuals as  andha  ekacakkhu and dvicakkhu who is either a householder or a monk the former who lives after having accomplished the mode of progress of householders starthing with occupation  inactivity  going as refuge distribution of charitable offering  taking upon oneself the observance of moral precepts  the making of fast  the latter who lives after having been successful in the mode of progress of a monk classified as beginning with the perfect purity of the mind beyond that reckoned as avippaṭisārakarasīla  by means of wisdom  in other words that leader of the life of wisdom has been spoken of as the best of the leaders of life  in this way the meaning should be seen
After having heard the four questions answered by the Blessed One in this way the ogre came to be in his own elements and spoke the stanza starting with Kathaṃ su tarati oghaṃ in order to ask the remaining four questions also
Then the Blessed One spoke the stanza starting with Saddhāya tarati in order to answer his even in the same manner as before 
There even inspite of the fact that he who crosses over the four forms of flood is going to cross over the ocean of rounds of repeated rebirth goes beyond the misery of cycle of repeated rebirths  all round cleanses the filth of depravity  even if it be also in this way since one who lacks in pious faith  does not spring forward to the crossing of the flood having no belief  he does not cross the ocean of the rounds of repeated rebirtjs having been intoxecated in the five strands of sensual plesures with his mental relaxation  owing to the condition of being attached to and entangled in there even being indolent he lives miserably  having been mixed up with sinful deeds  being devoid of wisdom  he does not all round cleanse himself not knowing the path of purity  therefore this stanza has been spoken by the Blessed One by showing its opposite 
When this had been told as well in this way that the controlling faculty of pious faith is the proximate cause  basic cause of sotāpattiyaṅga therefore by means of this clause saddhāya tarati oghaṃ by means of  the Blessed One made manifest the crossing of the flood of heresy  which is the right path of streamwinning and becoming a stream winner as well
Since however a streamwinner who is endowed with diligence reckoned as persevering performance by means of bhāvanā of meritorious deeds after having attained the second noble right path crosses over the ocean of rounds of repeated rebiths  the site of the flood of existence which has not been crossed over by the noble rightpath of a streamwinner and what is left which comprises the mere coming to this world once only after having had it as an exception  therefore Appamādena aṇṇavaṃ  by means of this phrase the Blessed One made manifest the crossing of the flood of existence  the noble right  path of once  returner as well as the winner of the path of once  returner 
Since the once  returner  after having attained the third noble right  path by means of exertion goes beyond sensual suffering so called the flood of sensual desires  the site of the flood of sensual pleasures  which has not been made a thing of the past by the right path of a oncereturner  therefore Vīriyena dukkamacceti  thus by means of this clause  the Blessed One made manifest the right path of a nonreturner and the one who is a nonreturner as well the crossing of the flood of sensual pleasures 
Since however after having attained the wisdom of the fourth noble rightpath which is definitely allround pure by means of allround pure wisdom owing to having been devoid of the mud of sensual pleasure  a nonreturner forsakes the absolutely filthy impurity reckoned as ignorance which has not been forsaken by means of the path of nonreturning  therefore  Paññāya parisujjhati  thus by means of this clause made manifest the crossing over the flood of ignorance  the path of Arahantship as well as the Arahant 
At the end of this stanza which had been taught with Arahantship as its climax  the ogre became established in the fruition of a streamwinner 
Now after having taken that very wisdom word which had been told here thus One purifies oneself all round by means of wisdom  spoke this stanza of six feet  thus Kathaṃ sulabhate paññaṃ  in order to ask a question mingled with what is mundane and supramundane with his own ready wit 
There Kathaṃ su means it was a question connected with benefit every where even
Indeed after having understood the advantage of wisdom etc he asked about its fitness thus Kathaṃ kāyayuttiyā kena kāraṇena paññaṃ labhati 
In wealth  etc this is the manner 
Then the Blessed One spoke the stanza starting with Saddahāno in order to show to that ogre the gaining of wisdom by four causes 
Its meaning is Saddahāno believing it by which Arahants Buddhas and silent Buddhas attained nibbāna on account of such a deed as classified in the past to be bodily good conduct and as classified in future to be the thirty seven bodhipakkhiya paññaṃ labhati the mundane and supramundane for Arahantaṃ dhammaṃ nibbānapattiyā 
That again is not by mere pious faith even since however he who has promoted pious faith makes his approach  making his approach he renders his service  making his attending upon he lends his ears  with his ears fixed he listens to the teaching of the truth  therefore originating from making the approach up to with the listening to the teaching of the truth sussūsaṃ labhati 
What is that which has been told  After having also believed that truth which has been taught he approaches his teachers and preceptors at the proper time  attends upon them by doing his duty and when their minds have been pleased they become desirous of speaking on something
then he gains the same as he keeps on listening after having become attentive 
In this way he gains the same even having been appamatto owing to the presence of awareness over his desire to hear also and being vicakkhaṇo owing to the condition of his knowledge of what is well spoken or otherwise  not any other individual 
Therefore the Blessed One said thus Appamatto vicakkhaṇo
In this way since he is intent on the mode of progress  conducive towards on account of pious faith and since he listens respectfully to the means of attainment to wisdom because of his desire to hear since he does not forget what has been collected with diligence and since he makes to be at length after having collected that which is without deficiency and superfluity and without being equivocal owing to the condition of his desire to hear
In other words he listen to the teaching of the truth which constitutes the cause of gaining properly the wisdom  with his attentive ears because of his desire to hear  after having heard with diligence he bears in his memory the truth taught  owing to the condition of being attentive he makes his investigation of the meaning of the truths which he has known by heart  then in due course he visualises the absolute meaning of the truth  therefore on having been asked How does he gain the wisdom   the Blessed One spoke this stanza Saddahāno P Vicakkhaṇo in order to show these four causes 
Now spoke this stanza Patirūpakārī  in order to answer the other three questions thereafter
There he does suitable means for the achievement of either mundane or super mundane wealth without having avoided place time etc thus patirūpakārī 
Dhuravā means he who has not freed himself of the responsibility by way of mental exertion
Uṭṭhātā means he who makes hard effort  and is endowed with exertion by way of physical exertion in the manner beginning with Whoever considers cold as well as heat as nothing more than grass 
 Vindate dhanaṃ means he gains mundane wealth similar to cūlantevāsī to the tune of two hundred thousand but before long with a single rat and the supramundane wealth also resembling the thera Mahallake Mahā Tissa 
The latter Indeed attained Arahantship in twelve years warding off sloth and drowsiness after having entered the throatdeep water after having made it his duty saying to himself I shall dwell with three departments  and after having moistened his strawpillow and kept it on his head  at the time when sloth and drowsiness camce to him
Saccena Saccavādī bhūtavādī  by means of the truth of absolute meaning also Buddha silent Buddha and a noble disciple thus it attains to to popularity 
Dadaṃ thus giving some thing or other which has been desired and wished for  mittāni ganthati he procures and he makes  thus  is the meaning
In other words either giving what is difficult to give or also the four objects signifying sympathy which have been taken in the direction of charitable offering thus they should be understood
By means of them he makes friends thus it is what has been stated
After having answered the four questions in such a manner as is common to householders and monks with what is mundane and supramundane mutually mixed in this way now the Blessed One spoke a stanza starting with Yassete in order to answer this fifth question by way of a householder
Its meaning is Saddhassa gharamesino who has pious faith and who seeks a house owing to the condition of having been endowed with saddhā  because of all good deeds of whom which has been told here thus saddahāno Arahantaṃ  have come into existence  of the householder the enjoyer of sensual pleasures who seeks and makes his quest either for a household life or of five strands of sensual pleasures saccaṃ which is in the manner spoken of here thus Saccena Kittiṃ pappoti  dhammo which has been spoken of by the name of the wisdom of the man who desires to hear thus Sussūsaṃ labhate paññaṃ  dhiti spoken of by the name of zeal as well as by the name of responsibility here thus Dhuravāuṭṭhātā  cāgo in the manner spoken of here thus Dadaṃ mittāni ganthati his friends  there are these four qualities 
sa ve pecca na socati  after having gone from this world to the other world he certainly is not to worry 
After having answered also the fifth question in this way the Blessed One spoke Iṅgha aññe pi in order to urge the ogre
There iṅgha is an indeclinable particle in the sense of urge 
Aññepi means you should ask multitudes of monks and brahmins in other faiths  in other words you should ask also many monks and brahmins beginning with Purāṇa Kassapa who claim themselves to be allknowing individuals 
whether there exists here any other cause for the attainment to fame over and above saccā in the manner spoken of here by us thus Ssaccena kittiṃ pappoti  or the cause of properly gaining mundane and supramundane wisdom over and above damā which has been spoken of here with the indication of wisdom of one who desires to hear thus Sussūsaṃ labhate paññaṃ 
or the cause of fastening friends  further than cāgā in the manner spoken of here thus Dadaṃ mittāni ganthati friends or the cause of acquiring the mundane and supermundane wealth more than khantyā reckoned as exertion for the attainment of the state of effort with the standing meaning of bearing a heavy responsibility according as has been spoken of by the name of responsibility as well as by the name of activity depending upon the influence of this and that meaning here thus Dhuravā uṭṭhātā or the cause of absence of sadness after having gone from this world to the other world more than indeed these four qualifications which have been spoken of in this waySaccaṃ dhammo dhiti cāgo  thus this is the atthavaṇṇanā by means of brief interpretation 
from the point of view of commenting at length  however it should be understood after having analysed each and every word by the method of elucidating  the synopsis of the meaning and that of the word 
On having been urged in this way the ogre spoke Yo haṃ ajja pajānāmi yo attho samparāyiko in order to let those who did not know the reason of his not asking also to understand after having told thus Kathaṃ nu dāni puccheyyaṃ puthūsamaṇabrāhmaṇe owing to the condition of obviating it by which uncertainty he would ask others
There ajja means after having made today the beginning thus is the significance
Pajānāmi means I comprehend according to the stated manner 
Yo attho means to this extent  it shows what is pertaining to the present existence which has been told in the manner beginning with Sussūsaṃ labhate paññaṃ  samparāyiko by means of this what belongs to the future existence  putting and end to sorrow after death having been told thusYass ete caturo dhammā 
Attho means this is the adhivacana for circumstantial cause 
here however it is in the sense of cause 
This I today clearly comprehend personally even the cause which is pertaining to the present existence for the gain  etc of wisdom  etc and which also constitutes that cause which is pertaining to future existence for the absence of sorrow hereafter in the manner spoken of by the Blessed One  how would that I now ask the many monks and brahmin thus the meaning should be understood bridfly hereIn this way
After having told in this way saying I clearly comprehend that which is the advantage pertaining to the futrue the ogre spoke being the source of that knowledge of his
There atthāya means for the benefit in other words for the increase 
Yattha dinnaṃ mahapphalaṃ means I clearly comprehend Buddha as worthy of that topmost dedicatory offering where what has been given as charitable offering with the said gift at a sacrifice here thusYassetc caturo dhammā is conducive to great fruition  thusis the meaning
Some scholars say thus He said so with reference to the saṅgha 
After having shown his own attainment to advantage by means of this stanza in this way the ogre now spoke  in order to shed light on his proper performance for the welfare of others 
Its meaning should be understood even in the same manner as has been told in the Hemavata Sutta
 In this way the ending of this stanza the shining daybreak  the uprising sound of the sādhukāra and the bringing of the child prince ḷavaka kumāra to the mansion of the ogre happened in a single moment even
The royal retainers  after having heard the sound of congratulation said to themselves The sound of such a type congratulation as this does not rise for others besides Buddha  has the Blessed One come indeed listening  they sighted Buddhas bodily rays  did not remain outside as they had done before became fearless  entered the inside even and saw the Blessed One seated in the dwelling of the ogre as well as the ogre himself who kept himself standing after having lifted his clasped hands
After having seen the ogre they spoke thus to the ogre O great ogre This royal childprince has been brought for the balikamma to you now you should either devour or eat you should do according as the prince is your requisite 
 Owing to his having become a stream winner the ogre became shameful because of being told in this way in particular  before Buddha  then after having accepted in both of his hands that tiny prince the ogre placed the prince close to the Blessed One saying Venerable sir This prince has been sent to me I do make my offering of this royal baby boy to the Blessed One Buddhas are sympathisers for the welfare  venerable sir The Blessed One should accept this royal baby boy for his benefit of welfare and weal 
The ogre spoke also this stanza
this royal baby boy with a hundred marks of merit  who is perfect in all limbs and allround filled with excellent charateristics 
Elationminded and good hearted I present to you kindly accept the baby for the welfare of the world O possessor of spiritual eye
 The Blessed One accepted the royal baby boy in the course of accepting also the Blessed One spoke a stanza of deficient feet  for the purpose of making maṅgala for the ogre as well as to the royal baby boy
The ogre made the stanza full by adding thrice the fourth foot causing the royal baby boy go to the three gems for his refuge 
That is according to this 
Let this royal baby boy have a long span of life 
O ogre May you also become peaceful  
without having any ailment you should stand for the welfare of the world
this royal baby boy goes to Buddha  the Truth  and the order of monks 
 The Blessed One gave the royal baby boy to the royal retainers saying After having him grown up you should give him to me even again
Owing to the condition of his having reached the hands of the ogre from the hands of the royal retainers the hands of the Blessed One from the hands of the ogre the hands of the royal retainers again from the hands of the Blessed One the royal baby boy became known as Hatthako ḷavako
 After having sighted the royal retainers who had been returning carrying the child prince  field cultivators and forest workers etc became full of fear and asked thus How is it Did the ogre not desire the child prince owing to the condition of his being too tiny 
 The royal retainers informed all of them thus Do not be afraid  security has been made by the Blessed One
 Thereafter  the whole city of ḷavī saying Sādhu sādhu  became facing forward toward the ogre with a single shouting 
When the time for the wandering about for collecting almsfood of the Blessed One had duly arrived the ogre also took hold of Buddhas bowl and robe and returned after having reached half the journey 
 Then the Blessed One after having wandered about throughout the city did his duty of partaking meal and sat down on the excellent seat prepared for Buddha at the base of a certain tree in seclusion at the gate of the city
Thereafter the king as well as the citizens together with a massive multitude of men united themselves together into a single crowd approached the Blessed One paid their homage surrounded had themselves seated and made their enquiry thusVenerable sir How in this way have you tamed the cruel ogre
 To them the Blessed One taught that very ḷavaka sutta after having made the battle as its beginning thus In this way the ogre rained down nine sorts of showers  in this way he made himself obviously frightful in this way he asked questions to him I answered 
 At the end of the teaching  eightyfour thousand people became dhammābhisamaya 
Thereafter the king as well as the citizens made a dwelling for the ogre near the dwelling of the great king Vessavaṇa and made their permanent bali endowed with such respectful offering as begun with flowers fragrant toilet were made the turning out to be 
They released as well the young prince who had attained the age of intelligence saying You gained your life having depended upon the Blessed One you should go and serve the Blessed One even as well as the order of monks 
As he kept himself attending upon the Blessed One as well as on bhikkhusaṅgha he became established in the fruition of a nonreturner but before long acquired the learning of all the teachings of Buddha and after having been established in the fruition of a nonreturner but before long and was surrounded by five hundred lay devotees
The Blessed One distinguished him at this topmost position thus O monks This one is the chief among my disciples who treat kindly their retinue with objects of sympathy  this who is Hatthaka ḷavaka
Evaṃ me sutaṃ thus Kasibhāradvājasutta
What is its origin
The Blessed One was residing among people of Magadha in Dakkhiṇāgiri  at the brahmin village of ekanālā  out of these two duties of Buddha comprising purebhattakicca and pacchābhattakicca the Blessed One had his purebhattakicca completed and towards the end of pacchābhattakicca  He had a look at the world by means of his Buddha eye and sighted the brahmin Bhāradvāja to have been endowed with upanissaya for Arahantship the Blessed One came to know thus When I go there conversation will happen thereafter at the end of the kathā  this brahmin will become monk after he had listened to my dhammadesanā and attain Arahantship the Blessed One went there personally promoted the conversation and spoke this sutta
 There it may be asked thus What is the purebhattakicca of Buddhas What is the pacchābhattakicca 
It is stated thus  Buddha the Blessed One used to get up even early at dawn do his bodily ablutions comprising facewashing etc for the purpose of doing favour to his serving attendent as well as for the sake of his own bodily comfort  till the time arrives for begging round Buddha used to spend his time at a secluded seat  put on his lower garment at the time of wandering about for alms food fasten his bodily belt  cloak himself in his upper robe  take his begging bowl and enter either a village or a market town for collecting almsfood sometimes even all alone and sometimes surrounded by the organisation of monds sometimes normally and sometimes with the turnings outtobe of many a miracle 
What is this for example  When the protector of the world entered to collect alms food softblowing breezes would go before and ahead and clean the earth the clouds in the sky permeated with water which release themselves would make the dust subside on the road and would station themselves behaving as an awning above the Blessed One
later  winds would pluck flowers and scatter them on the road raised portions of land would level themselves down and the depressions would become heaved up to provide an even surface  at the time of his dropping down of the feet the ground would be evenly level otherwise lotusflowers which have comfortable contacts of the size of a chariotswheel would receive his feet as and when his right foot has been put down within the citygate  his sixcoloured rays would radiate from his body resembling reddish gold colour or similar to having been surrounded by variegated cloth  making themselves shaped like the pinnacleroofed palaces etc and run about from here to there as well elephants horses and birds who would keep themselves stationed in their own homes would make their sounds in a sweet manner likewise musical instruments beginning with drums and lutes as well as bodily adornments of humanbeings by means of that knowledge of their own people came to know thusToday the Blessed One has entered here for almsfood
They dressed themselves well in lower and upper garments took along with them fragrant flowers would come out of their houses enter upon the innerpath  respectfully make reverential offering of fragrant flowers etc to the Blessed One pay their homage to the Master beg of the latter thusVenerable sir Please give us two monks please give us twenty please give us a hundred monks they would take a bowl of the Blessed One also have a seat prepared for Buddha and would serve the Blessed One respectfully with almsfood
 After having done the duty of mealeating the Blessed One looked at their santāna and would teach the truth in such a way that some would become established in saraṇagamana  some in the five moral precepts some in any of the fruitions of sotāpatti  sakadāgāmi and anāgāmi  some would become monks and get established on the topmost fruition of Arahantship
In this way after having done favour to multitude of men Buddha would rise up from his seat and go back to the monastery
There in the pavilion  Buddha would take his seat prepared for him awaiting the end of mealeating by bhikkhus
Thereafter at the end of mealeating of monks the attendant in service would let the Blessed One know of it 
then the Blessed One would enter his fragrant chamber
This first of all is purebhattakiccaṃ 
Whatever has not been told here that should be taken even in the said manner in Btahmāyu sutta
 Then the Blessed One would have done his forenoon duty in this way would sit being waited upon in his fragrant chamber have his feet washed stand on the footstool and advise the organisation of monks thusO monks You should work for your salvation diligently in this world appearance of Buddha is a rarity to gain the appropriate gain of humanhood in difficult to obtain prosperity of faith is difficult to gain  momkhood is hard to gain listening to the good truth is difficult to gain in the world
Thereafter the monks would pay their homage to the Blessed One and ask for kammaṭṭhāna 
then the Blessed One would give kammaṭṭhāna to the monks by way of their individual cariya 
The monks would learn the kammaṭṭhāna beg leave of the Blessed One with their adoration and would go to their respective residences Some to the forest some to the foot of a tree some to one or other of the hills etc some to the nansion of the four great divine kings  some to the divine mansion of Vasavatti
Thereafter the Blessed One would enter his fragrant chamber and slould He so on his right side with awareness and thoughtfulness for a muhutta 
Then with his body refreshed Buddha rose up and in the second portion would look at the world
In the third portion depending on either whatever village of market town the Blessed One dwelt there the multitude of men after having given charity in the forenoon  would get themselves well dressed in lower and upper garment and would assemble in the monastery taking a long with them fragrant flowers etc
Thereafter the Blessed One with his miracle commensurate with the audience which had wellarrived would go sit down on the excellently prepared Buddhas seat in the dhammasabhā and teach such dhamma as would suit the oceasion and befitting in pamāna 
Later on after having become conscious of the time He would let the audience go back
 Thereafter should the Blessed One desire to bathe his body 
He would rise from Buddhas seat go to the place where his attendant in service had kept water ready catch hold of his bathing garment from the hands of his service attendant and enter the bathroom 
The serving attendant also would bring the Buddhas seat and prepare it in the compound of the fragrant chamber 
after having bathed his limbs the Blessed One would put on his double sheeted lowergarment of excellent red colour  fasten his belt have himself cloaked in his upper garment and would come there and sit down all alone for a momentary sitting in seclusion
Then after having come from here and there monks would go to attend upon the Blessed One
There some monks would ask questions some would ask for mental exercise  some would make their request to get the chance of listening to the teaching of the truth 
Fulfilling well their purpose  the Blessed One would spend the first watch of the night
 In the middle watch of the night the divine beings of the entire ten thousand lokadhātu  gaining their oportunity would approach the Blessed One and ask questions according as they had been specially perpared comprising even the four tones of letters also
Answering the questions of those divinebeings the Blessed One would spend the middle watch of the night
Thereafter Buddha would divide the last watch of the night into four portions and make his resolution to walk to and fro for one portion He would lie down like a lion with awareness and thoughtfulness on his right side for the second portion after having entered his fragrant chamber He would spend the third portion with phalasamāpatti  in the fourth portion Buddha would enter mahākaruṇāsamāpatti and look at the world with his Buddhaeye for the purpose of sighting living being who are apparajakkha and mahārajakkha  etc
this is the aftermeal duty 
 Looking at the world in this way by means of his Buddhaeye in order to see such living beings as those who had not done as well as those who had done devoted deeds of service toward Buddha dhamma and saṅgha and those who would be either endowed or not endowed with upanissaya  at the end of the fourth portion reckoned as looking at the world  of this pacchābhattakicca  the Blessed One sighted the brahmin Kasibhāradvāja to have been endowed with upanissaya for the attainment of Arahantship and came to know thus When I go there conversation will happen  thereafter at the end of kathā  this brahmin will become a monk after he had listened to my teaching of the truth and will attain Arahantship the Blessed One went there facilitated the kathā and spoke this sutta 
Here it should be regarded as mode as demonstration and as memorizing
Herein in the sense of mode he illustrates the meaning by the word thus as follows Who is there capable of cognizing in all its modes that Blessed Ones word which is that of one expert in many methods originated by the several sorts of inclination perfect in the meaning and the letter possessing the various marvels profound in teaching and penetrating ideas and meanings suitable to all creatures each in his own speech as soon as it comes to their ears However thus I heardthere is one mode in which it was heard by me
In the sense of demonstration he points out by excluding himself the following meaning thus I am not selfbecome this has not been first realized by me and he also demonstrates the whole Sutta now to be related when he says Thus I heardby me it was heard thus
In the sense of memorizing he points out the following meaning By showing his own power of remembering such that it was commended by the Blessed One thus Bhikkhus foremost among the bhikkhus my disciples who are wellversed is Ananda  who are mindful who are well conducted who are courageous    who are attendants is Ananda  he stimulates creatures desire to hear in this way Thus I heardthat should be regarded thus only and not otherwise neither less nor more as to the meaning and the letter
Thus is my heard experience act of recording by a series of consciousnesses ushered in by earconsciousness
For by terminating the discomfort of one posture by replacing it with one of the others he carried his selfhood on made it proceed onwards without letting it fall that is why it is said that he was living 
 There Evaṃ me sutaṃ etc was spoken by the venerable nanda at the time of the first great council  when asked by the venerable thera Mahākassapa who made dhamma saṅgīti and I sow as well thus it was said by the brahmin Kasibhāra O brahmin I also indeed plough and sow etc was told by the Blessed One
All this had been collected together also and has been spoken of to be Kasibhāradvāja Sutta 
 There Evaṃ this expression evaṃ has the sense of ākāra  nidassana and avadhāraṇa 
Indeed in the sense of ākāra  he sheds light on this meaning by means of this  The word of that Blessed One is one which well promotes different manners subtileties and many an intention  endowed with meaning and characteristic  consisting of different varieties of miracles  profundity of penetration of the truth meaning and teaching  and which has the nature of discrimination commensurate with the own language of each and everyone who would be capable of knowing clearly  then indeed evaṃ me sutaṃ  by me also has been heard in a single manner 
In the sense of indication  saying I am not a sayambhū  this has not been visualised by me thus making himself allround released nanda indicated the entire sutta which should be stated now thus In this way has been heard by me by me in this way has been heard
 In the sense of affirmation  O monks This one is topmost among my disciples who are much learned monks namely this randa topmost among those who possess gati  sati  dhiti and Upaṭṭhāka namely this nanda Thus in order to show his own strength of memorising commansurate with the condition of the praise by the Blessed One in this way the thera nanda evoked the desire to hear of living creatures In this way has been heard by me that as well according to the sense or according to characteristic without deficiency and free from overstatement  even in this way it should be seen not in any other manner
Me sutaṃ here the grammatical expression me has the sense of the grammatical expression mayā the grammatical expression suta has the sense of sotadvāra viññāṇa 
Therefore evaṃ me sutaṃ means in this way has been borne in my memory by means of Viññṅāṇavīthi with Sotaviññāṇa as its forerunner  thus it is what has been stated
 Ekaṃ samayaṃ means at one time 
Bhagavā means bhājavā  bhaggavā  bhattavā  thus it is what has been told
Magadhesu viharati royal princes who were of the districts named magadhā their residence a single district also is spoken of as Magadhā by means ruḷhī sadda 
in that district out of the Magadha districts
Some scholars however are profuse many fold in such manners as starting with Since the sovereign Cetiya was in the course of entering the earth after having spoken falsehood it has been said thus Mā gadhaṃ pavisa  in other words since people were digging earth seeking that king were told Mā gadhaṃ karotha  any hole therefore Magadha
whichever is approved of that should be accepted 
Viharanti he carries his body and makes it turn out to be without its falling down after having interrupted one iriyāpathabādhana by means of another iriyāpatha  thus it is what has been stated
In other words he brings different varieties of welfare to living beings by leading the life of a divinebeing of a brahmā and of an ariya  thus viharati 
Harati means upasaṃharati  upaneti janeti  uppādeti  thus it is what has been stated
Likewise indeed As and when living beings vippaṭipajjanti in sensual pleasures  then it is said that the Blessed One lived the life of a divine being for the purpose of promoting their alobhakusalamūla they might arouse their appreciation here and get clearly detached from kāma pleasures
When however people commit sin towards living beings for the purpose of domination then Buddha would live the life of a brahmā for the purpose of promoting their origin of angerless good deed with this ideaPerphaps even namely after having seen this paṭipatti  they would arouse their appreciation here and would get rid of their anger by means of absence of anger 
When however monks dispute over spiritual controversy  then Buddha would live the life of an ariya for the purpose of evoking their foundation of amoha 
There is however no occasion when Buddha would not live the life of iriyāpatha since without it there would be absence of allround looking after his attabhāva 
This here is in brevity  we shall however say at length in the commentary on Maṅgala Sutta
 Dakkhiṇāgirismim means that hill which had kept itself standing after having surrounded Rājagaha the district on the south side of the same is said to be Dakkhiṇāgiri in that janapada  thus it is what has been spoken of
There the name of the monastery also is that even
Ekanālāyaṃ brāhmaṇagāme the name of that village is Ekanāḷā
here as well many brahmins lived in other words it is brāhmaṇabhogo therefore Brāhmaṇgāmo the village of brehminsthus it is stated
Tena kho pana samayena at that time when the Blessed One after having folded his legs and sat down on the invincible pedestal and had become selfawakened and attained well selfawakened Buddhahood He kept on turning the excellent wheel of truth and resided in the kingdom of Magadha at the Dakkhiṇāgiri monastary depending on the brahmin village of Ekanāḷa awaiting the allround maturity of the brahmins indriya  tena samayena  by the word which has become instrumentive 
Kho pana these two nipāta here constitute merely padapūraṇa  in other words for the purpose of showing adhikārantara  thus it should be seen
Kasibhāradvājassa brāhmaṇassa that brehmin led his life by ploughing  his clan is Bhāradvāja therefore it is said in this way
Pañcamattāni according as in such a context as Bhojane mattaññū here the grammatical expression matta occurs in pamāṇa here also in the same manner therefore five in quantity neither less nor more five hundred ploughs  thus it is what has been stated
Payuttāni means payojitāni  after having placed the ploughs on the backs of bullocks they have been yoked to the ploughs by means of straps  thus is the meaning
 Vappakāle means vapanakāle  at the time of throwing down seeds of crop thus it is what has been told
There there are two types of sowing sowing in mud and sowing in soft soil
The significance here is softsoil sowing
That as well indeed on the first day is maṅgala vappa 
There this is upakaraṇa sampadā  Three thousand oxen had been bred  the horns of all the cattle were made of and fastened with gold their hoofs were made of silver all of them were adorned with garlands of white flowers with every fragrance and sweet scent as well as with five fingers allround complete with major and minor limbs and endowed with all characteristic marks  the cattle were black akin to the colour of collyrium even  some of the oxen were white like the colour of crystal some were red with coral colour some of them were spotted with the colour of masāragalla 
Five hundred were mencultivators all of whom were dressed in new white lower garments Adorned with flower garlands with wreaths of flowers placed on their right shoulders  with portions or their bodies smeared with yellow orpiment and resplendent with red arsenic went to work after having been a cluster after another with ten ploughs each
The head of the ploughs as well as the yokes were covered with gold
At the first plough eight bullocks were yoked and four each at the remaining ploughs the rest were brought for the purpose of keeping going the tired 
In each cluster there was a cartload of seeds each and every one ploughed the field and each and every one sowed seeds
 The brahmin however even very early at dawn had his beard shaved  bathed his body smeared with sweet scented unguents dressed himself in his lower garment which was priced at five hundred  cloaked himself with his upper garment valued at a thousand  adorned each of his ten fingers with two rings making a total of twenty fingerrings at his earlobes were earrings shaped like a lion wrapped round his head was a turban of a brahmin kept a gold garland round his neck  and accompanied by a crowd of brahmins he took command of the work 
Then his wife the brahmin lady had milkrice cooked in many a hundred cauldrons had them mounted on large carts had her bath with fregrent water adorned herself with all adornments and went to the site of cultivation accompanied by a crowd of brahmin ladies
In his house also everywhere was well smeared with sweet scent and there was the performance of bali offering well made with flowers in the fields also in these and those places there were wellhoisted flags 
Together with parijana doing the field work the crowd of audience who visited the work of cultivation munbered one thousand two hundred and fifty
all of them were dressed in new clother For all of then also the milkrice meal was ready to be enjoyed
 Then the brahmin had the maṅgala bali kamma performed at the spot where well washed filled with milk rice  had it well mixed with ghee  honey and molasses  etc
his wife the brehmin lady went about entertaining her five hundred cultivators who were seated after having held such of their individual vessels as were made of gold silver brass and copper with milkrice after naving held in her hand the gold spoon
The brahmin however wandered about after having had the balikamma performed put on his redcoloured gold bound slippers caught hold of his redcoloured gold stick and kept on supervising the catering of his cultivators thus Give milkrice here give ghee here give sugar here
Then the Blessed One still seated in his fragrant chamber came to know of the happening of serving meal said to himself thus This is the time to tame the brahmin put on his lower robe fastened his bodily belt cloaked himself with saṃghāṭi  took his begging bowl and came away from his fragrant chamber according as the unsurpassed charioteerlike tamer of men to that brahmin
On that account the venerable nanda said thus Atha kho Bhagavā pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā 
 There atha is a nipāta indeclinable in the beginning of such a statement as aññādhikāra  Kho means pada pūraṇa 
Bhagavā is even in the said manner
Pubbaṇhasamayaṃ means the time of early portion of the day early at sunrise thus is the meaning in other words at the early time of sunrise is pubbaṇhasamaya  a moment before sunrise  thus it is what has been told
In this way in accantasaṃyoga is gained the upayogavacana 
Nivāsetvā means after having put on  this should be understood by way of vihāra  nivāsana and parivattana 
Indeed it was not that the Blessed One was without lower garment before that
Pattacīvaramādāya means after having taken the bowl with his hands and the robe by means of his body after having accepted and worn  thus is the meaning
It is said that when the Blessed One was desirous of entering for almsfood resembling a bee in the middle of two paduma lotuses which had blossomed  the begging bowl made of stone of the colour of indanīla gem would come to the middle of his two hands
therefore after having accepted with his hands the bowl which had come in this way and after having worn on his body his robe cloaked in such a way as to fringe evenly all round  thus its meaning should be understood in this way
Indeed either in this or that manner collecting and having taken along thus even it is said according as samādāyeva pakkamati 
 Yena means by whichever road 
Kammanto means the place of doing work 
Tena means by that road
Upasaṅkami means gato  by whichever road that led to the brahmin Kasibhāradvājas fieldwork Buddha went by that road thus it is what has been told
Then why did the monks not follow the Blessed One
If asked thus  as and when the Blessed One would be desirous of approaching anywhere alone even He would at the time of wandering about for almsfood close the door and enter the inner fragrant chamber
consequent upon that the monks understood by means of that Saññā thus Today the Blessed One is desirous of entering the village alone even sure enough  Buddha must have sighted even some individual who ought to be led out of saṃsāra 
Those monks would take their bowl and robe circumambulate the fragrant chamber and go on their begging wourn 
At that time as well the Blessed One did in this way and
therefore the monks did not follow the Blessed One
 Tena kho pana samayena means as and at what time the Blessed One approached the fieldwork at that time there happened serving of meal and there turned out to be the function of the meal thus is the meaning
What we spoke of formerly was thus The brahmin lady went about entertaining the five hundred ploughmen who were seated after having held in their hands such vessels as were made of gold silver bronze and copper with milkrice after having held in her hand her gold spoon
Then indeed the Blessed One approached the mealserving spot
For what reason
For the purpose of doing a favour to the brahmin
Indeed the Blessed One did not approach the site of serving meal owing to the condition of desire to eat similar to a man who was a destitute 
Indeed to the Blessed One there were relatives who were Sākiyan and Koliyan Kings numbering eightytwo thousand they were able to provide meals permanently owing to their own prosperity
On the other hand not for the purpose of procuring meals it was that the Blessed One had become a monk Moreover indeed however He became a monk thus Having kept on allround sacrificing the five great paricāga  for many an asaṅkhyeyya and fulfilled the pāramī  I would become mutta and would resolve to make others emancipated become tamed I would determine to tame others having become tranquilled I would make up my mind to tranquilise others having been bound for parinibbāna I would resolve to make others enter parinibbāna
Therefore owing to the condition of having himself emancipated  owing to the condition of having been bound for parinibbāna making others become emancipated  making others enter prainibbāna wandering about in the word Buddha appraoched the mealserving spot for the purpose of doing a favour to the brahmin thus it should be understood
 Upasaṅkamitvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi means having approached in this way He stood on one side
Ekamantaṃ means the niddesa of the natural neuter gender  one spot and one side  thus it is what has been told
In other words it is an accusative expression in the sense of locative  at the place of his visibilety precincts and within hearing of what is spoken  where the brahmin would see him standing there He stood at a high spot 
After having stood Buddha released the ray of his body red in colour like the finest of gold outshining the light of a thousand moons and suns all round measuring eighty cubits from all sides owing to the condition of having been flooded by which the hall of the brahmins fieldwork  its walls the trees and ploughedup lumps of earth etc were as if made of gold
Then the people who had eaten the milkrice sighted the well selfawakened Buddha shining with glory which his body aptly adorned with thirty two excellent lakkhaṇa  accompanied by eighty minor marks with a pair of arms decorated with his fathomlength rays radiating all round with his garland of rays shining bright looking graceful  resembling the moving  lotus lake like the sky surfact with its multitude of shining stars which possess flames of rays  similar to the burning crest of gold hill  who kept himself standing on one side they washed their hands and feet held put their clasped hands and stood after having surrounded the Blessed One
The brahmin Kasibhāradvāja indeed saw the Blessed One surrounded by them in this way who had remained standing for almsfood
 Why however this one spoke in this way
Is it because of his lack of pleasing faith in the Blessed One who was allpleasing of inspiring confidence  and had duly attained the most excellently subdued calm composure also Or is it owing to his stinginess over a spoonful of almsfood although he had provided milkrice to one thousand two hundred and fifty people
Not because of both nevertheless indeed he was upset in mind thus Buddha has come to make kammabhaṅga of mine after having seen his men who were not contented with having a look at the Blessed One and who had dropped down their work 
therefore the brahmin spoke in this way
This idea was to that brahmin also after having found out the prosperity of the characteristic marks of the Blessed One If this monk would engage himself in occupation he would become like cūlāmaṇi on the head of human beings in the whole island of Jambu  what namely is his wish unfulfilled  owing to the condition of laziness he did not engage himself in occupation  eating his meal after having wandered about for almsfood in cultivation ceremonies  he keeps himself going with abundance of bodily vigour 
On that account he said thus O monk Indeed I plough and I sow after having ploughed and sown I enjoy 
My occupations never failed neither am I like you endowed with lakkhaṇa in this way thus is the significance
Tvampi samaṇa  bhuñjassu  for you who are endowed with lakkhaṇa in this way what wish is there of yours which would not be fulfilled  Thus is the significance
 Moreover this brahmin had heard thus It is said that the prince arose in the family of the Sākiyan sovereign he became a monk after having rejected the sovereignty of the world king
Therefore after having understood thus Now this he the brahmin saying to himself It is said that after having rejected the sovereignty of a world king he was tired   Making censure the brahmin said Ahaṃ kho samaṇa 
Nevertheless however this brahmin was of sharp wisdom  he did not say so keeping the Blessed One under  however after having seen the prosperity of the visible form of the Blessed One the brahmin spoke in this way in order to honour the prosperity of his wisdom and for the purpose of occurrence of conversation  Ahaṃ kho samaṇa 
Consequent upon that the Blessed One spoke thus Ahampi kho brahmaṇa showing himself to be the topmost cultivator and sower in the world including the divine world by way of disciplining the living beings and leading them out of saṃsāra 
 Then there arose to the brahmin this thought This monk said thus I plough and I sow as well
I do not notice any ploughing implements beginning with material yoke and plough does he indeed speak falsehood Or not Thus the brahmin kept on carefully looking at the Blessed One beginning from the soles of his feet up to the tip of his hair above found out by means of his aṅgavijjā his prosperity of thirtytwo excellent characteristic marks owing to the condition of having done his adhikāra  he became full of veneration then and there saying to himself This is out of place and inopportune that such a personage as this would tell a lie the brahmin said thus Na kho mayaṃ passāma bhoto Gotamassa of the venerable Gotama behaving towards the Blessed One by means of his clan after having forsaken the samaṇavāda 
 Having however spoken in this way as well the sharpwitted brahmin after having understood thus In connection with the profundity of meaning this has been said by this personage made his enquiry and being desirous of comprehending that meaning he spoke to the Blessed One by means of a stanza thus
On that account the venerable nande said Atha kho Kasibhāradvājo brāhmaṇo Bhagavantaṃ gāthāya ajjhabhāsi 
There gāthāya means with words fixed by feet of letters or alphabets 
Ajjhabhāsi means abhāsi 
There the brahmin spoke of a combination of ploughing outfits beginning with yoke and plough thus kasiṃ 
On the other hand the Blessed One since the speaking after having had it mounted with the sabhāga former matter  is known as Buddhas pomp and power  therefore the Blessed One said Saddhā bījaṃ  shedding light on Buddhas ānubhāva and mounting by means of pubbadhamma sabhāga common previous truth
Here however what is pubbadhammasabhāga was it not that the Blessed One was asked about combination of ploughing outfits beginning with yoke and plough then however having had the mounting of the seed which had not been asked about commonly  the Blessed One said Saddhā bījaṃ  if it were in this way is not this Kathā without sequence even
It is said in reply thus For Buddhas there does not exist what is known as such kathā as is without sequence neither also do Buddhas speak without having mounted the pubba dhammasabhāga common previous matter
In this way as well here the sequence should be understood On having been enquired by this brahmin about the ploughing by way of the ploughing equipments beginning with yoke and plough
the Blessed One said thus Saddhā bījaṃ  in order to show the ploughing beginning from its origin in order to let the brahmin comprehend the cultivation along with its mūla with its upakāra  with its sambhāra and with its phala  without having all round omitted that this had not been asked about out of compassion for that brahmin
Indeed seed is the source of cultivation since when it exists there is what should be done when it does not exist there is nothing which ought to be done owing to what ought to be done commensurate with its quantity 
Indeed when there is seed they perform their ploughing when there is none they do not make any performance
According to the quantity of seeds as well clever cultivators plough their fields neither what is less saying Let there be no allround decrease of our yield of crops nor what is in excess saying Let not our effort be futile 
Since as well the seed even is the source therefore the Blessed One said Saddhā bījaṃ  in order to show to that brāhmin the cultivation starting from its source and having had his own pubbadhamma mounted with what is common to the seed which is the pubbadhamma in ploughing 
In this way here pubbadhammasabhāga should be understood
 If asked Why after having said what had but been asked and afterwards what had not been asked had not been answered
It is owing to the condition of his upakāra and due to the state of his capacity of dhamma sambandha 
Indeed this brahmin was possessor of wisdom  however owing to the condition of his having been born in the family with heresy he was devoid of devotional faith 
Being devoid of saddhā  the possessor of wisdom did not attain visesa not regulating his life in his own sphere with the pious faith of others  he did not do his accomplishment of advantage on the occuring together of his weak faith and strong wisdom which constitute the characteristic mark of mere pleasing piety comprising the disappearance of the darkness of depravity  similar to an ox yoked to a single load along with an elephant
Therefore for him saddhā was beneficial 
Rain is the benefactor of seeds as well That rain on being told even immediately even is capable
In this way it should be spoken afterward also owing to the condition of the combination of truth being capable  this matter had been told before the other also is of this kind the tie of a plough etc
 There excellent pleasing piety is the characteristic mark of saddhā  in other words its characteristic mark is confidence  pakkhandana is its rasa  adhimutti is its paccupaṭṭhāna  in other words akālussiya is its paccupaṭṭhāna  the sotāpattiyaṅga is its padaṭṭhānā  in other words the dhamma which should be believed is its padaṭṭhāna  the mind has become pleasant resembling the clarity of the surface of a mirror and of water etc similar to the gem which makes water clear to the water saddhā is the clarifier of sampayutta dhamma 
Bījaṃ is of five types mūla bījaṃ  aggabījaṃ  bījabījaṃ even is the fifth
Att that also goes to be calculated as as even bīja owing to its meaning of viruhana 
 There according as in the cultivation of the brahmin the seed which has become the source does two duties below it establishes itself with the root above it causes the sprout to rise up 
According as that seed after having collected the taste of the earth and the taste of the water by means of its root it increases in size with its stalk for the purpose of holding allround mature grain of paddy  in this way this faith after having collected the taste of samatha and vipassanā by means of the root of moral precepts  develops in size by means of the stalk of ariyamagga for the purpose of holding the all round mature grain of ariyaphala 
According as well that seed after having established itself on good ground and attained increase  growth and abundance by means of its root sprout leaves stalk  joints and offsprings  produced milk and accomplishes the head of barley paddy which had borne many a fruit of sāli  in this way this saddhā after having established itself in the citta santāna attained increase  growth and abundance  by means of the visuddhi of sīla  citta  diṭṭhi  kaṅkhā vitaraṇa maggāmaggañāṇadassana  and after having produced the milk of ñāṇadassana visuddhi accomplishes the fruition of Arahantship borne by many a paṭisambhidā and abhiññā 
On that account Buddha said Saddhābījaṃ the pious faith is the seed 
 There would it be asked When the other fifty two kusaladhamma arise unitedly why is it told thus Saddhāva bījaṃ 
It is said  owing to the bījaṃ kiccakaraṇato 
Indeed according as out of them viññāṇa does the duty of knowing clearly  in this way saddhā does bījakiccaṃ  that saddhā also has become the source of all kusala 
Accordingly Buddha said thus
With the birth of faith he approaches approaching he attends upon  attending upon he fixes his ears to listen  with his ears fixed he listens to dhamma  after having heard he memorises the truth  he investigates the meaning of the truths which he has known by heart owing to his investigation of the meaning the truths he finds pleasure in understanding  owing to his finding pleasure in understanding awareness and desire arise  desire having arisen he makes his effort  after having had his effort made he weighs  after having weighed he makes strenuous effort  being one whose mind is directed towards nibbāna  he visualises by means of his body even absolute truth  and by means of wisdom as well he sees it after having exceedingly penetrated it 
 He burns the bad deeds and his body as well thus tapo this is the adhivacana of doing of such difficult deeds as indriyasamvara  vīriya and dhutaṅga 
here however it signifies indriya saṃvara 
Vuṭṭhī is of many a variety starting with vassavuṭṭhi  and vātavuṭṭhi 
here the significance is vassavuṭṭhi 
Indeed according as having been favoured well with the rain shower the seed as well as the roots of the seed and the crop of the brahmin get growup up do not fade away and reach accomplishment  in this way well favoured by indriyasaṃvara  saddhā saddhamūlā  as well as such dhamma starting with sīla grow up do not fade and reach accomplishment 
On that account Buddha said thus Tapo vuṭṭhī 
Paññāme the grammatical expressionme  should be interpreted as imesupi padesu thus Saddhā me bījaṃ tapo me vuṭṭhi 
 By that on what does He shed light
 O brahmin According as when the seed has been sown by you if there were rain shower it is well and good  shold there be no rain water also must be supplied  likewise when the pole of hirī  the pair of ploughs of wisdom have been made unitedly bound with the tie rope of mind after having had the bullocks of vīriya yoked after having pierced with the pācana and when the bīja of saddhā has been sowed in the field of my own citta santāna there is no such thing as absence of rain 
however this tapa of kilesa is my perpetual and eternal rainshower 
 An individual knows clearly by means of this in other words he himself knows clearly thus paññā  That paññā is of many a variety owing to the classification of sensual sphere etc
here however the significance is maggapaññā along with vipassanā 
Yuganañgalaṃ means yoke and plough
Indeed according as the yoke and plough of the brahmin in this way is the Blessed Ones two types of wisdom
There according as the yoke is the upanissaya of īsā  it lies in front of it is fastened to īsā  it is dependent on ropes  it facilitates the going unitedly of the bullocks  in this way paññā has the supports of such dhamma headed by hirī 
Accordingly Buddha said thusPaññuttarā sabbekusalā dhammā  as well as Paññā hi stṭṭhākusalā vadanti nakkhattarājāriva tārakānaṃ 
Paññā is at the forefront as well because of its being the forerunner of all truths 
Accordingly Buddha said thus Sīlam hirī cāpi satañ ca dhammo anvāyikā paññavato bhavanti 
 Owing to the absence of sense of shame because it has not arisen there occurs īsābaddhā  There is nissaya on rope owing to relative cause of nissaya of the yotta of samādhi reckoned as mano  owing to prohibition of exerting oneself too much and the state of being sluggishly slow there is made to carry out the united going of the bullock of vīriya 
Again according as a plough yoked with a plough share cuts off the massive mass of earth at the time ploughing  and breaks asunder the original textures  in this way at time of vipassanā by means of wisdom harnessed to sati  the massive mass of ārammṇa  the function of accumulation continuity of consciousness becomes broken up the textures rooted in every depravity had themselves broken as under
That paññā as well indeed is for the supramundane even others however should be for the mundance  perhaps
 An individual is being put to shame by means of this in other words he himself is being ashamed he despises the turning out to be of akusala  thus hirī
By the taking of it there is ottappa having been taken up even owing to the condition of practising together
sā means a wooden pole which carries together the yoke and the plough
in this way the hirī of the Blessed One also carries the pole of the plough reckoned as the mundane and supramundane wisdom  owing to absence of paññā when there is no hirī 
Again according as the yoke and the plough fastened to the pole of a plough is efficient in their dutiful work without any waver or slackness  in this way paññā fittingly fastened to hirī does what should be done efficiently unwaveringly and unslackingly
Therefore Buddha saidHirī īsā 
 It ponders and knows thus mano  this is the adhivacana of citta 
here however the significance is samādhi well connected with it with manosīsa 
Yottaṃ means the fastening rope
It is of three types the fastening of the pole of the plough along with yuga  the fastening of balibaddha together with the yoke and the binding of the oxen along with the charioteer 
There just as the rope of the brahmin after having done the fastening of the pole of the plough  the yoke and the bullocks to be such as has been made into a singlebound unit  and has its own functions fittingly finished  in this way the samādhi of the Blessed One after having fastened even everyone of those truths namely hirī  paññā and vīriya in a single āraṃmaṇa with the condition of being balanced and has its own functions fittingly finished
Therefore Buddha said Mano yottaṃ  
 An individual remembers by means of this  the advantage long made etc in other words himself remembers thus sati  that sati has the characteristic mark of not being forgetful 
It causes to split up thus phālo 
He drives by means of this thus pājanaṃ 
Here it is said to be pācanaṃ this is the adhivacana of patoda 
A ploughshare and a goad as well constitute phālapācanaṃ 
Indeed according as the brahmins ploughshare and goad in this way the sati of the Blessed One is harnessed with vipassanā and magga 
There according as the ploughshare duly looks after the plough and goes ahead of the latter as well in this way sati fittingly following the destinies of good deeds or else making to attend upon the ārammaṇa looks after the plough of wisdom  Likewise indeed in such a context as Satārakkhena cetasā viharati  etc sati  is said to be rakkhā 
By way of not being forgetful as well sati is ahead of him
Indeed when the truths have been made familiar with by means of sati  paññā comes to understand comprehensively  not when forgetful 
Again according as keeping on showing the danger of piercing in the driving of the oxen the driver does not give the chance of sinkingly slacking  and restrains the bullocks from going along the wrong road  in this way sati keeping on showing the danger of apāya to the oxen of exertion does not give the chance to sink down into indolence  after having prohibited the wandering about in the wrong pasture  reckoned as kāmaguṇa and urging him in Kammaṭṭhāna  sati restrains the thoughts of the individual from going along the wrong road
Therefore Buddha said thusSati me phālapācanaṃ  
Kāyagutto means he who has his body guarded by means of three types of bodily good conduct 
Vacīgutto means one who is guarded by four forms of verbal good conduct 
According to this extent pātimokkhasaṃvarasīla has been told
hāre udare yato here in the face of nourishment owing to the condition of having collected all the paccaya  he who is restrained  selfcontrolled  free from upakkilesa  thus is the meaning
By means of this  ājīvapārisuddhisīla has been told
Udare yato means controlled and selfrestrained in the belly a measured eater one who knows ones limit in his eating meal thus it is what has been spoken of
In the face of this knowledge of limit in eating meal paccayapatisevana sīla has been spoken of
By that on what is the light shed 
According as you O brahmin After having sowed your seeds you make a fence of thorns or trees or an allround surrounding wall for the purpose of protecting all round your cultivated crops on that account they the crowds of cattle buffaloes and other beasts do not gain access to the field and do not plunder the crop in this way I also after having sown the seed of saddhā  make three types of enclosures  made of gutti the body  the vocal organ and hāra  for the purpose of protecting all round my crop of kusala of different varieties 
on that account crowds of cattle  buffaloes and beasts  in the form of akusala beginning with rāga  not gaining access to my field do not plunder my different varieties of crops of kusala 
 Saccaṃ karomi niddānaṃ here not speaking wrong not deceiving by means of two doors is saccaṃ 
Niddānaṃ means chedanaṃ  lunanaṃ  uppātanaṃ  It should be understood that it is an accusative word in the sense of instrumentive
Indeed this is the meaning hereSaccena karomi niddānaṃ 
what is it which has been spoken of
According as after having ploughed the outside you make the destruction of grass which spoil your crops either by means of your hand or by means of detaching and burning the  in this way I also after having ploughed inside do the weeding of grass of telling lies which spoil my crops of kusala by means of sacca 
in other words the truth of knowledge should be understood here as the truth  knowledge of this and that according as it has happened 
thus it is told therefore I do weed out the grass comprising the egoistic perception etc thus it should be interpretted in this way
In other words Niddānaṃ means having had it cut off  having had it reaped and having had it destroyed  thus is the meaning
When it is in this way according as you make either your slave or workman do the weeding out sayingyou should have the grasswedds removed thus you make them having had the grass cut off reaped off and removed in this way I make my truth  thus it is befitting to speak of it even in the accusative case expression 
In other words saccaṃ means diṭṭhisaccaṃ 
That I make the weeding out  I do have what should be cut off reaped off and removed thus in this way also it is befitting to speak of even in the accusative case expression
 Soraccaṃ me pamocanaṃ means here this and that kāyiko avītikkammo vācasiko avītikkamo  In this way sīla even is  soraccaṃ  thus what has been told does not signify it here this has but been stated in the manner as begun with kāyagutto   it however signifies fruition of Arahantship
Indeed that fruition of Arahantship also is said to be Soracca owing to the condition of delight in excellent nibbāna 
 Pamocanaṃ means release from fetters 
What is it which has been told
According to the fact that you should be engaged yourself again in either in the evening or on the next day or in the year to come to me it is not in this way
Indeed there is no such thing as release at intervals to me
Indeed originating from the time of the Dasabala Dīpaṅkara I had my oxen of vīriya harnessed at the ploughing a large quantity of cultivation for four innumerable periods and a hundred thousand aeoṅs  I did not first of all release it until I had not become specially selfawakened and become a well selfawakened Buddha
However as and when I had spent all those periods of time and there arose the fruition of Arahantship with its retinue of every good quality to me who was seated on the invincible pedestal at the foot of the bodhi tree then that oxen of exertion was released by me for the attainment of complete ease of every energy  now there will not again be any more such matter as should require harnessing it
In connection with this matter  the Blessed One said thusSoraccaṃ me pamocanaṃ  
Vīriyaṃ me dhuradhorayhaṃ here Vīriyaṃ is the effort which has been spoken of in the manner beginning with The starting of exertion either physical or mental 
A beast of burden at the load is dhuradhorayhaṃ  it bears a burden  thus is the meaning
Indeed just as the plough of the brehmin drawn by the beast of burden at the yoke breaks up the mass of earth  moreover to cuts asunder the original santānaka  in this way the plough of wisdom drawn by exertion breaks the mass according as told moreover it splits up the continuity of the entity of depravity 
Therefore Buddha said thus My exertion is my yoked ox 
In other words the bearing of the previous burden is dhurā  and bearing the original burden is dhoreyhā  The yoke or burden as well as the beast of burden constitute dhuradhorayhā
There according as at each plough of the brahmin the yoked oxen classified as four bullocks drawing the plough  accomplishes the destruction of the roots of grass weeds what has the page  evil deeds whether they had arisen or not as well as the prosperity of good deed 
Therefore Buddha said thusExertion is my yoked ox 
 Yogakkhemādhivāhanaṃ here nibbāna is said to be Yogakkhema  owing to the condition of being secure from fetters  it is being borne after having been made superior  in other words it is being borne facing forward thus adhivāhanaṃ 
the bearing of yogakkhema is the bearing to nibbāna 
By that on what does it shed the light on
According as your yoked oxen is being borne facing forward in the east direction or in any of such direction as west etc likewise my yoked ox is being borne facing forward in the direction of nibbāna
 In this way being borne also gacchati anivattanaṃ it goes without receding
According as the yoked oxen of yours bearing the plough after having reached the extreme limit of the field recedes again  in this way my yoked ox never receding beginning from the time of Dīpaṅkara goes on and on
In other words since by this and that magga the forms of deprevity which ahd been forsaken are not such as should be forsaken again and again just as by means of your plough the grass which had ben cut are such that they should be cut again on a subsequent occasion therefore also this yoke of ox of mine forsaking the seen and plough kilesa  under the influence of the first magga  the gross denominations of depravity under the influence of the second magga  the kilesa accompanied by minimum of residuum under the influence of the third magga  and all forms of depravity  goes without receding gacchati anivattantaṃ
In orther words gacchati anivattaṃ means it goes after having avoided recession  thus is the meaning
Taṃ means the yoked ox 
In this way also the analysis of words should be understood
According as the going of your yoked ox in this way does not reach that region where after arrival the cultivator after having been without soka free from worry  devoid of the dust of rāga  does not feel sorry  however thes goes to that site where having gone one does not grieve yattha gantvā na socati
Where after having gone urging this yoked ox of exertion by means of the goad of awareness a culivator similar to me after having become without anxiety  free from worry  devoid of the dust of rāga does not come to grief  that yoke ox goes to the region reckoned as nibbāna and amato which has become the uprooting of the thorn of every worry 
Now in order to make his conclusion the Blessed One spoke this stanza
In this way having perfected the ploughing it becomes immortal fruit
after having performed this ploughing one becomes released from all suffering 
 This is the meaning of it in brief By me O brahmin Esā this seed of faith having been favoured by the rainshower of austere practice kasi  after having made unitedly fastened the ploughpole made of hirī  by means of a rope made by the mind to the yoke and plough made of wisdom after having plough in the sati which constitutes the plough share caught hold of the goad of awareness after having had it guarded by means of the protection given to the body  vocal organs and nourishment  made the truth for doing the destruction  kaṭṭhā made my ploughing by having had my yoked ox exertion which has the pleasure of release facing forward to nibbāna without receding  at the all round end of the performance of ploughing the four forms of the fruit of monkhood have been made to be attained sā hoti amataphalā means that is the fruition of immortality  that this ploughing is the fruit of immortality 
Amata is said to be nibbāna It has benefit in nibbāna thus is the meaning
Indeed however this ploughing of that pattern brings fruition of immortality even for me singly again moreover indeed whoever he may be whether a khattiya or a brahmin or a merchant or a sudra or a householder or a monk  ploughs this pattern of ploughing all of them also etaṃ kasiṃ kasitvāna sabbadukkhā pamuccati escape from such suffering as vaṭṭadukkha  dukkha dukkha  saṅkhāra dukkha and vipariṇāma dukkha 
In this way the Blessed One brought his desanā to the brahmin to conclusion after having made nibbāna as the allround end and with arehatship as its zenith
 Thereafter the brahmin after having heard the desanā which was deep in meaning  came to comprehend thus evenAfter having eaten my cultivated fruit I became hungry even on the next day  the cultivation of this one however bears fruits of immortality  after having eaten the fruit of that cultivation one is really released from all sufferings the brahmin became pleasingly pious and in order to make his gesture of pious pleasure  began to make his offering of milk rice 
Therefore Buddha said thus Atha kho kasibhāradvājo 
There mahatiyā means in a large  thus is the meaning
Kaṃsapātiyā means in a gold vessel  in his own tray of gold priced at a hundred thousand
Vaḍḍhetvā meand after having touched  after having strewn  thus it is what has been spoken of
Bhagvato upanāmesi means the brahmin brought forward to the Tathāgata respectfully after having lifted it up  previous to having befittingly covered  by means of two layers of canopy after having made it variegated with sappi  madhu  phāṇita etc
In what manner 
Bhuñjatu bhavaṃ Gotamo pāyāsaṃ kassako bhavaṃ means Let the lord Gotama eat the milk rice being a cultivator
Thereafter the btahmin spoke of the matter of the bhāvasādhaka of a cultivator thusYañ cikasati  since my lord  ploughs thus it is what has been spoken of
Then the Blessed One said thusGāthābhigītaṃ me 
There gāthābhigītaṃ means having specially sung with stanzas having gained after having spoken stanzas thus it is what has been spoken of
Me meand by me 
Abhojaneyyaṃ means it is not worthy of making a meal of it 
Sampassataṃ means seeing the purity of right livelihood in other words well seeing all around of seers  of Buddhas  thus it is what has been spoken of
Nesa dhammo means Gāthābhigītaṃ bhuñjitabbaṃ  this deed and this conduct do not exist therefore gāthābhigītaṃ panudanti Buddhā Buddhas dispel gain by specially singing stanzas they reject  they do not eat 
Why however was that stanza for the purpose of milkrice specially singing stanzas was made by the Blessed One by whom has it been said in this way
Not for this purpose the stanza was specially sung as a matter of fact however indeed beginning from early morning Buddha stood near the field of cultivation and not having gained even a spoonful of almsfood again made manifest the entire good quality of Buddha that was received was similar to what was obtained by doers of dancing etc after dancing and singing as well therefore it has been stated thus Gāthābhigītaṃ gained by specially singing stanzas
Food like that also since it is not seemingly fit  therefore it has been spoken of as Abbojaneyyaṃ 
This is not also in conformity with appicchatā  therefore also it has been told in this way as well owing to symphy with the last mass
of their own good quality also by the making manifestation by others just as for example also the potmaker of meagre desire Ghatikāra there how will the Blessed One who was endowed with the extreme limitreaching meagre desire enjoy the gain that has arisen by making manifest his own good quality by himself Hence it is even befitting for the Blessed One to speak of this
 To this extent the monk Gotama after having made the unpious uncharitable brahmin to desire to offer charity by means of singing of stanzas accepted the bhojana  this ones desanā is for the sake of āmisa   thus in order to release himself of this censure of the world Buddha shed light on the allround purity of the desanā  now in order to shed light on the allround purity of his livelihood  said thusDhamme satī brahmanamullacessti Its meaning is When either the deed of ājīvapārisuddhī or dasavidhasucarita dhamme  or Buddhānaṃ cāritadhamme Sati  when it keeps on existing  when it is not spoilt  when it is current  vuttiresā is definitely clean similar to stretching out the palms in the sky seeking  searching  the habit of livelihood of Buddhas thus O brahmin brāhmaṇa
On having been told in this way the brahmin had displeasure arisen saying to himselfBuddha rejects my milk rice it is said that the meal is not kappiya  indeed I have on dhañña  I do not gain the opportunity of offering charity and thought thusPossibly even it may be that Buddha might accept another 
After having come to know of it the Blessed One said to himself I have come after having all round severed the time for wandering about to collect my almsfood with this ideawithin this period of time I shall make this brahmin piously pleased   the brahmin however made himself displeased 
now owing to that displeasure of his mind being angry with me and will not be able to properly penetrate into the excellent truth of amata   the Blessed One said thusAññena ca kevalinaṃ fulfilling the heartdesire wished for that brahmin and for the purpose of promoting the brehmins pleasing piety
There kevalinaṃ means all round filled with every good quality in other words well unconnected with every fetter  thus is the meaning
Mahesim  owing to the condition of being in quest of such good guṇa beginning with an enormous mass of sīla 
Khīṇāsayaṃ owing to the condion of having all round exhausted all the cankers
Kukkucca vūpasantaṃ  owing to the condition ot every regret having been removed after having made as the beginning bad behaviour of hands and feet
Upaṭṭhahassu means you should seve   paṭimānayassu
In this way although when the mind has been aroused by the brahmin Buddha spoke even tacfully  He did not tell thusDo make your offering bring it
The rest here is but clear
 Then the brahmin thought thusThis pāyāsa has been brought for the Blessed One it is not appropriate for me to offer it to any one according to my own desire and said thusAtha kassa cāhaṃ
Consequent upon that the Blessed One came to know thusLeaving aside Tathāgata that pāyāsa was not digestable to the disciples of Tathāgata as well as othersand said thusNa khvāhaṃ taṃ
 There by the expression sadvaka there is the taking of the deva of pañca kāmāvacara  by the expression samāraka there is the taking of the deva  by means of the expression sabrahmaka there is the taking of rūpāvacara brahmā  the arūpāvacara however might eat thus there should not be any assumption 
By means of the expression sasamaṇabrāhmaṃ there is the taking of monks and brahmins who are adversaries and enemies of the sāsana  there is also the taking of monks and brahmins whose evils had been eliminated and ousted 
by the expression pajā there has been taken the world of living creatures  by the expression sadevamanussa there has been taken the sammuti deva and the remaining human beings in this way
here by means of three expressions the world of space and by way of two pajā  the world of living beings has been taken thus it should be understood
This is in brief We shall however comment at length in the ḷāvaka sutta
 Why however would it not go to be rightly digested for anyone among men including devas 
It was owing to having thrown in the sukhuma ojā into the oḷārika 
Indeed in this pāyāsa  in dedication to the Blessed One divine delicacy had been thrown in by devatā even at the moment of the pāyāsa container had been held in hand according as they did into the pāyāsa ao Sujātā as well as when the sūkaramaddava of Cunda was being cooked as well as into the morsel as and when each of the meal of Verañjā was being eaten by the Blessed One in the remaining molasses in the pot of molasses of kaccāyana in the bhessajjakhandhaka 
That pāyāsa owing to the condition of having the delicate divine delicacy thrown into coarse material was not digestible to the devas 
Indeed devas are physically delicate  The material meal of human beings are not rightly digestible to the divine beings
The pāyāsa was not digestible to the humen beings also
Indeed the bodies of human beings are coarse  The delicate divine delicacy is not rightly digestable to them
On the other hand the pāyāsa was digestible to Tathāgata even by means of his normal digestive heat  it gets properly digested 
Owing to his origin of bodily strenght and intellectual vigour thus some say This pāyāsa is digestible to the disciple of Tathāgata whose cankers had become exhausted owing to his strength of samādhi as well as because of his knowledge of limit in eating The pāyāsa is not digestible to other disciples although they may be possessors or magical powers 
In other words here the cause is unthinkable  This is the visaya of Buddha
 Tena hi tvaṃ since I do not see any other individual since it is not kappati to me what is not fit for me is not suited to my disciple also therefore you O brabnim Thus it is what has ben told
Appaharite in the grass that is little green  in other words in the green grass that has slightly grown up similar to the back of a stone 
Appāṇake means without any breathing being  in other words in the massive mass of water devoid of living creatures liable to be killed owing to the cause of plunging the pāyāsa 
this has been told for the purpose of duly looking after the insects of the grass along with the breathing beings which depend upon grass
Ciccitāyati citiciṭāyati in this way it makes sound 
Saṃdhūpāyati it is fumigated and made fragrant all around 
Sampadhū pāyati means even likewise it is made fragrant with fumes to a higher extent 
Why is it in this way
By the ānubhāva of the Blessed One not of water not of pāyāsa  not of the brahmin not of any of the devas or of the yakkha etc
Indeed the Blessed One made his mental resolve in that manner for the purpose of the spiritual remorse of the brahmin
Seyyathāpināma this is mere indication of simile  according as phāla  thus it is what has been told so much even
Saṃviggo Remorseful mentally  lomahaṭṭhajāto became hairbristled bodily 
It is said that ninety nine thouannd pores on his body were uddhaggā resembling gemstudded elephant tusks āhata on a goldwall 
The rest is but clear
 There Evaṃ me sutaṃ etc was spoken by the venerable nanda at the time of the first great council  when asked by the venerable thera Mahākassapa who made dhamma saṅgīti and I sow as well thus it was said by the brahmin Kasibhāra O brahmin I also indeed plough and sow etc was told by the Blessed One
All this had been collected together also and has been spoken of to be Kasibhāradvāja Sutta 
 There Evaṃ this expression evaṃ has the sense of ākāra  nidassana and avadhāraṇa 
Indeed in the sense of ākāra  he sheds light on this meaning by means of this  The word of that Blessed One is one which well promotes different manners subtileties and many an intention  endowed with meaning and characteristic  consisting of different varieties of miracles  profundity of penetration of the truth meaning and teaching  and which has the nature of discrimination commensurate with the own language of each and everyone who would be capable of knowing clearly  then indeed evaṃ me sutaṃ  by me also has been heard in a single manner 
In the sense of indication  saying I am not a sayambhū  this has not been visualised by me thus making himself allround released nanda indicated the entire sutta which should be stated now thus In this way has been heard by me by me in this way has been heard
 In the sense of affirmation  O monks This one is topmost among my disciples who are much learned monks namely this randa topmost among those who possess gati  sati  dhiti and Upaṭṭhāka namely this nanda Thus in order to show his own strength of memorising commansurate with the condition of the praise by the Blessed One in this way the thera nanda evoked the desire to hear of living creatures In this way has been heard by me that as well according to the sense or according to characteristic without deficiency and free from overstatement  even in this way it should be seen not in any other manner
Me sutaṃ here the grammatical expression me has the sense of the grammatical expression mayā the grammatical expression suta has the sense of sotadvāra viññāṇa 
Therefore evaṃ me sutaṃ means in this way has been borne in my memory by means of Viññṅāṇavīthi with Sotaviññāṇa as its forerunner  thus it is what has been stated
 Ekaṃ samayaṃ means at one time 
Bhagavā means bhājavā  bhaggavā  bhattavā  thus it is what has been told
Magadhesu viharati royal princes who were of the districts named magadhā their residence a single district also is spoken of as Magadhā by means ruḷhī sadda 
in that district out of the Magadha districts
Some scholars however are profuse many fold in such manners as starting with Since the sovereign Cetiya was in the course of entering the earth after having spoken falsehood it has been said thus Mā gadhaṃ pavisa  in other words since people were digging earth seeking that king were told Mā gadhaṃ karotha  any hole therefore Magadha
whichever is approved of that should be accepted 
Viharanti he carries his body and makes it turn out to be without its falling down after having interrupted one iriyāpathabādhana by means of another iriyāpatha  thus it is what has been stated
In other words he brings different varieties of welfare to living beings by leading the life of a divinebeing of a brahmā and of an ariya  thus viharati 
Harati means upasaṃharati  upaneti janeti  uppādeti  thus it is what has been stated
Likewise indeed As and when living beings vippaṭipajjanti in sensual pleasures  then it is said that the Blessed One lived the life of a divine being for the purpose of promoting their alobhakusalamūla they might arouse their appreciation here and get clearly detached from kāma pleasures
When however people commit sin towards living beings for the purpose of domination then Buddha would live the life of a brahmā for the purpose of promoting their origin of angerless good deed with this ideaPerphaps even namely after having seen this paṭipatti  they would arouse their appreciation here and would get rid of their anger by means of absence of anger 
When however monks dispute over spiritual controversy  then Buddha would live the life of an ariya for the purpose of evoking their foundation of amoha 
There is however no occasion when Buddha would not live the life of iriyāpatha since without it there would be absence of allround looking after his attabhāva 
This here is in brevity  we shall however say at length in the commentary on Maṅgala Sutta
 Dakkhiṇāgirismim means that hill which had kept itself standing after having surrounded Rājagaha the district on the south side of the same is said to be Dakkhiṇāgiri in that janapada  thus it is what has been spoken of
There the name of the monastery also is that even
Ekanālāyaṃ brāhmaṇagāme the name of that village is Ekanāḷā
here as well many brahmins lived in other words it is brāhmaṇabhogo therefore Brāhmaṇgāmo the village of brehminsthus it is stated
Tena kho pana samayena at that time when the Blessed One after having folded his legs and sat down on the invincible pedestal and had become selfawakened and attained well selfawakened Buddhahood He kept on turning the excellent wheel of truth and resided in the kingdom of Magadha at the Dakkhiṇāgiri monastary depending on the brahmin village of Ekanāḷa awaiting the allround maturity of the brahmins indriya  tena samayena  by the word which has become instrumentive 
Kho pana these two nipāta here constitute merely padapūraṇa  in other words for the purpose of showing adhikārantara  thus it should be seen
Kasibhāradvājassa brāhmaṇassa that brehmin led his life by ploughing  his clan is Bhāradvāja therefore it is said in this way
Pañcamattāni according as in such a context as Bhojane mattaññū here the grammatical expression matta occurs in pamāṇa here also in the same manner therefore five in quantity neither less nor more five hundred ploughs  thus it is what has been stated
Payuttāni means payojitāni  after having placed the ploughs on the backs of bullocks they have been yoked to the ploughs by means of straps  thus is the meaning
 Vappakāle means vapanakāle  at the time of throwing down seeds of crop thus it is what has been told
There there are two types of sowing sowing in mud and sowing in soft soil
The significance here is softsoil sowing
That as well indeed on the first day is maṅgala vappa 
There this is upakaraṇa sampadā  Three thousand oxen had been bred  the horns of all the cattle were made of and fastened with gold their hoofs were made of silver all of them were adorned with garlands of white flowers with every fragrance and sweet scent as well as with five fingers allround complete with major and minor limbs and endowed with all characteristic marks  the cattle were black akin to the colour of collyrium even  some of the oxen were white like the colour of crystal some were red with coral colour some of them were spotted with the colour of masāragalla 
Five hundred were mencultivators all of whom were dressed in new white lower garments Adorned with flower garlands with wreaths of flowers placed on their right shoulders  with portions or their bodies smeared with yellow orpiment and resplendent with red arsenic went to work after having been a cluster after another with ten ploughs each
The head of the ploughs as well as the yokes were covered with gold
At the first plough eight bullocks were yoked and four each at the remaining ploughs the rest were brought for the purpose of keeping going the tired 
In each cluster there was a cartload of seeds each and every one ploughed the field and each and every one sowed seeds
 The brahmin however even very early at dawn had his beard shaved  bathed his body smeared with sweet scented unguents dressed himself in his lower garment which was priced at five hundred  cloaked himself with his upper garment valued at a thousand  adorned each of his ten fingers with two rings making a total of twenty fingerrings at his earlobes were earrings shaped like a lion wrapped round his head was a turban of a brahmin kept a gold garland round his neck  and accompanied by a crowd of brahmins he took command of the work 
Then his wife the brahmin lady had milkrice cooked in many a hundred cauldrons had them mounted on large carts had her bath with fregrent water adorned herself with all adornments and went to the site of cultivation accompanied by a crowd of brahmin ladies
In his house also everywhere was well smeared with sweet scent and there was the performance of bali offering well made with flowers in the fields also in these and those places there were wellhoisted flags 
Together with parijana doing the field work the crowd of audience who visited the work of cultivation munbered one thousand two hundred and fifty
all of them were dressed in new clother For all of then also the milkrice meal was ready to be enjoyed
 Then the brahmin had the maṅgala bali kamma performed at the spot where well washed filled with milk rice  had it well mixed with ghee  honey and molasses  etc
his wife the brehmin lady went about entertaining her five hundred cultivators who were seated after having held such of their individual vessels as were made of gold silver brass and copper with milkrice after naving held in her hand the gold spoon
The brahmin however wandered about after having had the balikamma performed put on his redcoloured gold bound slippers caught hold of his redcoloured gold stick and kept on supervising the catering of his cultivators thus Give milkrice here give ghee here give sugar here
Then the Blessed One still seated in his fragrant chamber came to know of the happening of serving meal said to himself thus This is the time to tame the brahmin put on his lower robe fastened his bodily belt cloaked himself with saṃghāṭi  took his begging bowl and came away from his fragrant chamber according as the unsurpassed charioteerlike tamer of men to that brahmin
On that account the venerable nanda said thus Atha kho Bhagavā pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā 
 There atha is a nipāta indeclinable in the beginning of such a statement as aññādhikāra  Kho means pada pūraṇa 
Bhagavā is even in the said manner
Pubbaṇhasamayaṃ means the time of early portion of the day early at sunrise thus is the meaning in other words at the early time of sunrise is pubbaṇhasamaya  a moment before sunrise  thus it is what has been told
In this way in accantasaṃyoga is gained the upayogavacana 
Nivāsetvā means after having put on  this should be understood by way of vihāra  nivāsana and parivattana 
Indeed it was not that the Blessed One was without lower garment before that
Pattacīvaramādāya means after having taken the bowl with his hands and the robe by means of his body after having accepted and worn  thus is the meaning
It is said that when the Blessed One was desirous of entering for almsfood resembling a bee in the middle of two paduma lotuses which had blossomed  the begging bowl made of stone of the colour of indanīla gem would come to the middle of his two hands
therefore after having accepted with his hands the bowl which had come in this way and after having worn on his body his robe cloaked in such a way as to fringe evenly all round  thus its meaning should be understood in this way
Indeed either in this or that manner collecting and having taken along thus even it is said according as samādāyeva pakkamati 
 Yena means by whichever road 
Kammanto means the place of doing work 
Tena means by that road
Upasaṅkami means gato  by whichever road that led to the brahmin Kasibhāradvājas fieldwork Buddha went by that road thus it is what has been told
Then why did the monks not follow the Blessed One
If asked thus  as and when the Blessed One would be desirous of approaching anywhere alone even He would at the time of wandering about for almsfood close the door and enter the inner fragrant chamber
consequent upon that the monks understood by means of that Saññā thus Today the Blessed One is desirous of entering the village alone even sure enough  Buddha must have sighted even some individual who ought to be led out of saṃsāra 
Those monks would take their bowl and robe circumambulate the fragrant chamber and go on their begging wourn 
At that time as well the Blessed One did in this way and
therefore the monks did not follow the Blessed One
 Tena kho pana samayena means as and at what time the Blessed One approached the fieldwork at that time there happened serving of meal and there turned out to be the function of the meal thus is the meaning
What we spoke of formerly was thus The brahmin lady went about entertaining the five hundred ploughmen who were seated after having held in their hands such vessels as were made of gold silver bronze and copper with milkrice after having held in her hand her gold spoon
Then indeed the Blessed One approached the mealserving spot
For what reason
For the purpose of doing a favour to the brahmin
Indeed the Blessed One did not approach the site of serving meal owing to the condition of desire to eat similar to a man who was a destitute 
Indeed to the Blessed One there were relatives who were Sākiyan and Koliyan Kings numbering eightytwo thousand they were able to provide meals permanently owing to their own prosperity
On the other hand not for the purpose of procuring meals it was that the Blessed One had become a monk Moreover indeed however He became a monk thus Having kept on allround sacrificing the five great paricāga  for many an asaṅkhyeyya and fulfilled the pāramī  I would become mutta and would resolve to make others emancipated become tamed I would determine to tame others having become tranquilled I would make up my mind to tranquilise others having been bound for parinibbāna I would resolve to make others enter parinibbāna
Therefore owing to the condition of having himself emancipated  owing to the condition of having been bound for parinibbāna making others become emancipated  making others enter prainibbāna wandering about in the word Buddha appraoched the mealserving spot for the purpose of doing a favour to the brahmin thus it should be understood
 Upasaṅkamitvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi means having approached in this way He stood on one side
Ekamantaṃ means the niddesa of the natural neuter gender  one spot and one side  thus it is what has been told
In other words it is an accusative expression in the sense of locative  at the place of his visibilety precincts and within hearing of what is spoken  where the brahmin would see him standing there He stood at a high spot 
After having stood Buddha released the ray of his body red in colour like the finest of gold outshining the light of a thousand moons and suns all round measuring eighty cubits from all sides owing to the condition of having been flooded by which the hall of the brahmins fieldwork  its walls the trees and ploughedup lumps of earth etc were as if made of gold
Then the people who had eaten the milkrice sighted the well selfawakened Buddha shining with glory which his body aptly adorned with thirty two excellent lakkhaṇa  accompanied by eighty minor marks with a pair of arms decorated with his fathomlength rays radiating all round with his garland of rays shining bright looking graceful  resembling the moving  lotus lake like the sky surfact with its multitude of shining stars which possess flames of rays  similar to the burning crest of gold hill  who kept himself standing on one side they washed their hands and feet held put their clasped hands and stood after having surrounded the Blessed One
The brahmin Kasibhāradvāja indeed saw the Blessed One surrounded by them in this way who had remained standing for almsfood
after having met the Blessed One the brahmin told this to the latter thus Ahaṃ Kho samaṇa kasāmi ca ca vapāmica 
 Why however this one spoke in this way
Is it because of his lack of pleasing faith in the Blessed One who was allpleasing of inspiring confidence  and had duly attained the most excellently subdued calm composure also Or is it owing to his stinginess over a spoonful of almsfood although he had provided milkrice to one thousand two hundred and fifty people
Not because of both nevertheless indeed he was upset in mind thus Buddha has come to make kammabhaṅga of mine after having seen his men who were not contented with having a look at the Blessed One and who had dropped down their work 
therefore the brahmin spoke in this way
This idea was to that brahmin also after having found out the prosperity of the characteristic marks of the Blessed One If this monk would engage himself in occupation he would become like cūlāmaṇi on the head of human beings in the whole island of Jambu  what namely is his wish unfulfilled  owing to the condition of laziness he did not engage himself in occupation  eating his meal after having wandered about for almsfood in cultivation ceremonies  he keeps himself going with abundance of bodily vigour 
On that account he said thus O monk Indeed I plough and I sow after having ploughed and sown I enjoy 
My occupations never failed neither am I like you endowed with lakkhaṇa in this way thus is the significance
Tvampi samaṇa  bhuñjassu  for you who are endowed with lakkhaṇa in this way what wish is there of yours which would not be fulfilled  Thus is the significance
 Moreover this brahmin had heard thus It is said that the prince arose in the family of the Sākiyan sovereign he became a monk after having rejected the sovereignty of the world king
Therefore after having understood thus Now this he the brahmin saying to himself It is said that after having rejected the sovereignty of a world king he was tired   Making censure the brahmin said Ahaṃ kho samaṇa 
Nevertheless however this brahmin was of sharp wisdom  he did not say so keeping the Blessed One under  however after having seen the prosperity of the visible form of the Blessed One the brahmin spoke in this way in order to honour the prosperity of his wisdom and for the purpose of occurrence of conversation  Ahaṃ kho samaṇa 
Consequent upon that the Blessed One spoke thus Ahampi kho brahmaṇa showing himself to be the topmost cultivator and sower in the world including the divine world by way of disciplining the living beings and leading them out of saṃsāra 
 Then there arose to the brahmin this thought This monk said thus I plough and I sow as well
I do not notice any ploughing implements beginning with material yoke and plough does he indeed speak falsehood Or not Thus the brahmin kept on carefully looking at the Blessed One beginning from the soles of his feet up to the tip of his hair above found out by means of his aṅgavijjā his prosperity of thirtytwo excellent characteristic marks owing to the condition of having done his adhikāra  he became full of veneration then and there saying to himself This is out of place and inopportune that such a personage as this would tell a lie the brahmin said thus Na kho mayaṃ passāma bhoto Gotamassa of the venerable Gotama behaving towards the Blessed One by means of his clan after having forsaken the samaṇavāda 
 Having however spoken in this way as well the sharpwitted brahmin after having understood thus In connection with the profundity of meaning this has been said by this personage made his enquiry and being desirous of comprehending that meaning he spoke to the Blessed One by means of a stanza thus
On that account the venerable nande said Atha kho Kasibhāradvājo brāhmaṇo Bhagavantaṃ gāthāya ajjhabhāsi 
There gāthāya means with words fixed by feet of letters or alphabets 
Ajjhabhāsi means abhāsi 
There the brahmin spoke of a combination of ploughing outfits beginning with yoke and plough thus kasiṃ 
On the other hand the Blessed One since the speaking after having had it mounted with the sabhāga former matter  is known as Buddhas pomp and power  therefore the Blessed One said Saddhā bījaṃ  shedding light on Buddhas ānubhāva and mounting by means of pubbadhamma sabhāga common previous truth
Here however what is pubbadhammasabhāga was it not that the Blessed One was asked about combination of ploughing outfits beginning with yoke and plough then however having had the mounting of the seed which had not been asked about commonly  the Blessed One said Saddhā bījaṃ  if it were in this way is not this Kathā without sequence even
It is said in reply thus For Buddhas there does not exist what is known as such kathā as is without sequence neither also do Buddhas speak without having mounted the pubba dhammasabhāga common previous matter
In this way as well here the sequence should be understood On having been enquired by this brahmin about the ploughing by way of the ploughing equipments beginning with yoke and plough
the Blessed One said thus Saddhā bījaṃ  in order to show the ploughing beginning from its origin in order to let the brahmin comprehend the cultivation along with its mūla with its upakāra  with its sambhāra and with its phala  without having all round omitted that this had not been asked about out of compassion for that brahmin
Indeed seed is the source of cultivation since when it exists there is what should be done when it does not exist there is nothing which ought to be done owing to what ought to be done commensurate with its quantity 
Indeed when there is seed they perform their ploughing when there is none they do not make any performance
According to the quantity of seeds as well clever cultivators plough their fields neither what is less saying Let there be no allround decrease of our yield of crops nor what is in excess saying Let not our effort be futile 
Since as well the seed even is the source therefore the Blessed One said Saddhā bījaṃ  in order to show to that brāhmin the cultivation starting from its source and having had his own pubbadhamma mounted with what is common to the seed which is the pubbadhamma in ploughing 
In this way here pubbadhammasabhāga should be understood
 If asked Why after having said what had but been asked and afterwards what had not been asked had not been answered
It is owing to the condition of his upakāra and due to the state of his capacity of dhamma sambandha 
Indeed this brahmin was possessor of wisdom  however owing to the condition of his having been born in the family with heresy he was devoid of devotional faith 
Being devoid of saddhā  the possessor of wisdom did not attain visesa not regulating his life in his own sphere with the pious faith of others  he did not do his accomplishment of advantage on the occuring together of his weak faith and strong wisdom which constitute the characteristic mark of mere pleasing piety comprising the disappearance of the darkness of depravity  similar to an ox yoked to a single load along with an elephant
Therefore for him saddhā was beneficial 
In this way owing to the condition of being with upakāra for that brahmin with making that brahmin established in saddhā what should be spoken afterwards also this matter had been told before owing to the condition of cleverness in desanā according as elsewhere also thus Saddhā bandhati pātheyyaṃ  saddhā dutiyassa purisassa hoti faith is for the companion for the man Saddhīdha vittaṃ purisassa seṭṭham  Saddhāya tarati oghaṃ  Saddhāhattho mahānāgo  saddhesito kho bhikkhave ariyasāvako ca 
Rain is the benefactor of seeds as well That rain on being told even immediately even is capable
In this way it should be spoken afterward also owing to the condition of the combination of truth being capable  this matter had been told before the other also is of this kind the tie of a plough etc
 There excellent pleasing piety is the characteristic mark of saddhā  in other words its characteristic mark is confidence  pakkhandana is its rasa  adhimutti is its paccupaṭṭhāna  in other words akālussiya is its paccupaṭṭhāna  the sotāpattiyaṅga is its padaṭṭhānā  in other words the dhamma which should be believed is its padaṭṭhāna  the mind has become pleasant resembling the clarity of the surface of a mirror and of water etc similar to the gem which makes water clear to the water saddhā is the clarifier of sampayutta dhamma 
Bījaṃ is of five types mūla bījaṃ  aggabījaṃ  bījabījaṃ even is the fifth
Att that also goes to be calculated as as even bīja owing to its meaning of viruhana 
Accordingly Buddha said Bījañ ca etaṃ virulhanaṭṭhena this is seed as well
 There according as in the cultivation of the brahmin the seed which has become the source does two duties below it establishes itself with the root above it causes the sprout to rise up 
According as that seed after having collected the taste of the earth and the taste of the water by means of its root it increases in size with its stalk for the purpose of holding allround mature grain of paddy  in this way this faith after having collected the taste of samatha and vipassanā by means of the root of moral precepts  develops in size by means of the stalk of ariyamagga for the purpose of holding the all round mature grain of ariyaphala 
According as well that seed after having established itself on good ground and attained increase  growth and abundance by means of its root sprout leaves stalk  joints and offsprings  produced milk and accomplishes the head of barley paddy which had borne many a fruit of sāli  in this way this saddhā after having established itself in the citta santāna attained increase  growth and abundance  by means of the visuddhi of sīla  citta  diṭṭhi  kaṅkhā vitaraṇa maggāmaggañāṇadassana  and after having produced the milk of ñāṇadassana visuddhi accomplishes the fruition of Arahantship borne by many a paṭisambhidā and abhiññā 
On that account Buddha said Saddhābījaṃ the pious faith is the seed 
 There would it be asked When the other fifty two kusaladhamma arise unitedly why is it told thus Saddhāva bījaṃ 
It is said  owing to the bījaṃ kiccakaraṇato 
Indeed according as out of them viññāṇa does the duty of knowing clearly  in this way saddhā does bījakiccaṃ  that saddhā also has become the source of all kusala 
Accordingly Buddha said thus
With the birth of faith he approaches approaching he attends upon  attending upon he fixes his ears to listen  with his ears fixed he listens to dhamma  after having heard he memorises the truth  he investigates the meaning of the truths which he has known by heart owing to his investigation of the meaning the truths he finds pleasure in understanding  owing to his finding pleasure in understanding awareness and desire arise  desire having arisen he makes his effort  after having had his effort made he weighs  after having weighed he makes strenuous effort  being one whose mind is directed towards nibbāna  he visualises by means of his body even absolute truth  and by means of wisdom as well he sees it after having exceedingly penetrated it 
 He burns the bad deeds and his body as well thus tapo this is the adhivacana of doing of such difficult deeds as indriyasamvara  vīriya and dhutaṅga 
here however it signifies indriya saṃvara 
Vuṭṭhī is of many a variety starting with vassavuṭṭhi  and vātavuṭṭhi 
here the significance is vassavuṭṭhi 
Indeed according as having been favoured well with the rain shower the seed as well as the roots of the seed and the crop of the brahmin get growup up do not fade away and reach accomplishment  in this way well favoured by indriyasaṃvara  saddhā saddhamūlā  as well as such dhamma starting with sīla grow up do not fade and reach accomplishment 
On that account Buddha said thus Tapo vuṭṭhī 
Paññāme the grammatical expressionme  should be interpreted as imesupi padesu thus Saddhā me bījaṃ tapo me vuṭṭhi 
 By that on what does He shed light
 O brahmin According as when the seed has been sown by you if there were rain shower it is well and good  shold there be no rain water also must be supplied  likewise when the pole of hirī  the pair of ploughs of wisdom have been made unitedly bound with the tie rope of mind after having had the bullocks of vīriya yoked after having pierced with the pācana and when the bīja of saddhā has been sowed in the field of my own citta santāna there is no such thing as absence of rain 
however this tapa of kilesa is my perpetual and eternal rainshower 
 An individual knows clearly by means of this in other words he himself knows clearly thus paññā  That paññā is of many a variety owing to the classification of sensual sphere etc
here however the significance is maggapaññā along with vipassanā 
Yuganañgalaṃ means yoke and plough
Indeed according as the yoke and plough of the brahmin in this way is the Blessed Ones two types of wisdom
There according as the yoke is the upanissaya of īsā  it lies in front of it is fastened to īsā  it is dependent on ropes  it facilitates the going unitedly of the bullocks  in this way paññā has the supports of such dhamma headed by hirī 
Accordingly Buddha said thusPaññuttarā sabbekusalā dhammā  as well as Paññā hi stṭṭhākusalā vadanti nakkhattarājāriva tārakānaṃ 
Paññā is at the forefront as well because of its being the forerunner of all truths 
Accordingly Buddha said thus Sīlam hirī cāpi satañ ca dhammo anvāyikā paññavato bhavanti 
 Owing to the absence of sense of shame because it has not arisen there occurs īsābaddhā  There is nissaya on rope owing to relative cause of nissaya of the yotta of samādhi reckoned as mano  owing to prohibition of exerting oneself too much and the state of being sluggishly slow there is made to carry out the united going of the bullock of vīriya 
Again according as a plough yoked with a plough share cuts off the massive mass of earth at the time ploughing  and breaks asunder the original textures  in this way at time of vipassanā by means of wisdom harnessed to sati  the massive mass of ārammṇa  the function of accumulation continuity of consciousness becomes broken up the textures rooted in every depravity had themselves broken as under
That paññā as well indeed is for the supramundane even others however should be for the mundance  perhaps
 An individual is being put to shame by means of this in other words he himself is being ashamed he despises the turning out to be of akusala  thus hirī
By the taking of it there is ottappa having been taken up even owing to the condition of practising together
sā means a wooden pole which carries together the yoke and the plough
in this way the hirī of the Blessed One also carries the pole of the plough reckoned as the mundane and supramundane wisdom  owing to absence of paññā when there is no hirī 
Again according as the yoke and the plough fastened to the pole of a plough is efficient in their dutiful work without any waver or slackness  in this way paññā fittingly fastened to hirī does what should be done efficiently unwaveringly and unslackingly
Therefore Buddha saidHirī īsā 
 It ponders and knows thus mano  this is the adhivacana of citta 
here however the significance is samādhi well connected with it with manosīsa 
Yottaṃ means the fastening rope
It is of three types the fastening of the pole of the plough along with yuga  the fastening of balibaddha together with the yoke and the binding of the oxen along with the charioteer 
There just as the rope of the brahmin after having done the fastening of the pole of the plough  the yoke and the bullocks to be such as has been made into a singlebound unit  and has its own functions fittingly finished  in this way the samādhi of the Blessed One after having fastened even everyone of those truths namely hirī  paññā and vīriya in a single āraṃmaṇa with the condition of being balanced and has its own functions fittingly finished
Therefore Buddha said Mano yottaṃ  
 An individual remembers by means of this  the advantage long made etc in other words himself remembers thus sati  that sati has the characteristic mark of not being forgetful 
It causes to split up thus phālo 
He drives by means of this thus pājanaṃ 
Here it is said to be pācanaṃ this is the adhivacana of patoda 
A ploughshare and a goad as well constitute phālapācanaṃ 
Indeed according as the brahmins ploughshare and goad in this way the sati of the Blessed One is harnessed with vipassanā and magga 
There according as the ploughshare duly looks after the plough and goes ahead of the latter as well in this way sati fittingly following the destinies of good deeds or else making to attend upon the ārammaṇa looks after the plough of wisdom  Likewise indeed in such a context as Satārakkhena cetasā viharati  etc sati  is said to be rakkhā 
By way of not being forgetful as well sati is ahead of him
Indeed when the truths have been made familiar with by means of sati  paññā comes to understand comprehensively  not when forgetful 
Again according as keeping on showing the danger of piercing in the driving of the oxen the driver does not give the chance of sinkingly slacking  and restrains the bullocks from going along the wrong road  in this way sati keeping on showing the danger of apāya to the oxen of exertion does not give the chance to sink down into indolence  after having prohibited the wandering about in the wrong pasture  reckoned as kāmaguṇa and urging him in Kammaṭṭhāna  sati restrains the thoughts of the individual from going along the wrong road
Therefore Buddha said thusSati me phālapācanaṃ  
Kāyagutto means he who has his body guarded by means of three types of bodily good conduct 
Vacīgutto means one who is guarded by four forms of verbal good conduct 
According to this extent pātimokkhasaṃvarasīla has been told
hāre udare yato here in the face of nourishment owing to the condition of having collected all the paccaya  he who is restrained  selfcontrolled  free from upakkilesa  thus is the meaning
By means of this  ājīvapārisuddhisīla has been told
Udare yato means controlled and selfrestrained in the belly a measured eater one who knows ones limit in his eating meal thus it is what has been spoken of
In the face of this knowledge of limit in eating meal paccayapatisevana sīla has been spoken of
By that on what is the light shed 
According as you O brahmin After having sowed your seeds you make a fence of thorns or trees or an allround surrounding wall for the purpose of protecting all round your cultivated crops on that account they the crowds of cattle buffaloes and other beasts do not gain access to the field and do not plunder the crop in this way I also after having sown the seed of saddhā  make three types of enclosures  made of gutti the body  the vocal organ and hāra  for the purpose of protecting all round my crop of kusala of different varieties 
on that account crowds of cattle  buffaloes and beasts  in the form of akusala beginning with rāga  not gaining access to my field do not plunder my different varieties of crops of kusala 
 Saccaṃ karomi niddānaṃ here not speaking wrong not deceiving by means of two doors is saccaṃ 
Niddānaṃ means chedanaṃ  lunanaṃ  uppātanaṃ  It should be understood that it is an accusative word in the sense of instrumentive
Indeed this is the meaning hereSaccena karomi niddānaṃ 
what is it which has been spoken of
According as after having ploughed the outside you make the destruction of grass which spoil your crops either by means of your hand or by means of detaching and burning the  in this way I also after having ploughed inside do the weeding of grass of telling lies which spoil my crops of kusala by means of sacca 
in other words the truth of knowledge should be understood here as the truth  knowledge of this and that according as it has happened 
thus it is told therefore I do weed out the grass comprising the egoistic perception etc thus it should be interpretted in this way
In other words Niddānaṃ means having had it cut off  having had it reaped and having had it destroyed  thus is the meaning
When it is in this way according as you make either your slave or workman do the weeding out sayingyou should have the grasswedds removed thus you make them having had the grass cut off reaped off and removed in this way I make my truth  thus it is befitting to speak of it even in the accusative case expression 
In other words saccaṃ means diṭṭhisaccaṃ 
That I make the weeding out  I do have what should be cut off reaped off and removed thus in this way also it is befitting to speak of even in the accusative case expression
 Soraccaṃ me pamocanaṃ means here this and that kāyiko avītikkammo vācasiko avītikkamo  In this way sīla even is  soraccaṃ  thus what has been told does not signify it here this has but been stated in the manner as begun with kāyagutto   it however signifies fruition of Arahantship
Indeed that fruition of Arahantship also is said to be Soracca owing to the condition of delight in excellent nibbāna 
 Pamocanaṃ means release from fetters 
What is it which has been told
According to the fact that you should be engaged yourself again in either in the evening or on the next day or in the year to come to me it is not in this way
Indeed there is no such thing as release at intervals to me
Indeed originating from the time of the Dasabala Dīpaṅkara I had my oxen of vīriya harnessed at the ploughing a large quantity of cultivation for four innumerable periods and a hundred thousand aeoṅs  I did not first of all release it until I had not become specially selfawakened and become a well selfawakened Buddha
However as and when I had spent all those periods of time and there arose the fruition of Arahantship with its retinue of every good quality to me who was seated on the invincible pedestal at the foot of the bodhi tree then that oxen of exertion was released by me for the attainment of complete ease of every energy  now there will not again be any more such matter as should require harnessing it
In connection with this matter  the Blessed One said thusSoraccaṃ me pamocanaṃ  
Vīriyaṃ me dhuradhorayhaṃ here Vīriyaṃ is the effort which has been spoken of in the manner beginning with The starting of exertion either physical or mental 
A beast of burden at the load is dhuradhorayhaṃ  it bears a burden  thus is the meaning
Indeed just as the plough of the brehmin drawn by the beast of burden at the yoke breaks up the mass of earth  moreover to cuts asunder the original santānaka  in this way the plough of wisdom drawn by exertion breaks the mass according as told moreover it splits up the continuity of the entity of depravity 
Therefore Buddha said thus My exertion is my yoked ox 
In other words the bearing of the previous burden is dhurā  and bearing the original burden is dhoreyhā  The yoke or burden as well as the beast of burden constitute dhuradhorayhā
There according as at each plough of the brahmin the yoked oxen classified as four bullocks drawing the plough  accomplishes the destruction of the roots of grass weeds what has the page  evil deeds whether they had arisen or not as well as the prosperity of good deed 
Therefore Buddha said thusExertion is my yoked ox 
 Yogakkhemādhivāhanaṃ here nibbāna is said to be Yogakkhema  owing to the condition of being secure from fetters  it is being borne after having been made superior  in other words it is being borne facing forward thus adhivāhanaṃ 
the bearing of yogakkhema is the bearing to nibbāna 
By that on what does it shed the light on
According as your yoked oxen is being borne facing forward in the east direction or in any of such direction as west etc likewise my yoked ox is being borne facing forward in the direction of nibbāna
 In this way being borne also gacchati anivattanaṃ it goes without receding
According as the yoked oxen of yours bearing the plough after having reached the extreme limit of the field recedes again  in this way my yoked ox never receding beginning from the time of Dīpaṅkara goes on and on
In other words since by this and that magga the forms of deprevity which ahd been forsaken are not such as should be forsaken again and again just as by means of your plough the grass which had ben cut are such that they should be cut again on a subsequent occasion therefore also this yoke of ox of mine forsaking the seen and plough kilesa  under the influence of the first magga  the gross denominations of depravity under the influence of the second magga  the kilesa accompanied by minimum of residuum under the influence of the third magga  and all forms of depravity  goes without receding gacchati anivattantaṃ
In orther words gacchati anivattaṃ means it goes after having avoided recession  thus is the meaning
Taṃ means the yoked ox 
In this way also the analysis of words should be understood
According as the going of your yoked ox in this way does not reach that region where after arrival the cultivator after having been without soka free from worry  devoid of the dust of rāga  does not feel sorry  however thes goes to that site where having gone one does not grieve yattha gantvā na socati
Where after having gone urging this yoked ox of exertion by means of the goad of awareness a culivator similar to me after having become without anxiety  free from worry  devoid of the dust of rāga does not come to grief  that yoke ox goes to the region reckoned as nibbāna and amato which has become the uprooting of the thorn of every worry 
Now in order to make his conclusion the Blessed One spoke this stanza
In this way having perfected the ploughing it becomes immortal fruit
after having performed this ploughing one becomes released from all suffering 
 This is the meaning of it in brief By me O brahmin Esā this seed of faith having been favoured by the rainshower of austere practice kasi  after having made unitedly fastened the ploughpole made of hirī  by means of a rope made by the mind to the yoke and plough made of wisdom after having plough in the sati which constitutes the plough share caught hold of the goad of awareness after having had it guarded by means of the protection given to the body  vocal organs and nourishment  made the truth for doing the destruction  kaṭṭhā made my ploughing by having had my yoked ox exertion which has the pleasure of release facing forward to nibbāna without receding  at the all round end of the performance of ploughing the four forms of the fruit of monkhood have been made to be attained sā hoti amataphalā means that is the fruition of immortality  that this ploughing is the fruit of immortality 
Amata is said to be nibbāna It has benefit in nibbāna thus is the meaning
Indeed however this ploughing of that pattern brings fruition of immortality even for me singly again moreover indeed whoever he may be whether a khattiya or a brahmin or a merchant or a sudra or a householder or a monk  ploughs this pattern of ploughing all of them also etaṃ kasiṃ kasitvāna sabbadukkhā pamuccati escape from such suffering as vaṭṭadukkha  dukkha dukkha  saṅkhāra dukkha and vipariṇāma dukkha 
In this way the Blessed One brought his desanā to the brahmin to conclusion after having made nibbāna as the allround end and with arehatship as its zenith
 Thereafter the brahmin after having heard the desanā which was deep in meaning  came to comprehend thus evenAfter having eaten my cultivated fruit I became hungry even on the next day  the cultivation of this one however bears fruits of immortality  after having eaten the fruit of that cultivation one is really released from all sufferings the brahmin became pleasingly pious and in order to make his gesture of pious pleasure  began to make his offering of milk rice 
Therefore Buddha said thus Atha kho kasibhāradvājo 
There mahatiyā means in a large  thus is the meaning
Kaṃsapātiyā means in a gold vessel  in his own tray of gold priced at a hundred thousand
Vaḍḍhetvā meand after having touched  after having strewn  thus it is what has been spoken of
Bhagvato upanāmesi means the brahmin brought forward to the Tathāgata respectfully after having lifted it up  previous to having befittingly covered  by means of two layers of canopy after having made it variegated with sappi  madhu  phāṇita etc
In what manner 
Bhuñjatu bhavaṃ Gotamo pāyāsaṃ kassako bhavaṃ means Let the lord Gotama eat the milk rice being a cultivator
Thereafter the btahmin spoke of the matter of the bhāvasādhaka of a cultivator thusYañ cikasati  since my lord  ploughs thus it is what has been spoken of
Then the Blessed One said thusGāthābhigītaṃ me 
There gāthābhigītaṃ means having specially sung with stanzas having gained after having spoken stanzas thus it is what has been spoken of
Me meand by me 
Abhojaneyyaṃ means it is not worthy of making a meal of it 
Sampassataṃ means seeing the purity of right livelihood in other words well seeing all around of seers  of Buddhas  thus it is what has been spoken of
Nesa dhammo means Gāthābhigītaṃ bhuñjitabbaṃ  this deed and this conduct do not exist therefore gāthābhigītaṃ panudanti Buddhā Buddhas dispel gain by specially singing stanzas they reject  they do not eat 
Why however was that stanza for the purpose of milkrice specially singing stanzas was made by the Blessed One by whom has it been said in this way
Not for this purpose the stanza was specially sung as a matter of fact however indeed beginning from early morning Buddha stood near the field of cultivation and not having gained even a spoonful of almsfood again made manifest the entire good quality of Buddha that was received was similar to what was obtained by doers of dancing etc after dancing and singing as well therefore it has been stated thus Gāthābhigītaṃ gained by specially singing stanzas
Food like that also since it is not seemingly fit  therefore it has been spoken of as Abbojaneyyaṃ 
This is not also in conformity with appicchatā  therefore also it has been told in this way as well owing to symphy with the last mass
of their own good quality also by the making manifestation by others just as for example also the potmaker of meagre desire Ghatikāra there how will the Blessed One who was endowed with the extreme limitreaching meagre desire enjoy the gain that has arisen by making manifest his own good quality by himself Hence it is even befitting for the Blessed One to speak of this
 To this extent the monk Gotama after having made the unpious uncharitable brahmin to desire to offer charity by means of singing of stanzas accepted the bhojana  this ones desanā is for the sake of āmisa   thus in order to release himself of this censure of the world Buddha shed light on the allround purity of the desanā  now in order to shed light on the allround purity of his livelihood  said thusDhamme satī brahmanamullacessti Its meaning is When either the deed of ājīvapārisuddhī or dasavidhasucarita dhamme  or Buddhānaṃ cāritadhamme Sati  when it keeps on existing  when it is not spoilt  when it is current  vuttiresā is definitely clean similar to stretching out the palms in the sky seeking  searching  the habit of livelihood of Buddhas thus O brahmin brāhmaṇa
On having been told in this way the brahmin had displeasure arisen saying to himselfBuddha rejects my milk rice it is said that the meal is not kappiya  indeed I have on dhañña  I do not gain the opportunity of offering charity and thought thusPossibly even it may be that Buddha might accept another 
After having come to know of it the Blessed One said to himself I have come after having all round severed the time for wandering about to collect my almsfood with this ideawithin this period of time I shall make this brahmin piously pleased   the brahmin however made himself displeased 
now owing to that displeasure of his mind being angry with me and will not be able to properly penetrate into the excellent truth of amata   the Blessed One said thusAññena ca kevalinaṃ fulfilling the heartdesire wished for that brahmin and for the purpose of promoting the brehmins pleasing piety
There kevalinaṃ means all round filled with every good quality in other words well unconnected with every fetter  thus is the meaning
Mahesim  owing to the condition of being in quest of such good guṇa beginning with an enormous mass of sīla 
Khīṇāsayaṃ owing to the condion of having all round exhausted all the cankers
Kukkucca vūpasantaṃ  owing to the condition ot every regret having been removed after having made as the beginning bad behaviour of hands and feet
Upaṭṭhahassu means you should seve   paṭimānayassu
In this way although when the mind has been aroused by the brahmin Buddha spoke even tacfully  He did not tell thusDo make your offering bring it
The rest here is but clear
 Then the brahmin thought thusThis pāyāsa has been brought for the Blessed One it is not appropriate for me to offer it to any one according to my own desire and said thusAtha kassa cāhaṃ
Consequent upon that the Blessed One came to know thusLeaving aside Tathāgata that pāyāsa was not digestable to the disciples of Tathāgata as well as othersand said thusNa khvāhaṃ taṃ
 There by the expression sadvaka there is the taking of the deva of pañca kāmāvacara  by the expression samāraka there is the taking of the deva  by means of the expression sabrahmaka there is the taking of rūpāvacara brahmā  the arūpāvacara however might eat thus there should not be any assumption 
By means of the expression sasamaṇabrāhmaṃ there is the taking of monks and brahmins who are adversaries and enemies of the sāsana  there is also the taking of monks and brahmins whose evils had been eliminated and ousted 
by the expression pajā there has been taken the world of living creatures  by the expression sadevamanussa there has been taken the sammuti deva and the remaining human beings in this way
here by means of three expressions the world of space and by way of two pajā  the world of living beings has been taken thus it should be understood
This is in brief We shall however comment at length in the ḷāvaka sutta
 Why however would it not go to be rightly digested for anyone among men including devas 
It was owing to having thrown in the sukhuma ojā into the oḷārika 
Indeed in this pāyāsa  in dedication to the Blessed One divine delicacy had been thrown in by devatā even at the moment of the pāyāsa container had been held in hand according as they did into the pāyāsa ao Sujātā as well as when the sūkaramaddava of Cunda was being cooked as well as into the morsel as and when each of the meal of Verañjā was being eaten by the Blessed One in the remaining molasses in the pot of molasses of kaccāyana in the bhessajjakhandhaka 
That pāyāsa owing to the condition of having the delicate divine delicacy thrown into coarse material was not digestible to the devas 
Indeed devas are physically delicate  The material meal of human beings are not rightly digestible to the divine beings
The pāyāsa was not digestible to the humen beings also
Indeed the bodies of human beings are coarse  The delicate divine delicacy is not rightly digestable to them
On the other hand the pāyāsa was digestible to Tathāgata even by means of his normal digestive heat  it gets properly digested 
Owing to his origin of bodily strenght and intellectual vigour thus some say This pāyāsa is digestible to the disciple of Tathāgata whose cankers had become exhausted owing to his strength of samādhi as well as because of his knowledge of limit in eating The pāyāsa is not digestible to other disciples although they may be possessors or magical powers 
In other words here the cause is unthinkable  This is the visaya of Buddha
 Tena hi tvaṃ since I do not see any other individual since it is not kappati to me what is not fit for me is not suited to my disciple also therefore you O brabnim Thus it is what has ben told
Appaharite in the grass that is little green  in other words in the green grass that has slightly grown up similar to the back of a stone 
Appāṇake means without any breathing being  in other words in the massive mass of water devoid of living creatures liable to be killed owing to the cause of plunging the pāyāsa 
this has been told for the purpose of duly looking after the insects of the grass along with the breathing beings which depend upon grass
Ciccitāyati citiciṭāyati in this way it makes sound 
Saṃdhūpāyati it is fumigated and made fragrant all around 
Sampadhū pāyati means even likewise it is made fragrant with fumes to a higher extent 
Why is it in this way
By the ānubhāva of the Blessed One not of water not of pāyāsa  not of the brahmin not of any of the devas or of the yakkha etc
Indeed the Blessed One made his mental resolve in that manner for the purpose of the spiritual remorse of the brahmin
Seyyathāpināma this is mere indication of simile  according as phāla  thus it is what has been told so much even
Saṃviggo Remorseful mentally  lomahaṭṭhajāto became hairbristled bodily 
It is said that ninety nine thouannd pores on his body were uddhaggā resembling gemstudded elephant tusks āhata on a goldwall 
The rest is but clear
Evaṃ me sutaṃ thus Kasibhāradvājasutta
What is its origin
The Blessed One was residing among people of Magadha in Dakkhiṇāgiri  at the brahmin village of ekanālā  out of these two duties of Buddha comprising purebhattakicca and pacchābhattakicca the Blessed One had his purebhattakicca completed and towards the end of pacchābhattakicca  He had a look at the world by means of his Buddha eye and sighted the brahmin Bhāradvāja to have been endowed with upanissaya for Arahantship the Blessed One came to know thus When I go there conversation will happen thereafter at the end of the kathā  this brahmin will become monk after he had listened to my dhammadesanā and attain Arahantship the Blessed One went there personally promoted the conversation and spoke this sutta
 There it may be asked thus What is the purebhattakicca of Buddhas What is the pacchābhattakicca 
It is stated thus  Buddha the Blessed One used to get up even early at dawn do his bodily ablutions comprising facewashing etc for the purpose of doing favour to his serving attendent as well as for the sake of his own bodily comfort  till the time arrives for begging round Buddha used to spend his time at a secluded seat  put on his lower garment at the time of wandering about for alms food fasten his bodily belt  cloak himself in his upper robe  take his begging bowl and enter either a village or a market town for collecting almsfood sometimes even all alone and sometimes surrounded by the organisation of monds sometimes normally and sometimes with the turnings outtobe of many a miracle 
What is this for example  When the protector of the world entered to collect alms food softblowing breezes would go before and ahead and clean the earth the clouds in the sky permeated with water which release themselves would make the dust subside on the road and would station themselves behaving as an awning above the Blessed One
later  winds would pluck flowers and scatter them on the road raised portions of land would level themselves down and the depressions would become heaved up to provide an even surface  at the time of his dropping down of the feet the ground would be evenly level otherwise lotusflowers which have comfortable contacts of the size of a chariotswheel would receive his feet as and when his right foot has been put down within the citygate  his sixcoloured rays would radiate from his body resembling reddish gold colour or similar to having been surrounded by variegated cloth  making themselves shaped like the pinnacleroofed palaces etc and run about from here to there as well elephants horses and birds who would keep themselves stationed in their own homes would make their sounds in a sweet manner likewise musical instruments beginning with drums and lutes as well as bodily adornments of humanbeings by means of that knowledge of their own people came to know thusToday the Blessed One has entered here for almsfood
They dressed themselves well in lower and upper garments took along with them fragrant flowers would come out of their houses enter upon the innerpath  respectfully make reverential offering of fragrant flowers etc to the Blessed One pay their homage to the Master beg of the latter thusVenerable sir Please give us two monks please give us twenty please give us a hundred monks they would take a bowl of the Blessed One also have a seat prepared for Buddha and would serve the Blessed One respectfully with almsfood
 After having done the duty of mealeating the Blessed One looked at their santāna and would teach the truth in such a way that some would become established in saraṇagamana  some in the five moral precepts some in any of the fruitions of sotāpatti  sakadāgāmi and anāgāmi  some would become monks and get established on the topmost fruition of Arahantship
In this way after having done favour to multitude of men Buddha would rise up from his seat and go back to the monastery
There in the pavilion  Buddha would take his seat prepared for him awaiting the end of mealeating by bhikkhus
Thereafter at the end of mealeating of monks the attendant in service would let the Blessed One know of it 
then the Blessed One would enter his fragrant chamber
This first of all is purebhattakiccaṃ 
Whatever has not been told here that should be taken even in the said manner in Btahmāyu sutta
 Then the Blessed One would have done his forenoon duty in this way would sit being waited upon in his fragrant chamber have his feet washed stand on the footstool and advise the organisation of monks thusO monks You should work for your salvation diligently in this world appearance of Buddha is a rarity to gain the appropriate gain of humanhood in difficult to obtain prosperity of faith is difficult to gain  momkhood is hard to gain listening to the good truth is difficult to gain in the world
Thereafter the monks would pay their homage to the Blessed One and ask for kammaṭṭhāna 
then the Blessed One would give kammaṭṭhāna to the monks by way of their individual cariya 
The monks would learn the kammaṭṭhāna beg leave of the Blessed One with their adoration and would go to their respective residences Some to the forest some to the foot of a tree some to one or other of the hills etc some to the nansion of the four great divine kings  some to the divine mansion of Vasavatti
Thereafter the Blessed One would enter his fragrant chamber and slould He so on his right side with awareness and thoughtfulness for a muhutta 
Then with his body refreshed Buddha rose up and in the second portion would look at the world
In the third portion depending on either whatever village of market town the Blessed One dwelt there the multitude of men after having given charity in the forenoon  would get themselves well dressed in lower and upper garment and would assemble in the monastery taking a long with them fragrant flowers etc
Thereafter the Blessed One with his miracle commensurate with the audience which had wellarrived would go sit down on the excellently prepared Buddhas seat in the dhammasabhā and teach such dhamma as would suit the oceasion and befitting in pamāna 
Later on after having become conscious of the time He would let the audience go back
 Thereafter should the Blessed One desire to bathe his body 
He would rise from Buddhas seat go to the place where his attendant in service had kept water ready catch hold of his bathing garment from the hands of his service attendant and enter the bathroom 
The serving attendant also would bring the Buddhas seat and prepare it in the compound of the fragrant chamber 
after having bathed his limbs the Blessed One would put on his double sheeted lowergarment of excellent red colour  fasten his belt have himself cloaked in his upper garment and would come there and sit down all alone for a momentary sitting in seclusion
Then after having come from here and there monks would go to attend upon the Blessed One
There some monks would ask questions some would ask for mental exercise  some would make their request to get the chance of listening to the teaching of the truth 
Fulfilling well their purpose  the Blessed One would spend the first watch of the night
 In the middle watch of the night the divine beings of the entire ten thousand lokadhātu  gaining their oportunity would approach the Blessed One and ask questions according as they had been specially perpared comprising even the four tones of letters also
Answering the questions of those divinebeings the Blessed One would spend the middle watch of the night
Thereafter Buddha would divide the last watch of the night into four portions and make his resolution to walk to and fro for one portion He would lie down like a lion with awareness and thoughtfulness on his right side for the second portion after having entered his fragrant chamber He would spend the third portion with phalasamāpatti  in the fourth portion Buddha would enter mahākaruṇāsamāpatti and look at the world with his Buddhaeye for the purpose of sighting living being who are apparajakkha and mahārajakkha  etc
this is the aftermeal duty 
 Looking at the world in this way by means of his Buddhaeye in order to see such living beings as those who had not done as well as those who had done devoted deeds of service toward Buddha dhamma and saṅgha and those who would be either endowed or not endowed with upanissaya  at the end of the fourth portion reckoned as looking at the world  of this pacchābhattakicca  the Blessed One sighted the brahmin Kasibhāradvāja to have been endowed with upanissaya for the attainment of Arahantship and came to know thus When I go there conversation will happen  thereafter at the end of kathā  this brahmin will become a monk after he had listened to my teaching of the truth and will attain Arahantship the Blessed One went there facilitated the kathā and spoke this sutta 
 After having however fallen down at the feet the brahmin specially appreciating the dhammadesanā of the Blessed One said this to the Blessed One Abhkkantaṃ bho Gotama abhikkantaṃ bho Gotama
 Indeed this grammatical expression  here is in the sense of particular appreciation 
The elucidation of the meaning of it at length however will become evident in the commentary on Maṅgalasutta
Since again it is in the sense of supreme appreciation therefore it has been told thus Sādhu sādhu bho Gotama thus it is what has been spoken of thus it should be understood
In fear in anger in praise in haste  in an uproar  in astonishment 
in laughter  in anxiety  in pleasing piety as well a wise man would make interjection 
By means of this lakkhaṇa as well here under the influence of pleasing piety as well as by way of praise this had been told twice thus it should be understood
In other words abhikkantaṃ means specially lovely  exteemely desirable  excessively endearing and enormously excellent  thus is what has been said
 There with one sound of abhikkanta the brahmin praises  by another one his own pasāda 
This indeed is the significance here Specially lovely O Gotama This namely the dhammadesanā of Lord Gotama definitely desireble O Gotama Depending upon  this namely the dhammadesanā there is my pasāda 
In other words the brahmin praises the vacana of lord Gotama to be specially lovely owing to destruction of dosa  abhikkantaṃ owing to attainment of good quality  likewise owing to promotion of pious faith  Procurement of wisdom  owing to being with meaning with literal language  owing to clear wording  owing to profundity of neaning  owing to being soothing to the ear owing to its reaching to the heart owing to not upgrading oneself  owing to not minimising others  owing to the coolness of compassion owing to pure white wisdom  owing to delightful sphere owing to endurance of destruction  owing to being easy to be heard  owing to the venefit of being tested  thus in this way etc indeed it should be interpreted
 Thereafter subsequently also by means of four similes the brahmin praised the desanā even
There nikkujjitaṃ means what has been placed with face or mouth downwards  in other words what has become face underneath 
Ukkujjeyya means one would make face above 
Paṭicchannaṃ means covered by grass leaves etc 
vivareyya means would uncover open up expose 
Mūḷassa means to one who has become deluded in directions 
Maggaṃ ācikkheyya means after having seized the men by his hand one should say This is the path to travel by 
Andhakāre mean in the darkness of four forms  with rainclouds in the dense forest  with the mass of midnight on the fourteenth night of the waning fortnight 
This first of all is the wordbyword meaning
 This however is the interpretation of the significanceAccording as some one would upturn what had been turned with its face downwares  in this way by making me who had fallen into heresy which constitutes the turning away from the excellent truth  rise up  according as he would open out what had been covered and concealed in this way by the opening of the sāsana which had been covered and concealed by the forest of heresy beginning from the disappearance of despensation of the Blessed One Kassapa according as one would inform the right road to one who had lose his way in this way by informing me who had entered upon a wrong journey and the path of heresy the path to heaven and the way of escape from saṃsāra according as one would carry an oillamp lighted in darkness in this way owing to the condition of having taught to me by holding for me the shining light of his desanā which constitutes the destroyer of darkness of delusion which covered and concealed it to me who did not see the visible forms of such gems as begun with Buddha since I was submerged in the darkness of delusion by Lord Gotama by means of these pariyāya  the truth had been made manifest by many a manner 
 In other words since this truth is similar to the upturning of what had been upside down by seeing dukkha with a single thought and by forsaking the perversion in regarding the unpleasant as pleasant  it resembles unveiling what has been covered and concealed by forsaking as well the perversing in considering dukkha as sukha  owing to his seeing the origin of suffering it is equal to intimating the right journey to one who has lost his way  by forsaking his perversion as well in taking as permanent what is impermanent owing to his seeing nirodha it is identical with the shining light in the darkness by forsaking his perversion in connection with atta in anatta owing to his seeing magga  therefore just as for example also  namely either one would upturn what has been upside down  would bear a lighted lamp with the idea Those who have eyes will see visible forms in this way it has been nade manifest
 Since here however sīlakkhandha has been made manifest by means of saddhā  tapa  kāyaguttaka  etc the mass wisdom  by paññā  the mass of concentration by the sense of shame and mind  nirodha by means of yogakkhema  thus the three khandhas of ariyamagga as well as nirodha  in this way thus the two ariyasaccā have been made manifest even in the same form 
there magga is the reverse of samudaya  nirodha is the opposite of dukkha 
thus by this means the four truths have been made manifest
Therefore has been clarified by many a pariyāya  thus it should be understood
 In sohaṃ etc  thus that I 
Saraṇaṃ gacchati means after having fallen down at the feet has reached saranagamana by means of prostration also he now said takig upon himself the obesrvance of it by word of mouth 
In other words by means of prostration he has gone to Buddha even thus now making that refuge in Buddha as the beginning he spoke of his going to the remaninig dhamma and saṅgha 
Ajjatagge means making the very present moment the beginning there is an alternative reading ajjadagge for it the letter d is the maker of union of words  after having made to day the topmost  thus it is what has been stated
Pāṇupetaṃ being endowed with breathings  as long as my life turns out to be  so long as I am endowed with life may the Lord Gotama hold and understand me as having arrived at refuge by means of the three reachings as refuges which have nothing to do with other teachers  thus it is what has been spoken of
Up to this here paṭipatti which was in conformity with pleasantness has been shown by this
In other words by means of this the prosperity of a pupil has been so shown as begun with Esāhaṃ  after having shown the prosperity of the Master by means of nikkujjitādīhi 
In other words by means of this the apt gain of saddhā has been shown after having pointed out the appropriate gain of paññā 
Now in this way by means of the possession of paññā owing to the appropriate gain of saddhā being desirous of doing what should be done made his request to the Blessed One thus Labheyyāhaṃ 
There being specially pleasingly piousminded the brehmin pg for monkhood out of his pious faith thus Even the Blessed One became a monk after having abdicated his supreme sovereignty of a worldking why should I however not  There wishing for the making of allround fulfilment he asked for fullfledged ordination by means of his wisdom 
The rest is but clear
 In such context as Eko vūpakaṭṭho etc however eko means with bodily solitude  vūpakaṭṭho means with the seclusion of mind  Appamatto means without forsaking awareness in kammaṭṭhāna  ātāpī means zealous with endeavour reckoned as physical and mental exertion pahitatto by being regardless for the body as well as for the life  viharanto the life of a certain deportment 
Na cīrasseva  it is said with reference to his monkhood
Kulaputtā there are two types of young men of good families those by birth and those by good conduct  as well
this brahmin however is kulaputta of both the types also
Agārasmā means from the house 
the beneficial welfare of the houses is agāriyaṃ  it is said to be cultivation cattle caring  etc the work of support to the estate  
here there is no household welfare  thus anagāriyaṃ  this is the adhibacana of monkhood Pabbajanti means they go near they approavh 
Tadanuttaraṃ that unsurpassed that superior 
Brahmacariyapariyosānaṃ means the allround end of maggabrahmacariya  the fruition of Arahantship thus it is what has been spoken of
Indeed for that benefit young men of good families become monks
Diṭṭhe va dhamme means in that body in that very existence
Sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā means after having made evident by means of his own very wisdom  after having uderstood that he has not to depend on others 
connotse he dwelt either after having attained or after having striven for accomplishment
Dwelling in this way as well Khīṇā jāti  abbhaññāsi
by means of this he sheds light on his ground of his reflection 
 What jāti of his has become exhausted How again did he specially know it
It is said owing to the condition of having been exhausted even before it is not first and foremost that the past jāti has been exhausted owing to the absence of vāyāma in the future it is not the future birth neither is it the present birth owing to the existing condition 
However whatever birth classified as single aggregate  four and five aggregates in such existences as one four and five vokāra which would arise owing to the condition of having not developed the right path  that birth has become exhausted by having arrived at the state of the nature of not arising owing to the condition of having developed the right path 
After having reflected upon it and the forms of depravity which he had forsaken by means of maggabhāvanā in the absense of kilesa although kamma is existing  there is no taking of conception in time to come  thus knowing he understands
 Vusitaṃ dwelt  allround dwelt had done  practised  had completed  thus is the meaning
Brahmacariyaṃ means the higher life of the right path 
Kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ means what should be done of sixteen types by way of allround knowing forsaking visualising and developing by meditation by means of four right paths in the four truths thus is the meaning
Nāparaṃ itthattāva means now there does not exist maggabhāvanā either owing to this earthly existence in this way for the condition of such sixteen as should be done or for the elimination of depravity 
In other words itthabhāya means from being in this earthly existence  from this such a variety in this way  now there dose not exist subsequent continuity of aggregates apart from the present continuity of aggregates 
however these five aggregated which had been allround understood stand resembling a tree with its roots cut off  thus he completely comprehended 
Aññataro means one a certain one 
Arahataṃ means of the Arahants 
The brahmin became the venerable Bhāradvāja deep inside the group of great disciples thus it is said that this is the significance
Tradition tells us that four asankheyyas  and a hundred thousand cycles ago there was a city called Amaravati
In this city there dwelt a brahmin named Sumedha of good family on both sides on the father s and the mother s side of pure conception for seven generations back by birth unreproached and respected a man comely wellfavoured and amiable and endowed with remarkable beauty
He followed his brahminical studies without engaging in any other pursuit
His parents died while he was still young
A minister of state who acted as steward of his property bringing forth the rollbook of his estate threw open the stores filled with gold and silver gems and pearls and other valuables and said   So much young man belonged to your mother so much to your father so much to your grandparents and greatgrandparents and pointing out to him the property inherited through seven generations he bade him guard it carefully
The wise Sumedha thought to himself   After amassing all this wealth my parents and ancestors when they went to another world took not a farthing with them Can it be right that I should make it an object to take my wealth with me when I go 
And informing the king of his intention he caused proclamation to be made x in the city gave largess to the people and embraced the ascetic life of a hermit
To make this matter clear the Story of Sumedha  must here be related
This story though given in full in the Buddhavamsa from its being in a metrical form is not very easy to understand
I will therefore relate it with sentences at intervals explaining the metrical construction
Four asankheyyas and a hundred thousand cycles ago there was a city called Amaravati or Amara resounding with the ten city cries concerning which it is said in Buddhavamsa 
Now one day the wise Sumedha having retired to the splendid upper apartment of his house seated himself crosslegged and fell athinkingOh  wise man grievous is rebirth in a new existence and the dissolution of the body in each successive place where we are reborn I am subject to birth to decay to disease to death it is right being such that I should strive to attain the cool great deathless Nir vana the tranquil the free from birth and decay and sickness and grief and joy  surely there must be a road that leads to Nirvana and releases man from becoming
Further he reasoned thus   For as in this world there is pleasure as the correlative of pain so where there is becoming there must be its opposite the cessation of becoming 
and as where there is heat there is also cold which neutralizes it so there must be a Nirvana  that extinguishes lust and the other passions 
and as in opposition to a bad and evil condition there is a good and blameless one so where there is evil birth there must also be a Nirvana called the birthless because it puts an end to all that is called rebirth
 but if he does not seek it the fault is not that of the pond 
even so where there is the lake of the great deathless Nirvana for the washing of the defilement of sin if it is not sought it is not the fault of the lake
And just as a man who is surrounded by robbers if when there is a way of escape he does not fly it is not the fault of the way but of the man 
even so when there is a blessed road leading to Nirvana for the man who is encompassed and held fast by sin its not being sought is not the fault of the road but of the person
And as a man who is oppressed with sickness there being a physician who can heal his disease if he does not get cured by going to the physician that is no fault of the physician 
even so if a man who is oppressed by the disease of sin seeks not a spiritual guide who is at hand and knows the road which puts an end to sin the fault lies with him and not with the sindestroying teacher
Again he reasoned thus   Just as a man who has fallen into a heap of filth if he beholds afar off a great pond covered with lotuses of five colours ought to seek that pond saying  By what way shall I arrive there 
And again he argued  As a man fond of gay clothing throwing off a corpse bound to his shoulders goes away rejoicing so must I throwing off this perishable body and freed from all care enter the city of Nirvana
And as men and women depositing filth on a dungheap do not gather it in the fold or skirt of their garments but loathing it throw it away feeling no desire for it  so shall I also cast off this perishable body without regret and enter the deathless city of Nirvana
And as seamen abandon without regret an unseaworthy ship and escape so will I also leaving this body which distils corruption from its nine festering apertures enter without regret the city of Nirvana
And as a man carrying various sorts of jewels and going on the same road with a band of robbers out of fear of losing his jewels withdraws from them and gains a safe road  even so this impure body is like a jewelplundering robber
if I set my affections thereon the jewel of the good doctrine of the sublime path of holiness will be lost to me
therefore ought I to enter the city of Nirvana forsaking this robberlike body
Having thus in nine similes pondered upon the advantages connected with retirement from the world the wise Sumedha gave away at his own house as aforesaid an immense hoard of treasure to the indigent and wayfarers and sufferers and kept open house And renouncing all pleasures both material and sensual departing from the city of Amara away from the world in Himavanta he made himself a hermitage near the mountain called Dhammaka and built a hut and a cloister free from the five defects which are hindrances  And with a view to obtain the power reckoned as supernormal knowledge which is characterized by the eight casual qualities described in the words beginning  With a mind thus tranquillized  he embraced in that hermitage the ascetic life of a Rishi casting off the cloak with its nine disadvantages and wearing the garment of bark with its twelve advantages
And when he had thus given up the world forsaking this hut crowded with eight drawbacks he repaired to the foot of a tree with its ten advantages and rejecting all sorts of grain lived constantly upon wild fruits And strenuously exerting himself both in sitting and in standing and in walking within a week he became the possessor of the eight attainments and of the five supernormal knowledges 
and so in accordance with his prayer he attained the might of supernormal knowledge
Now while the hermit Sumedha having thus attained the strength of supernormal knowledge was living in the bliss of the attainments the Teacher Dipankara appeared in the world
At the moment of his conception of his birth of his attainment of Buddhahood of his preaching his first discourse the whole universe of ten thousand worlds trembled shook and quaked and gave forth a mighty sound and the thirtytwo marks showed themselves
But the hermit Sumedha living in the bliss of the attainments neither heard that sound nor beheld those signs
At that time Dipankara Buddha accompanied by a hundred thousand saints wandering his way from place to place reached the city of Ramma and took up his residence in the great monastery of Sudassana
And the dwellers of the city of Ramma heard it said   Dipankara lord of ascetics having attained supreme Buddhaship and set rolling the wheel of the excellent Norm wandering his way from place to place has come to the town of Ramma and dwells at the great monastery of Sudassana  And taking with them ghee and butter and other medicinal requisites and clothes and raiment and bearing perfumes and garlands and other offerings in their hands their minds bent towards the Buddha the Doctrine and the Order inclining towards them hanging upon them they approached the Teacher and worshipped him and presenting the perfumes and other offerings sat down on one side And having heard his preaching of the Doctrine and invited him for the next day they rose from their seats and departed
And on the next day having prepared almsgiving for the poor and having decked out the town they repaired the road by which the Buddha was to come throwing earth in the places that were worn away by water and thereby levelling the surface and scattering sand that looked like strips of silver And they sprinkled fried paddy and flowers and raised aloft flags and banners of manycoloured cloths and set up banana arches and rows of brimming jars
Then the hermit Sumedha ascending from his hermitage and proceeding through the air till he was above those men and beholding the joyous multitude exclaimed   What can be the reason   and alighting stood on one side and questioned the people   Tell me why are you adorning this road 
And the men replied   Venerable Sumedha dost thou not know  Dipankara Buddha having attained supreme knowledge and set rolling the wheel of the glorious Doctrine travelling from place to place has reached our town and dwells at the great monastery Sudassana 
we have invited the Blessed One and are making ready for the blessed Buddha the road by which he is to come
And the hermit Sumedha thought   The very sound of the word Buddha is rarely met with in the world much more the actual appearance of a Buddha  it behoves me to join these men in clearing the road
He said therefore to the men   If you are clearing this road for the Buddha assign to me a piece of ground I will clear the ground in company with you
They consented saying  It is well   and perceiving the hermit Sumedha to be possessed of supernatural power they fixed upon a swampy piece of ground and assigned it to him saying   Do thou prepare this spot
Sumedha his heart filled with joy of which the Buddha was the cause thought within himself  I am able to prepare this piece of ground by supernatural power but if so prepared it will give me no satisfaction  this day it behoves me to perform menial duties   and fetching earth he threw it upon the spot
But ere the ground could be cleared by him with a train of a hundred thousand miracleworking saints endowed with the six supernormal knowledges while devas offered celestial wreaths and perfumes while celestial hymns rang forth and men paid their homage with earthly perfumes arid with flowers and other offerings Dlpankara endowed with the ten Forces with all a Buddha s transcendant majesty like a lion rousing himself to seek his prey on the Vermilion plain came down into the road all decked and made ready for him
Then the hermit Sumedha as the Buddha with unblenching eyes approached along the road prepared for him beholding that form endowed with the perfection of beauty adorned with the thirtytwo marks of a superman and marked with the eighty minor beauties attended by a halo of a fathom s depth and sending forth in streams the sixhued Buddharays linked in pairs of different colours and wreathed like the varied lightnings that flash in the gemstudded vault of heaven exclaimed   This day it behoves me to make sacrifice of my life for the Buddha  let not the Blessed one walk in the mire nay let him advance with his four hundred thousand saints trampling on my body as if walking upon a bridge of jewelled planks this deed will long be for my good and my happiness  So saying he loosed his hair and spreading in the sooty mire his hermit s skin mantle roll of matted hair and garment of bark he lay down in the mire like a bridge of jewelled planks
And as he lay in the mire again beholding the Buddhamajesty of Dipankara Buddha with his unblenching gaze he thought as follows   Were I willing I could enter the city of Ramma as a novice in the priesthood after having destroyed all human passions 
but why should I disguise myself to attain Nirvana after the destruction of human passion 
Let me rather like Dipankara having risen to the supreme knowledge of the Doctrine enable mankind to enter the Ship of the Doctrine and so carry them across the Ocean of Goingon and when this is done afterwards attain Nirvana  this indeed it is right that I should do
Then having enumerated the eight conditions and having made the resolution to become Buddha he laid himself down
And the blessed Dipankara having reached the spot stood close by the hermit Sumedhas head And opening his eyes possessed of the five kinds of grace as one opens a jewelled window and beholding the hermit Sumedha lying in the mire thought to himself   This hermit who lies here has formed the resolution to be a Buddha  will his wish be fulfilled or not  And casting forward his prescient gaze into the future and considering he perceived that four asankheyyas and a hundred thousand cycles from that time he would become a Buddha named Gotama And stand ing there in the midst of the assembly he delivered this prophecy  See ye this very austere ascetic lying in the mire 
 Yes lord they answered
 This man lies here having made the resolution to become a Buddha his wish will be answered  at the end of four asankheyyas and a hundred thousand cycles hence he will become a Buddha named Gotama
and in that birth the city Kapilavatthu will be his residence queen Maya will be his mother king Suddhodana his father his chief disciple will be the thera Upatissa his second disciple the thera Kolita the Buddha s servitor will be Ananda his chief female disciple the nun Khema the second the nun Uppalavanna When he attains to years of ripe knowledge having retired from the world and made the great exertion having received at the foot of a banyantree a meal of rice milk and partaken of it by the banks of the Neranjara having ascended the botree seat he will at the foot of a figtree attain Supreme Buddhahood
The hermit Sumedha exclaiming   My wish it seems will be accomplished  was filled with happi ness
The multitudes hearing the words of Dipankara Buddha were joyous and delighted exclaiming   The hermit Sumedha it seems is a Buddhaseed a Buddhashoot  
For thus they thought   As a man fording a river if he is unable to cross to the ford opposite him crosses to a ford lower down the stream even so we if under the dispensation of Dipankara Buddha we fail to attain the Paths and their fruition yet when thou shalt become Buddha we shall be enabled in thy presence to make the paths and their fruition our own  and so they recorded their wish 
And Dipankara Buddha also having praised the Bodhisatta and made an offering to him of eight handfuls of flowers reverentially saluted him and departed And the Arahants also four hundred thousand in numbers having made offerings to the Bodhisatta of perfume and garlands reverentially saluted him and departed
And the devas and men having made the same offerings and bowed down to him went their way
And the Bodhisatta when all had retired rising from his seat and exclaiming  I will study the Perfections  sat himself down crosslegged on a heap of flowers
And as the Bodhisatta sat thus the devas in all the ten thousand worlds assembling shouted applause  Venerable hermit Sumedha  they said  all the omens which have manifested themselves when former Bodhisattas seated themselves crosslegged saying   We will study the Perfections all these this day have appeared  assuredly thou shalt become Buddha This we know  to whom these omens appear he surely will become Buddha  do thou make a strenuous effort and exert thyself With these words they lauded the Bodhisatta with varied praises
And the Bodhisatta having heard the words of Dlpankara Buddha and of the devas in ten thousand worlds filled with abounding vigour thought thus within himself   The Buddhas are beings whose word cannot fail  there is no deviation from truth in their speech
For as the fall of a clod thrown into the air as the death of a mortal as the sunrise at dawn as a lion s roaring when he leaves his lair as the delivery of a woman with child as all these things are sure and certain even so the word of the Buddhas is sure and cannot fail verily I shall become a Buddha
And having thus made the resolution  I shall surely become Buddha  with a view to considering the conditions that constitute a Buddha exclaiming   Where are the conditions that make the Buddha are they found above or below in the principle or the minor directions  studying successively the principles of all things and beholding the first Perfection of Giving practised and followed by former Bodhisattas he thus admonished himself   Wise Sumedha from this time forth thou must fulfil the perfection of Giving 
for as a waterjar over turned discharges the water so that none remains and cannot recover it even so if thou indifferent to wealth and fame and wife and child and goods great and small give away to all who come and ask every thing that they require till nought remains thou shalt seat thyself at the foot of the tree of Bodhi and become a Buddha  With these words he strenuously resolved to attain the first perfection of Giving
But considering further   There must be beside this other conditions that make a Buddha  and beholding the second Perfection  Moral Practice he thought thus   wise Sumedha from this day forth mayest thou fulfil the perfection of Morality 
for as the yak ox regardless of his life guards his bushy tail even so thou shalt become Buddha if from this day forward regardless of thy life thou keepest the moral precepts  And he strenuously resolved to attain the second perfection Moral Practice
But considering further   These cannot be the only Buddhamaking conditions and beholding the third Perfection of Selfabnegation he thought thus   wise Sumedha mayest thou henceforth fulfil the perfection of Abnegation 
for as a man long the denizen of a prison feels no love for it but is dis contented and wishes to live there no more even so do thou likening all births to a prisonhouse dis contented with all births and anxious to get rid of them set thy face toward abnegation thus shalt thou become Buddha And he strenuously made the resolution to attain the third Perfection of Selfabnegation
But considering further   These cannot be the only Buddhamaking conditions  and beholding the fourth Perfection of Wisdom he thought thus   wise Sumedha do thou from this day forth fulfil the Perfection of Wisdom
avoiding no subject of knowledge great small or middling  do thou approach all wise men and ask them questions 
for as the mendicant friar on his begging rounds avoiding none of the families great and small that he frequents  and wandering for alms from place to place speedily gets food to support him even so shalt thou approach ing all wise men and asking them questions become a Buddha And he strenuously resolved to attain the fourth Perfection Wisdom
But considering further   These cannot be the only Buddhamaking conditions  and seeing the fifth Perfection of Exertion he thought thus  O wise Sumedha do thou from this day forth fulfil the Perfection of Exertion
As the lion the king of beasts in every action strenuously exerts himself so if thou in all rebirths and in all thy acts art strenuous in exertion and not a laggard thou shalt become a Buddha  And he made a firm resolve to attain the fifth Perfection Exertion
But considering further   These cannot be the only Buddhamaking conditions  and beholding the sixth Perfection of Patience he thought to him self   wise Sumedha do thou from this time forth fulfil the Perfection Patience 
be thou patient in praise and in reproach
And as when men throw things pure or foul upon the earth the earth does not feel either desire or repulsion towards them but suffers them endures them and consents to them even so thou also if thou art patient in praise and reproach shalt become a Buddha  And he strenuously resolved to attain the sixth perfection Patience
But further considering   These cannot be the only conditions that make a Buddha and beholding the seventh Perfection of Truth he thought thus within himself  O wise Sumedha from this time forth do thou fulfil the perfection of Truth 
though the thunderbolt descend upon thy head do thou never under the influence of desire or otherwise utter a conscious lie for the sake of wealth or anything else
And as the planet Venus at all seasons pursues her own course nor ever goes on another course forsaking her course even so if thou forsake not truth and utter no lie thou shalt become Buddha  And he strenuously turned his mind to the seventh Perfection Truth
But further considering   These cannot be the only conditions that make a Buddha and beholding the eighth Perfection of Resolution he thought thus within himself   wise Sumedha do thou from this time forth fulfil the perfection of Resolution 
what soever thou resolvest be thou unshaken in that resolution
For as a mountain the wind beating upon it in all directions trembles not moves not but stands in its place even so thou if unswerving in thy resolution shalt become Buddha  And he strenuously resolved to attain the eighth Perfection Resolution
But further considering   These cannot be the only conditions that make a Buddha and beholding the tenth Perfection  Equanimity he thought thus within himself  O wise Sumedha from this time do thou fulfil the perfection of Equanimity
be thou of equal mind in prosperity and adversity
And as the earth is indifferent when things pure or impure are cast upon it even so if thou art indifferent in prosperity and adversity thou shalt become Buddha And he strenuously resolved to attain the tenth Perfection Equanimity
But further considering   These cannot be the only conditions that make a Buddha and beholding the ninth Perfection of Goodwill he thought thus within himself   wise Sumedha do thou from this time forth fulfil the perfection of Goodwill
mayest thou be of one mind towards friends and foes
And as water fills with its refreshing coolness good men and bad alike  even so if thou art of one mind in friendly feeling towards all mortals thou shalt become Buddha And he strenuously resolved to attain the ninth perfection of Goodwill
Then he thought   These are the only conditions in this world that bringing Buddhaship to perfection and constituting a Buddha have to be fufilled by Bodhisattas  beside the ten Perfections there are no others And these ten Perfections are neither in the heaven above nor in the earth below nor are they to be found in the east or the other quarters but reside in my heart of flesh
Having thus realized that the Perfections were established in his heart having strenuously resolved to keep them all grasping them again and again he mastered them forwards and backwards  taking them at the end he went backward to the beginning taking them at the beginning he placed them at the end  taking them at the middle he carried them to the two ends taking them at both ends he carried them to the middle
Repeating   The Perfections are the sacrifice of limbs the Lesser Perfections are the sacrifice of property the Unlimited Perfections are the sacrifice of life he mastered them as the Perfections the Lesser Perfections and the Unlimited Perfections like one who converts two kindred oils into one or like one who using Mount Meru for his churningrod churns the great Chakkavala ocean
And as he grasped again and again the ten Perfections by the glow of his piety  this earth four nahutas and eight hundred thousand leagues in breadth like a bundle of reeds trodden by an elephant or a sugarmill in motion uttering a mighty roar trembled shook and quaked and spun round like a potters wheel or the wheel of an oilmill
And while the earth was trembling the people of Ramnia unable to endure it like great Saltrees over thrown by the wind that blows at the end of a cycle fell swooning here and there while waterpots and other vessels revolving like a jar on a potter s wheel struck against each other and were dashed and ground to pieces
The multitudes in fear and trembling approaching the Teacher said   Tell us Blessed one is this turmoil caused by Nagas or is it caused by either demons or ogres or by devas  for this we know not but truly this whole multitude is grievously afflicted Pray does this portend evil to the world or good  Tell us the cause of it
The Teacher hearing their words said   Fear not nor be troubled there is no danger to you from this
The wise Sumedha concerning whom I predicted this day  Hereafter he will be a Buddha named Gotama is now mastering the Perfections and while he masters them and turns them about by the power of his piety the whole ten thousand worlds with one accord quake and thunder
And the people hearing the Buddhas words joyful and delighted taking with them garlands perfumes and unguents left the city of Kamma and went to the Bodhisatta And having offered their flowers and other presents and bowed to him and respectfully saluted him they returned to the city of Ramma
And the Bodhisatta having made a strenuous exertion of resolve rose from the seat on which he sat
And as the Bodhisatta rose from his seat the devas in all the ten thousand worlds having assembled and offered him garlands and perfumes uttered these and other words of praise and blessing   Venerable hermit Sumedha this day thou hast made a mighty resolve at the feet of Dipankara Buddha mayest thou fulfil it without let or hindrance  fear not nor be dismayed may not the slightest sickness visit thy frame quickly exercise the Perfections and attain supreme Buddhaship
As the flowering and fruitbearing trees bring forth flowers and fruit in their season so do thou also not letting the right season pass by quickly reach the supreme enlightenment and thus having spoken they returned each one to his devahome
Then the Bodhisatta having received the homage of the devas made a strenuous exertion of resolve saying   Having fulfilled the ten Perfections at the end of four asankheyyas and a hundred thousand cycles I shall become a Buddha And rising into the air he returned to Himavanta
And the people of the city of Ramma having re turned to the city kept open house to the Order with the Buddha at their head
The Teacher having preached the Doctrine to them and established them in the three Kefuges and the other branches  departing from the city of Kamma living thereafter his allotted span of life having fulfilled all the duties of a Buddha in due course attained that Nirvana in which no condition of rebirth remains
Tanhankara and Medhankara and Saranankara
And the Perfect Buddha Dipankara and Kondanya best of men
And Mangala and Sumana and Revata and Sobhita the sage
Anomadassin Paduma Narada Padumuttara
And Sumedha and Sujata Piyadassin the famous one
Atthadassin Dhammadassin Siddhattha guide of the world
Tissa and Phussa the enlightened Vipassin Sikhin Vessabhu
Kakusandha Konagamana and Kassapa too the Guide
These were the perfect Buddhas the sinless ones the wellcontrolled
Appearing like suns dispelling the thick darkness 
They and their disciples too blazed up like flames of fire and went out
And the rewards which fell to him on his way as they fall to all the Bodisats who have resolved to become Buddhas are lauded thus 
So the men perfect in every part and destined to Buddhahood
Traverse the long road through thousands of millions of ages
They are not born in hell nor in the space between the worlds 
They do not become consumed by hunger thirst and want
And they do not become small animals even though born to sorrow
When born among men they are not blind by birth
They are not hard of hearing they are not classed among the dumb
They do not become women  among hermaphrodites and eunuchs
They are not found these men destined to Buddha hood
Free from the deadly sins everywhere pureliving
They follow not after vain opinions they perceive the working of karma
Though they dwell in bright worlds they are not born in the mindless
Nor are they destined to rebirth among the devas in the Pure Abodes
Bent upon renunciation good men detached from this rebirth or that
They walk as acting for the world s welfare fulfilling all perfection
It was when the Bodisat was thus dwelling in the City of Delight that the socalled  Buddha proclamation  took place
For three such  Proclamations  take place on earth These are the three
When they realize that at the end of a hundred thousand years a new dispensation will begin devas of the next world who are called Worldarrangers with their hair flying and dishevelled with weeping faces wiping away their tears with their hands clad in red garments and with their clothes all in disorder wander among men and make proclamation saying   Sirs one hundred thousand years from now there will be a new dispensation  this worldsystem will be destroyed  even the sea will dry up  this great earth with Sineru the monarch of mountains will be burned up and destroyed  and the whole world up to the Brahmarealms will pass away And so sirs exercise love pity sympathy and equanimity cherish the mother cherish the father honour the elders in your families
This is called the proclamation of an Age Kappahalahala
Again when they realize that at the end of a thousand years an omniscient Buddha will appear on earth the devaguardians of the world go from place to place and make proclamation saying   Sirs at the end of a thousand years from this time a Buddha will appear on earth
This is called the proclamation of a Buddha Buddhahalahala
Again when devas realize that at the end of a hundred years a universal monarch will appear they go from place to place and make proclamation saying   Sirs at the end of a hundred years from this time a universal monarch will appear on earth
This is called the proclamation of a Universal monarch Chakkavattihalahala
These are the three great proclamations
When of these three they hear the Buddhaproclamation the devas of the entire ten thousand world systems assemble together  and having ascertained who will become the Buddha they go to him and beseech him to do so
so beseeching him when the first signs appear that his present life is drawing to its close
Accordingly on this occasion they all with the governors in each world  assembled in one world and going to the future Buddha in the world of bliss  they besought him saying   Sir when thou wast fulfilling the Ten Perfections thou didst not do so from a desire for the state of worldgovernor Sakka or Mara or Brahma or of a mighty king upon earth  thou wast fulfilling them with the hope of reaching allknowledge for the sake of the salvation of mankind  Now has the moment come sir for thy Buddhahood  now sir has the time arrived  
But the Great Being as if he had not granted the prayer of the devas reflected in succession on the following five important points viz the time  the country the family  the mother  and her agelimit
Of these he first reflected on the TIME thinking   Is this the time or not 
And on this point he thought   When the time of the span of life has grown to be upwards of a hundred thousand years the time has not arrived
Why not 
Because in such a period men perceive not that living beings are subject to birth decay and death 
the thricemarked pearl of the preaching of the gospel of the Buddhas is not 
and when the Buddhas speak of the impermanence of all things of the universality of sorrow and of the delusion of individuality people will neither listen nor believe saying  What is this they talk of  At such a time there can be no understanding and without that the teaching will not lead to salvation
That therefore is not the time
Neither is it the right time when the span of life is under one hundred years
Why not 
Because then sin is rife among men  and admonition addressed to the sinners does not endure but like a streak drawn on the water vanishes quickly away
That therefore is not the time
When however the span of life is under a hundred thousand and over a hundred years that is the proper time
Now at that time the span of life was one hundred years
The Great Being therefore saw that the time of his advent had arrived
Then reflecting upon the COUNTRY and considering the four great continents with their surrounding islands  he thought   In three of the continents the Buddhas are not born but in Jambudvipa they are born and thus he decided on the country
Then reflecting upon THE DISTRICT and thinking   Jambudvipa indeed is large ten thousand leagues in extent  now in which district of it do the Buddhas appear   he fixed upon the Middle Country
And calling to mind that the town named Kapilavatthu was in that country he concluded that he ought to be born in it
Then reflecting on THE FAMILY he thought   The Buddhas are not born in the Vessa caste nor the Sudda caste  but either in the Brahmin or in the Khattiya caste whichever is then held in the highest repute
The Khattiya caste is now predominant I must be born in it
and Suddhodana the chief will be my father Thus he beheld the family
Then reflecting on THE MOTHER he thought   The mother of a Buddha is not lustful or corrupt as to drink but has fulfilled the Perfections for a hundred thousand ages and from her birth upwards has kept the five Precepts unbroken
Now this lady Maha Maya is such an one she will be my mother  And further considering how long her life should last he foresaw that it would still last ten months and seven days
Having thus reflected on these five important points he favoured the devas by consenting   The time has arrived sirs for me to become a Buddha He then dismissed them with the words and promise  Do you go   and attended by the devas of the world of Bliss  he entered the grove of Gladness in the City of Bliss
Now in each of the devaworlds there is such a grove of Gladness 
and there the devas are wont to remind any one of them who is about to depart of the opportunities he has gained by good deeds done in a former birth saying to him   When hence deceased go to a good destiny
And thus he also when walking about there surrounded by devas reminding him of his acquired merit departed thence and was conceived in the womb of the Lady Maha Maya
In order to explain this better the following is the account in fuller detail At that time it is said the Midsummer festival was proclaimed in the City of Kapilavatthu and the people were enjoying the feast
During the seven days before the full moon the Lady Maha Maya had taken part in the festivity as free from drunkenness as it was brilliant with garlands and perfumes On the seventh day she rose early and bathed in perfumed water  and she distributed four hundred thousand pieces in giving great largesse Decked in her richest attire she partook of the purest food  and steadfast in the rites of the feast she entered her beautiful chamber and lying on her royal couch she fell asleep and dreamt this dream The four Guardians of the world lifting her up in her couch carried her to the Himalaya mountains and placing her under the Great Saltree seven leagues high on the Crimson Plain sixty yojanas broad they stood respectfully aside
Their queens then came toward her and taking her to the Jake of Anotatta bathed her to free her from human stains  and dressed her in heavenly garments  and anointed her with perfumes  and decked her with heavenly flowers Not far from there is the Silver Hill within which is a golden mansion  in it they spread a heavenly couch with its head towards the East and on it they laid her down
Then the future Buddha who had become a superb white elephant and was wandering on the Golden Hill not far from there descended thence and ascending the Silver Hill approached her from the North Holding in his silvery trunk a white lotus flower and uttering a farreaching cry he entered the golden mansion and thrice doing obeisance to his mother s couch he gently struck her right side and seemed to enter her womb
Thus was he conceived at the end of the Midsummer festival
And the next day having awoke from her sleep she related her dream to the raja
The raja had sixtyfour eminent brahmins summoned and had costly seats spread on a spot made ready for the state occasion with green leaves and dalbergia flowers and he had vessels of gold and silver filled with delicate milkrice compounded with ghee and sweet honey and covered with gold and silver bowls This food he gave them and he satisfied them with gifts of new garments and of tawny cows
And when he had thus satisfied their every desire he had the dream told to them and then he asked them   What will come of it 
The brahmins said  Be not anxious sire  your queen has conceived  and the fruit of her womb will be a manchild  it will not be a womanchild You will have a son
And he if he adopts a householder s life will become a king a Universal Monarch  but if leaving his home he adopt the religious life he will become a Buddha who will remove from the world the veils of ignorance and sin
Now at the moment when the future Buddha made himself incarnate in his mother s womb the constituent elements of the ten thousand worldsystems at the same instant quaked and trembled and were shaken violently
The Thirtytwo Good Omens also were made manifest In the ten thousand world systems an immeasurable light appeared
The blind received their sight as if from very longing to behold this his glory The deaf heard the noise The dumb spake one with another The crooked became straight The lame walked All prisoners were freed from their bonds and chains In each hell the fire was extinguished In the realm of the Petas hunger and thirst were allayed The wild animals ceased to be afraid The illness of all who were sick was allayed All men began to speak kindly Horses neighed and elephants trumpeted gently All musical instruments gave forth each its note though none played upon them Bracelets and other ornaments jingled of them selves All the heavens became clear A cool soft breeze wafted pleasantly for all Bain fell out of due season Water welling up from the very earth overflowed  The birds forsook their flight on high The rivers stayed their waters flow The sea became sweet water Everywhere its surface was covered with lotuses of every colour All flowers blossomed on land and in water The trunks and branches and twigs of trees were covered with the bloom appropriate to each On earth treelotuses sprang up by sevens together breaking even through the rocks  and hanginglotuses were born in the sky and rained down everywhere a rain of blossom In the sky deva music was played The ten thousand worldsystems revolved and rushed as close together as a bunch of gathered flowers  and became as it were a woven wreath of worlds as sweetsmelling and resplendent as a mass of garlands or as a sacred altar decked with flowers
From the moment of the conception thus brought about of the future Buddha four devas with swords in their hands stood guard over the Bodisat and his mother to shield them from all harm
Pure in thought having reached the highest aim and the highest honour the mother was happy and unwearied
she saw the child within her as plainly as one could see a thread passed through a transparent gem
But as a womb in which a future Buddha has dwelt like a sacred relic shrine can never be occupied by another  the mother of the Bodisat seven days after his birth died and was reborn in the City of Bliss
Now other women give birth some before some after the completion of the tenth month some sitting and some lying down Not so the mother of a Bodisat
She gives birth to the Bodisat standing after she has cherished him in her womb for exactly ten months
this is a distinctive quality of the mother of a Buddha elect
And queen Maha Maya when she too had thus cherished the Bodisat in her womb like oil in a vessel for ten months felt herself far gone with child  and wishing to go to her family home she spake to King Suddhodana and said   Sire I wish to go to Devadaha to the city of my people
The king saying   It is good consented and had the road from Kapilavatthu to Devadaha made plain and decked with arches of plaintaintrees and well filled waterpots and flags and banners And seating the queen in a golden palanquin carried by a thousand attendants he sent her away with a great retinue
Now between the two towns there is a pleasure grove of saltrees belonging to the people of both cities and called the Lumbini grove At that time from the roots to the topmost branches it was one mass of fruits and flowers  and amidst the blossoms and branches swarms of variouscoloured bees and flocks of birds of different kinds roamed warbling sweetly
The whole of the Lumbini grove was like a wood of variegated creepers or the welldecorated banqueting hall of some mighty king
The queen beholding it was filled with the desire of besporting herself in the saltree grove 
and the attendants carrying the queen entered the wood
When she came to the monarch saltree of the glade she wanted to take hold of a branch of it and the branch bending down like a reed heated by steam approached within reach of her hand
Stretching out her hand she took hold of the branch
and then karmaborn winds shook her
The people drawing a curtain round her retired
Standing and holding the branch of the saltree she was delivered
That very moment the four pureminded Maha Brahmas came there bringing a golden net  and receiving the future Buddha on that net they placed him before his mother saying  Be joyful Lady  a mighty son is born to thee  
Now other living things when they leave their mother s womb leave it smeared with offensive and impure matter Not so a Bodisat
The future Buddha left his mother s womb like a preacher descending from a pulpit or a man from a ladder erect stretching out his hands and feet unsoiled by any impurities from contact with his mothers womb pure and fair and shining like a gem placed on fine muslin of Benares
But though this was so two showers of water came down from heaven in honour of them and refreshed the Bodisat and his mother and cleansed her body
From the hands of the Brahmas who had received him in the golden net the Four Kings received him on cloth of antelope skins soft to the touch such as are used on occasions of royal state From their hands men received him on a roll of fine cloth 
and on leaving their hands he stood up upon the ground and looked towards the East Thousands of world systems became visible to him like a single open space
Men and devas offering him sweetsmelling garlands said   great man there is no other like thee how then a greater 
Searching the ten directions  and finding no one like himself he took seven strides saying   This is the best direction  And as he walked the Great Brahma held over him the white umbrella and the Suyama followed him with the fan and other devas with the other symbols of royalty in their hands
Then stopping at the seventh step he sent forth his noble voice and shouted the shout of victory beginning with  I am the chief of the world
Now the future Buddha in three births thus uttered his voice immediately on leaving his mother s womb  in his birth as Mahosadha in his birth as Vessantara and in this birth
In the Mahosadha birth the devaking Sakka came to him as he was being born and placing some fine sandalwood in his hand went away He came forth from the womb holding this in his fist
His mother asked him   What is it you hold dear as you come 
He answered  Herbmedicine mother  
So because he came holding this they gave him the name of Herbmedicine child 
Taking the medicine they kept it in a chatty  and it became a drug by which all the sickness of the blind and deaf and others as many as came was healed
so the saying sprang up   This is a great osadha  this is a great osadha   and hence he was called Mahosadha 
Again in the Vessantara birth as he left his mother s womb he stretched out his right hand saying   But is there anything in the house mother  I would give a gift
Then his mother saying  You are born dear in a wealthy family took his hand in hers and placed on it a bag containing a thousand
Lastly in this birth he sang the song of victory  Thus the future Buddha in three births uttered his voice as he came out of his mothers womb
And as at the moment of his conception so at the moment of his birth the thirtytwo Good Omens were seen
Now at the very time when our Bodisat was born in the Lumbini grove the lady mother of Rahula Channa the attendant Kaludayi the minister Kanthaka the royal horse the great Botree and the four vases full of treasure also came into being
Of these last one was two miles one four one six and one eight miles in size
These seven are called the Sahajata the Connatal Ones
The people of both towns took the Bodisat and went to Kapilavatthu
On that day too companies of devas in the next the Tavatimsa world were astonished and joyful  and waved their robes and rejoiced saying  In Kapilavatthu to Suddhodana the king a son is born who seated under the Botree will become a Buddha
At that time an ascetic named Kaja Devala a confidential adviser of Suddhodana the king who had passed through the eight stages of religious attainment had eaten his midday meal and had gone to the Tavatimsa world for his midday rest Whilst there sitting resting he saw these devas and asked them   Why are you thus glad at heart and rejoicing  Tell me the reason of it
The devas replied   Sir to Suddhodana the king is born a son who seated under the Botree will become a Buddha and will found a Kingdom of Righteous ness  To us it will be given to see his infinite grace and to hear his wordTherefore it is that we are glad  
The ascetic hearing what they said quickly came down from the devaworld and entering the king s house sat down on the seat set apart for him and said   A son they say is born to you king  let me see him
The king ordered his son to be clad in splendour and carried in to salute the ascetic But the future Buddha turned his feet round and planted them on the matted hair of the ascetic
For in that birth there was no one worthy to be saluted by the Bodisat
and if these ignorant ones had placed the head of the future Buddha at the feet of the ascetic assuredly the ascetics head would have split in two
The ascetic rose from his seat and saying   It is not right for me to work my own destruction he did homage to the Bodisat
And the king also seeing this wonder did homage to his own son
Now the ascetic had the power of calling to mind the events of forty ages in the past and of forty ages in the future
Looking at the marks of future prosperity on the Bodisat s body he considered with himself   Will he become a Buddha or not   And perceiving that he would most certainly become a Buddha he smiled saying   This is a wonderman
Then reflecting   Will it be given to me to behold him when he has become a Buddha   he perceived that it would not  Dying before that time I shall be reborn in the formless world  so that while a hundred or perhaps a thousand Buddhas appear among men I shall not be able to go and be taught by them And it will not be my good fortune to behold this so wonderful man when he has become a Buddha Great alas is my loss   And he wept
The people seeing this asked saying   Our master just now smiled and has now begun to weep 
Will sir any misfortune befall our master s child 
There is no misfortune in him  assuredly he will become a Buddha was the reply
Why then do you weep 
 It will not be granted to me he said  to behold so great a man when he has become a Buddha Great alas is my loss  bewailing myself I weep
Then reflecting   Will it be granted or not to any one of my relatives to see him as a Buddha   he saw it would be granted to his nephew the boy Nalaka
So he went to his sister s house and said to her  Where is your son Nalaka 
 In the house brother
 Call him said he When he came he said to him  In the family of Suddhodana the king dear a son is born a young Buddha In thirtyfive years he will become a Buddha and it will be granted you to see him This very day give up the world  
Bearing in mind that his uncle was not a man to urge him without a cause the young man though bom in a family of incalculable wealth  straightway took out of the inner store a yellow suit of clothes and an earthenware pot and shaved his head and put on the robes And saying  I leave the world for the sake of him who is the greatest person on earth he prostrated himself on the ground and raised his joined hands in adoration towards the Bodisat Then putting the begging bowl in a bag and carrying it on his shoulder lie went to the Himalaya mountains and lived the life of a monk
When the Tathagata had attained to complete Enlightenment Nalaka went to him and heard the way of salvation  He then returned to the Himalayas and reached Arahantship And when he had lived seven months longer as a pilgrim along the most excellent Path he passed away when standing near a Golden Hill by that final passing away in which no source of rebirth remains
Now on the fifth day they bathed the Bodisat s head saying   Let us perform the rite of choosing a name for him  So they perfumed the king s house with four kinds of odours and decked it with Dalbergia flowers and made ready rice well cooked in milk Then they sent for one hundred and eight brahmins who had mastered the three Vedas and seated them in the king s house and gave them the pleasant food to eat and did them great honour and asked them to recognize the signs of what the child should be
Among them 
Rama and Dhaja and Lakkhana and Mantin Kondanya and Bhoja Suyama and Sudatta
These eight brahmins then were there Their senses all subdued  and they declared the charm
Now these eight brahmins were recognizers of signs 
it was by them that the dream on the night of conception had been interpreted
Seven of them holding up two fingers prophesied in the alternative saying   If a man having such marks should remain a householder he becomes a Universal Monarch  but if he takes the vows he becomes a Buddha  And so saying they declared all the glory and power of a Chakkavatti king
But the youngest of all of them a young brahmin whose family name was Kondanya beholding the perfection of the auspicious marks on the Bodisat raised up one finger only and prophesied without ambiguity and said   There is no sign of his remaining amidst the cares of household life Verily he will become a Buddha and remove the veils of sin and ignorance from the world
This man already under former Buddhas had made a deep resolve of holiness and had now reached his last birth Therefore it was that he surpassed the other seven in wisdom  that he perceived how the Bodisat would only be subject to this one life  and that raising only one finger he so prophesied saying   The lot of one possessed of these marks will not be cast amidst the cares of household life Verily he will become a Buddha  
Now those brahmins went home and addressed their sons saying   We are old dear ones  whether or not we shall live to see the son of Suddhodana the king after he has gained allknowledge do you when he has gained allknowledge take the vows according to his religion
And after they all seven had lived out their span of life they passed away and were reborn according to their deeds But the young brahmin Kondanya was in good health 
and for the sake of the wisdom of the Great Being he left all that he had and made the great renunciation And coming in due course to Uruvela he thought   Behold how pleasant is this place  how suitable for the exertions of a young man desirous of wrestling with sin  So he took up his residence there And when he heard that the Great Being had left the world he went to the sons of those brahmins and said to them   Siddhattha the prince has taken the vows Assuredly he will become a Buddha
If your fathers were in health they would today leave their homes and go forth 
and now if you should so desire come I will leave the world in imitation of him
But all of them were not able to agree with one accord  three did not give up the world 
the other four made Kondanya the brahmin their leader and left the world
It was those five who came to be called  the Company of the Five Elders 
Then the king asked   After seeing what will my son forsake the world 
 The four Omens  was the reply
 Which four 
 A man worn out by age a sick man a dead body and a monk
The king thought   From this time let no such things come near my son There is no good in my son s becoming a Buddha I should like to see my son exercising rule and sovereignty over the four great continents and the two thousand islands that surround them  and walking as it were in the vault of heaven surrounded by an innumerable retinue 
Then so saying he placed guards two miles apart in the four directions to prevent men of those four kinds coming to the sight of his son
That day also of eighty thousand clansmen assembled in the festival hall each one dedicated a son saying   Whether this child becomes a Buddha or a king we give each a son 
so that if he shall become a Buddha he shall live attended and honoured by Khattiya monks
and if he shall become a king he shall live attended and honoured by nobles 
And the raja appointed nurses of great beauty and free from every fault for the Bodisat
So the Bodisat grew up in great splendour and surrounded by an innumerable retinue
Now one day the king held the socalled Ploughing Festival
On that day they ornament the town like a palace of the gods
All the slaves and servants in new garments and crowned with sweetsmelling garlands assemble in the king s house
For the king s work a thousand ploughs are yoked
On this occasion one hundred and eight minus one were with the oxenreins and crossbars ornamented with silver But the plough for the king to use was ornamented with red gold 
and so also the horns and reins and goads of the oxen
The king leaving his house with a great retinue took his son and went to the spot
There there was a jambutree thick with leaves and giving a dense shade
Under it the raja had the child s couch laid out  and over the couch a canopy spread inlaid with stars of gold and round it a curtain hung Then leaving a guard there the raja clad in splendour and attended by his ministers went away to plough
At such a time the king takes hold of a golden plough the attendant ministers one hundred and eight minus one silver ploughs and the peasants the rest of the ploughs
Holding them they plough this way and that way
The raja goes from one side to the other and comes from the other back again
On this occasion the king had great success 
and the nurses seated round the Bodisat thinking   Let us go to see the king s glory  came out from within the curtain and went away
The future Buddha looking all round and seeing no one got up quickly seated himself crosslegged and holding his breath sank into the first Jhana
The nurses engaged in preparing various kinds of food delayed a little
The shadows of the other trees turned round but that of the jambutree remained steady and circular in form
The nurses remembering their young master was alone hurriedly raised the curtain and returned inside it Seeing the Bodisat sitting crosslegged and that miracle of the shadow they went and told the raja saying   Sire  the prince is seated in such and such a manner  and while the shadows of the other trees have turned that of the jambutree is fixed in a circle  
And the raja went hurriedly and saw that miracle and did homage to his son saying   This dear is the second homage paid to thee  
But the Bodisat in due course grew to manhood
And the king had three mansions made suitable for the three seasons one nine stories high one seven stories high and one five stories high  and he provided him with forty thousand dancing girls
So the Bodisat surrounded by welldressed dancing girls like a deva surrounded by troops of nymphs and attended by musical instruments which played of themselves lived as the seasons changed in each of these mansions in enjoyment of great prosperity
And the mother of Rahula was his principal queen
Whilst he was thus in the enjoyment of great prosperity the following talk sprang up in the public assembly of his clansmen   Siddhattha lives devoted to pleasure  not one thing does he learn  if war should break out what would he do 
The king sent for the future Buddha and said to him   Your relations dear one say that you learn nothing and are given up to pleasure  now what do you think you should do about this 
 Sire there is no art it is necessary for me to learn Have the drumbeater about the city that I may show my skill Seven days from now I will show my kindred what I can do
The king did so
The Bodisat assembled those so skilled in archery that they could split even a hair and shoot as quick as lightning  and then in the midst of the people he showed his relatives his twelvefold skill and how unsurpassed he was by other masters of the bow
So the assembly of his clansmen doubted no longer
Now one day the future Buddha wanting to go to his pleasure ground told his charioteer to harness his chariot
The latter accordingly decked the gloriously beautiful chariot with all its trappings and harnessed to it four state horses of the Sindhi breed and white as the leaves of the white lotus flower And he informed the Bodisat
So the Bodisat ascended the chariot resplendent like a mansion in the skies and went towards the garden
The devas thought   The time for young Siddhattha to attain Enlightenment is near let us show him the Omens  And they did so by making a son of the devas represent a man wasted by age with decayed teeth and grey hair bent and broken down in body and with a stick in his hand
But he was only visible to the future Buddha and his charioteer
Then the Bodisat asked his charioteer as is told in the Mahapadana    What kind of man is this whose very hair is not as that of other men   When he heard his servant s answer he said   Shame then be upon life  since the old age of what is born is evident   and with agitated heart he turned back at that very spot and reentered his palace
The king asked   Why does my son turn back so hurriedly 
 He has seen an old man they said
 and having seen an old man he will forsake the world  By this you ruin me exclaimed the raja   quickly get ready plays to be performed before my son So long as he continues in the enjoyment of pleasure he will not turn his thoughts to forsaking the world   Then increasing the guards he placed them at each point of the compass at intervals of half a league
Again one day when the future Buddha as he was going to his pleasure ground saw a sick man represented by the devas he made the same inquiry as before  and then with agitated heart turned back and reentered his palace
The king also made the same inquiry and gave the same orders as before  and again increasing the guard placed them all round as far as three gavutas
Once more when the future Buddha as he was going to his pleasure ground saw a dead man repre sented by the gods he made the same inquiry as before  and then with agitated heart turned back and reentered his palace
The king also made the same inquiry and gave the same orders as before  and again increasing the guard placed them all round as far as a league
Once again when the future Buddha as he was going to his pleasure ground saw one who had abandoned the world carefully and decently clad he asked his charioteer   Friend what kind of man is that 
As at that time there was no Buddha at all in the world the charioteer understood neither what a recluse was nor what were his distinguishing characteristics  but nevertheless inspired by the devas he said  That is a recluse   and described the advantages of renouncing the world
And that day the future Buddha cherishing the thought of re nouncing the world went on to his pleasure ground
The repeaters of the Digha Nikaya  however say that he saw all the four Omens on the same day and then went to his pleasure ground
There he enjoyed himself during the day and bathed in the beautiful lake  and at sunset seated himself on the royal resting stone to be robed
Now his attendants brought robes of different colours and various kinds of ornaments and garlands and perfumes and ointments and stood around him
At that moment the throne on which Sakka was seated became warm
And thinking to himself   Who is it now who wants me to descend from hence   he perceived that the time for the adornment of the future Buddha had come And he said to Vissakamma   Friend Vissakamma the young noble Siddhattha today at midnight will carry out the Great Renunciation This is the last time he will be clad in splendour Go to the pleasure ground and adorn him with heavenly array
By the miraculous power which devas have he accordingly that very moment drew near in the likeness of the royal barber  and taking from the barber s hand the material for the turban he arranged it round the Bodisat s head
At the touch of his hand the Bodisat knew   This is no man it is a son of the devas
When the first round of the turban was put on there arose by the appearance of the jewel on the diadem a thousand folds 
when the turban was wrapt the second time round a thousand folds arose again  when ten times ten thousand folds appeared
How so many folds could seem to rise on so small a head is beyond imagination 
for in size the largest of them were as the flower of the Black Piyangu creeper and the rest even as Kutumbaka blossoms
And the head of the future Buddha became like a Kuyyaka flower in full bloom
And when he was arrayed in all his splendour the musicians the while exhibiting each one his peculiar skill the brahmins honouring him with words of joy and victory and the men of lower station with festive cries and shouts of praise  he ascended his superbly decorated car
At that time Suddhodana the king who had heard that the mother of Rahula had brought forth a son sent a message saying   Make known my joy to my son  
The future Buddha hearing this said   An impediment has come into being a bond has come into being
When the king asked   What did my son say   and heard that saying he gave command   From henceforth let Rahula be my grandson s name
But the Bodisat riding in his splendid chariot entered the town with great magnificence and exceeding glory
At that time a noble maiden Kisa Gotami by name had gone to the flat roof of the upper story of her palace and she beheld the beauty and majesty of the Bodisat as he was proceeding through the cityPleased and delighted at the sight she burst forth into this song of joy 
Blessed indeed is that mother Blessed indeed is that father
Blessed indeed is that wife Of whom such an one is master 
Hearing this the Bodisat thought to himself   On catching sight of such an one the heart of his mother is made happy the heart of his father is made happy the heart of his wife is made happy  So she says
But in peace as to what can the heart be at peace 
And to him whose mind was estranged from sin the answer came   When the fire of lust is gone out then peace is gained  when the fires of hatred and delusion are gone out then peace is gained  when the troubles of mind arising from vain conceits opinions and all other corruptions have ceased then peace is gained 
Sweet is the lesson this singer makes me hear for the going out which is Peace is that which I have been trying to find out This very day I will break away from household cares  I will renounce the world  I will follow only after the Nirvana itself  Then loosing from his neck a string of pearls worth a hundred thousand he sent it to Kisa Gotami as a teachers fee
Delighted at this she thought   Prince Siddhattha has fallen in love with me and has sent me a present
But the Bodisat on entering his palace in great splendour reclined on a couch of state
Thereupon women clad in beautiful array skilful in the dance and song and lovely as devamaidens brought their musical instruments and ranging them selves in order danced and sang and played delight fully
But the Bodisat his heart being estranged from sin took no pleasure in the spectacle and fell asleep
And the women saying   He for whose sake we were performing is gone to sleep  Why should we weary ourselves   laid aside the instruments they held and lay down to sleep Lamps fed with sweetsmelling oil were burning
The Bodisat waking up sat crosslegged on the couch and saw those women with their music truck laid aside and sleeping some drivelling at the mouth spittlebesprinkled some grinding their teeth some snoring some muttering in their sleep some gaping and some with their dress in disorder plainly revealed as mere horrible occasions of worldly ways
Seeing this change in their appearance he became more and more unfain of sensedesires
To him that magnificent apartment as splendid as Sakka s residence began to seem like a great area laden with divers offal like a enamelfield full of corpses Life whether in the worlds subject to passion or in the other worlds of form or in the formless worlds seemed to him like staying in a house that had become the prey of devouring flames  An utterance of intense feeling broke from him  It all oppresses me  It is intolerable   and his mind turned ardently to the state of those who have renounced the world
Resolving that very day to accomplish the Great Renunciation he rose from his couch went to the door and called out   Who is there  
Channa who had been sleeping with his head on the threshold answered   It is I sir Channa
Then said he  I want today to accomplish the Great Renunciation saddle me a horse
So Channa saying  Very good sire and taking harness went to the stableyard and entering the stables saw by the light of the lamps Kanthaka prince of steeds standing at a pleasant spot under a canopy of cloth beautified with a pattern of jasmine flowers  This is the very one I ought to saddle today thought he  and he saddled Kanthaka
Even whilst he was being saddled the horse knew  He is saddling me so tightly and not as on other days for such rides as those to the pleasure grounds because my master is about today to carry out the Great Kenunciation
Then glad at heart he neighed a mighty neigh 
and the sound thereof would have penetrated over all the town had not the devas stopped the sound and let no one hear it
Now after the Bodisat had sent Channa on this errand he thought  I will just look at my son  And rising from his crosslegged sitting he went to the apartments of Rahula s mother and opened her chamber door
At that moment a lamp fed with sweetsmelling oil was burning dimly in the inner chamber The mother of Rahula was asleep on a bed strewn with many jasmine flowers  and resting her hand on the head of her son
Stopping with his foot on the threshold the Bodisat thought  If I lift her hand to take my son she will awake  and that will prevent my going away I will come back and see him when I have become a Buddha  And he left the palace
Now what is said in the Jataka commentary  At that time Rahula was seven days old is not found in the other commentaries Therefore the view given above should be accepted
And when the Bodisat had left the palace he went to his horse and said   Dear Kanthaka do thou bear me over this once tonight  so that I having become a Buddha by thy help shall bear over the world of men and devas
Then leaping up he seated himself on Kanthaka s back
Kanthaka was eighteen cubits in length from the nape of his neck and of proportionate height  he was strong and fleet and white all over like a clean chank shell
If he should neigh or paw the ground the sound would penetrate through all the town
Therefore the devas so muffled the sound of his neighing that none could hear it  and placed at each step the palms of their hands under his feet
The Bodisat rode on the excellent back of the excellent steed  told Channa to catch hold of its tail and arrived at midnight at the great gate of the city
Now the king thinking  In that way the Bodisat will not be able at any time to open the city gate and get away  had placed a thousand men at each of the two gates to stop him
The Bodisat was mighty and strong according to the measure of elephants as ten thousand million elephants and according to the measure of men as a million million men
He thought   If the door does not open sitting on Kanthaka s back with Channa holding his tail I will press Kan thaka with my thighs and jumping over the city rampart eighteen cubits high I will get away  
Channa thought  If the door is not opened I will take my master on my neck and putting my right hand round Kanthaka s girth I will hold him close to my waist and so leap over the rampart and get away  
Kanthaka thought  If the door is not opened I will spring up with my master seated as he is on my back and Channa holding by my tail and will leap over the rampart and get away  
And if the door had not been opened verily one or other of those three would have accomplished that whereof he had thought
But the deva residing at the gate opened it
At that moment Mara came there with the intention of stopping the Bodisat  and standing in the air he exclaimed  Go not forth sir  in seven days from now the treasurewheel will appear and will make you sovereign over the four continents and the two thousand adjacent islesStop my lord  
 Who are you   said he
 I am Vasavatti was the reply
 Mara  Well do I know that the treasurewheel would appear to me  but it is not sovereignty that I desire I shall become a Buddha and make the ten thousand worldsystems shout for joy
Then thought the Tempter to himself   Now from this time forth whenever a thought of lust or anger or malice shall arise within you I will get to know of it  And he followed him ever watching for some slip as closely as a shadow which never leaves its object
But the future Buddha making light of the kingdom of the world thus within his reach casting it away as one would spittle left the city with great honour on the fullmoon day of Asalhi when the moon was in the Uttarasalha lunar mansion 
And when he had left the city a desire sprang up within him to look back upon it 
and the instant he did so the broad earth revolved like a potter s wheel and was stayed  saying as it were to him  O great man there is no need for you to stop in order to fulfil your wish
So the Bodisat with his face towards the city gazed at it  and he fixed at that place a spot for The Shrine of Kanthaka s Staying And keeping Kanthaka in the direction in which he was going he went on with great honour and exceeding glory
For then they say devas in front of him carried sixty thousand torches and behind him too and on his right hand and on his left And while some devas undefined on the edge of the horizon held torches aloft  other devas and the Nagas and Winged Creatures and other superhuman beings bore him company doing homage with heavenly perfumes and garlands and sandalwood powder and incense
And the whole sky was full of Paricchattaka flowers as with the pouring rain when thick clouds gather Divine songs floated around  and on every side thousands of musical instruments sounded as when the thunder roars in the womb of the sea or the ocean heaves against the boundaries of the world 
Advancing in this pomp and glory the Bodisat in that one night passed beyond three kingdoms and arrived at the end of thirty leagues at the bank of the river called Anoma
But why could not the horse go still further 
It was not through want of power 
for he could go from one edge of the world s disc to the other as easily as one could step across the cir cumference of a wheel lying on its side  and doing this in the forenoon he could return and eat the food prepared for him
But on this occasion he was constantly delayed by having to drag himself along and break his way through the mass of garlands and flowers cast down from heaven in such profusion by the devas and the Nagas and the Winged Creatures that his very flanks were hid Hence it was that he only got over thirty leagues
Now the Bodisat stopping at the river side asked Channa   What is this river called 
 Its name sire is Anoma
 And so also our leaving the world shall be called Anoma  said he  and signalling to his horse by pressing it with his heel
the horse sprang over the river five or six hundred yards in breadth and stood on the opposite bank
The Bodisat getting down from the horses back stood on the sandy beach extending there like a sheet of silver and said to Channa   Good Channa do thou now go back taking my ornaments and Kanthaka I am going to leave the world
 But I also sire will leave the world
Thou canst not be allowed to leave the world do thou go back he said Three times he refused this request of Channa s  and he delivered over to him both the ornaments and Kanthaka Then he thought   These locks of mine are not suited for a recluse
Now it is not right for any one else to cut the hair of a future Buddha so I will cut them off myself with this sword  Then taking his sword in his right hand and holding the plaited tresses together with the diadem on them with his left he cut them off So his hair was thus reduced to two inches in length and curling from the right it lay close to his head
It remained that length as long as he lived and the beard the same There was no need at all to shave either hair or beard any more
The Bodisat saying to himself  HI am to become a Buddha let it stand in the air  if not let it fall to the ground  threw the hair and diadem together as he held them towards the sky
The plaited hair and the jewelled turban went a league off and stopped in the air
Sakka the devaking caught sight of it with his devaeye and receiving it into a jewel casket a league high he placed it in Tavatimsa in the Dagaba of the Diadem
Cutting off his hair with pleasant perfumes sweet The supreme person cast it to the sky
The thousandeyed one Sakka by his head Received it humbly in a golden casket
Again the Bodisat thought   This my raiment of Benares muslin is not suitable for a recluse
Now the great Brahma Ghatikara who had formerly been his friend in the time of Kassapa Buddha was led by his friendship which had not grown old in that long interval to think   Today my friend is accomplishing the Great Renunciation I will go and provide him with the requisites of a recluse
The three robes and the alms bowl Razor needle and girdle
And a water strainer these eight Are the wealth of the monk devout
Taking these eight requisites of a recluse he gave them to him
The Bodisat dressed himself in the banner of an Arahant  and adopted the sacred garb of Renunciation  and he enjoined upon Channa to go and in his name assure his parents of his safety
And Channa did homage to the Bodisat reverently and departed
Now Kanthaka stood listening to the Bodisat as he talked with Channa And thinking From this time forth I shall never see my master more   he was unable to bear his grief And going out of their sight he died of a broken heart and was reborn in Tavatimsa as a deva with the name of Kanthaka
So far the sorrow of Channa had been but single  now torn with the second sorrow of Kanthakas death he returned weeping and bewailing to the city
But the Bodisat having renounced the world spent seven days in a mango grove called Anupiya hard by that spot in the joy of renunciation Then he went on foot in one day to Rajagaha a distance of thirty leagues 
and entering the city begged his food from door to door
The whole city at the sight of his beauty was thrown into commotion as was Rajagaha by the entrance of Dhanapalaka or like the devacity by the entrance of the governor of the Asuras
The guards went to the king and said describing him   Sire such and such a being is coming for alms through the town We cannot tell whether he is a deva or a man or a Naga or a Supanna or what he is
 The king watching the great man from his palace became full of wonder and gave orders to his guards saying Go I say and watch If it is a super human being he will disappear as soon as he leaves the city  if a deva he will depart through the air  if a snake he will dive into the earth  if a man he will eat the food just as it is
But the great man collected mixed food And when he perceived there was enough to support him he left the city by the gate at which he had entered And seating himself facing towards the East under the shadow of the Pandava rock he began to eat his meal
His stomach however turned and made as if it would come out of his mouth
Then though distressed by that revolting food for in that birth he had never even beheld such food with his eyes saying   Siddhattha it is true thou wast born in a family where food and drink were easily obtainable into a state of life where thy food was perfumed thirdseason s rice with various curries of the finest kinds But ever since thou didst see one clad in a mendicant s garb thou hast been thinking  When shall I become like him and live by begging my food  would that that time were come  And now that thou hast left all for that very purpose what is this that thou art doing 
he himself admonished himself And overcoming his feelings he ate the food
The king s men saw this and went and told him that had happened
Hearing what his messengers said the king quickly left the city and approaching the Bodisat was so pleased at the mere sight of his dignity and grace that he offered him all his kingdom
The Bodisat said  In me king  there is no desire after wealth or sinful pleasures It is in the hope of attaining to complete enlightenment that I have left all
And when the king gained not his consent though he asked it in many ways he said   Assuredly thou wilt become a Buddha  Deign at least after thy Buddhahood to come to my kingdom first
This is here concisely stated  but the full account beginning  I sing the Renunciation how the Wise One renounced the world  will be found on referring to the Pabbajja Sutta x and its commentary
And the Bodisat granting the king s request went forward on his way And joining himself to Alara Kalama and to Uddaka son of Rama he acquired their systems of ecstatic trance But when he saw that that was not the way to enlightenment he left off applying himself to the realization of that system of Attainment And with the intention of carrying out the Great Struggle against sin and showing his might and resolution to devas and men he went to Uruvela And saying   Pleasant indeed is this spot   he took up his residence there and devoted himself to the Great Struggle
And those five recluses Kondanya and the rest  begging their way through villages market towns and royal cities met with the Bodisat there
And for six years they stayed by him and served him while he was carrying out the Great Struggle with different kinds of service such as sweeping out the hermitage and so on  thinking the while   Now he will become a Buddha  now he will become a Buddha  
Now the Bodisat thought  I will perform the uttermost penance And he brought himself to live on one seed of the oilplant or one grain of rice and even to fast entirely  but devas gathered the sap of life and infused it into him through the pores of his skin
By this fasting however he became as thin as a skeleton  the colour of his body once fair as gold became dark 
and the thirtytwo signs of a great man disappeared
And one day when walking up and down plunged in intense meditation he was overcome by severe pain  and he fainted and fell
Then certain of the devas began to say   He is dead  But others said   Such is the way of saints
And those who thought he was dead went and told Suddhodana the king saying   Your son is dead
 Did he die after becoming a Buddha or before 
 He was unable to attain to Buddhahood and fell down and died in the midst of the Great Struggle
When the king heard this he refused to credit it saying   I do not believe it My son could never die without attaining to Enlightenment  
If you ask   Why did not the king believe it 
it was because he had seen the miracles at the foot of the jambutree and on the day when Kala Devala had been compelled to do homage to the Bodisat
And the Bodisat recovered consciousness again and stood up And those devas went and told the king Your son king is well
And the king said   I knew my son was not dead
And the great being s six years penance became noised abroad as when the sound of a great bell is heard in the sky
But he perceived that penance was not the way to enlightenment  and begging through the villages and towns he collected ordinary material food and lived upon it And the thirtytwo signs of a great man appeared again upon him and his body became fair in colour like unto gold
Then the five attendant monks thought   This man has not been able even by six years penance to attain allknowledge  how can he do so now when he goes begging through the villages and takes material food  He is altogether lost in the struggle To think of getting spiritual eminence through him is like a man who wants to bathe his head thinking of using a dewdrop What could we get from him   And leaving the great man they took each his robes and begging bowl and went eighteen leagues away and entered Isipatana
Now at that time at Uruvela in the village Senani there was a girl named Sujata born in the house of Senani the landowner who when she had grown up made a vow at a Nigrodhatree saying   If I am married into a family of equal rank and have a son for my firstborn child then I will spend every year a hundred thousand on an offering to thee
And this her vow took effect
And in order to make her offering on the fullmoon day of the month of May in the sixth year of the Great Being s penance she had driven in front of her a thousand cows into a meadow of rich grass With their milk she had fed five hundred cows with theirs two hundred and fifty and so on down to eight Thus aspiring after quantity and sweetness and strength she did what is called   Working the milk in and in
And early on the fullmoon day in the month of May thinking   Now I will make the offering  she rose up in the morning early and milked those eight cows
Of their own accord the calves kept away from the cows udders and as soon as the new vessels were placed ready streams of milk poured into them
Seeing this miracle Sujata with her own hands took the milk and poured it into new pans  and with her own hands made the fire and began to cook it
When that ricemilk was boiling huge bubbles rising turned to the right and ran round together  not a drop fell or was lost  not the least smoke rose from the fireplace
At that time the four guardians of the world came and kept watch by the fireplace A great Brahma held over it a canopy of state Sakka put the sticks together and lighted the fire
By their divine power the devas gathering so much of the sap of maintenance as would suffice for the support of all men and devas of the four continents and their circumjacent two thousand isles as easily as a man crushing the honey comb formed round a stick would take the honey they infused it into the milkrice
At other times devas infused the sap into each mouthful of rice as he took it  but on the day of his Buddhahood and on the day of his passing away they infused it into the very vesselfull of rice itself
Sujata seeing that so many wonders appeared to her on this one day said to her slavegirl Punna   Punna my girl  Very gracious is our deva today  Never before have I seen such a wonder Go at once and keep watch by the holy place
 Very good madam replied she  and ran and hastened to the foot of the tree
Now the Bodisat had seen that night five dreams and on considering their purport he had drawn the conclusion   Verily this day I shall become a Buddha  And at the end of the night he washed and dressed himself and waiting till the time should come to go round for his food he went early and sat at the foot of that tree lighting it all up with his glory
And Punna coming there saw the Bodisat sitting at the foot of the tree and lighting up all the region of the East  and she saw the whole tree in colour like gold from the rays issuing from his body
And she thought   Today our deva descending from the tree is seated to receive our offering in his own hand  And excited with joy she returned quickly and announced this to Sujata
Sujata delighted at the news gave her all the ornaments befitting a daughter saying   Today from this time forth be thou to me in the place of an elder daughter  
And since on the day of attaining Buddhahood it is proper to receive a golden vessel worth a hundred thousand she conceived the idea   We will put the milkrice into a vessel of gold And sending for a vessel of gold worth a hundred thousand she poured out the wellcooked food to put it therein
All the ricemilk flowed into the vessel like water from a lotus leaf and filled the vessel full
Taking it she covered it with a golden platter and wrapped it in a cloth And adorning herself in all her splendour she put the vessel on her head and went with great dignity to the Nigrodhatree Seeing the Bodisat she was filled with exceeding joy taking him for the treedeva  and advanced bowing from the spot whence she saw him Taking the vessel from her head she uncovered it  and fetching sweetscented water in a golden vase she approached the Bodisat and stood by
The earthenware pot given him by the deva Ghatikara which had never till then left him disappeared at that moment Not seeing his pot the Bodisat stretched out his right hand and took the water
Sujata placed the vessel with the milkrice in it in the hand of the great man The great man looked at her
Pointing to the food she said   O sir  accept what I have offered thee and depart whithersoever seemeth to thee good  And adding   May there arise to thee as much joy as has come to me   she went away valuing her golden vessel worth a hundred thousand at no more than a dried leaf
But the Bodisat rising from his seat and leaving the tree on the right hand took the vessel and went to the bank of the Neranjara river down into which on the day of their complete Enlightenment so many thou sand Bodisats had gone The name of that bathing place is the Supatitthita ferry Putting the vessel on the bank he descended into the river and bathed And having dressed himself again in the banner of the Arahants worn by so many thousand Buddhas he sat down with his face to the East  and dividing the rice into fortynine balls of the size of so many singleseeded palmyra fruits he ate all that sweetmilk rice without any water
Now that was the only food he had for fortynine days during the seven times seven days he spent after he became a Buddha at the foot of the Tree of Enlightenment
During all that time he had no other food  he did not bathe  nor wash his teeth  nor feel the cravings of nature He lived on Jhanajoy on Pathjoy on Fruitionjoy
But when he had finished eating that milkrice he took the golden vessel and said   If I shall be able today to become a Buddha let this pot go up the stream  if not let it go down the stream   and he threw it into the water
And it went in spite of the stream eighty cubits up the river in the middle of the stream all the way as quickly as a fleet horse And diving into a whirlpool it went to the palace of Kala Nagaraja  and striking against the bowls from which the three previous Buddhas had eaten it made them sound  killikilli   and stopped as the lowest of them
Kala the snakeking hearing the noise exclaimed  Yesterday a Buddha arose now today another has arisen   and he stood praising him in many hundred stanzas
But the Bodisat spent the heat of the day in a grove of saltrees in full bloom on the bank or the river And in the evening when the flowers droop from their stems he proceeded like a lion when it is roused towards the Tree of Enlightenment along a path five or six hundred yards wide decked by devas
The Snakes and Genii and Winged Creatures  and other superhuman beings offered him sweetsmelling flowers from heaven and sang heavenly songs The ten thousand worldsystems became filled with perfumes and garlands and shouts of approval
At that time there came from the opposite direction a grasscutter named Sotthiya carrying grass  and recognizing the great man he gave him eight bundles of grass
The Bodisat took the grass  and ascending the rising ground round the Botree he stood at the South of it looking towards the North
At that moment the Southern horizon seemed to descend below the level of the lowest hell and the Northern horizon mounting up seemed to reach above the highest heaven
The Bodisat saying   This cannot methinks be the right place for attaining Buddhahood  turned round it keeping it on the right hand  and went to the Western side and stood facing the East Then the Western horizon seemed to descend beneath the lowest hell and the Eastern horizon to ascend above the highest heaven 
and to him where he was standing the earth seemed to bend up and down like a great cart wheel lying on its axis when its circumference is trodden on
The Bodisat saying   This cannot I think be the right place for attaining Buddhahood  turned round it keeping it on the right hand  and went to the Northern side and stood facing the South Then the Northern horizon seemed to descend beneath the lowest hell and the Southern horizon to ascend above the highest heaven
The Bodisat saying   This cannot I think be the right place for attaining Buddhahood  turned round it keeping it on the right hand  and went to the Western side and stood facing towards the East
Now in the East is the place where all the Buddhas have sat crosslegged  and that place neither trembles nor shakes
The great being perceiving   This is the steadfast spot chosen by all the Buddhas the spot for the throwing down of the cage of sin  took hold of the grass by one end and scattered it there And immediately there was a seat fourteen cubits long
For those blades of grass arranged themselves in such a form as would be beyond the power of even the ablest painter or carver to design
The Bodisat turning his back upon the trunk of the Botree and with his face towards the East made the firm resolve 
 May skin indeed and sinews and bones wilt away
may flesh and blood in my body dry up
but till I attain to complete enlightenmentthis seat I will not leave   And he sat himself down in a crosslegged position firm and immovable as if welded with a hundred thunderbolts
At that time the deva Mara thinking   Prince Siddhattha wants to free himself from my dominion I will not let him get free yet   went to the hosts of his Maras and told the news And sounding the drum called MaraCry he led forth the hosts of Mara
That army of Mara stretches twelve leagues before him twelve leagues to right and left of him behind him it reaches to the rocky limits of the world above him it is nine leagues in height  and the sound of its warcry is heard twelve leagues away even as the sound of an earthquake
Then Mara deva mounted his elephant two hundred and fifty leagues high named  Girded with mountains  And he created for himself a thousand arms and seized all kinds of weapons
And of the remainder too of the company of Mara no two took the same weapon  but assuming various colours and various forms they went on to overwhelm the great being
But the devas of the ten thousand worldsystems continued speaking the praises of the great being
Sakka the devaking stood there blowing his trumpet Vijayuttara
Now that trumpet is a hundred and twenty cubits long
and can itself cause the wind to enter and thus itself give forth a sound which will resound for four months when it becomes still
The Great Black One the king of the Nagas stood there uttering his praises in many hundred stanzas The Maha Brahma stood there holding over him the white canopy of state
But as the army approached and surrounded the seat under the Botree not one of the hosts of Mara was able to stay and they fled each one from the spot where the army met them
The Black One king of the Nagas dived into the earth and went to Manjerika the palace of the Nagas five hundred leagues in length and lay down covering his face with his hands
Sakka taking the Vijayut tara trumpet on his back stopped on the rocky verge of the world
Maha Brahma putting the white canopy of state on to the summit of the rocks at the end of the earth went to the world of Brahma
Not a single deity was able to keep his place The great man sat there alone
But Mara said to his company   Sirs  there is no other man like Siddhattha the son of Suddhodana We cannot give him battle face to face Let us attack him from behind  
The great man looked round on three sides and saw that all the devas had fled and their place was empty
Then beholding the hosts of Mara coming thick upon him from the North he thought   Against me alone this mighty host is putting forth all its energy and strength No father is here nor mother nor brother nor any other relative to help me But those ten perfections have long been to me as retainers fed from my store So making the perfections like a shield I must strike this host with the sword of perfection and thus over whelm it   And so he sat meditating on the Ten Perfections
Then Mara deva saying   Thus will I drive away Siddhattha  caused a whirlwind to blow
And immediately such winds rushed together from the four corners of the earth as could have torn down the peaks of mountains half a league two leagues three leagues high could have rooted up the shrubs and trees of the forest and could have made of the towns and villages around one heap of ruins But through the glow of the merit of the great man they reached him with their power gone and even the hem of his robe they were unable to shake
Then saying  I will overwhelm him with water and so slay him  he caused a mighty rain to fall
And the clouds gathered overspreading one another by hundreds and by thousands and poured forth rain 
and by the violence of the torrents the earth was saturated 
and a great flood overtopping the trees of the forest approached the Bodhisat But it was not able to wet on his robe even the space where a dewdrop might fall
Then he caused a storm of rocks to fall
And mighty mighty mountain peaks came through the air spitting forth fire and smoke But as they reached the Bodhisat they changed into divine garlands
Then he raised a storm of deadly weapons
And they came oneedged and twoedged swords and spears and arrows smoking and flaming through the sky But as they reached the Bodhisat they became divine flowers
Then he raised a storm of charcoal
But the embers though they came through the sky like red kimsuka flowers were scattered at the feet of the future Buddha as divine flowers
Then he raised a storm of embers 
and the embers came through the air exceeding hot and in colour like fire  but they fell at the feet of the future Buddha as sandalwood powder
Then he raised a storm of sand 
and the sand exceeding fine came smoking and flaming through the air  but it fell at the feet of the future Buddha as divine flowers
Then he raised a storm of mud
And the mud came smoking and flaming through the air  but it fell at the feet of the future Buddha as divine unguent
Then saying   By this I will terrify Siddhattha and drive him away   he brought on a thick darkness
And the darkness became fourfold  but when it reached the future Buddha it disappeared as dark ness does before the brightness of the sun
Thus was Mara unable by these nine the wind and the rain and the rocks and the weapons and the char coal and the embers and the sand and the mud and the darkness to drive away the future Buddha So he called on his host and said   Say why stand you still  Seize or slay or drive away this prince   And himself mounted the Mountaingirded and seated on his back he approached the future Buddha and cried out   Get up Siddhattha from that seat  It does not belong to thee  It belongs to me  
The great being listened to his words and said   Mara  it is not by you that the ten Perfections have been perfected neither the lesser Perfections nor the higher Perfections It is not you who have sacrificed yourself in the five great acts of renunciation who have perfected the way of good in knowledge nor the way of good for the world nor the way of understanding This seat does not belong to thee it is to me that it belongs
Then the enraged Mara unable to endure the vehemence of his anger cast at the great man that Sceptrejavelin of his the barb of which was in shape as a wheel
But it became a wreath of flowers and remained as a canopy over him whose mind was bent upon the Ten Perfections
Now at other times when that Wicked One throws his Sceptrejavelin it cleaves asunder a pillar of solid rock as if it were the tender shoot of a bambu When however it thus turned into a wreathcanopy the entire company of Mara shouted  Now he will rise from his seat and flee   and they hurled at him huge masses of rock
But these too fell on the ground as garlands at the feet of him whose mind was bent upon the Ten Perfections
And the devas stood on the edge of the rocks that encircle the world  and stretching forward in amaze ment they looked on saying   Lost  lost is the life of Siddhattha the Prince supremely beautiful  What can he do 
Then the great man said   To me belongs the seat on which sit the Buddhastobe when they have fulfilled perfection on the day of their Enlightment  And he said to Mara standing there before him   Mara who is witness that thou hast given alms 
And Mara stretched forth his hand to the hosts of his followers and said   So many are my witnesses
And that moment there arose a shout as the sound of an earthquake from the company of Mara saying  I am his witness  I am his witness  
Then the Tempter addressed the great man and said   Siddhattha  who is witness that thou hast given alms 
And the great man answered   Thou hast living witnesses that thou hast given alms  and I have in this place no living witness at all But not counting the alms I have given in other births let this great and solid earth unconscious though it be be witness of the seven hundredfold great alms I gave when I was born as Vessantara   And withdrawing his right hand from beneath his robe he stretched it forth towards the earth and said   Art thou or art thou not witness of the seven hundredfold great gift I gave in my birth as Vessantara 
And the great Earth uttered a voice saying  I am witness to thee of that   overwhelming as it were the hosts of Mara as with the shout of hundreds of thousands of foes
Then the mighty elephant Mountgirded as he realized what the generosity of Vessantara had been said   The great gift the uttermost gift was given by thee Siddhattha   And he fell down on his knees before the great man And the company of Mara fled this way and that way so that not even two were left together  throwing of their clothes and their turbans they fled each one straight on before him
But the company of devas when they saw that the hosts of Mara had fled cried out   Mara is overcome  Siddhattha the Prince has prevailed  Come let us honour the victor   And the Nagas and the Winged Creatures and the Devas and the Brahmas each urging his comrades on went up to the great man at the Botree s foot
and as they came
 The Blessed Buddha he hath prevailed  And the Evil Mara is overthrown  
 at the Botree s foot the Naga bands Shouted for joy that the Sage had won
 The Blessed Buddha he hath prevailed  And the Evil Mara is overthrown  
 at the Botree s foot the Winged Ones Shouted for joy that the Sage had won
 The Blessed Buddha he hath prevailed  And the Evil Mara is overthrown  
 at the Botree s foot the Deva hosts Shouted for joy that the Sage had won
 The Blessed Buddha he hath prevailed  And the evil Mara is overthrown
 at the Botree s foot the Brahma Gods Shouted for joy that the Sage had won
The other devas too in the ten thousand worldsystems offered garlands and perfumes and uttered his praises aloud
It was while the sun was still above the horizon that the great man thus put to flight the hosts of Mara Then whilst the Botree paid him homage as it were by its shoots like sprigs of red coral falling over his robe he acquired in the first watch of the night the knowledge of the past in the middle watch the clairvoyant eye and in the third watch the knowledge of the chain of causation
Now on his thus revolving this way and that way and tracing backwards and forwards and thoroughly realizing the twelvefold chain of causation the ten thousand worldsystems quaked twelve times even to their ocean boundaries
And again when the great man making the ten thousand world systems to shout for joy attained at break of day to complete enlightenment the whole ten thousand worldsystems became glorious as on a festive day
The streamers of the flags and banners raised on the edge of the rocky boundary of the East of the world reached to the very West  and so those on the West and North and South reached to the East and South and North  while in like manner those of flags and banners on the surface of the earth reached to the Brahmaworld and those of flags and banners in that world swept down upon the earth Throughout the universe flowering trees put forth their blossoms and fruitbearing trees were loaded with clusters of fruit 
the trunks and branches of trees and even the creepers were covered with bloom  lotus wreaths hung from the sky  and lilies by sevens sprang one above another even from the very rocks
The ten thousand worldsystems as they revolved seemed like a mass of loosened wreaths or like a nosegay tastefully arranged 
and the worldvoids between them the hells whose darkness the rays of seven suns had never been able to disperse became filled with light The sea became sweet water down to its profoundest depths  and the rivers were stayed in their course The blind from birth received their sight  the deaf from birth heard sound  the lame from birth could use their feet  and chains and bonds were loosed and fell away
It was thus in surpassing glory and honour and with many wonders happening around that he attained allknowledge and gave vent to his emotion in the hymn of triumph uttered by all the Buddhas
Long have I wandered long Bound by the chain of life Through many births
Seeking thus long in vain The builder of the house And pain Is birth again again
Housemaker thou art seen  No more a house thou lt make
Broken are all thy beams Thy ridgepole shattered 
From things that make for life my mind has past  The end of cravings has been reached at last  Dhp 
 Now whilst he was still seated there after he had sung the hymn of triumph the Blessed One thought  It is in order to attain to this seat that I have undergone successive births for so long a time that I severed my crowned head from my neck and gave it away that I tore out my darkened eyes and my heart s flesh and gave them away that I gave away to serve others such sons as Jali the Prince and such daughters as Kanha Jina the Princess and such wives as Maddi the Queen This seat is a seat of triumph to me and a seat of glory 
while seated on it my aims have been fulfilled  I will not leave it yet  And he sat there absorbed in many thoughts  for those seven days
referred to in the text beginning   And then the Blessed One sat motionless for seven days realizing the bliss of Nirvana
Now certain of the devas began to doubt thinking   This day also there must be something more Siddhattha has to do for he still lingers seated there
The Master knowing their thoughts and to appease their doubts rose into the air and performed the twinmiracle
And the Master having thus by this miracle dispelled the devas doubts stood a little to the north east of the seat thinking  It was on that seat that I attained allknowing insight  And he thus spent seven days gazing steadfastly at the spot where he had gained the result of the deeds of virtue fulfilled through such countless years And that spot became known as the Dagaba of the Steadfast Gaze
Then he created between the seat and the spot where he had stood a cloistered walk and he spent seven days walking up and down in that treasurecloister which stretched from east to west And that spot became known as the Dagaba of the TreasureCloister
But for the fourth week the devas created to the northwest of the Botree a Treasurehouse  and he spent the week seated there crosslegged and thinking out the Abhidhamma Pitaka and here especially the entire Patthana with its infinite methods
But the Abhidhammikas  say that Treasurehouse here means either a mansion built of the seven kinds of jewels or the place where the seven books were thought out 
and as they give these two explanations of the passage both may be accepted as correct
Having thus spent four weeks close to the Botree he went in the fifth week to the Shepherds Nigrodhatree  and sat there meditating on Doctrine and experiencing the happiness of deliverance
Now at that time the deva Mara thought to himself  So long a time have I followed this man seeking some access to him and find no fault in him  and now indeed he is beyond my power  And overcome with sorrow he sat down on the highway and as he thought of the following sixteen things he drew sixteen lines on the ground Thinking  I did not attain as he did to the perfection of Giving  therefore I have not become like him  he drew one line
Then thinking   I did not attain as he did to the Perfections of Moral Practice and Selfabnegation and Wisdom and Exertion and Patience and Truth and Resolution and Kindness and Equanimity  therefore I have not become like him he drew nine more lines
Then thinking  I did not attain the Ten Perfections the conditions precedent to the penetration the extraordinary knowledge of the complete way of the senses and therefore I have not become like him  he drew the eleventh line
Then thinking  I did not attain to the Ten Perfections the conditions precedent to the penetration the extraordinary knowledge of inclinations and latent tendencies of the attainment of compassion of the double miracle of the removal of hindrances and of allknowing  therefore I have not become like him  he drew the five other lines
And so he sat on the highway drawing sixteen lines for these sixteen thoughts
At that time Craving Discontent and Lust  the three daughters of Mara could not find their father and were looking for him wondering where he could be And when they saw him sad at heart writing on the ground they went up to him and asked   Why dear are you sad and sorrowful 
And he answered   My women this great recluse is escaping from my power Long have I watched but in vain to find some fault in him Therefore it is that I am sad and sorrowful
 If that is so replied they  think not thus We will subject him to our influence and come back bringing him captive with us
 My women said he  you cannot by any means bring him under your influence  this man stands firm in faith unwavering
 Dear one we are women  was the reply   even now we shall bring him bound by the sweetness of lust Do not think so So they approached the Blessed One and said   recluse upon thee we humbly wait  
But the Blessed One neither paid any attention to their words nor raised his eyes to look at them He sat with a mind made free by the complete extinction of rebirthconditions enjoying the bliss of detachment
Then the daughters of Mara considered with themselves   Various are men s tastes Some fall in love with girls some with young women some with mature women some with older women We will tempt him in various forms So each of them assumed the appearance of a hundred women girls women who had never had a child or only once or only twice middleaged women older women and six times they went up to the Blessed One and professed themselves his humble handmaidens 
and to that also the Blessed One paid no attention so was he made free by the complete extinction of rebirthconditions
Now some teachers say that when the Blessed One saw them approaching in the form of elderly women he commanded saying   Let these women remain just as they are with broken teeth and bald heads This should not be believed
for the Master issues not such commands
But the Blessed One said   Depart ye  What have ye seen that ye thus strive  Such things might be done in the presence of men who linger in the paths of sin  but by the Tathagata lust is put away illwill is put away delusion is put away
Whose conquest is not overthrown His conquest nought on earth assails
That Buddha infinite in range Pathless by what path will ye lead 
In whom there is no snare besetting Venomous craving anywhither leading
That Buddha infinite in range Pathless by what path will ye lead 
And he admonished them in those two verses from the Chapter on the Buddha in the Scripture Verses
And they saying   Our father spoke the truth indeed The saint the WellFarer of the world is not easily led away  and so on returned to their father
But the Blessed One when he had spent a week at that spot went on to the Muchalindatree
There he spent a week Muchalinda the snakeking when a storm arose shielding him with seven folds of his hood so that the Blessed One enjoyed the bliss of deliverance as if he had been resting unharassed in a fragrant chamber Thence he went away to the Kingsteadtree and there also sat down enjoying the bliss of deliverance
And so seven weeks passed away
during which he experienced no bodily wants but fed on Jhanajoy Pathjoy and Fruitionjoy
Now as lie sat there on the last day of the seven weeks the fortyninth day he felt a desire to bathe his face
And Sakka the devagovernor brought a fruit of the myrobolantree and gave him to eat
And Sakka too provided a toothcleanser of the thorns of the snakecreeper and water to bathe his face
And the Master used the toothcleanser and bathed his face and sat him down there at the foot of the Kingsteadtree
At that time two merchants Tapassu and Bhalluka by name were travelling from Orissa to Central India  with five hundred carts And a deva a blood relation of theirs stopped their carts and moved their hearts to offer food to the Master And they took a rice cake and a honey cake and went up to the Master and said  O sir Blessed One  out of compassion for us accept this food
Now on the day when he had received the sweet ricemilk his bowl had disappeared   so the Blessed One thought   The Buddhas never receive food in their hands How shall I accept it 
Then the four Guardians knew his thought and coming from the four quarters of the sky they brought bowls made of sapphire And the Blessed One accepted them
Then they brought four other bowls made of jade 
and the Blessed one out of kindness to the four devas received the four and placing them one above another commanded saying   Let them become one  And the four closed up into one of medium size becoming visible only as lines round the mouth of it
The Blessed One received the food into that newcreated bowl and ate it and gave thanks
The two brothers took refuge in the Buddha the Doctrine and the Order  and became professed disciples
Then when they asked him saying   Lord bestow upon us something to which we may pay reverence with his own right hand he tore from his head and gave to them the hairrelics
And they built a Dagaba in their own city and placed the relics within it
But the Perfectly Enlightened One rose up thence and returned to the Shepherds Nigrodhatree and sat down at its foot
And no sooner was he seated there considering the depth of the Doctrine which he had gained than there arose in his mind a doubt that he had not that kind of ability necessary to explain that Doctrine to others
Then the great Kuler of the Brahma heavens exclaiming   Alas  the world is lost Alas  the world is altogether lost   brought with him the rulers of the worlds in the tenthousand worldsystems  and went up to the Master and said  O Blessed Lord do thou proclaim the Doctrine  Proclaim the Doctrine Blessed Lord   and in other words of like purport begged from him the preaching of the Doctrine
Then the Master granted his request And considering to whom he should first reveal the Doctrine thought at first of Alara his former teacher as one who would quickly comprehend it But on surveying  he perceived that Alara had been dead seven days So he fixed on Uddaka
But he learnt that he too had died that very evening Then he thought of the five mendicants   they were very helpful   And casting about in his mind   where are they now dwelling   he perceived they were at the Deerpark in Benares And he determined saying  There going I will set rolling the wheel of Doctrine  But he delayed a few days begging his daily food in the neighbourhood of the Botree with the intention  I will go to Benares on the fullmoon day of Asalhi  And at dawn on the fourteenth day of the month when the night had passed away he took his robe and his bowl  and had gone eighteen leagues just half way when he met the Ajivika friar Upaka And he announced to him how he had become a Buddha  and on the evening of that day he arrived at the hermitage near Benares
The five elders  seeing already from afar the Buddha coming said one to another   Brethren here comes the recluse Gotama He has turned back to a free use of the necessaries of life and has recovered roundness of form acuteness of sense and beauty of complexion We ought to pay him no reverence  but as he is after all of a good family he deserves the honour of a seat So we will simply prepare a seat for him
The Blessed One casting about in his mind by the power that he had of knowing what was going on in the thoughts of all beings as to what they were thinking knew their thoughts
Then concentrating that feeling of his goodwill which was able to pervade generally all beings in earth and heaven he directed it specially towards them
And the sense of his good will diffused itself through their hearts   and as he came nearer and nearer unable any longer to adhere to their resolve they rose from their seats and bowed down before him and welcomed him with every mark of reverence and respect But not knowing that he had become a Buddha they addressed him in everything they said either by name or as  Brother 
Then the Blessed One announced to them his Buddhahood saying   Mendicants address not a Buddha by his name or as avuso I mendicants am a perfectly awakened one one of those who have thus come  Then seated on the place prepared for him and surrounded by myriads of devas he addressed the five attendant elders just as the moon was passing out of conjunction with the lunar mansion in Uttarasalha and taught them in that discourse which was The Foundation of the Kingdom of Righteousness
Of the five Elders Kondanya the Believer  sending forth insight as the discourse went on as it concluded he with myriads of devas had arrived at the Fruit of the First Path
And the Master who remained there for the rainy season sat in the vihdra the next day when the other four had gone abegging talking to Vappa 
and Vappa that morning attained to the Fruit of the First Path
And in a similar manner Bhaddiya on the next day and MahaNama on the next and Assaji on the next attained to the Fruit of the First Path And on the fifth day he called all five to his side and preached to them the discourse On the Mark ofnotsoul
At the end of that discourse the five elders attained to the Arahantfruition
Then the Master perceived that Yasa a young man of good family was capable of entering the Paths And when day was breaking he having left his home and gone away the Master called him saying Come Yasa  and on that very night he attained to the Fruit of the First Path and on the next day to Arahantship
Evaṃ me sutaṃ thus is Parābhava Sutta
What is its origin
It is said that after having listened to Maṅgalasutta this idea occurred to devas  In the Maṅgala Sutta by teaching the increase as well as welfare of living beings definitely bhava only had been taught but not parābhava 
come now let us ask that parābhava of theirs owing to which living beings all round diminish and become ruined 
Then on the next day after the day when Maṅgalasutta had been taught the devatā in the ten thousand universes being desirous of listening to Parābhava sutta assimbled together in this universe and stood surrounding the Blessed One who was seated on the excellent seat prepared for him and who was shining bright after having attained by means of the power as well as glory  of all devas Māra and brahmā after having created ten also twenty also thiety also forty also fifty also sixty also seventy also eighty also of his subtle body in the mere space of the tip end of a tail 
Thereafter under orders of Sakka the sovereign of celestial beings a certain devaputta asked the Blessed One the question on the problem of parābhava 
Then the Blessed One spoke this by way of a question
 There the context beginning with Evaṃ me sutaṃ has been spoken by the venerable nanda
An intervening stanza was spoken by devaputta in the manner beginning withParābhavantaṃ purisaṃ  The very intervening single stanza in the manner of suvijāno bhavaṃ hotietc as well as the concluding stanza were spoken by the Blessed One After having combined all this also it is spoken of as Parābhava Sutta
There whatever should be said in the context starting with Evaṃ me sutaṃ all that we will speak of in the commentary on Maṅgala Sutta
Parābhavantaṃ purisaṃ in the contexts beginning with this expression however parābhavantaṃ means all round diminishing and ruining 
Purisaṃ means any and every living being and creature 
Mayaṃ pucchāme Gotama that devaputta addressed the Blessed One by his clan having had the opportunity made after having had himself along with the remaining devas indicated
Bhavantaṃ puṭṭhumāgamha indeed we have come from this and that universe saying to ourselvesWe shall ask the Lord thus is the meaning
By this he showed his respect 
Kiṃ parābhavato mukhaṃ please tell us who have come in this way as to what is the cause  what is the door  what is the origin and what is the circumstance of a ruined man by which we would know a man in ruin thus is the meaning
By means of this the young divinity enquired of the circumstantial cause of ruin of a man who is in ruin  of whom it has been spoken here thus Parābhavantaṃpurisaṃ 
Indeed when the circumstantial cause of ruin has been understood by means of that kāraṇsāmañña  it is possible to know any one who is a ruined man
Then the Blessed One said thus Suvijāno bhavaṃ in order to shed light on the cause of ruin by means of his desanā with individual decision  after having shown the reverse  for the purpose of making manifest excellently 
Its meaning is A man who swelling this bhavaṃ existence and notallround diminishing it is he who is suvijāno hotī a well knowing one with ease  with no difficulty and with no trouble  it is possible for him to understand clearly
This one who also gets ruined is a parābhava  he allround diminishes and gets ruined  You ask me the cause of a man who gets ruined  that man who is so also is easy to be known clearly
How
Indeed this one dhammakāmo bhavaṃ hoti is righteously desirous of existence he desires he loves  he wishes for  he listens to and he enters upon it  After having seen and heard of as well that proper performance he becomes well comprehended owing to the fact that it should be understood
The other also is dhammadessī parābhavo he will give that very truth  but he does not desire  he does not love  he does not wish for  he does not listen to  he does not enter upon to properly perform it  after having seen and heard of that vippaṭipatti  he becomes an excellently clear comprehender from the point of view of what should be understood
In this way here the Blessed One after having shown the cause from the point of view of existence and the state of dhammakāma from the point of view of meaning in order to show the oposite pointed out the cause of ruin shown by the truth thus it should be understood
Then that devatā said thus Iti hetaṃ being delighted with what had been spoken by the Blessed One
Its meaning is Indeed according as has been told thus by the Blessed One even in the manner we clearly comprehend collect and bear in our menory this  Paṭhamo so parābhavo that lakkhaṇa the teaching of the truth constitutes the first ruin 
Out of those causes of ruin  to clearly comprehend which we have some this first and foremost is one cause of ruin  thus it is what has been spoken of
There the viggaha is they are ruined owing to this thus parābhavo 
By what again are they ruined
Whatever is the cause and circumstance of ruin  on account of that
Indeed even to the extent of byañjana here is different variety of making  from the point of view of meaning however either parābhava or parābhava mukha there does not exist any different variety of performance 
in this way we clearly comprehend the cause of ruin  thus after having been delighted and because of their desire to know further beyond that they said thus Dutiyaṃ bhagavā brūhi kiṃ parābhavato mukhaṃ
Further beyond this as well in the third and fourth tatiyaṃ catutthaṃ etc the meaning should be understood even in this way
In the expositionial flank also since these and those living beings are endowed with these and those causes of ruin it is not even one with all neither as well all with a single one even therefore in order to show these and those causes of ruin of these and those Buddha explained different varieties of cause of ruin by means of the desanā even by individual decision in the manner beginning with Asantassa piyāhonti thus it should be understood
 There this is the commentary briefly on the meaningAsanto namely are six teachers in other words others however also who are endowed with unappeased bodily verbal and mental actions  those wicked people are dear to him similar to acelakakorakhattiya etc of sunakkhatta etc
Santo namely Buddhas silent Buddhas and disciples of Buddha
in other words others who however also are endowed with calm bodily verbal and mental actions  those sante na kurute piyaṃ does dear to themselves thus is the meaning
Indeed here by way of veneyya classification of wording has been made thus it should be understood
In other words sante na kurute means does not serve good people  thus  is the meaning according as Rājānaṃ sevati  Indeed in this meaning rājānaṃ piyaṃ kurute  thus saddavidū are of opinion 
Piyaṃ means being fond of  being satisfied and being glad  thus is the meaning
Asataṃ dhammo is namely sixty two diṭṭhigatāni  in other words dasa akusalakammapatha 
Roceti he takes delight in  is fond of wishes for and serves that dhamma of bad people 
In this way by means of this stanza such three types of the cause of ruin as the state of being fond of bad people the state of not being fond of good people as well as delight in the doctrine which is not good have been told
Indeed a man who is endowed with this ruins and allround dwindles himself Neither even here nor hereafter does he attain prosperity  therefore it is said to be Parābhavato mukhaṃ 
At length here however we shall speak of in the commentary on the stanza Asevanā ca bālānaṃ  paṇḍtānañ ca sevanā  
Niddāsilī  manely is he who sleeps even while going sitting standing or lying down
Sabhāsilī  means the condition of delight in society and he who is ever engaged in the state of pleasure in conversation 
Anuṭṭhātā  there is no habit of being energetic  being devoid of the power of exertion on being urged by others he being either a householder or a monk begins doing either household work or the duties of a monk
Alaso means one who is born lazy having excessively overpowered by sloth is one who kept himself stationed even at the spot where he had stood is one who remanined even seated at the site where he had sat down by means of his own effort he does not do any other iriyāpatha 
Long ago when fire broke out in a forest is the indication here as well of the lazy one who did not flee
This is here the highest allround limit  thereafter also by inferior measure  however a lazy one should be understood even as indolent
Similar to the banner of a chariot resembling the smoke of fire anger would have its token  thus Kodhapaññā
One of angry behaviour speedily becomes angry  having a heart like a sore the individual is in comformity with this 
By means of this stanza the state of sleeping habit  the state of habitual convesational society  the state of not being energetic the state of laziness the state of token of anger thus five forms of the cause of ruin have been spoken of
Indeed neither even a householder endowed with this attains the prosperity of a householder nor a monk attains the prosperity of a monk Sure and certain he allround diminishes even and comes to ruin even therefore it is spoken of as the cause of ruin
Mātā should be understood as one who gives birth to a baby 
Pitā means the man who produces a child even
Jiṇṇakaṃ owing to the condition of the body being soft 
Gatayobbanaṃ owing to having gone beyod youthfulness  either at the age of eighty or ninety having no capacity to perform acts personally 
Pahusanto though being capable living the life of happiness 
Na bharati means dose not have himself nourished 
By means of this stanza not supporting  not nourishing  not attending upon the mother and father have been spoken of as even a cause of ruin 
Indeed to him who is endowed with this thus
Owing to attending upon mother and father wise men
praise him even here and later he rejoices in the excellent existence 
Thus the benefit in suporting the parents has been told
that heaven he does not attain to as a matter of fact he suffers such a blame being remarked thus he does not support even his parents whom else will he do the state of being avoided and attains to evil existence also and even reaches ruination therefore it is spoken as the cause of ruin
Owing to the condition of having ousted evils he is brahmaṇaṃ a brahmin Owing to the condition of having been quieted  he is samaṇaṃ a monk
in other words having origin from a brahmin family he is a brahmin one who has approached monkhood is a monk thereafter aññaṃ vā pi means or whichever any other beggar 
Musāvādena vañceti after having invited thusVenerable sir You should bid for recluses requisite in other words after having acknowledged on having been begged of him he breaks his word of promise that desire of his by not bestowing 
By means of this stanza deceiving brahmins etc with speaking falsehood a cause of ruin even has been told
Indeed one who is endowed with this suffers blame here and reached hereafter the evil existence which is as well the reverse in significance to sugati also
Indeed this has been said thus
Dussīlassa sīlavipannassa pāpako kittisaddo abbhuggacchati specially spreads up
likewise
O monks One who is endowed with four deeds  according as what has been brought as a load has been thrown down in this way is thrown down into hell
with which four
He is a teller of lies  etc
According as
O Sāriputta Here some one after having approached either a monk or a brahmin makes his inviting offer thus Venerable sir Please bid for recluses requisite he dose not give what he has invited for accepting offering
If after having passed away from there and were to come into being here
he takes to trade of whatever type even it will lead him to loss 
O Sāripytta Here however  he does not give what that signifies after having made his inviting offer
if after having passed away from there he were to come into being here
whatever trade he takes to that will not become according as what he signifies 
In this way suffering from these blames etc he comes to ruin even Therefore it has been stated as The cause of ruin  
Pahūtavitto means one who has abundant gold silver and gemjewellery
Sahirañño one who has his own gold coins
Sabhojano endowed with such a meal as comprising many a sort of soup and kinds of curry
Eko bhuñjati sādūni without giving good dishes of meal to his sons even he eats his meal at a spot covered and concealed thus eko bhuñjati sādūni 
By means of this stanza owing to the condition of being greedy of meal the jealousy over mealeating has been spoken of as one cause of ruin even
Indeed he who is endowed with this arriving at the situation of blame sinfulness and evil destiny  comes to ruin even thereforeIt is the cause of ruin thus it has been stated
Even in the said manner all should be interpretted in conformity to the sutta We speak of mere meaning even now without showing the manner of interpretation however for fear of being excessively at length
Jātitthaddho namely is he who provokes pride saying to himself I am endowed with jāti  and owing to that he becomes hardened and swelled up similar to a bag filled with air  he does not bow down to any one
This is the manner among those who are obdurate over their wealth and clan 
Saññātim atimaññeti he despises even his own relative owing to jāti similar to sākiyans towards Viṭaṭūbha
Owing to wealth also he slightens saying This one is a destitute and a pauper  even mere courtesy he does not show  Those kinsmen of his wish his becoming ruined even
By means of this stanza four forms from the point of view of vatthu and a single one only from the view of lakkhaṇa  cause of ruin has been stated
Itthidhutto passionately devoted to women Whatever he has after having given all that also he takes up a lady
Likewise after having thrown down all his belongings also he gets connected with drinking alcoholics  surādhutto
After having thrown down his dressedup garments also he is connected with or addicted to gambling play at dice akkhadhutto 
By means of these three situations whatever there is that had been gained owing to his ruin he has whatever he had gained ruined thus it should be understood
The type in this way is even he who ruins himself  by means of that three types of that cause of his ruin have been spoken of this stanza
Sehi dārehi means with his own wives 
He who after having been discontented with his wives vesiyāsu padussati among prostitutes  likewise amidst other mens wives paradāresu Since by the gift of wealth to the harlots and by his cohabitation with the wives of other men he ruins himself even with royal punishments etc by that these two types of the cause of ruin of his has been spoken of by menas of this stanza
Atītayobbano after having gone beyond youth and after having been either eighty years or ninety years old āneti he allround takes up
Timbarutthaniṃ a tender girl with her breasts resembling the fig fruit 
Tassā issā na supati he does not sleep in looking after her due to his jealousy thus To a young girl enjoyment together with the aged and cohabitation as well is not charmingly pleasant  indeed let her not wish for a young man even
Since owing to his kāmarāga and being burnt by jealousy as well could not engage himself in his outside occupations gets ruined even by that absence of sleep owing to issā of his that one cause even of ruin has been spoken of by means of this stanza
Soṇḍim  he who is greedy congenitally and unsteadily greedy for fish and meat 
Vikiraṇiṃ  him whose good moral is ruined after having scattered  similar to soft grains of earth his wealth for their purpose
Purisaṃ vā tādisaṃ or a man also who is of this type  him whoever ṭhapeti places him in exercising authority  after having given bribe and muddikā etc has himself even busily occupied either with that household work or in such sorts of business as trade etc
Since owing to that defect he gets into ruin even arriving at exhaustion of wealth  By that this placing in the position or authority of that type of category of his has been spoken of as one cause of ruin even by means of this stanza
Appabhogo namely owing to the absence of accumulation of wealth and cause of income 
Mahātaṇho means endowed with great craving for wealth he who is not contented with that which has been gained
Khattiye jāyate kule means he is born in the family of Khattiya 
So ca rajjaṃ patthayati means owing to this great craving he wishes for the sovereignty which either has become his own heritage which ought not to be gained or the sovereignty belonging to others by wrong means which is out of his reach  aspiring in this way since he after having given that meagre wealth also to yodhājīva etc and not attaining to sovereignty gets into ruin even By that this aspiration for sovereinty of his has been spoken of as one cause of ruin even by means of this stanza
If subsequent  this that devatā would ask thus The Blessed One should speak of the thirteenth  the Blessed One should speak of the hundred thousandth that also the Blessed One would teach 
Since however that devatā saying to himselfWhat is the use of having these questions asked Here there does not exist a single one which promotes prosperity   asked this much even of those causes of ruin which have not been heard of became regretful and kept himself silent  therefore the Blessed One after having understood his āsaya  spoke this stanza starting with Ete parābhave loke  in order to have his desanā concluded
There paṇḍito endowed with parivīmaṃsā 
Samavekkhiya means after having investigated by means of his eye of wisdom 
Ariyo not by magga not by pahala  moreover as well indeed however in this anaya reckoned as ruin  he is unmoved  thus ariya 
He avoids after having seen ruin by whichever dassana and by whatever wisdom  owing to the condition of having been endowed with that he is dassana sampanno
Sa lokaṃ bhajate sivaṃ means sich a man as he resorts to covets and approaches the cool devaloka which is secure the most excellent and free from danger  thus it is what has been spoken of
At the allround end of the desanā  after having heard the causes of ruin the number of devatā who have attained to the fruition of sotāpatti  sakadāgāmi and anāgāmi after having made strenuous effort Wisely commesurate with the arisen remorse passed beyond calculation
Accordingly Buddha said thus
 at the teaching of Mahāsamaya sutta and then the Maṅgala Sutta
at the teaching of Samacitta and Rāhulovāda at the teaching of Dhammacakka and Parābhava
The assembly of devatā there was immeasurable and innumerable 
those who realised the truth as well here was innumerable in number 
Evaṃ me sutaṃ constitute Aggikabhāradāje Sutta it is stated as Vasala suttaalso
What is the origin
The Blessed One took his residence at Jetavana the monastery of Anāthapiṇḍika in Sāvatthi
In the manner spoken of in kasiBhāradvāja Sutta at the end of having done what should be done at pacchābhatta in the afternoon evening and the three watches of the night sighted the brahmin Aggika Bhāradvāja as being endowed with saraṇa and sikkhāpada as well as with upanissaya and came to know thusWhen I have reached there talking will take place  thereafter at the end of the conversation  after having heard my teaching of the truth  thus brahmin will reach saraṇa and take upon himself the observance of sikkhāpada  Buddha went there and when the conversation had taken place spoke of this sutta on having been requested by the brahmin for the teaching of the truth 
There as regards the context which begins with Evaṃ me sutaṃ we will make the commentary on it in my Mangalasutta vaṇṇanā  That context starting with Atha kho Bhagavā pubbaṇhasamayaṃ should be understood even in the manner stated in kasi Bhāradvā Sutta
 Tena kho pana samayena Aggika Bhāradvājassa whatever has not been spoken of before that and that even we shall make our commentary on 
What is the example here  Indeed that brehmin made sacred sacrifice of fire and attended upon fire  thus after having made that performance he became popular as Aggika by name and according to his clan he was wellknown as Bhāradvāja
Therefore the expression Aggika Bhāradvājassa has been spoken of
Nivesane means at the house 
It is said that there was a hall of fire sacrifice within the street at the door of that brahmins residence
Consequent upon that although it should be said Nivesanadvāre  it has been spoken of even as Nivesane  owing to the condition of that region also being pariyāpanna even in the residence 
In the sense of nearness is this locative case expression near the residence  thus is the meaning
Aggipajjalito hoti the fire which has stood in a firereceptacle with the special raising having been done  after having received the breeze of a fan also becomes jalita  fully crowded with a wellraised flame upwards 
huti paggahitā after having bathed his body along with his head  there were well prepared milkrice ghee honey molasses etc with great respect to make offering thus is the meaning
Indeed anything which should be sacredly sacrificed in the fire all that is said to be huti 
 Sapadānaṃ means one house after another in succession 
Indeed the Blessed One wanders about for collecting alms food without having deviated from high and low family for the purpose of doing favour to all people as well as for the sake of his contentment in nourishment 
on that account it has been told thusSapadānaṃ piṇḍāya caramāno
 Then after having sighted the Blessed One endowed with all good manners and who is allpleasing why is it that the mind of the brehmin was not pleased 
Why as well did he assail the Blessed One with an abusive word in this way as well
It is stated thus It is said that this brahmin had his heresy in this way The seeing of a monk in his maṅgalakicca is avamaṅgala  Consequent upon that he opined thusAt the time of eating meal of mahābrahmā a baldheaded monk of unlucky quality approaches my residence   As a matter of fact he went even under the influence of anger 
Then having been angry he became displeased he uttered his word of displeasure  starting withTatreva muṇḍaka
 There also since the heresy of the brahmins is thus A baldheaded individual is impure therefore there is not respectable offering to devabrāhmaṇa on account of that fact that this one is impurethus getting disgusted the brahmin said thus Munḍaka 
In other words owing to the condition of being baldheaded this one is impure  it is not beffitting for him to come to this spot  The brahmin said thus Samaṇaka despising the condition of a monk thus as well he does not praise the bodily depravity of this identity  inspite of Buddhas having been a monk
Not completing with it  the brahmin said thus Vasalaka feeling loathsome saying to himselfThis one is worse than a vasala  in other words after having made outcastes  monks he has fallen by making sambhogaparibhoga unitedly together with them In other words the sacred sacrifice becomes bad by the mere looking at it and listening to the same of those who are outcastes by birth thus thinking also he said in this wise
 The Blessed One although having been spoken to in that manner was with this such facial complexion as to placidly pleasing even with his sweet voice with his heart compassionate and cool over the brahmin and said thusJānāsi pana tvaṃ brāhmaṇa  however in order to make manifest the state of his being unique etc
Then the brahmin after having understood the state of the brightness of the needlelike mouth and the tādi condition of the Blessed One and after having heard his sweet voice uttered with his heart compassionately cool heart became pleased with his heart having been annointed with ambrosia even with his faculties of senses placidly pious with his pride struckdown gave up his familiar verbal expression similar to spitting out of poison that nature of birth  Certainly indeed this I am of low birth and a vasala  thus I realise  from the point of view of absolute meaning he  is not a vasala  neither as well in the state of being lowborn is even the phenomenon which makes an outcaste  thus thinking said thusNa khvāhaṃ bho Gotama
indeed this is natural  which is one who is endowed with hetu  owing to not receiving any causal antecedent in spite of being pharusa when the paccaya has been merely received becomes muduka 
 There sādhu thus this sadda is seen in āyācana  sampaṭicchana  sampahaṃsana sundara  daḷhākamma etc
Indeed in such contexts as Venerable Sir I do request that the Blessed One should teach the truth brieflyetc Sādhu is in the sense of request
In such contexts as Sādhu bhante ti kho so bhikkhu bhagavato bhāsitaṃ abhinanditvā animoditvā etc it is in the sense of acknowledgement 
In such contexts as Sādhu sādhu Sāriputta etc it is in the sense of sampahaṃsa 
In such contexts as  Excellent is the king finding pleasure in the truth  excellent is a man who is a possessor of wisdom 
excellent is he who is harmless to his friends not doing any evil is happiness etc 
it is in the sense of excellence 
In such contexts asTaṃ suṇātha sādhukaṃ manasi karotha  etc it is in the sense of strengthening 
Here however it is in the sense of request 
 Tena hi it is the indication of the significance of it if you are desirous of knowing  thus it is what has been spoken of
In other words it is the vacana of kāraṇa  since you are desirous of knowing it therefore O brahmin You should listen make yourself mindful of the same well I shall speak to you in that manner according as you will undestand  thus along with other words the connection should be understood
There as well Suṇāhi thus there is the warding off of disturbance of the faculty of sense of hearing by means of ears  Sādhukaṃ manasikarohi means the warding off of disturbance of manindriya by means of urging of strengthening  in making himself mindful 
Earlier  here as well there in the warding off of the grip of derangement of letter  later  there is the warding off of the grip of derangement of meaning 
At first as well the Blessed One urged the brahmin to listen to the teaching of the truth  afterwards in the memorising and investigation or examining etc of the meaning of the truths which had been listened to 
At first as well the Blessed One sheds light on his teaching thusThis truth is with letter  therefore it should be listened to afterwards It is with meaning  therefore mindfulness should be made
In other words after having harnessed the expression of sādhuka with both the pada the Blessed One said thusSuṇāhi sādhukaṃ manasikarohi  in order to shed the light on this meaning thus Since this teaching of mine is deep dhamma and prefound teaching as well therefore you should listen to it very well since it is deep in meaning as well as profound to penetrate therefore you should listen and make mindful of it very well
 Thereafter the Blessed One said thus Bhāsissāmi in order to investigate that brahmin who was as if he was sinking down saying to himselfHow shall I gain patiṭṭha in the deep in this way
There I shall speak to you in a clear manner with words and letters which are wellsounding in such a manner that you will understandthus the significance should be understood in this way
Consequent upon that he became energetic Evaṃ bho ti kho Aggikabhradvājo brāhmaṇo bhagavato paccasosi and acceptance  thus it is what has been told In other words the brehmin listened to such as he has been admonished being inclined towards with prorer procedure 
Then to him Bhagavā etadavoca  now in connection with what should be said has been told kodhano upanāhī  thus starting in this way
There Kodhano means he who is in the habit of being angry 
Upapāhī means he who is endowed with the bearing of illwill by making firm of that very anger
He who soils and wipes off the good qualities of others thus makkhī  He is wicked as well as bearer of illwill  thus pāpamakkhī 
Vipannadiṭṭhi is destroyed right view in other words he who is endowed with heresy of ten foundations which has reached virūpa 
Māyāvī means endowed with māyā  with the characteristic mark of concealing his own existing dosa 
Taṃ jaññā vasalo iti  One would know thus Vasalo  such an individual as him owing to pouring down the shower  the sprinkling and the streaming into  he who has been born at the summit of brahmins with all these
Indeed this one is a vasala even from the point of view of absolute meaning  merely for the satisfaction of his own heart not for others 
In this way here the Blessed One even by means of the ādipada made the censure of that brahmins anger  taught the truths first of all by means of a single pariyāya about vasala as well as vasalakaraṇa showing the phenomena starting with anger by means of the desanā known as puggalādhiṭṭhāna as well thus Kodhādidhammo hīnapuggalo 
Teaching in this way as well the Blessed One did not make paravamblna and attukkaṃsana had that brahmin established in the condition of vasala and himself in the state of a brāhmaṇa in conformity with the truth even and with propriety 
Now this which is the heresy of the brahminsInspite of committing such sin as pāṇātipāta and adinnādāna etc he is still a brahmin even 
in order to condradict that wrong view  those who not seeing the disadvantage being endowed with these and those out of sinful deeds starting with cruelty to creatures give rise to doctrines  in order to show the disadvantage as well there of theirs there thus Inferior are these doctrines which are makers of vasala  and to teach as well the truths about vasala as well as the vasalakaraṇa by means of other tactful terms  the Blessed One spoke such stanzas as have started in this way Ekajaṃ vā dvijaṃ vā 
There ekajo means besides the product of an egg one who is born by the remaining womb 
Indeed he is born once even 
Dvijo means born of an egg 
Indeed from the womb of the mother as well as from aṇḍakosa 
Eithe that ekaja or dvija 
Yodha pāṇaṃ that living being here
Vihiṃsati either with the payoga arisen volition pertaining to the door of the body or with the action of the arisen volition pertaining to vocal organ  he deprives the life of others 
There is such a reading also as Pāṇāni hiṃsati 
there he who here is cruel to creatures who are classified in this way as either ekaja or dvija  thus the conjunction should be understood in this way
Yassa pāṇe dayā natthi  by this the Blessed One said of the nonexistence of mental sympathy 
The rest here is even in the said manner

O monks These five big thieves are ever existing in the world
who are the five
O monks Here to some big thieves it is in this wayWhen namely I shall wander about in villages market towns and kings capital cities surrounded by either a hundred or a thousand killing slaughtering  cutting  causing the cutting  cooking or tormenting and causing the cooking or tormenting On a subsequent occasion he surrounded by either a hundred or a thousand wanders about in villages market towns and kings capital cities killing  causing the cooking or tormenting 
O monks in this way indeed here to some wicked monks It is in this way When namely shall I either with a hundred or  wander about on a tour in kings capital cities having been respected reverenced  revered  honoured  and treated with courtesy by householders as well as by monks recipient of robes  and ecclesiastical essentials 
on a subsequent occasion that monk surrounded by either a hundred or a thousand wanders about on a tour in villages market towns and kings capital cities respected  of ecclesiastical essentials 
O monks This first big thief is ever existing in the world
O monks Again as well further on here some wicked monks after having learnt the dhamma and vinaya  made known by Tathāgata burns his own O monks This is the second big thief in the world
O monks Again as well further on here some wicked monks degrades a pure monk leading a highly chaste life practising the allround pure brahmacariya with unfounded unchaste conduct  O monks
This is the third big thief in the world
O monks Again as well further on here some wicked monk favours and coaxes a householder with those which are such important of valuable properties of the order of monks and valuable ecclesiastical essential as for example the ashram  the site of the ashraṃ  monastery  the site of the monastery  cot  stool  bolster  pillow  copper cauldrum  bronze box  brass jar  bronze vessel  razor  axe  hatchet  spade or hoe  chisel  reed rope for binding building bamboo  muñja grass bulrush  grassreed earth  wooden property and torracotta ware

There in connection with that monk who is this fifth big thief the Blessed One said thusIn the world including the divine world is a thief
That monk indeed has been spoken of as topmost big thief owing to his stealing the mundane and supermundane wealth in this way according as Buddha said thusO monks In the world including the divine world  among human beings along with the divinebeings this monk in the topmost big thief in that he lays his claim to the uttarimanussadhamma which is abhūta therefore here also Buddha made manifest that monk by means of this allround hyperbolic limit thus Sabrahmake loke 
 Eso kho vasalā dhamo
here Kho is in the sense of avadhāraṇa  on that account this one even is vasalādhama 
the inferior  the last of all of outcastesl thus Buddha emphaseses
Why
Owing to the rainshower of theyyadhamma poured down on the site which is  as long as he does not release that paṭiññaṃ  till then he is subject to making himself not without being in outcaste as well
Ete kho vasalā
now those five of the first stanza which are kodhana  etc under the influence āsayavipatti  in other words after having made evilhypocrisy two types they are six one who is cruel to cretures is one in number by way of failure of payoga of the second stanza of the third stanza one in number is an oppressor of village and market town even under the influence of failure of exerting oneself  of the fourty stanza one in number by way of theyyāvahāra  of the fifth stanza one in number by way of deceiving debt  of the sixth stanza one in number is the panthadūsaka by way of taking off forcibly  of the seventh stanza one in number by way of kūṭa sakkhi  of the eighth stanza one in number by way mittadubbhi  of the tenth stanza one in number by way of insulting after having caused ruin  of the eleventh stanza one in number by way of deceiving the heart  of the twelveth stanza two in number by way of having covered concealingly an occupation work  of the thirteenth stanza one in number by way of not knowing what had been done for him of fraud  of the fifteenth stanza one in number by way of vexing  of the sixteenth stanza one in number by way of deception  of the seventeeth stanza two in number by way of extolling oneself and slighting others of the eighteenth stanza seven in number wrathfulness etc by way of failure of payoga and āsaya  of the nineteenth stanza two in number by way of paribhāsana  of the twentieth stanza one in number by way of topmost big thief  thus either thirty three or thirty four types or vasala have been spoken of in this way
In order to point them out Buddha said thusEte kho vasalā vuttā mayā ye te pakāsitā
Its meaning is Thise vasala  were previously spoken of by me briefly in this way asking you thus O brahmin Do you however know the vasala outcaste Indeed these are those which have been made minifest at length
In other words those which have been told by way of puggala  indeed these are made manifest by way of truth 
In other words indeed these vasala have been spoken of by way of kamma done by ariyas  not by way of jāti  those which have been made manifest by me is in the manner starting with kokhano upanāhī 
After having shown vasala in this way now since the brahmin was excessively attached to his own view  therefore in order to ward off that heresy Buddha spoke thus Na jaccā vasalo hoti
Its meaning is Indeed from the point of veiw of absolute sense one is not a vasala owing to birth  neither one is a brahmin owing to ones birth indeed nevertheless one is a vasala owing to kamma  one is a vasala owing to rainlike shower of allround impure kamma  One is a brāhmaṇa owing to carrying the allround impure by means of allround pure kamma 
In other words since you thought an inferior vasala to be a superior brāhmaṇa  therefore one is a vasala owing to inferior kamma  one is a brāhmaṇa owing to superior kamma  thus making the brahmin know the meaning in this way also the Blessed One said in this way
Now the Blessed One spoke three stanzas starting with Thdamonā pi jānātha in order to bring to a conclusion that very meaning by nidassana 
Out of those three stanzas two are of four feet and one is of six feet Their meaning is You should understand in this way also that context Na jaccā Vasalo hotietc and tadaminā pi jānātha yathā medaṃ nidassamaṃ which had been spoken of by me this is the nidassana by which manner and by which sāmañña of mine thus it is what has been stated
If asked what nidassanaṃ 
Caṇḍāla putto Sopāko  brabmalokūpapattiyā
 The son of a caṇḍāla is caṇḍālaputto
After having obtained dead dogs he cooks the same for the purpose of his own eating thus Sopāko
 Mātaṅgo is one who is named in this way Vissuto means clearly evident in this way owing to inferior birth as well as owing to livelihood 
 So means that Mātaṅga after having connected it with the previous pada  yasaṃ paramaṃ patto means having attained to what is extraordinary  most excellent  extremely eminent  famous  raputed and praised 
Yaṃ sudullabhaṃ connotse which is difficult to gain inspite of owing to having sprung up in an eminent family in this way extremely difficult to gain by having been born in an inferior family
In this way to one who has reached reputation as well āgacchuṃ tass upaṭṭhānaṃ khattiyā brāhmaṇā bahū for the purpose of attending upon that Mātaṇga the khattiyas and brahmins as well as many other people of commercial class and suddā etc who constitute the humanbeings of jambu island generally came for service thus is the meaning
 That Mātaṅga endowed with serving attendants in this way is virajaṃ owing to the condition of being devoid of the dust of depravity  mahāpathaṃ it is the great path owing to the condition of having been entered upon by great personages beginning with Buddha abhiruyha means after having specially ascended the conveyance of eight proper attainments of trance named the vehicle of the divine world owing to the condition of its ability to transport to the divine world reckoned as the brehmā world kāmarāgaṃ virāgaṃ virājetvā and on the disintegration of his body  brahmalokūpago ahu  though that birth of his is inferior  ma maṃ jāti nivāresi brahmalokūpapattiyā  owing to his being born in brahmaloka  thus it is what has been stated
 This meaning however should be understood thus It is said that long ago the great man  working for the welfare of living beings by this and that means sprang up in the family of an outcaste which lived cooking dogmeat 
He was known by the name of Mātaṅga since he was physically badlooking  he lived in a small leather hut  After having wandered about inside the town as a beggar for food he earned his livelihood
Then one day in that town when alcoholic festival was proclaimed alcoholics bemused themselves according as they were with their own retinue 
A certain daughter of an immensely wealthy brahmin also of the age of fifteen or sizteen according to indication  goodlooking physically resembling a devakaññā with pleasing demeanour  saying to herself I shall sport myself commensurate with my own family lineage  had the accumulation of such sporting outfits as starting with abundant hard food and soft food loaded on carts  ascended the vehicle yoked with all white coloured mares and proceeded to the garden ground surrounded by a large retinue she was known by the name of Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā
It is said that she did not desire to see the inauspiscious physically deformed individual  on that account there arose her appellation of her even as Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā
 At that time that Mātaṅga rose up even early put on his lower garment of rags  fastened at his hand a bronze gong held an earther sighted multitude of people even from afar he kept on beating his gong
At that juncture Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā was being led by her people who kept on removing despicable crowd of people ahead and in front sayingYou should run away you had better run away she sighted Mātaṅga at the centre of the citygate and asked thusWho is this
 He replied thusI am Mātaṅga a caṇdāla 
She said to herself thusAfter having seen one like this to those who have gone on from where can there be prosperity  and had her vehicle turned back 
People became angry sayingHindrance has been made by Mātaṅga for us to receive that hard food and soft food etc since we are eating them after having reached the garden They shouted you should seize caṅḍāla  hit him with clods of earth and saying to themselves He is dead seized him by his feet discarded him at a corner had him concealingly covered with garbage and went away
That Mātaṅga regained his sati  rose up and enquired of the people thusMy lords What is your opinion Is such a thing as a gate common to everyone or has the gate been made for brahmins only
 The people gave their answer thusThe gate is for the common use of everyone
 Mātaṅga said to himselfPeople of Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā made me who had been keeping myself going with food abtained by begging after having entered by the gate common to every one in this way and reach distresful destruction  kept an wandering about from one chariotroad to another after having given information to the mass of men and lay himself down at the door of the brahmins house saying to himself I shall not rise up without having gained Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā
 After having heard thusAt the door of the house Mātaṅga has kept himself lying downthe brahmin said thusGive him a kākaṇika and let him go after having had his limb smeared with oil 
Mātaṅga did not desire it and said thusI shall not rise up without having obtained Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā
 Consequent upon that the brahmin said thusGive him two kākaṇekas  let him eat a half a copper coin worth of cake and let him go after having smeared his limb with half a coppercoin worth of oil
 He did not desire it but insisted telling his requirement
After heard of it the brahmin gave orders up to one hundred saying thusGive him a māsaka  a pāda  half a gold coin and a gold coin  two and three
 He did not desire it but kept on telling even in that manner
Making his demand in this way even the sunset occurred
Then the bramin lady came down from her palatial mansion had a screen wall set up all round approached that Mātaṅga made her request thusDear son Mātaṅga Do condone the offence of Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā please accept a thousend thus she kept on saying until her offer to Māgaṅga reached a hundred thousand gold coins
That outcaste became silent but kept on lying down even
 When four or five days expired in this way young men of khattiya clan etc who could not get the hand of Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā after having offered plenty of presents had Mātaṅga informed close to his ear thusAfter having made exertion for many a year male men achieve their desired benefit  do not indeed be disappointed  definitely with the lapse of two or three days you will ger Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā
Having become silent Mātaṅga kept on lying down even
Then on the seventh day neighbours from all round rose up and said thusYou should either make Mātaṅga get up or give him the girl do not ruin all of us
It is said that this is their opinion  Together wih the house at the door of which a caṇḍāla who keeps himself lying down in this way dies the residents of the surrounding seven houses in each direction become caṇḍāla 
Consequent upon that the parents made the weeping Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā put on blue patchedup raiment of rags gave her a spoon  a pot  etcled her to his presence and gave her sayingYou should take the girl rise up and go
 She stood on his side and told him to rise up he replied thusYou should seize me by your hand and raise me up
She made him rise up
He sat down and said to her thusWe are not allowed to live in the city come lead me to my hidehut outside the town
She held him by his hand and led him there
Reciters of birthstories said thusPiṭṭhiyaṃ āropetvā after having made him ride her on her back
 After having led him as well she smeared his body woth oil had him bathed with warm water cooked ricegruel and gave him
He said to himselfLet not this brahmin girl get ruineddid not do even any jātisambheda  collected his strength to the extend of hald a month and told her thusIm going to the forest do not get disappointed  sayingHe takes too long  gave orders to the at home as well thusDo not have this young lady become neglected  took his departure fron his house renounced the world became an ascetic performed the preliminaries of kasiṇa  even within a few days made himself attain the eight samāpatti and five abhiññā as well said to himselfNow I shall become winner of the heart of Diṭṭhamaṅgalikāwent through the sky descended at the city gate and sent to Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā
 After having heard the message she went thinking thusI think some one a relative of mine a recluse having come to know of my misfortune must have come to see meafter having recognised him  fell herself down at his feet and said thusWhy have you made me to be without protection
 The great man replied thusO Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā Do not be unhappy  I shall carry out in such a way that all the residents of the whole island of Jambu will make their respectful offerings to you  He gave her this instruectionGo and make this proclamation My husband is mahābrahmā he is not a mātaṅga  he will come to my presence on the seventh day after having split open the mansion of the moon
 She said in reply thusVenerable Sir After having become the daughter of brahmaṇamahāsāla  I have reached the state of a caṇḍāla owing to my evil deed it is not possible for me to say in this way
The great men remarked thusYou do not know the ānubhāva of Mātaṅga After having said so according as she should come to believe in that manner he showed many a miracle and after having given her his orders in that manner even he went back to his own dwelling abode 
She did in that manner
 People grumbled and laughed making this remarkIndeed how can this one having reached the state of caṇḍāla owing to her own evil deed again will made her of the Great Brahmā
 She continued to be intent upon  roamed about the city proclaiming the same day after day thus On the sixth day fron this day he will come After fourth on the third tomorrow and to day he will come
After having heard her well confident words people said to themselvesSometimes it would be in this way alsohad pandals made at their respective housedoors set up a wall of screen  adorned their girls who had come of age and kept themselves seated looking up at the sky saying to themselvesWe shall give girls as charity
Then the great men on the fullmoon day when the moon had just come up the surface of the sky split open the mansion of the moon and while the massive multitude of men were looking on descended in the form of Mabābrahmā 
The multitude of men exaggeratingly imagined thusTwo moons have come into being
 Thereafter after having seen him come gradually the multitude came to a decision thusDiṭṭhamaṅgalikā spoke the truth in order to subdue this Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā he came previously in the guise of Mātaṅga 
In this way being seen by the massive multitude of men he descended down to the residence of Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā even
She on her part was at that time was having her mensturation 
he touched her navel with his thumb 
by means of that contact pregnancy come to be established
Thereafter after having told her thusPregnancy has well stood in you when the son has been born you should live depending upon himhe entered the mansion of the moon again while the massive multitude of men was looking on
 The brahmins said thusDiṭṭhamaṅgalikā is the consort of Mahābrahmā she has become our mother and came to her fron here and there
Owing to the trouble of multitude of men who were desirous of making respectful offering to her the gates of the city became congested 
They placed Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā on a heap of gold bathed her adorned her made her mount the chariot let her make the circumambulation of the city with enormous respect had a pandal built at the centre of the city placed her in that pandal at the spot where she could be seen saying The consort of Mahā brahmāand let her stay there thus Until we make a suitable residence for her till then let her stay on here even
In that pandal even she gave birth to her son
On a pure day they bathed her along with her son washed their heads also and gave the name Maṇḍabyakumāra to the baby boy sayingHe had been born in the pandal
Originating from that time the brahmins wandered about after having surrounded him sayingThe son of Mahābrahmā
 Thereafter there came to him presents of many a hundred thousand varieties Those brahmins became the guard of the young man Those who arrived did not receive the opportunity of seeing the young man swiftly 
 In due course the young man grew up and began to make charitable offering
He gave his charity to the brahmins only without giving to the destitutes and travellers who had well arrived at his charityhall
The Great man reflected over thusWhom does my son offer charity  He saw his son giving charity to brahmins only saying to himselfI shall manage in such a manner that he gives to every one He put on his upper robe took hold of his begging bowl came thuough the sky and stood at the housedoor of his son
After having seen him the young man became angry saying to himselfFrom where has this ugly looking vasala come  spoke this stanza
O you dirtily dressed  From where have you come You are clothed in rags  You are like a mudsprite 
at your neck you fasten a rag picked up from a rubbish heap  Look here  who are you who is not dakkhiṇeyya 
 The brahmins saying to themselvesYou should seize him you should capture him caught hold of him pounded him and made him reach miserable ruin 
He went through the sky and stood firmly outside the city
Devatā became angry seized the young man at his throat and placed him feet upwards and head downwards
With his eyes gone out with the oozing out of saliva from his month  inhaling his breath snoringly  suffered painful sensation
After having heard about it Diṭṭhamaṇgalikā enquired thusWas there any one who had come
 They replied thusYes a monk came
 She asked thusWhere has he gone
 They answered thusHe had gone in this way
 She went there and lay herself down on the ground at the base of his feet imploring thusVenerable Sir Kindly condone your own slave
 On that occasion the Great Man had wandered about for almsfood received ricegruel and was seated drinking that ricegruel He gave to Diṭṭhamaṇgalikā a small quantity of ricegruel which was left over with this instrution
You should go mix this ricegruel in a jar of water and sprinkle this stirred up ricegruel water in the eyes mouths ears and nose which have become ābila  of thoes people who have bhūtavikāra 
She did in that manner
Consequent upon that when the young man had become normal in body  Diṭṭhamaṇgalikā said thusMy dear son Maṇḍabya Do come let us all the brahmins lie down facedownwards at the base of the feet of that husband of hers and tender their apology to get themselves condoned
 He gave his advice thus Charitable offering should be given to all humanbeings  Did the teaching of the truth  went back to his own residential region and thought thusDiṭṭhamaṇgalikā obviously popular among young ladies had been tamed  the distinctly wellknown Maṇdabya among the male people had been subhued now who is he who should be tamed
 Consequent upon that he sighted an ascetic jātimanta dwelling on the bank of the river kumbhavatī depending upon the city of Bandhumatī
He said to himself thusI am eminent by birth  I am not going to drink the water allround consumed by othersthus he dwelt at the upper reaches of the river 
The Great Man took up his residence near the river upstream above him  at the time when he made an allround use of the riverwater the Great Man chewed his toothstick and threw the same down the river water
the ascetic on seeing that toothbrush floating down stream on the river went uppstream met the Great Man and saked thus Who is he here
 The reply wasO teacher I am a caṇḍāla Mātaṅga
The ascetic instructed thusO Caṇḍāla  Take your departure from here do not stay on the shore of the upper reaches of the river
 The Great Man saying responsively Very well O teacher took up his residence on the bank of the lower reaches of the river against the rivercurrent also his toothpick reached the presence of the ascetic
The ascetic went again and said thus O Caṇḍāla  Do take your departure you should stay on the shore of the upper reaches of the river even
The Great Man in compliance said thusVery well O teacher and did likewise again also there turned out to be but in that manner
The ascetic again also saying to himself He is doing in that mannergot offended and cursed the Great Man thusMay his head be splitted up into seven slices at the time of the rising of the sun
 Mahāpurisa also said thus Very well O teacher I however am not allowing the sun to rise 
Consequent upon that the night did not come into an end to become daybreak  Having become afraid the citizens of Bandhumatī went to the presence of the ascetic ahd made their enquires thusO teacher Is there indeed our safety 
 Indeed they thought that ascetic to be an Arahant
That ascetic gave intimation to them about everything
They approched Mahāpurisa and made their request thusVenerable Sir Kindly release the sun
 Mahāpurise replied thusIf your Arahant comes and apologises me I shall make the release 
 The multitude of men went and told the ascetic thusVenerable Sir Do come and apologise the wise Mātaṇga do not make us perish on account your quarrel 
 That ascetic replied thus I am not going to apologise the caṇḍāla 
The multitude of men saying to themselves You make us ruin seized that ascetic by his hands and legs and led him to the presence of Mahāpurisa
The Great Man said thusI an going to condone him when he tenders his aplolgy after having lain down on his belly at the base of my feet
 The multitude of men told the ascetic thus You should do in this way
The ascetic persisted thus I am not paying my homage to the caṇḍāla 
The multitude of men saying to the asceticYou will not pay your homage voluntarily  caught hold of him by his hands legs beard and neck etc and made him lie down at the base of the feet of Mahāpurisa
who said thus I condone this one all the same out of compassion for him I am not releasing the sun indeed the mere moment the sun has risen his head will split into seven slices
 The people enquired thus Venerable Sir What should be done now
 Mahāpurisa replied thus Well then sink him into the riverwater neckdeep and you should concealingly cover his head with a lump of earth touched by the rays of the sun the lump of earth will split into seven slices
when it had been splitted let this one go elsewhere
They held the hermit by his hands and legs etc and did in that manner
When the sun had just been barely released  the lump of earth split into seven slices and fell The hermit fled with fear 
After having seen  The multitude of men remarked saying O friends You should see the ānubhāva of the monk  After having made the throwing of the toothbrush the beginning they told everything at length and became pleased with him saying There does not exist any monk resembling this
Beginning thereafter in the entire island of Jambu khattiya and brahmins etc lay people and monks went to attend upon the wise Mātaṅga
He lived as long as his lifespan lasted and on the dissolution of his body rose up in the brehmā world
On that account the Blessed One said thusYou should understand it by means of this  for spontaneous springing up in the brahmā world 
In this way after having proved thusNot because of birth one is a vasala  it is owing to kamma one is a vasala  Buddha now said thusAjjhāyakakule jātā  duggatyā garahāya vā in order to bring this to a logical conclusion  Not by birth is he a brahmin because of his kamma he is a brahmin
There ajjhāyakakule jātā means bacause of having been born in the family of a brahmin who recited charms 
There is such a reading asAjjhāyakākuṭṭhe jātā also
because of having been born on the family of a brahmin who was irreproachable in the recitation of many a manta  thus is the meaning
Mantabandhavā means to them their relatives were mantā 
Knowledgekinsmen and knowledge protection  thus it is what has been stated
Te ca pāpesu kammesu abhiṇhamupadissa means having been born on the family in this way although they were the relatives of manta as well if they again and again discovered in evil deeds beginning with pāṇātipāta  then diṭṭheva dhamme gārayhā samparāye ca duggati means on being discovered in this way they even in this present existence treated even by their own mother and father thusThese are not our sons these are badly born  they have become burning embers  drag them out  by the brahmins also thusThese are householders  these are not bramins do not allow their entry into saddha  yañña  thālipāka etc do not have any conversation together with them  They are blamed by other people also in this way thus These individuals are evil doers they are not brahmins
Hereafter in the next existence as well their evil existence is classified as hell etc in the other world there is duggati for these individuals thus is the meaning
There is such a reading as samparāya 
Duggati means destiny for misery is for these individuals in the other world  there is but arrival at suffering  thus is the meaning
Na ne jāti nivāreti duggatyā garahāya vā means birth does not prevent these brahmins either fron diggati in the manner stated hereSamparāye ca kuggati these brahmins who are seen in evil kamma  although that birth is exalted in that manner that birth which you fall back upon  as being essential  or from blane in the manner stated here thusDiṭṭhe va dhamme garayhā 
In this way the Blessed One shedding light on the condition of having fallin in this very present existence by way of such kamma as begun with blame of the brahmins although they have been born in the family of ajjhāyaka and shedding light on the absence of the brahmin birth in the next existence owing to his reaching the duggati owing to his reaching the duggati  proved this matter also saying Not by birth one is a brahmin owing to his kamma he is a brahmin now in order to conclude the matter of the two types also the Blessed One said thusO brahmin in this way
Not by birth one is a vasala  not by birth one is a brahmin
owing to action one is a vasala  owing to action one is a brahmin
 The rest is even in the manner stated in kasibhāradvāja sutta
In other words from the point of view of qualification  the interpertation in this way of the context beginning with nikujjitaṃ vā should be understood According as some one would turn what has been made face downwards to become one with face upwards  in this way by making me rise up from diṭṭhi  me Who has fallen into jātivāda which constitutes the vimukha kamma  according as one would unveil what has been concealingly covered  in this way by revealing the opinion of action which has been concealingly covered by jātivāda  according as one would give information of the right road to one who has lost ones way in this way by intimating to me the unmixedup straightforward path of the state of btāhmaṇa and vasala  in other words according as one would bear in ones hand a lighted oil lamp in darkness in this way by bearing the lighted lanp of such illustrations as begun with Mātaṇga the truth has been made manifest in many a tactful manner to me by Lord Gotama  owing to the condition of having elucidated by means of these expositional methods
Evaṃ me sutaṃ constitute Aggikabhāradāje Sutta it is stated as Vasala suttaalso
What is the origin
The Blessed One took his residence at Jetavana the monastery of Anāthapiṇḍika in Sāvatthi
In the manner spoken of in kasiBhāradvāja Sutta at the end of having done what should be done at pacchābhatta in the afternoon evening and the three watches of the night sighted the brahmin Aggika Bhāradvāja as being endowed with saraṇa and sikkhāpada as well as with upanissaya and came to know thusWhen I have reached there talking will take place  thereafter at the end of the conversation  after having heard my teaching of the truth  thus brahmin will reach saraṇa and take upon himself the observance of sikkhāpada  Buddha went there and when the conversation had taken place spoke of this sutta on having been requested by the brahmin for the teaching of the truth 
There as regards the context which begins with Evaṃ me sutaṃ we will make the commentary on it in my Mangalasutta vaṇṇanā  That context starting with Atha kho Bhagavā pubbaṇhasamayaṃ should be understood even in the manner stated in kasi Bhāradvā Sutta
 Tena kho pana samayena Aggika Bhāradvājassa whatever has not been spoken of before that and that even we shall make our commentary on 
What is the example here  Indeed that brehmin made sacred sacrifice of fire and attended upon fire  thus after having made that performance he became popular as Aggika by name and according to his clan he was wellknown as Bhāradvāja
Therefore the expression Aggika Bhāradvājassa has been spoken of
Nivesane means at the house 
It is said that there was a hall of fire sacrifice within the street at the door of that brahmins residence
Consequent upon that although it should be said Nivesanadvāre  it has been spoken of even as Nivesane  owing to the condition of that region also being pariyāpanna even in the residence 
In the sense of nearness is this locative case expression near the residence  thus is the meaning
Aggipajjalito hoti the fire which has stood in a firereceptacle with the special raising having been done  after having received the breeze of a fan also becomes jalita  fully crowded with a wellraised flame upwards 
huti paggahitā after having bathed his body along with his head  there were well prepared milkrice ghee honey molasses etc with great respect to make offering thus is the meaning
Indeed anything which should be sacredly sacrificed in the fire all that is said to be huti 
 Sapadānaṃ means one house after another in succession 
Indeed the Blessed One wanders about for collecting alms food without having deviated from high and low family for the purpose of doing favour to all people as well as for the sake of his contentment in nourishment 
on that account it has been told thusSapadānaṃ piṇḍāya caramāno
 Then after having sighted the Blessed One endowed with all good manners and who is allpleasing why is it that the mind of the brehmin was not pleased 
Why as well did he assail the Blessed One with an abusive word in this way as well
It is stated thus It is said that this brahmin had his heresy in this way The seeing of a monk in his maṅgalakicca is avamaṅgala  Consequent upon that he opined thusAt the time of eating meal of mahābrahmā a baldheaded monk of unlucky quality approaches my residence   As a matter of fact he went even under the influence of anger 
Then having been angry he became displeased he uttered his word of displeasure  starting withTatreva muṇḍaka
 There also since the heresy of the brahmins is thus A baldheaded individual is impure therefore there is not respectable offering to devabrāhmaṇa on account of that fact that this one is impurethus getting disgusted the brahmin said thus Munḍaka 
In other words owing to the condition of being baldheaded this one is impure  it is not beffitting for him to come to this spot  The brahmin said thus Samaṇaka despising the condition of a monk thus as well he does not praise the bodily depravity of this identity  inspite of Buddhas having been a monk
Not completing with it  the brahmin said thus Vasalaka feeling loathsome saying to himselfThis one is worse than a vasala  in other words after having made outcastes  monks he has fallen by making sambhogaparibhoga unitedly together with them In other words the sacred sacrifice becomes bad by the mere looking at it and listening to the same of those who are outcastes by birth thus thinking also he said in this wise
 The Blessed One although having been spoken to in that manner was with this such facial complexion as to placidly pleasing even with his sweet voice with his heart compassionate and cool over the brahmin and said thusJānāsi pana tvaṃ brāhmaṇa  however in order to make manifest the state of his being unique etc
Then the brahmin after having understood the state of the brightness of the needlelike mouth and the tādi condition of the Blessed One and after having heard his sweet voice uttered with his heart compassionately cool heart became pleased with his heart having been annointed with ambrosia even with his faculties of senses placidly pious with his pride struckdown gave up his familiar verbal expression similar to spitting out of poison that nature of birth  Certainly indeed this I am of low birth and a vasala  thus I realise  from the point of view of absolute meaning he  is not a vasala  neither as well in the state of being lowborn is even the phenomenon which makes an outcaste  thus thinking said thusNa khvāhaṃ bho Gotama
indeed this is natural  which is one who is endowed with hetu  owing to not receiving any causal antecedent in spite of being pharusa when the paccaya has been merely received becomes muduka 
 There sādhu thus this sadda is seen in āyācana  sampaṭicchana  sampahaṃsana sundara  daḷhākamma etc
Indeed in such contexts as Venerable Sir I do request that the Blessed One should teach the truth brieflyetc Sādhu is in the sense of request
In such contexts as Sādhu bhante ti kho so bhikkhu bhagavato bhāsitaṃ abhinanditvā animoditvā etc it is in the sense of acknowledgement 
In such contexts as Sādhu sādhu Sāriputta etc it is in the sense of sampahaṃsa 
In such contexts as  Excellent is the king finding pleasure in the truth  excellent is a man who is a possessor of wisdom 
excellent is he who is harmless to his friends not doing any evil is happiness etc 
it is in the sense of excellence 
In such contexts asTaṃ suṇātha sādhukaṃ manasi karotha  etc it is in the sense of strengthening 
Here however it is in the sense of request 
 Tena hi it is the indication of the significance of it if you are desirous of knowing  thus it is what has been spoken of
In other words it is the vacana of kāraṇa  since you are desirous of knowing it therefore O brahmin You should listen make yourself mindful of the same well I shall speak to you in that manner according as you will undestand  thus along with other words the connection should be understood
There as well Suṇāhi thus there is the warding off of disturbance of the faculty of sense of hearing by means of ears  Sādhukaṃ manasikarohi means the warding off of disturbance of manindriya by means of urging of strengthening  in making himself mindful 
Earlier  here as well there in the warding off of the grip of derangement of letter  later  there is the warding off of the grip of derangement of meaning 
At first as well the Blessed One urged the brahmin to listen to the teaching of the truth  afterwards in the memorising and investigation or examining etc of the meaning of the truths which had been listened to 
At first as well the Blessed One sheds light on his teaching thusThis truth is with letter  therefore it should be listened to afterwards It is with meaning  therefore mindfulness should be made
In other words after having harnessed the expression of sādhuka with both the pada the Blessed One said thusSuṇāhi sādhukaṃ manasikarohi  in order to shed the light on this meaning thus Since this teaching of mine is deep dhamma and prefound teaching as well therefore you should listen to it very well since it is deep in meaning as well as profound to penetrate therefore you should listen and make mindful of it very well
 Thereafter the Blessed One said thus Bhāsissāmi in order to investigate that brahmin who was as if he was sinking down saying to himselfHow shall I gain patiṭṭha in the deep in this way
There I shall speak to you in a clear manner with words and letters which are wellsounding in such a manner that you will understandthus the significance should be understood in this way
Consequent upon that he became energetic Evaṃ bho ti kho Aggikabhradvājo brāhmaṇo bhagavato paccasosi and acceptance  thus it is what has been told In other words the brehmin listened to such as he has been admonished being inclined towards with prorer procedure 
Then to him Bhagavā etadavoca  now in connection with what should be said has been told kodhano upanāhī  thus starting in this way
There Kodhano means he who is in the habit of being angry 
Upapāhī means he who is endowed with the bearing of illwill by making firm of that very anger
He who soils and wipes off the good qualities of others thus makkhī  He is wicked as well as bearer of illwill  thus pāpamakkhī 
Vipannadiṭṭhi is destroyed right view in other words he who is endowed with heresy of ten foundations which has reached virūpa 
Māyāvī means endowed with māyā  with the characteristic mark of concealing his own existing dosa 
Taṃ jaññā vasalo iti  One would know thus Vasalo  such an individual as him owing to pouring down the shower  the sprinkling and the streaming into  he who has been born at the summit of brahmins with all these
Indeed this one is a vasala even from the point of view of absolute meaning  merely for the satisfaction of his own heart not for others 
In this way here the Blessed One even by means of the ādipada made the censure of that brahmins anger  taught the truths first of all by means of a single pariyāya about vasala as well as vasalakaraṇa showing the phenomena starting with anger by means of the desanā known as puggalādhiṭṭhāna as well thus Kodhādidhammo hīnapuggalo 
Teaching in this way as well the Blessed One did not make paravamblna and attukkaṃsana had that brahmin established in the condition of vasala and himself in the state of a brāhmaṇa in conformity with the truth even and with propriety 
Now this which is the heresy of the brahminsInspite of committing such sin as pāṇātipāta and adinnādāna etc he is still a brahmin even 
in order to condradict that wrong view  those who not seeing the disadvantage being endowed with these and those out of sinful deeds starting with cruelty to creatures give rise to doctrines  in order to show the disadvantage as well there of theirs there thus Inferior are these doctrines which are makers of vasala  and to teach as well the truths about vasala as well as the vasalakaraṇa by means of other tactful terms  the Blessed One spoke such stanzas as have started in this way Ekajaṃ vā dvijaṃ vā 
There ekajo means besides the product of an egg one who is born by the remaining womb 
Indeed he is born once even 
Dvijo means born of an egg 
Indeed from the womb of the mother as well as from aṇḍakosa 
Eithe that ekaja or dvija 
Yodha pāṇaṃ that living being here
Vihiṃsati either with the payoga arisen volition pertaining to the door of the body or with the action of the arisen volition pertaining to vocal organ  he deprives the life of others 
There is such a reading also as Pāṇāni hiṃsati 
there he who here is cruel to creatures who are classified in this way as either ekaja or dvija  thus the conjunction should be understood in this way
Yassa pāṇe dayā natthi  by this the Blessed One said of the nonexistence of mental sympathy 
The rest here is even in the said manner

O monks These five big thieves are ever existing in the world
who are the five
O monks Here to some big thieves it is in this wayWhen namely I shall wander about in villages market towns and kings capital cities surrounded by either a hundred or a thousand killing slaughtering  cutting  causing the cutting  cooking or tormenting and causing the cooking or tormenting On a subsequent occasion he surrounded by either a hundred or a thousand wanders about in villages market towns and kings capital cities killing  causing the cooking or tormenting 
O monks in this way indeed here to some wicked monks It is in this way When namely shall I either with a hundred or  wander about on a tour in kings capital cities having been respected reverenced  revered  honoured  and treated with courtesy by householders as well as by monks recipient of robes  and ecclesiastical essentials 
on a subsequent occasion that monk surrounded by either a hundred or a thousand wanders about on a tour in villages market towns and kings capital cities respected  of ecclesiastical essentials 
O monks This first big thief is ever existing in the world
O monks Again as well further on here some wicked monks after having learnt the dhamma and vinaya  made known by Tathāgata burns his own O monks This is the second big thief in the world
O monks Again as well further on here some wicked monks degrades a pure monk leading a highly chaste life practising the allround pure brahmacariya with unfounded unchaste conduct  O monks
This is the third big thief in the world
O monks Again as well further on here some wicked monk favours and coaxes a householder with those which are such important of valuable properties of the order of monks and valuable ecclesiastical essential as for example the ashram  the site of the ashraṃ  monastery  the site of the monastery  cot  stool  bolster  pillow  copper cauldrum  bronze box  brass jar  bronze vessel  razor  axe  hatchet  spade or hoe  chisel  reed rope for binding building bamboo  muñja grass bulrush  grassreed earth  wooden property and torracotta ware 
O monks This is the fourth big thief in the world
O monks In the world including the divine world  among human beings along with divinebeings this thief who without his being and not having become actually lays his claim to the supramundane deed is the topmost big thief
 There worldly robbers steal or rob but worldly wealth paddygrain and so on
In the sāsana out of the said thieves the first steals mere such recluses requisites as robes etc even in conformity with that  the second the pariyatti dhamma  the third the brahmacariya of another monk The fourth the valuably important property which belongs to saṅgha  the fifth the wealth of mundane and supramundane good quality classified as jhāna  samādhi  samāpatti  magga and phala as well as worldly or mundane robes etc Which have become recluses requisites 
Accordingly Buddha said thusO monks The almsfood of the kingdom has been eaten by means of theft 
There in connection with that monk who is this fifth big thief the Blessed One said thusIn the world including the divine world is a thief
That monk indeed has been spoken of as topmost big thief owing to his stealing the mundane and supermundane wealth in this way according as Buddha said thusO monks In the world including the divine world  among human beings along with the divinebeings this monk in the topmost big thief in that he lays his claim to the uttarimanussadhamma which is abhūta therefore here also Buddha made manifest that monk by means of this allround hyperbolic limit thus Sabrahmake loke 
 Eso kho vasalā dhamo
here Kho is in the sense of avadhāraṇa  on that account this one even is vasalādhama 
the inferior  the last of all of outcastesl thus Buddha emphaseses
Why
Owing to the rainshower of theyyadhamma poured down on the site which is  as long as he does not release that paṭiññaṃ  till then he is subject to making himself not without being in outcaste as well
Ete kho vasalā
now those five of the first stanza which are kodhana  etc under the influence āsayavipatti  in other words after having made evilhypocrisy two types they are six one who is cruel to cretures is one in number by way of failure of payoga of the second stanza of the third stanza one in number is an oppressor of village and market town even under the influence of failure of exerting oneself  of the fourty stanza one in number by way of theyyāvahāra  of the fifth stanza one in number by way of deceiving debt  of the sixth stanza one in number is the panthadūsaka by way of taking off forcibly  of the seventh stanza one in number by way of kūṭa sakkhi  of the eighth stanza one in number by way mittadubbhi  of the tenth stanza one in number by way of insulting after having caused ruin  of the eleventh stanza one in number by way of deceiving the heart  of the twelveth stanza two in number by way of having covered concealingly an occupation work  of the thirteenth stanza one in number by way of not knowing what had been done for him of fraud  of the fifteenth stanza one in number by way of vexing  of the sixteenth stanza one in number by way of deception  of the seventeeth stanza two in number by way of extolling oneself and slighting others of the eighteenth stanza seven in number wrathfulness etc by way of failure of payoga and āsaya  of the nineteenth stanza two in number by way of paribhāsana  of the twentieth stanza one in number by way of topmost big thief  thus either thirty three or thirty four types or vasala have been spoken of in this way
In order to point them out Buddha said thusEte kho vasalā vuttā mayā ye te pakāsitā
Its meaning is Thise vasala  were previously spoken of by me briefly in this way asking you thus O brahmin Do you however know the vasala outcaste Indeed these are those which have been made minifest at length
In other words those which have been told by way of puggala  indeed these are made manifest by way of truth 
In other words indeed these vasala have been spoken of by way of kamma done by ariyas  not by way of jāti  those which have been made manifest by me is in the manner starting with kokhano upanāhī 
After having shown vasala in this way now since the brahmin was excessively attached to his own view  therefore in order to ward off that heresy Buddha spoke thus Na jaccā vasalo hoti
Its meaning is Indeed from the point of veiw of absolute sense one is not a vasala owing to birth  neither one is a brahmin owing to ones birth indeed nevertheless one is a vasala owing to kamma  one is a vasala owing to rainlike shower of allround impure kamma  One is a brāhmaṇa owing to carrying the allround impure by means of allround pure kamma 
In other words since you thought an inferior vasala to be a superior brāhmaṇa  therefore one is a vasala owing to inferior kamma  one is a brāhmaṇa owing to superior kamma  thus making the brahmin know the meaning in this way also the Blessed One said in this way
Now the Blessed One spoke three stanzas starting with Thdamonā pi jānātha in order to bring to a conclusion that very meaning by nidassana 
Out of those three stanzas two are of four feet and one is of six feet Their meaning is You should understand in this way also that context Na jaccā Vasalo hotietc and tadaminā pi jānātha yathā medaṃ nidassamaṃ which had been spoken of by me this is the nidassana by which manner and by which sāmañña of mine thus it is what has been stated
If asked what nidassanaṃ 
Caṇḍāla putto Sopāko  brabmalokūpapattiyā
 The son of a caṇḍāla is caṇḍālaputto
After having obtained dead dogs he cooks the same for the purpose of his own eating thus Sopāko
 Mātaṅgo is one who is named in this way Vissuto means clearly evident in this way owing to inferior birth as well as owing to livelihood 
 So means that Mātaṅga after having connected it with the previous pada  yasaṃ paramaṃ patto means having attained to what is extraordinary  most excellent  extremely eminent  famous  raputed and praised 
Yaṃ sudullabhaṃ connotse which is difficult to gain inspite of owing to having sprung up in an eminent family in this way extremely difficult to gain by having been born in an inferior family
In this way to one who has reached reputation as well āgacchuṃ tass upaṭṭhānaṃ khattiyā brāhmaṇā bahū for the purpose of attending upon that Mātaṇga the khattiyas and brahmins as well as many other people of commercial class and suddā etc who constitute the humanbeings of jambu island generally came for service thus is the meaning
 That Mātaṅga endowed with serving attendants in this way is virajaṃ owing to the condition of being devoid of the dust of depravity  mahāpathaṃ it is the great path owing to the condition of having been entered upon by great personages beginning with Buddha abhiruyha means after having specially ascended the conveyance of eight proper attainments of trance named the vehicle of the divine world owing to the condition of its ability to transport to the divine world reckoned as the brehmā world kāmarāgaṃ virāgaṃ virājetvā and on the disintegration of his body  brahmalokūpago ahu  though that birth of his is inferior  ma maṃ jāti nivāresi brahmalokūpapattiyā  owing to his being born in brahmaloka  thus it is what has been stated
 This meaning however should be understood thus It is said that long ago the great man  working for the welfare of living beings by this and that means sprang up in the family of an outcaste which lived cooking dogmeat 
He was known by the name of Mātaṅga since he was physically badlooking  he lived in a small leather hut  After having wandered about inside the town as a beggar for food he earned his livelihood
Then one day in that town when alcoholic festival was proclaimed alcoholics bemused themselves according as they were with their own retinue 
A certain daughter of an immensely wealthy brahmin also of the age of fifteen or sizteen according to indication  goodlooking physically resembling a devakaññā with pleasing demeanour  saying to herself I shall sport myself commensurate with my own family lineage  had the accumulation of such sporting outfits as starting with abundant hard food and soft food loaded on carts  ascended the vehicle yoked with all white coloured mares and proceeded to the garden ground surrounded by a large retinue she was known by the name of Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā
It is said that she did not desire to see the inauspiscious physically deformed individual  on that account there arose her appellation of her even as Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā
 At that time that Mātaṅga rose up even early put on his lower garment of rags  fastened at his hand a bronze gong held an earther sighted multitude of people even from afar he kept on beating his gong
At that juncture Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā was being led by her people who kept on removing despicable crowd of people ahead and in front sayingYou should run away you had better run away she sighted Mātaṅga at the centre of the citygate and asked thusWho is this
 He replied thusI am Mātaṅga a caṇdāla 
She said to herself thusAfter having seen one like this to those who have gone on from where can there be prosperity  and had her vehicle turned back 
People became angry sayingHindrance has been made by Mātaṅga for us to receive that hard food and soft food etc since we are eating them after having reached the garden They shouted you should seize caṅḍāla  hit him with clods of earth and saying to themselves He is dead seized him by his feet discarded him at a corner had him concealingly covered with garbage and went away
That Mātaṅga regained his sati  rose up and enquired of the people thusMy lords What is your opinion Is such a thing as a gate common to everyone or has the gate been made for brahmins only
 The people gave their answer thusThe gate is for the common use of everyone
 Mātaṅga said to himselfPeople of Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā made me who had been keeping myself going with food abtained by begging after having entered by the gate common to every one in this way and reach distresful destruction  kept an wandering about from one chariotroad to another after having given information to the mass of men and lay himself down at the door of the brahmins house saying to himself I shall not rise up without having gained Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā
 After having heard thusAt the door of the house Mātaṅga has kept himself lying downthe brahmin said thusGive him a kākaṇika and let him go after having had his limb smeared with oil 
Mātaṅga did not desire it and said thusI shall not rise up without having obtained Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā
 Consequent upon that the brahmin said thusGive him two kākaṇekas  let him eat a half a copper coin worth of cake and let him go after having smeared his limb with half a coppercoin worth of oil
 He did not desire it but insisted telling his requirement
After heard of it the brahmin gave orders up to one hundred saying thusGive him a māsaka  a pāda  half a gold coin and a gold coin  two and three
 He did not desire it but kept on telling even in that manner
Making his demand in this way even the sunset occurred
Then the bramin lady came down from her palatial mansion had a screen wall set up all round approached that Mātaṅga made her request thusDear son Mātaṅga Do condone the offence of Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā please accept a thousend thus she kept on saying until her offer to Māgaṅga reached a hundred thousand gold coins
That outcaste became silent but kept on lying down even
 When four or five days expired in this way young men of khattiya clan etc who could not get the hand of Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā after having offered plenty of presents had Mātaṅga informed close to his ear thusAfter having made exertion for many a year male men achieve their desired benefit  do not indeed be disappointed  definitely with the lapse of two or three days you will ger Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā
Having become silent Mātaṅga kept on lying down even
Then on the seventh day neighbours from all round rose up and said thusYou should either make Mātaṅga get up or give him the girl do not ruin all of us
It is said that this is their opinion  Together wih the house at the door of which a caṇḍāla who keeps himself lying down in this way dies the residents of the surrounding seven houses in each direction become caṇḍāla 
Consequent upon that the parents made the weeping Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā put on blue patchedup raiment of rags gave her a spoon  a pot  etcled her to his presence and gave her sayingYou should take the girl rise up and go
 She stood on his side and told him to rise up he replied thusYou should seize me by your hand and raise me up
She made him rise up
He sat down and said to her thusWe are not allowed to live in the city come lead me to my hidehut outside the town
She held him by his hand and led him there
Reciters of birthstories said thusPiṭṭhiyaṃ āropetvā after having made him ride her on her back
 After having led him as well she smeared his body woth oil had him bathed with warm water cooked ricegruel and gave him
He said to himselfLet not this brahmin girl get ruineddid not do even any jātisambheda  collected his strength to the extend of hald a month and told her thusIm going to the forest do not get disappointed  sayingHe takes too long  gave orders to the at home as well thusDo not have this young lady become neglected  took his departure fron his house renounced the world became an ascetic performed the preliminaries of kasiṇa  even within a few days made himself attain the eight samāpatti and five abhiññā as well said to himselfNow I shall become winner of the heart of Diṭṭhamaṅgalikāwent through the sky descended at the city gate and sent to Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā
 After having heard the message she went thinking thusI think some one a relative of mine a recluse having come to know of my misfortune must have come to see meafter having recognised him  fell herself down at his feet and said thusWhy have you made me to be without protection
 The great man replied thusO Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā Do not be unhappy  I shall carry out in such a way that all the residents of the whole island of Jambu will make their respectful offerings to you  He gave her this instruectionGo and make this proclamation My husband is mahābrahmā he is not a mātaṅga  he will come to my presence on the seventh day after having split open the mansion of the moon
 She said in reply thusVenerable Sir After having become the daughter of brahmaṇamahāsāla  I have reached the state of a caṇḍāla owing to my evil deed it is not possible for me to say in this way
The great men remarked thusYou do not know the ānubhāva of Mātaṅga After having said so according as she should come to believe in that manner he showed many a miracle and after having given her his orders in that manner even he went back to his own dwelling abode 
She did in that manner
 People grumbled and laughed making this remarkIndeed how can this one having reached the state of caṇḍāla owing to her own evil deed again will made her of the Great Brahmā
 She continued to be intent upon  roamed about the city proclaiming the same day after day thus On the sixth day fron this day he will come After fourth on the third tomorrow and to day he will come
After having heard her well confident words people said to themselvesSometimes it would be in this way alsohad pandals made at their respective housedoors set up a wall of screen  adorned their girls who had come of age and kept themselves seated looking up at the sky saying to themselvesWe shall give girls as charity
Then the great men on the fullmoon day when the moon had just come up the surface of the sky split open the mansion of the moon and while the massive multitude of men were looking on descended in the form of Mabābrahmā 
The multitude of men exaggeratingly imagined thusTwo moons have come into being
 Thereafter after having seen him come gradually the multitude came to a decision thusDiṭṭhamaṅgalikā spoke the truth in order to subdue this Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā he came previously in the guise of Mātaṅga 
In this way being seen by the massive multitude of men he descended down to the residence of Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā even
She on her part was at that time was having her mensturation 
he touched her navel with his thumb 
by means of that contact pregnancy come to be established
Thereafter after having told her thusPregnancy has well stood in you when the son has been born you should live depending upon himhe entered the mansion of the moon again while the massive multitude of men was looking on
 The brahmins said thusDiṭṭhamaṅgalikā is the consort of Mahābrahmā she has become our mother and came to her fron here and there
Owing to the trouble of multitude of men who were desirous of making respectful offering to her the gates of the city became congested 
They placed Diṭṭhamaṅgalikā on a heap of gold bathed her adorned her made her mount the chariot let her make the circumambulation of the city with enormous respect had a pandal built at the centre of the city placed her in that pandal at the spot where she could be seen saying The consort of Mahā brahmāand let her stay there thus Until we make a suitable residence for her till then let her stay on here even
In that pandal even she gave birth to her son
On a pure day they bathed her along with her son washed their heads also and gave the name Maṇḍabyakumāra to the baby boy sayingHe had been born in the pandal
Originating from that time the brahmins wandered about after having surrounded him sayingThe son of Mahābrahmā
 Thereafter there came to him presents of many a hundred thousand varieties Those brahmins became the guard of the young man Those who arrived did not receive the opportunity of seeing the young man swiftly 
 In due course the young man grew up and began to make charitable offering
He gave his charity to the brahmins only without giving to the destitutes and travellers who had well arrived at his charityhall
The Great man reflected over thusWhom does my son offer charity  He saw his son giving charity to brahmins only saying to himselfI shall manage in such a manner that he gives to every one He put on his upper robe took hold of his begging bowl came thuough the sky and stood at the housedoor of his son
After having seen him the young man became angry saying to himselfFrom where has this ugly looking vasala come  spoke this stanza
O you dirtily dressed  From where have you come You are clothed in rags  You are like a mudsprite 
at your neck you fasten a rag picked up from a rubbish heap  Look here  who are you who is not dakkhiṇeyya 
 The brahmins saying to themselvesYou should seize him you should capture him caught hold of him pounded him and made him reach miserable ruin 
He went through the sky and stood firmly outside the city
Devatā became angry seized the young man at his throat and placed him feet upwards and head downwards
With his eyes gone out with the oozing out of saliva from his month  inhaling his breath snoringly  suffered painful sensation
After having heard about it Diṭṭhamaṇgalikā enquired thusWas there any one who had come
 They replied thusYes a monk came
 She asked thusWhere has he gone
 They answered thusHe had gone in this way
 She went there and lay herself down on the ground at the base of his feet imploring thusVenerable Sir Kindly condone your own slave
 On that occasion the Great Man had wandered about for almsfood received ricegruel and was seated drinking that ricegruel He gave to Diṭṭhamaṇgalikā a small quantity of ricegruel which was left over with this instrution
You should go mix this ricegruel in a jar of water and sprinkle this stirred up ricegruel water in the eyes mouths ears and nose which have become ābila  of thoes people who have bhūtavikāra 
She did in that manner
Consequent upon that when the young man had become normal in body  Diṭṭhamaṇgalikā said thusMy dear son Maṇḍabya Do come let us all the brahmins lie down facedownwards at the base of the feet of that husband of hers and tender their apology to get themselves condoned
 He gave his advice thus Charitable offering should be given to all humanbeings  Did the teaching of the truth  went back to his own residential region and thought thusDiṭṭhamaṇgalikā obviously popular among young ladies had been tamed  the distinctly wellknown Maṇdabya among the male people had been subhued now who is he who should be tamed
 Consequent upon that he sighted an ascetic jātimanta dwelling on the bank of the river kumbhavatī depending upon the city of Bandhumatī
He said to himself thusI am eminent by birth  I am not going to drink the water allround consumed by othersthus he dwelt at the upper reaches of the river 
The Great Man took up his residence near the river upstream above him  at the time when he made an allround use of the riverwater the Great Man chewed his toothstick and threw the same down the river water
the ascetic on seeing that toothbrush floating down stream on the river went uppstream met the Great Man and saked thus Who is he here
 The reply wasO teacher I am a caṇḍāla Mātaṅga
The ascetic instructed thusO Caṇḍāla  Take your departure from here do not stay on the shore of the upper reaches of the river
 The Great Man saying responsively Very well O teacher took up his residence on the bank of the lower reaches of the river against the rivercurrent also his toothpick reached the presence of the ascetic
The ascetic went again and said thus O Caṇḍāla  Do take your departure you should stay on the shore of the upper reaches of the river even
The Great Man in compliance said thusVery well O teacher and did likewise again also there turned out to be but in that manner
The ascetic again also saying to himself He is doing in that mannergot offended and cursed the Great Man thusMay his head be splitted up into seven slices at the time of the rising of the sun
 Mahāpurisa also said thus Very well O teacher I however am not allowing the sun to rise 
Consequent upon that the night did not come into an end to become daybreak  Having become afraid the citizens of Bandhumatī went to the presence of the ascetic ahd made their enquires thusO teacher Is there indeed our safety 
 Indeed they thought that ascetic to be an Arahant
That ascetic gave intimation to them about everything
They approched Mahāpurisa and made their request thusVenerable Sir Kindly release the sun
 Mahāpurise replied thusIf your Arahant comes and apologises me I shall make the release 
 The multitude of men went and told the ascetic thusVenerable Sir Do come and apologise the wise Mātaṇga do not make us perish on account your quarrel 
 That ascetic replied thus I am not going to apologise the caṇḍāla 
The multitude of men saying to themselves You make us ruin seized that ascetic by his hands and legs and led him to the presence of Mahāpurisa
The Great Man said thusI an going to condone him when he tenders his aplolgy after having lain down on his belly at the base of my feet
 The multitude of men told the ascetic thus You should do in this way
The ascetic persisted thus I am not paying my homage to the caṇḍāla 
The multitude of men saying to the asceticYou will not pay your homage voluntarily  caught hold of him by his hands legs beard and neck etc and made him lie down at the base of the feet of Mahāpurisa
who said thus I condone this one all the same out of compassion for him I am not releasing the sun indeed the mere moment the sun has risen his head will split into seven slices
 The people enquired thus Venerable Sir What should be done now
 Mahāpurisa replied thus Well then sink him into the riverwater neckdeep and you should concealingly cover his head with a lump of earth touched by the rays of the sun the lump of earth will split into seven slices
when it had been splitted let this one go elsewhere
They held the hermit by his hands and legs etc and did in that manner
When the sun had just been barely released  the lump of earth split into seven slices and fell The hermit fled with fear 
After having seen  The multitude of men remarked saying O friends You should see the ānubhāva of the monk  After having made the throwing of the toothbrush the beginning they told everything at length and became pleased with him saying There does not exist any monk resembling this
Beginning thereafter in the entire island of Jambu khattiya and brahmins etc lay people and monks went to attend upon the wise Mātaṅga
He lived as long as his lifespan lasted and on the dissolution of his body rose up in the brehmā world
On that account the Blessed One said thusYou should understand it by means of this  for spontaneous springing up in the brahmā world 
Thus have I heard the Sammaditthi Sutta
Herein all such questions spoken by the Elder as  One of right view one of right view is said friends In what way is a noble disciple one of right view   or And what friends is the unwholesome    these are questions showing a desire to expound
Herein since those who know those who do not know those outside the Dispensation those within it those who speak by hearsay etc and those who speak by personal knowledge say one of right view therefore taking it as an expression to the many he touched upon it twice saying One of right view one of right view is said friends 
The intention here is this Others say one of right view and still others say one of right view  Since that is said in what way friends is a noble disciple one of right view in respect of meaning and characteristic
Herein one of right view is one possessing a lucid and praiseworthy view 
But when this word right view is used to signify a state  it then means a lucid and praiseworthy view
This right view is twofold mundane and supramundane 
Herein the knowledge of kamma as ones own and knowledge which is in conformity with the Truths are mundane right view or in brief all understanding that is accompanied by the taints
Understanding connected with the noble paths and fruits is supramundane right view
The person possessing right view is of three kinds the worldling  the disciple in higher training  and the one beyond training 
Herein the worldling is of two kinds one outside the Dispensation and one within the Dispensation
Herein one outside the Dispensation who believes in kamma is one of right view on account of the view of kamma as ones own but not on account of that which is in conformity with the truths because he holds to the view of self
One within the Dispensation is of right view on account of both
The disciple in higher training is one of right view on account of fixed right view
the one beyond training on account of that is beyond training
But here one of right view is intended as one possessing supramundane wholesome right view which is fixed in destiny and emancipating
Hence he said whose view is straight who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma  Because of its going straight without deviating to either extreme or because of its going straight by removing all crookedness such as bodily crookedness etc supramundane right view is straight  One possessing that view also possesses perfect confidence unshakable confidence in the ninefold supramundane Dhamma And by becoming disentangled from all the thickets of views by abandoning all the defilements by departing from the round of rebirths by bringing the practice to its consummation he is said to have come by the noble path to this true Dhamma proclaimed by the Enlightened One that is Nibbana the plunge into the Deathless
The Wholesome and the Unwholesome  Understands the unwholesome  he understands the unwholesome called the ten courses of unwholesome kamma  penetrating this by way of function with the understanding that has Nibbana as its object as This is suffering
 the root of the unwholesome  And he understands the unwholesome root which has become the root condition of that  penetrating this in the same way as This is the origin of suffering
The same method applies here also in regard to the wholesome and the root of the wholesome
And as it is here so in all the following sections the understanding of the subject should be understood by way of function
In that way  by this much by this understanding of the unwholesome etc
He is one of right view  he possesses supramundane right view of the kind aforesaid
Whose view is straight and has arrived at this true Dhamma At this point the summary version of the teaching has been expounded
And this the teaching itself was brief but for those bhikkhus it should be understood that the penetration through right attention occurred in detail
But in the second section it should be understood that the teaching too as well as the penetration through attention is stated in detail
Herein the bhikkhus at the council at the Great Monastery held to rehearse the Pitakas said In the brief exposition the two lower paths are discussed in the detailed exposition the two higher paths taking into account the passage at the end of the sections setting forth the detailed exposition that begins he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust
But the Elder said In the brief exposition the four paths are expounded as a group and also in the detailed exposition 
This query into the brief and detailed expositions which has been cleared up here should be understood in all the following sections in the way stated here
From here on we shall only comment on terms that are new or obscure
Herein firstly in the detailed exposition of the first section as regards the passage beginning killing living beings is unwholesome  unwholesome should be understood by way of the occurrence of unwholesomeness or as what is opposed to the wholesome which is to be dealt with below 
As to characteristic it is blameworthy and has painful result or it is defiled
This in the first place is the comment upon the general terms here
But as regards the particular terms the phrase killing living beings means the slaughter of a living being the destruction of a living being
And here a living being is according to ordinary usage a being  in the ultimate sense it is the life faculty
Killing living beings is the volition to kill on the part of one who is aware in respect of a living being that it is a living being and which  manifesting itself through one or the other of the doors of body and speech initiates activity resulting in the cutting off of the life faculty
In relation to beings such as animals etc which lack moral qualities  it is less blameworthy in respect of small living beings and more blameworthy in respect of beings with large bodies
Why
Because of the magnitude of the effort involved
And when the effort involved is equal because of the magnitude of the object 
In relation to beings such as humans etc who possess moral qualities it is less blameworthy in respect of beings with few good qualities and more blameworthy in respect of beings with great qualities
When the size of the body and moral qualities are equal however it is less blameworthy when the defilements and activity are mild and more blameworthy when they are strong so it should be understood
There are five constituents for this  a living being awareness that it is a living being the mind to kill activity and the death thereby
There are six means ones own person command a missile a fixed contrivance a magical spell supernormal power
To explore this matter in detail however would involve too much diffuseness Therefore we shall not explore it in detail or any other subject similar in kind
Those who wish to go into the matter may do so by looking it up in the Samantapasadika the Vinaya Commentary
Taking what is not given  the carrying off of others goods stealing robbery is what is meant
Herein what is not given is anothers possession which the other may use as he likes without incurring penalty or blame
Taking what is not given is the volition to steal on the part of one who is aware in respect of anothers possession that it is anothers possession and which initiates activity resulting in the taking of that thing
That is less blameworthy when the others property is of low value and more blameworthy when it is of high value
Why
Because of the high value of the object 
When the value of the objects is equal the act is more blameworthy when the object belongs to one of outstanding qualities
and less blameworthy when the object belongs to one who in comparison is inferior with respect to moral qualities
There are five constituents of this act anothers possession awareness that it is anothers possession the mind to steal the activity and the carrying off thereby
There are six means ones own person etc 
And these may be classed according to the way in which they occur by way of the following taking by theft by force by concealment by stratagem by fraud This here is in brief
the details however are given in the Samantapasadika
Misconduct in sensual pleasures  here in sensual pleasures means in regard to sexual intercourse
Misconduct is entirely reprehensible vile conduct
As to characteristic sexual misconduct is the volition to transgress bounds occurring through the body door by way of unrighteous intent
Herein out of bounds for men firstly are the twenty kinds of women that is the ten beginning with those protected by the mother namely protected by the mother protected by the father protected by the mother and father protected by the brother protected by the sister protected by relatives protected by the clan protected by the law under protection entailing a penalty and the ten beginning with those purchased with money namely one purchased with money one who lives by her own desire one who lives on account of wealth one who lives on account of cloth one who is given dipping the hand in water one who has been relieved of her burdencarrying headpad one who is a slave and a wife one who is a servant and a wife one who is carried off in a raid one engaged at so much a time 
Then as concerns women for the twelve kinds of women consisting of the two namely under protection and entailing a penalty and the ten beginning with those purchased with money other men are out of bounds
This sexual misconduct is less blameworthy when out of bounds is without good qualities such as virtue etc and more blameworthy when possesses good qualities such as virtue etc
There are four constituents of this act an object which is out of bounds the mind to engage in that the effort to engage and consent to the union of sexual organs
The means is single ones own person
False speech  false is the verbal effort or bodily effort for destroying welfare by one bent on deceiving
False speech is the volition initiating the verbal effort or bodily effort of deceiving another on the part of one intent on deceiving
According to another method false means an unreal untrue case
speech the communication of that as being real true
As to characteristic false speech is the volition of one desiring to communicate to another an untrue case as being true which initiates such an act of communication
This is less blameworthy when the welfare destroyed is slight and more blameworthy when the welfare destroyed is great
Further when it occurs on the part of householders who not wishing to give away some belonging of theirs say I do not have it it is less blameworthy when one who is a witness speaks for the purpose of destroying anothers welfare it is more blameworthy
In the case of those gone forth when it occurs by their saying as a joke after they have obtained just a little oil or ghee in the manner of the Puranas Today the oil is flowing in the village just like a river then it is less blameworthy but for those who speak saying that they have seen what they have not seen it is more blameworthy
There are four constituents of this act an untrue case the mind to deceive the appropriate effort the communicating of that meaning to another
The means is single ones own person only
That is to be regarded as the performing of the action of deceiving another by means of the body or by means of something attached to the body or by means of speech
If through that action the other understands that meaning one is bound by the kamma of false speech at the very moment of the volition initiating the action
Malicious speech etc The kind of speech that creates in the heart of the person to whom it is spoken affection for oneself and voidness for another is malicious speech 
The kind of speech by which one makes both oneself and another harsh the kind of speech which is also itself harsh being pleasant neither to the ear nor to the heart  that is harsh speech 
That by which one gossips idly without meaning is gossip 
Also the volition that is the root cause of these gains the name malicious speech etc And that only is intended here
Therein malicious speech is the volition of one with a defiled mind which initiates an effort by body or by speech either to cause division among others or to endear oneself 
It is less blameworthy when the person divided has few good qualities and more blameworthy when such a one has great qualities
Its constituents are four another person to be divided the intention to divide Thus these will be separated and split or the desire to endear oneself Thus I shall become loved and intimate the appropriate effort the communicating of that meaning to that person
Harsh speech is the entirely harsh volition initiating an effort by body or by speech to wound anothers vital feelings
This is an example given for the purpose of making it clear A village boy it is said went to the forest without heeding his mothers words Unable to make him turn back she scolded him angrily saying May a wild buffalo chase you
Then a buffalo appeared before him right there in the forest
The boy made an asseveration of truth saying Let it not be as my mother said but as she thought
The buffalo stood as though tied there
Thus although the means was that of wounding the vital feelings because of the gentleness of her mind it was not harsh speech
For sometimes parents even say to their children May robbers chop you to pieces yet they do not even wish a lotus leaf to fall upon them
And teachers and preceptors sometimes say to their pupils What is the use of these shameless and heedless brats Drive them out
yet they wish for their success in learning and attainment
Just as through gentleness of mind speech is not harsh so through gentleness of speech speech does not become unharsh
for the words Let him sleep in peace spoken by one wishing to kill are not unharsh speech
But harsh speech is such on account of harshness of mind only
It is less blameworthy when the person to whom it is spoken has few good qualities and more blameworthy when such a one has great qualities
Its constituents are three another to be abused an angry mind the abusing
Gossip is the unwholesome volition initiating an effort by body or by speech to communicate what is purposeless
It is less blameworthy when indulged in mildly and more blameworthy when indulged in strongly
Its constituents are two the being intent on purposeless stories such as the Bharata war or the abduction of Sita etc and the telling of such stories
Covetousness  It covets thus it is covetousness having become directed towards others goods it occurs through inclination towards them is the meaning
It has the characteristic of coveting others goods thus Oh that this were mine
It is less blameworthy and more blameworthy as in the case of taking what is not given
Its constituents are two anothers goods and the inclination for them to be ones own
For even though greed has arisen based on anothers goods it is not classed as a course of kamma so long as one does not incline to them as ones own  Oh that this were mine
Ill will  It injures welfare and happiness thus it is ill will 
Its characteristic is the mental defect the destruction of others It is less blameworthy and more blameworthy as in the case of harsh speech
Its constituents are two another being and the wish for that beings destruction
For even though anger has arisen based on another being there is no breach of a course of kamma so long as one does not wish Oh that this being might be cut off and destroyed
Wrong view  It sees wrongly due to the absence of a correct grasp of things thus it is wrong view
Its characteristic is the mistaken view that there is no giving etc
It is less blameworthy and more blameworthy as in the case of gossip
Moreover it is less blameworthy when not fixed in destiny and more blameworthy when fixed
Its constituents are two a mistaken manner of grasping the basis  and the appearance of that in accordance with the manner in which it has been grasped
Now the exposition of these ten courses of unwholesome kamma should be understood in five ways as to mental state  as to category  as to object  as to feeling  and as to root 
Herein as to mental state The first seven among these are volitional states only The three beginning with covetousness are associated with volition
As to category The eight consisting of the first seven and wrong view are courses of kamma only not roots
Covetousness and ill will are courses of kamma and also roots
for covetousness having arrived at the a root is the unwholesome root greed
and ill will is the unwholesome root hate
As to object Killing living beings because it has the life faculty as object has a formation as object
Taking what is not given has beings as object or formations as object
Misconduct in sensual pleasures has formations as object by way of tangible object
but some say it also has beings as object
False speech has beings or formations as object
likewise malicious speech
Harsh speech has only beings as object
Gossip has either beings or formations as object by way of the seen heard sensed and cognized likewise covetousness
Ill will has only beings as object
Wrong view has formations as object by way of the states belonging to the three planes 
As to feeling Killing living beings has painful feeling
for although kings seeing a robber say laughingly Go and execute him their volition consummating the action is associated only with pain
Taking what is not given has three feelings
Misconduct has two feelings pleasant and neutral but in the mind which consummates the action there is no neutral feeling
False speech has three feelings likewise malicious speech
Harsh speech has painful feeling only
Gossip has three feelings
Covetousness has two feelings pleasant and neutral likewise wrong view
Ill will has painful feeling only
As to root Killing living beings has two roots by way of hate and delusion
taking what is not given by way of hate and delusion or by way of greed and delusion
misconduct by way of greed and delusion
false speech by way of hate and delusion or by way of greed and delusion likewise for malicious speech and gossip
harsh speech by way of hate and delusion
Covetousness has one root by way of delusion likewise ill will
Wrong view has two roots by way of greed and delusion
The Unwholesome Roots  Greed is a root of the unwholesome etc It is greedy thus it is greed 
it offends against  thus it is hate 
it deludes thus it is delusion 
Among these greed is itself unwholesome in the sense that it is blameworthy and has painful results and it is a root of these unwholesome beginning with killing living beings for some in the sense that it is an associated originative cause for some in the sense that it is a decisive support condition Thus it is an unwholesome root
This too is said One who is lustful friends overwhelmed and with mind obsessed by lust kills a living being 
The same method applies to the state of being unwholesome roots in the cases of hate and delusion
Abstention from killing living beings is wholesome  etc Here killing living beings etc have the same meaning as aforesaid
It crushes the hostile thus it is abstention  the meaning is that it abandons the hostile
Or with that as the instrument one abstains  the syllable ve being substituted for the syllable vi
This here is in the first place the commentary on the phrasing
But as to the meaning abstention is refraining associated with wholesome consciousness
What is stated thus For one refraining from killing living beings that which is on that occasion the leaving off the refraining  that is the refraining associated with wholesome consciousness As to kind it is threefold refraining in the presence of opportunity refraining because of an undertaking and refraining because of eradication 
Herein refraining in the presence of an opportunity is to be understood as the refraining which occurs in those who have not undertaken any training rule but who do not transgress when an opportunity for doing so presents itself because they reflect upon their birth age learning etc like the lay follower Cakkana in the island of Sri Lanka
When he was a boy it is said his mother developed an illness
and the doctor said Fresh hares flesh is needed
Then Cakkanas brother sent him saying Go dear and hunt in the field
He went there
On that occasion a hare had come to eat the young corn On seeing him it bolted swiftly but it got entangled in a creeper and squealed kiri kiri
Guided by the sound Cakkana went and caught it thinking I will make medicine for my mother
Then he thought again This is not proper for me that I should deprive another of life for the sake of my mothers life
So he released it saying Go and enjoy the grass and the water with the other hares in the forest
When his brother asked him Did you get a hare dear  he told him what had happened
His brother scolded him
He went to his mother and determined upon an asseveration of truth Since I was born I am not aware that I have ever intentionally deprived a living being of life
Straightaway his mother became well
Refraining because of an undertaking is to be understood as the refraining which occurs in those who do not transgress in a particular case because they have undertaken training rules giving up even their own lives in the undertaking of the training rules and in what is superior to that like the lay follower who dwelt at Uttaravaddhamana Mountain
It is said that after undertaking the training rules from the Elder Pingala Buddharakkhita who lived in the Ambariya Monastery he was plowing a field
Then his ox got lost Searching for it he climbed up Uttaravaddhamana Mountain There a large serpent seized him
He thought Let me cut off his head with this sharp axe
Then he thought again This is not proper for me that I should break a training rule that I have undertaken in the presence of my honored teacher
Thinking up to the third time I will give up my life but not the training rule he threw the sharp hand axe that was slung on his shoulder into the forest
Straightaway the creature released him and went away
Refraining because of eradication  is to be understood as the refraining associated with the noble path
After the arising of this even the thought I will kill a living being does not occur to the noble persons
This refraining is called wholesome because of the occurrence of wholesomeness 
or because of shedding the vile  Also evil conduct is commonly called weeds and it mows this down  thus it is called wholesome
As in the case of the unwholesome so for these courses of wholesome kamma the exposition should be understood in five ways as to mental state as to category as to object as to feeling and as to root
Herein as to mental state The first seven among these can be both volitions and abstinences
the last three are associated with volition only
As to category The first seven are courses of kamma only not roots
The last three are courses of kamma and also roots
For noncovetousness having arrived at the a root is the wholesome root nongreed
nonill will is the wholesome root nonhate
and right view is the wholesome root nondelusion
As to object The objects of these are the same as the objects of killing living beings etc For abstention is spoken of in relation to something which can be transgressed
But just as the noble path which has Nibbana as object abandons the defilements so too should these courses of kamma which have the life faculty etc as object be understood to abandon the kinds of evil conduct beginning with killing living beings
As to feeling All have pleasant feeling or neutral feeling
For there is no painful feeling which arrives at the wholesome
As to root The first seven courses of kamma have three roots by way of nongreed nonhate and nondelusion in one who abstains by means of consciousness associated with knowledge
They have two roots in one who abstains by means of consciousness dissociated from knowledge
Noncovetousness has two roots in one who abstains by means of consciousness associated with knowledge one root by means of consciousness dissociated from knowledge
Nongreed however is not by itself its own root
The same method applies in the case of nonill will
Right view always has two roots by way of nongreed and nonhate
The Wholesome Roots  Nongreed is a root of the wholesome  etc Nongreed is not greed this is a term for the state that is opposed to greed
The same method applies in the case of nonhate and nondelusion
Among these nongreed is itself wholesome and it is a root of these wholesome beginning with abstention from killing living beings for some in the sense that it is an associated originative cause and for some in the sense that it is a decisive support condition Thus it is a wholesome root
The same method applies to the state of being wholesome roots in the cases of nonhate and nondelusion
Conclusion on the Unwholesome and the Wholesome  Now summing up the meaning of all that has been set forth in brief and in detail he states the concluding section beginning with the words when a noble disciple
Herein has thus understood the wholesome means has thus understood the unwholesome by way of the ten courses of unwholesome kamma as described
The same method applies in the case of the root of the unwholesome etc
Up to this point by a single method emancipation as far as arahantship has been expounded for one who has the Four Noble Truths as his meditation subject
How
Here the ten courses of unwholesome kamma with the exception of covetousness and the courses of wholesome kamma are the truth of suffering
These two states  covetousness and the greed which is a root of the unwholesome  are literally speaking the truth of the origin
Speaking figuratively however all the courses of kamma are the truth of suffering
and all the wholesome and unwholesome roots are the truth of the origin
The nonoccurrence of both is the truth of cessation
The noble path fully understanding suffering abandoning its origin and understanding its cessation is the truth of the path Thus two truths are stated in their own nature and two are to be understood by way of the guideline of conversion
He entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust  Understanding thus the unwholesome etc he abandons in all ways the underlying tendency to lust
He abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion  and he removes in all ways too the underlying tendency to aversion is what is meant
Up to this point the path of nonreturn is stated
He extirpates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit I am  he extricates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit which occurs in the mode of grasping the five aggregates as a group I am due to failure to distinguish any state among them
Therein by the phrase the underlying tendency to the view and conceit I am what is meant is the underlying tendency to conceit which is similar to a view 
For this underlying tendency to conceit is similar to a view because it occurs I am therefore it is stated thus
And one who wishes to understand this conceit I am in detail should look up the Khemaka Sutta in the Khandhiyavagga 
By abandoning ignorance  having abandoned ignorance the root of the round 
And arousing true knowledge  having aroused the true knowledge of the path of arahantship which completely extricates that ignorance
At this point the path of arahantship is stated
He here and now makes an end of suffering  in this very existence he becomes one who cuts off the suffering of the round
In that way too  he marks off the teaching by way of the attention and penetration stated in this exposition of the courses of kamma is what is meant
The rest is as aforesaid
Thus he concludes the exposition by means of the path of nonreturn and the path of arahantship
Saying Good friend     and has arrived at this true Dhamma Thus having heard the Venerable Sariputtas exposition of the four truths under the heading of the wholesome and the unwholesome the bhikkhus delighted in his words with the statement Good friend and rejoiced with the mind that aroused that statement what is meant is that they agreed by word and approved by mind
Now because the Elder was competent to give an exposition on the four truths in diverse ways  as said Bhikkhus Sariputta is able to propound to teach the Four Noble Truths in detail  or because he had said in that way too being desirous of giving a further exposition the bhikkhus being desirous of hearing the teaching of the four truths by another method asked him a further question
By asking But friend might there be another way Would there be another case  they asked another question additional to that question asked and answered by the Venerable Sariputta himself Or what is meant is that they asked a question subsequent to the previous one
Then answering them the Elder said There might be friends and so on
Herein this is the elucidation of the terms that are not clear Nutriment is a condition 
For a condition nourishes its own fruit therefore it is called nutriment
Of beings that already have come to be  etc Here come to be means come to birth reborn
seeking a new existence means those who seek search for existence birth production
Therein among the four kinds of generation beings born from eggs and from the womb are said to be seeking a new existence as long as they have not broken out of the eggshell or the placenta
When they have broken out of the eggshell or the placenta and emerged outside they are said to have come to be
The moistureborn and the spontaneously born are said to be seeking a new existence at the first moment of consciousness
from the second moment of consciousness onwards they are said to have come to be
Or alternatively come to be is born reproduced this is a term for those who have destroyed the cankers  who are reckoned thus They have come to be only but they will not come to be again
Seeking a new existence means they seek a new existence
this is a term for worldlings and disciples in higher training who seek a new existence in the future too because they have not abandoned the fetter of being
Thus by these two terms he includes all beings in all ways
For the maintenance  for the purpose of maintaining
For the support  for the purpose of supporting for the purpose of helping
This is merely a difference of words but the meaning of the two terms is one only
Or alternatively for the maintenance is for the noninterruption of this or that being by means of the serial connection of arisen states
For the support is for the arising of unarisen 
And both these expressions should be regarded as applicable in both cases thus
For the maintenance and support of those that have come to be and for the maintenance and support of those seeking a new existence
The Four Kinds of Nutriment Physical food as nutriment  is nutriment that can be swallowed after making it into a ball this is a term for the nutritive essence which has as its basis boiled rice junket etc
Gross or subtle  it is gross because of the grossness of the basis and subtle because of the subtlety of the basis
But because physical nutriment is included in subtle materiality by way of its individual essence it is subtle only
And also that grossness and subtlety should be understood relatively in respect of the basis
The nutriment of peacocks is subtle compared with the nutriment of crocodiles
Crocodiles they say swallow stones 
and these dissolve on reaching their stomachs
Peacocks eat such animals as snakes scorpions etc
But the nutriment of hyenas is subtle compared with the nutriment of peacocks 
These they say eat horns and bones thrown away three years before
and these become soft as yams as soon as they are moistened with their saliva
Also the nutriment of elephants is subtle compared with the nutriment of hyenas
For these eat the branches of various trees etc
The nutriment of the gayal buffalo the antelope the deer etc is subtler than the nutriment of elephants
These they say eat the sapless leaves of various kinds of trees etc
The nutriment of cows is subtler than their nutriment
they eat fresh and dried grass
The nutriment of hares is subtler than their nutriment
that of birds is subtler than that of hares
that of barbarians is subtler than that of birds
that of village headmen is subtler than that of barbarians
that of kings and kings ministers is subtler than village headmens
that of a Wheelturning Monarch is subtler than their nutriment
The earth deities nutriment is subtler than that of a Wheelturning Monarch
The nutriment of the deities of the Four Great Kings is subtler than that of the earth deities
Thus nutriment should be elaborated up to that of the deities who wield power over others creations But saying Their nutriment is subtle the end is reached
And here in a basis that is gross the nutritive essence is limited and weak in one that is subtle it is strong
Thus one who has drunk even a full bowl of gruel is soon hungry again and desirous of eating anything
but after drinking even a small amount of ghee he will not want to eat for the whole day
Therein it is the basis that dispels fatigue but it is unable to preserve
but the nutritive essence preserves though it cannot dispel fatigue
But when the two are combined they both dispel fatigue and preserve
Contact as the second  The sixfold contact beginning with eyecontact
should be understood as the second of these four kinds of nutriment
And this is the method of the teaching itself
therefore it should not be inquired into here saying For this reason it is the second or the third
Mental volition  volition itself is stated
Consciousness  any kind of consciousness whatever
It may be asked here If the meaning of condition is the meaning of nutriment then when other conditions also exist for beings why are only these four stated
It should be said in reply It is because they are the special conditions for personal continuity
For physical nutriment is the special condition for the material body of beings that eat physical nutriment
as regards the group of mental constituents contact is for feeling mental volition for consciousness and consciousness for mentalitymateriality
As it is said
Just as bhikkhus this body has nutriment for its maintenance is maintained in dependence on nutriment and without nutriment is not maintained 
and likewise With contact as condition feeling with formations as condition consciousness  with consciousness as condition mentalitymateriality 
What is this nutriment and what does it nourish
Physical nutriment nourishes the materiality with nutritive essence as eighth
contact as nutriment nourishes the three feelings mental volition as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of being consciousness as nutriment nourishes the mentalitymateriality of rebirthlinking
How
As soon as it is placed in the mouth physical food as nutriment brings into being the eight kinds of materiality 
Then each lump of cooked rice ground by the teeth on being swallowed brings into being unit after unit of the eight kinds of materiality
Thus it nourishes the materiality with nutritive essence as eighth
But with contact as nutriment when contact productive of pleasant feeling arises it nourishes pleasant feeling contact productive of painful feeling nourishes painful feeling contact productive of neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling nourishes neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling Thus in all ways contact as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of feeling
In the case of mental volition as nutriment kamma leading to sensesphere being nourishes sensesphere being kamma leading to finematerial and immaterial being nourishes its respective kind of being
Thus in all ways mental volition as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of being
But with consciousness as nutriment it is said that it nourishes by way of conascence condition etc the three aggregates associated with itself at the moment of rebirthlinking and the thirty kinds of materiality that arise by way of triple continuity
Thus consciousness nourishes the mentalitymateriality of rebirthlinking
And here by the words mental volition as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of being only the wholesome and unwholesome volition accompanied by taints is meant
by the words consciousness nourishes the mentalitymateriality of rebirthlinking only rebirthlinking consciousness is meant
However these are to be understood indiscriminately as nutriments as well because they nourish the states that are associated with them and originated by them
The Four Functions As regards these four kinds of nutriment physical food as nutriment accomplishes the function of nutriment by sustaining
contact by contacting  mental volition by accumulating
consciousness by cognizing
How
Physical food as nutriment by sustaining is for the maintenance of beings by maintaining the body
For this body though generated by kamma is sustained by physical food and stands for ten years or a hundred years up to the end of the lifespan
Like what
Like a child which though given birth by the mother is nurtured by the milk etc given to him to drink by the wetnurse and thus lives long Also as a house is supported by a prop
This too has been said 
Great king just as when a house is collapsing they prop it up with other timber and that house being propped up by other timber does not collapse so too this body is supported by nutriment persists in dependence upon nutriment
Thus physical food as nutriment accomplishes the function of nutriment by sustaining
Accomplishing it thus physical food as nutriment becomes a condition for two material continuities namely for that originated by nutriment and that kammically acquired
It is a condition for the kammaborn materiality by becoming its preserver
It is a condition for that originated by nutriment by becoming its producer
Then contact by contacting the object which is the basis for pleasure etc is for the maintenance of beings by causing the occurrence of pleasant feeling etc
Mental volition accumulating by way of wholesome and unwholesome kamma is for the maintenance of beings because it provides the root of existence
Consciousness by cognizing is for the maintenance of beings by causing the occurrence of mentalitymateriality
The Four Dangers Now while these are accomplishing their function of nutriment by sustaining etc four dangers are to be seen
the danger of desire in the case of physical food as nutriment the danger of approach in the case of contact of accumulating in the case of mental volition and of launching into a new existence here or there by way of taking rebirthlinking in the case of consciousness
What are the reasons 
Because having aroused desire for physical food beings face cold etc to undertake such work as checking accounting etc and incur not a little suffering
And some who have gone forth in this dispensation seek nutriment through such improper means as the practice of medicine etc and they are to be censured here and now
and hereafter they become recluse ghosts in the manner described thus in the Lakkhana Samyutta And his outer robe was burning blazing etc
For this reason desire itself is to be understood as the danger in physical food as nutriment
Those who approach contact who find gratification in contact commit crimes in respect of others guarded and protected belongings such as their wives etc
When the owners of the goods catch them with their belongings they cut them into pieces or throw them onto a rubbish heap
or hand them over to the king
and then the king has various tortures inflicted upon them
And with the breakup of the body after death a bad destination is to be expected for them
Thus this entire danger  that pertaining to the here and now and that pertaining to the afterlife  has come about rooted in contact
For this reason approach is to be understood as the danger in the case of the nutriment contact
The entire danger in the three realms of existence has come about by the accumulation of wholesome and unwholesome kamma and is rooted in that 
For this reason accumulation is to be understood as the danger in the nutriment mental volition
And in whatever place rebirthlinking consciousness launches  in that same place it is reborn by seizing the rebirthlinking mentalitymateriality When it is produced all dangers are produced for they are all rooted in it For this reason launching is to be understood as the danger in the nutriment consciousness
The Four Similes In regard to these nutriments with their dangers for the sake of eliminating desire for the nutriment physical food the Fully Enlightened One taught the simile of sons flesh in the passage beginning thus Suppose bhikkhus a couple a man and his wife  
For the sake of eliminating desire for the nutriment contact he taught the simile of the flayed cow in the passage beginning thus Suppose bhikkhus there was a flayed cow
For the sake of eliminating desire for the nutriment mental volition he taught the simile of the charcoal pit in the passage beginning thus Suppose bhikkhus there was a charcoal pit 
And for the sake of eliminating desire for the nutriment consciousness he taught the simile of the man struck with three hundred spears in the passage beginning thus Suppose bhikkhus there was a thief a crook  
Therein taking the essential meaning there follows a brief interpretation of the meaning A couple it is said a man and his wife took their son and set out on a desert trail a hundred yojanas long with only limited provisions
When they had gone fifty yojanas their provisions ran out
Exhausted by hunger and thirst they sat down in some scanty shade
Then the man said to his wife My dear for fifty yojanas on all sides there is neither a village nor a town Therefore though a man can do many kinds of work such as plowing guarding cattle etc it is not possible for me to do that Come kill me Eat half of my flesh and having made the other half into provisions for the journey cross out of the desert together with our son 
The wife said Dear husband though a woman can do many kinds of work such as spinning thread etc it is not possible for me to do that Come kill me Eat half of my flesh and having made the other half into provisions for the journey cross out of the desert together with our son 
Then the man said My dear the death of the mother would mean the death of two
for a young boy cannot live without his mother
But if we both live then we can beget another child again Come now let us kill our child take his flesh and cross out of this desert 
Then the mother said to the son Dear go to your father
He went
but the father said For the sake of supporting this child I incurred much suffering through such work as plowing guarding cattle etc I cannot kill the boy You kill your son  Then he said Dear go to your mother
He went 
But the mother said Longing for a son I incurred much suffering by observing the cowobservance the dogobservance praying to the gods etc not to speak of bearing him in my womb
It is not possible for me to kill him  Then she said Dear go to your father 
The boy died from going back and forth between the father and the mother
Seeing him dead they wept and having taken the flesh as described above they departed
Because that flesh of their son was repulsive to them for nine reasons it was not eaten for enjoyment nor for intoxication nor for making strong and beautiful but only for the purpose of crossing out of the desert
For what nine reasons was it repulsive
Because it was the flesh of their own offspring the flesh of a relative the flesh of a son the flesh of a dear son the flesh of a youngster raw flesh not beef unsalted unspiced
Therefore the bhikkhu who sees the nutriment physical food thus as similar to sons flesh eliminates the desire for it
This in the first place is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of sons flesh
Then as regards the simile of the flayed cow If a cow were stripped of its skin from the neck to the hooves and then set free whatever it would rest upon would become a basis of pain for it since it would be bitten by the small creatures living there So too whatever physical basis or object contact stands upon as its support becomes a basis for the felt pain originating from that basis or object
Therefore a bhikkhu who sees the nutriment contact thus as similar to a flayed cow eliminates the desire for it This is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of the flayed cow
Then as regards the simile of the charcoal pit The three realms of being are like a charcoal pit in the sense of a great burning heat 
Like the two men who grab hold by both his arms and drag him towards it is mental volition in the sense that it drags one towards the realms of being
Therefore a bhikkhu who sees the nutriment mental volition thus as similar to a charcoal pit eliminates the desire for it This is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of the charcoal pit
Then as regards the simile of the man struck with three hundred spears The hundred spears that strike the man in the morning make a hundred wound openings in his body and without remaining inside they pierce through and fall on the other side and so with the other two hundred spears as well Thus his whole body is cut again and again by the spears which come without piercing him in a place where another has already struck There is no measuring the pain arisen in him from even one of the wound openings not to speak of three hundred wound openings
Therein the time of the generation of the rebirthlinking consciousness is like the time of being struck by a spear
The production of the aggregates is like the production of the wound openings
The arising of the various kinds of suffering rooted in the round once the aggregates have been born is like the arising of suffering on account of the wound openings
Another method of interpretation  The rebirthlinking consciousness is like the thief
His mentalitymateriality conditioned by consciousness is like the wound openings created by the striking of the spears
The arising of the various kinds of suffering by way of the thirtytwo types of torture and the eightynine types of diseases in regard to consciousness conditioned by mentalitymateriality  this should be regarded as like the arising of severe pain for that man conditioned by the wound openings
Therefore a bhikkhu who sees the nutriment consciousness thus as similar to one struck by three hundred spears
eliminates the desire for it This is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of the man struck by three hundred spears
Full Understanding Thus by eliminating desire in regard to these nutriments he also fully understands these four nutriments When these have been fully understood the entire basis has also been fully understood
For this has been said by the Blessed One 
Bhikkhus when the nutriment physical food has been fully understood lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure has been fully understood
When lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure has been fully understood there exists no more any fetter bound by which the noble disciple might come back to this world
Bhikkhus when the nutriment contact has been fully understood the three feelings have been fully understood
When the three feelings have been fully understood there is nothing further for the noble disciple to do I say
Bhikkhus when the nutriment mental volition has been fully understood the three kinds of craving have been fully understood
When the three kinds of craving have been fully understood there is nothing further for the noble disciple to do I say
Bhikkhus when the nutriment consciousness has been fully understood mentalitymateriality has been fully understood
When mentalitymateriality has been fully understood there is nothing further for the noble disciple to do I say
The Arising and Cessation of Nutriment With the arising of craving there is the arising of nutriment  This is the meaning With the arising of craving in the previous the arising of the nutriments occurs at rebirthlinking 
How
Because at the moment of rebirthlinking there is the nutritive essence produced among the thirty types of materiality that have arisen by way of triple continuity
This is the kammically acquired physical food as nutriment produced by craving as its condition
But the contact and volition associated with the rebirthlinking consciousness and that mind or consciousness itself  these are the kammically acquired nutriments of contact mental volition and consciousness produced by craving as their condition
Thus in the first place the arising of the nutriments at rebirthlinking should be understood as occurring with the arising of craving in the previous existence
But because the nutriments that are kammically acquired and those that are not kammically acquired have been discussed here combined the arising of nutriment with the arising of craving should be understood to apply also to those that are not kammically acquired
For there is nutritive essence in the kinds of materiality that are aroused by the eight types of consciousness accompanied by greed this is the nutriment physical food that is not kammically acquired yet is produced by conascent craving as its condition
But the contact and volition associated with the consciousness accompanied by greed and that mind or consciousness itself  these are the nutriments of contact mental volition and consciousness that are not kammically acquired yet are produced by craving as their condition
With the cessation of craving there is cessation of nutriment  By this there is set forth the cessation of nutriment by the cessation of the craving that had become the condition for both nutriment that is kammically acquired and that which is not kammically acquired
The rest by the method stated
but there is this difference Here the four truths are stated directly
and as here so in all the following sections
Therefore one who is unconfused in mind can deduce the truths throughout in what follows
And in all the following sections the delimiting phrase In that way too friends should be construed according to the principle that has been expounded
Here in the first place this is the interpretation of it  In that way too what is meant is the attention and penetration stated by way of the teaching concerning nutriment
The same method throughout
Now delighting and rejoicing in the Elders words after saying as before Good friend the bhikkhus asked a further question
and the Elder answered them by another exposition
This method is found in all the following sections
Therefore from here onwards we shall explain the meaning only of the particular exposition he states in reply without touching upon such words 
In the brief exposition of this teaching in the phrase understands suffering  suffering is the truth of suffering
But regarding the detailed exposition whatever needs to be said has all been said already in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of the Truths 
From here onwards the teaching is given by way of dependent arising 
Therein in the section on aging and death firstly as to the term their  this should be understood as a collective designation in brief for the many kinds of beings
For if one were to state the aging of Devadatta the aging of Somadatta etc one would never come to an end of beings
But there is no being not included by this term their
Therefore it was said above This should be understood as a collective designation in brief for the many kinds of beings 
In the various  This is a collective designation for the many orders by way of destiny and birth
Orders of beings  an indication of the nature of what is designated by the collective designation
Aging old age  etc As regards these aging is the description of the nature
old age is the description of the aspect
brokenness etc are descriptions of the function with respect to the passage of time
and the last two terms are descriptions of the normal 
For this is indicated as to nature by this term aging  hence this is a description of its nature
It is indicated as to aspect by this term old age  
hence this is a description of its aspect
Brokenness  by this it is indicated as to the function of causing the broken state of teeth and nails on account of the passage of time
Grayness  by this it is indicated as to the function of causing the head hairs and body hairs to turn gray
Wrinkling  by this it is indicated as to the wrinkled state of the skin after the withering of the flesh
Hence the three terms beginning with brokenness are descriptions of function with respect to the passage of time
By these evident aging is shown which becomes evident by the showing of these alterations
For just as the course taken by water or wind or fire is evident from the damaged and broken state or the burnt state of the grass and trees etc and yet the course that has been taken is not the water etc itself so too the course taken by aging is evident through brokenness of teeth etc and it is apprehended by opening the eyes
but the brokenness etc themselves are not aging nor is aging cognizable by the eye
Decline of life weakness of faculties  By these terms it is indicated by means of the normal known as the exhaustion of the lifespan and the weakening of the eye faculty etc that has become manifest with the passage of time
Hence these last two are to be understood as descriptions of its normal 
Therein because the lifespan of one who has reached aging is dwindling aging is called decline of life as a metaphor of its effect
And because the eye faculty etc  which at the time of youth were quite clear and could easily grasp even subtle objects  become deficient obscure unable to grasp even gross objects when one has reached old age therefore it is called weakness of faculties also as a metaphor of its effect
This aging thus described is all of two kinds evident and concealed
Therein the aging of material phenomena shown by brokenness etc is called evident aging 
But in the case of immaterial phenomena because their alteration in such a way is not visible their aging is called concealed aging 
Therein the brokenness that is seen is simply color because of the ease of comprehending such things as the teeth etc Having seen this with the eye and reflected on it with the mind door one knows aging thus These teeth have been afflicted by aging just as one knows the existence of water below when one has noticed the heads of cows etc bound to the place where the water is located
Again aging is twofold thus as continuous and as discrete
Therein continuous aging is the aging of such things as gems gold silver coral the sun and moon etc it is so called because of the difficulty of perceiving in such things distinct changes in color etc at regular intervals as we can in the case of living beings passing through the decade of childhood etc and in the case of vegetation such as flowers fruits buds etc The meaning is aging that progresses without interval
Discrete aging is the aging of the things other than those i e  of the aforesaid things  it is so called because it is easy to perceive in them distinct changes in color etc at regular intervals So it should be understood
Following this the term their should be understood by the method stated above 
Then in the expression passing passing away etc passing is said by way of what has the nature to pass away this is a collective designation to one four and fiveaggregate 
Passing away is the indication of the characteristic by a word expressing the abstract state
Dissolution is an indication of the occurrence of the breaking up of the aggregates of passing
Disappearance is an indication of the absence of any manner of persistence of the aggregates of passing as they are broken like a broken pot
Dying  death which is called dying
By this he rejects the idea of death as complete annihilation
Completion of time  time is the destroyer and this is its activity
By this he explains death in conventional terminology
Now to explain death in the ultimate sense he next says the dissolution of the aggregates  etc
For in the ultimate sense it is only the aggregates that break up it is not any so called being that dies
But when the aggregates are breaking up convention says a being is dying and when they have broken up convention says  dead 
Here the dissolution of the aggregates is said by way of four and five constituent being the laying down of the body by way of oneconstituent being
Or alternatively the dissolution of the aggregates is said by way of fourconstituent being the laying down of the body should be understood by way of the other two 
Why
Because of the existence of the body that is the material body in those two realms of being
Or else because in the realm of the Four Great Kings etc the aggregates simply break up and they do not lay anything down the dissolution of the aggregates is said with reference to them The laying down of the body occurs among human beings etc
And here because it is the cause for the laying down of the body death is called the laying down of the bodyThus the meaning should be understood
So this aging and this death are what is called aging and death 
this is spoken of as aging and death by combining the two into one
In the section on birth in regard to the phrase birth  their coming to birth etc birth is in the sense of being born this is stated with reference to those with incomplete sense bases
Coming to birth is in the sense of the act of coming to birth this is stated with reference to those with already complete sense bases
Precipitation is in the sense of being precipitated 
This is stated with reference to those born from the egg and from the womb for they take rebirthlinking as though descending and entering the egg shell or the placenta
Generation is in the sense of being generated This is stated with reference to those born from moisture or those of spontaneous birth for these are generated as soon as they become manifest
Now comes the exposition in the ultimate sense
Manifestation is the arising
Of the aggregates is to be understood as of one aggregate in the oneconstituent realm of being of four aggregates in fourconstituent realms and of five aggregates in fiveconstituent realms
Obtaining is the manifestation in continuity
The bases should be understood as comprising the sense bases arising in this or that realm
For when the sense bases become manifest then they are said to be obtained
This is called birth  by this phrase he comes to the conclusion on birth taught in both conventional terms and in the ultimate sense
With the arising of being  but here one should understand kammically active being as the condition for birth
The rest by the method stated
In the section on being sensesphere being is kammically active being and resultant being
Therein kammically active being is kamma itself that leads to sensesphere being
For that is called being as a designation of the cause in terms of its effect because it is the cause for resultant being as when it is said The arising of Buddhas is bliss and The accumulation of evil is painful 
Resultant being is the group of kammically acquired aggregates produced by that kamma
For that is called being because it exists there
Thus this kamma and this result are both spoken of conjointly as sensesphere being
The same method applies to finematerial being and immaterial being 
With the arising of clinging  But here clinging is a condition for wholesome kammically active being only by way of decisive support
it is a condition for unwholesome kammically active being by way of both decisive support and conascence
For all resultant being it is a condition only by way of decisive support
The rest by the method stated
In the section on clinging in regard to the phrase clinging to sense pleasures etc clinging to sense pleasures is analyzed thus by this one clings to the object of sensual pleasure or this itself clings to it
Or alternatively that is a sensual pleasure and it is clinging thus it is clinging to sensual pleasure
It is firm grasping that is called clinging
For here the prefix upa has the sense of firmness This is a designation for the lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure
This is the brief account here
The detailed account should be understood by the method stated thus Therein what is clinging to sensual pleasures The sensual desire in regard to sensual pleasures etc 
So too that is a view and clinging thus it is clinging to views 
Or alternatively it clings to a view or by this they cling to a view
For the subsequent view clings to the previous view
and thereby they cling to the view
As it is said Self and the world are eternal only this is true anything else is false etc  This is a designation for the whole field of views except clinging to rituals and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self
This is the brief account here
The detailed account should be understood by the method stated thus Therein what is clinging to views There is nothing given etc 
So too by this they cling to rituals and observances or this itself clings to them or that is a ritual and observance and clinging thus it is clinging to rituals and observances 
For when one adheres to the idea that the cow ritual or cow observance brings purification that itself is a clinging This is the brief account here
The detailed account should be understood by the method stated thus Therein what is clinging to rituals and observances of recluses and brahmans outside here that purity by rules etc 
Now they assert in terms of this thus it is a doctrine
By this they cling thus it is clinging
What do they assert Or what do they cling to
Self
The clinging to a doctrine about a self is the clinging to a doctrine of self 
Or alternatively by this a mere doctrine of self is clung to as self thus it is clinging to a doctrine of self This is a designation for personality view with its twenty cases
This is the brief account here
The detailed account should be understood by the method stated thus Therein what is clinging to a doctrine of self Here the uninstructed worldling who has no regard for noble ones etc 
With the arising of craving  here craving is a condition for clinging to sensual pleasures either by way of decisive support or by way of proximity contiguity absence disappearance and repetition
But for the rest by way of conascence etc too
The rest by the method stated
In the section on craving craving for forms craving for mindobjects  these are names for the kinds of craving which occur in the course of a javana cognitive process in the eye door etc Like a name derived from the father such as Setthiputta or Brahmanaputta  their names are derived from the object which is similar to the father as being the cause of it only not as is the case with eyecontact which is like a name derived from the mother in that is a cause by its nature as a physical support 
And here craving for forms is craving that has forms as its object craving in regard to forms
When this occurs by finding gratification in visible forms through its nature as sensual lust it is craving for sensual pleasure 
When it occurs by finding gratification in visible forms thinking Form is permanent lasting eternal through its nature as lust accompanied by the eternalist view then it is craving for being 
When it occurs by finding gratification in visible form thinking Form is annihilated destroyed and does not exist after death through its nature as lust accompanied by the annihilationist view then it is craving for nonbeing  Thus it is threefold
And as craving for form so too craving for sound etc  Thus there are eighteen modes of craving
These eighteen in respect of internal visible form etc and in respect of external visible form etc come to thirtysix
So thirtysix in the past thirtysix in the future and thirtysix at present make up a hundred and eight
Or there are eighteen based on internal form etc thus On account of the internal there is I am there is I am such and such  and so on and there are eighteen based on external form etc thus On account of the external there is I am there is I am such and such  and so on Thus there are thirtysix
So thirtysix in the past thirtysix in the future and thirtysix at present make up thus the hundred and eight modes of craving 
Again when a classification is made they reduce to only six classes of craving  in terms of their objects forms and the rest  and to only three types of craving  craving for sensual pleasure and the rest Thus
Craving should be known by the wise Through description and when described In detail
it again Through classification of the detail
With the arising of feeling there is the arising of craving  But here the word feeling is intended as resultant feeling
How is that the condition for craving in respect of the six sense doors
Because of its ability to produce gratification
For it is through the gratification in pleasant feeling that beings become enamored of that feeling and after arousing craving for feeling and being seized by lust for feeling they long only for a desirable visible form in the eye door And on getting it they find gratification in it and they honor painters etc who provide such objects
Likewise they long only for a desirable sound etc in the ear door etc And on getting it they find gratification in it and they honor musicians perfume makers cooks spinners and the teachers of the various crafts
Like what
Like those who being enamored of a child out of love for the child honor the wetnurse and give her suitable ghee milk etc to eat and drink
The rest by the method stated
In the section on feeling classes of feeling means groups of feeling
Feeling born of eyecontact  feeling born of mindcontact  because of what has come down in the Vibhanga thus There is feeling born of eyecontact that is wholesome that is unwholesome that is indeterminate  the wholesome unwholesome and indeterminate feelings that occur in the eye door etc are named after the physical base which is similar to a mother just as some are named after their mother such as Sariputta  Mantaniputta  etc
But the word meaning here is this feeling born of eyecontact is feeling that is born with eyecontact as the cause
The same method throughout
This in the first place is the allinclusive explanation
But by way of resultant in the eyedoor there are two eyeconsciousnesses two mind elements three mindconsciousness elements feeling should be understood as what is associated with these
This method also applies in the ear door etc
In the mind door is associated only with the mindconsciousness elements
With the arising of contact  But here the arising in the five doors of the feelings that have the five physical bases occurs with the arising of the conascent eyecontact
For the rest eyecontact etc are conditions by way of decisive support
In the mind door the arising of feelings of registration and of the doorless feelings of rebirthlinking lifecontinuum and death occurs with the arising of the conascent mindcontact
The rest by the method stated
In the section on contact eyecontact is contact in the eye
The same method throughout
Eyecontact  bodycontact  up to this point ten kinds of contact have been stated namely the wholesome and unwholesomeresultants having the five physical bases 
Mindcontact  by this the remaining twentytwo kinds of contact associated with the mundane resultant 
With the arising of the sixfold base  The arising of this sixfold contact should be understood to occur by way of the arising of the six bases beginning with the eyebase
The rest by the method stated
In the section on the sixfold base as regards the eyebase  etc whatever should be said has all been said already in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of the Aggregates and in the Description of the Bases 
With the arising of mentalitymateriality  But here the arising of the sixfold base should be understood to occur from the arising of mentalitymateriality according to the method stated in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of Dependent Arising as to which mentality which materiality and which mentalitymateriality are a condition for which base 
In the section on mentalitymateriality mentality has the characteristic of bending 
materiality has the characteristic of being molested 
In the detailed section however feeling is to be understood as the feeling aggregate
perception as the perception aggregate
and volition contact and attention as the formations aggregate
While it is certainly the case that other states are included in the formations aggregate still these three are found in all classes of consciousness even the weakest
That is why the formations aggregate is here pointed out only by means of these three
The four great elements 
this is a designation for the four  earth water fire and air
The reason why these are called great elements and other determinations concerning them are all stated in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of the Materiality Aggregate
Derived from the four great elements 
derived from  having clung to  having grasped is the meaning
Some also say depending upon 
And here the reading is completed by adding the word existing 
The Pali uses the genitive in the sense of a group
Hence the meaning here should be understood thus the materiality that exists derived from the group of the four great elements
Thus materiality taken altogether is to be understood as consisting of all the following the four great elements beginning with the earth element and the materiality that exists derived from the four great elements stated in the canonical Abhidhamma to be of twentythree kinds by analysis into the eyebase etc
With the arising of consciousness  But here the arising of mentalitymateriality should be understood to occur with the arising of consciousness according to the method stated in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of Dependent Arising as to which consciousness is a condition for which mentality for which materiality and for which mentalitymateriality 
The rest by the method stated
In the section on consciousness eyeconsciousness is consciousness in the eye or consciousness born from the eye
So also with ear nose tongue and bodyconsciousness
But with the other one i e  mindconsciousness  mind itself is consciousness
This is a designation for the resultant consciousness of the three planes of existence except for the two groups of fivefold consciousness
With the arising of formations  But here the arising of consciousness should be understood to occur with the arising of formations according to the method stated in the Visuddhimagga as to which formation is a condition for which consciousness 
In the section on formations a formation has the characteristic of forming 
But in the detailed section the bodily formation is a formation that proceeds from the body This is a designation for the twenty kinds of bodily volition  the eight sensesphere wholesome and twelve unwholesome  that occur by way of activation in the bodily door
The verbal formation is a formation that proceeds from speech This is a designation for the twenty kinds of verbal volition that occur by way of breaking into speech in the door of speech
The mental formation is a formation that proceeds from the mind This is a designation for the twentynine kinds of mental volition  the mundane wholesome and unwholesome  that occur in one sitting alone in thought and which do not cause activation of the bodily and verbal doors
With the arising of ignorance  But here ignorance should be understood as a condition for the wholesome by way of decisive support and for the unwholesome by way of conascence as well
The rest by the method stated
In the section on ignorance not knowing about suffering means not knowing about the truth of suffering This is a designation for delusion 
The same method with respect to not knowing about the origin of suffering and so on
Herein not knowing about suffering should be understood in four ways as to containment  as to physical basis  as to object  and as to concealment 
Thus because of being included in the truth of suffering it is contained in suffering and the truth of suffering is its physical basis by being its support condition and is its object by being its object condition and it conceals the truth of suffering by preventing the penetration of its real characteristic and by not allowing knowledge to occur in regard to it
Not knowing about the origin should be understood in three ways as to physical basis as to object and as to concealment
And not knowing about cessation and the way should be understood in one way only as to concealment
For nonknowledge only conceals cessation and the way by preventing the penetration of their real characteristics and by not allowing knowledge to occur in regard to them
But it is not contained in them because it is not included in this pair of truths
And these two truths are not its physical basis because they are not conascent
Nor are they its object because of its nonoccurrence on account of them
For the last pair of truths are difficult to see because of their profundity and nonknowledge which is blind does not occur there
But the first is profound in the sense of opposition because of the difficulty in seeing the characteristic of their intrinsic nature it occurs there by way of obsession by the perversions
Furthermore About suffering  to this extent ignorance is indicated as to inclusion as to physical basis as to object and as to function
About the origin of suffering  to this extent as to basis as to object and as to function
About the cessation of suffering and about the way leading to the cessation of suffering  to this extent as to function
But without distinction ignorance is described in terms of its intrinsic nature by the phrase not knowing 
With the arising of the taints  But here the taint of sensual desire and the taint of being are conditions for ignorance by way of conascence etc
the taint of ignorance only by way of decisive support
And here the ignorance that had arisen previously should be understood as the taint of ignorance
That is a decisive support condition for the ignorance that arises subsequently
The rest by the method stated
In the section on the taints with the arising of ignorance  Here ignorance is a condition for the taint of sensual desire and the taint of being by way of decisive support etc
 for the taint of ignorance only by way of decisive support
And here the ignorance that arises subsequently should be understood as the taint of ignorance
The previously arisen ignorance itself becomes a decisive support condition for the subsequently arisen taint of ignorance
The rest by the aforesaid method
This section is stated by way of showing the condition for the ignorance which heads the factors of dependent arising
Stated thus the undiscoverability of any beginning of samsara is established
How
Because with the arising of the taints there is the arising of ignorance and with the arising of ignorance there is the arising of the taints
Thus the taints are a condition for ignorance and ignorance is a condition for the taints
Having shown this no first point of ignorance is manifest and because none is manifest the undiscoverability of any beginning of samsara is proven
Conclusion Thus in all this sutta sixteen sections have been stated the section on the courses of kamma the section on nutriment the section on suffering and the sections on aging and death birth being clinging craving feeling contact the sixfold base mentalitymateriality consciousness formations ignorance and the taints
As to these in each individual section there is a twofold analysis  in brief and in detail  amounting to thirtytwo cases
Thus in this sutta in these thirtytwo cases the Four Truths are expounded
Among these in the sixteen cases stated in detail arahantship is expounded
But according to the opinion of the Elder the four truths and the four paths are expounded in the thirtytwo cases
Thus in the entire Word of the Buddha comprised in the five great Nikayas there is no sutta except for this Discourse on Right View where the Four Truths are explained thirtytwo times and where arahantship is explained thirtytwo times
That is what the Venerable Sariputta said  The Venerable Sariputta spoke this Discourse on Right View having adorned it with sixtyfour divisions  thirtytwo expositions of the four truths and thirtytwo expositions of arahantship The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Venerable Sariputtas words
In the Papañcasudani the Commentary to the Majjhima Nikaya
the Explanation of the Discourse on Right View is concluded
Evam me sutam  Thus have I heard the Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness Satipatthana Sutta
Ekam samayam bhagava Kurusu viharati  At one time the Blessed One was living in the Kurus Although the territory of the Kuru Princes their homeland was a single contiguous domain by taking into consideration its many villages and markettowns it was commonly referred to by the use of the plural form Kurus 
In the time of the legendary king Mandhatu say the commentators inhabitants of the three continents Pubba Videha Apara Goyana and Uttara Kuru having heard that Jambudipa the birthplace of Sammasambuddhas Paccekabuddhas the Great Disciples of the Buddhas Universal Monarchs and other beings of mighty virtue was an exceedingly pleasant excellent continent came to Jambudipa with the Universal Monarch Mandhatu who was making a tour of all the continents in due order preceded by his Wheel Treasure
And at last when Mandhatu bodily translated himself by means of his psychic virtue to the Tavatimsa devaloka the heaven of the Thirtythree
the people of the three continents who accompanied him to Jambudipa begged of his son for territory to live in as they said they had come carried by the great power of Mandhatu and were now unable by themselves to return to their own continents
Their prayer was heard and lands were granted to each of the groups of people of the three continents
The settlement of people from Pubba Videha came to be known as Videha
of those from Apara Goyana as Aparanta
and of those from Uttara Kuru as Kururattha
Kammasadammam nama Kurunam nigamo  At Kammasadamma a markettown of the Kuru people
Some explain the word Kammasadamma here spelling it with a dh instead of a d
Since Kammasa was tamed here it was called Kammasadamma the place of the taming of Kammasa
Kammasa refers to the cannibal of Kammasapada the one with the speckled black and white or gray colored foot
It is said that a wound on his foot caused by a stake healed having become like a piece of wood with lines of fibre of a complex pattern cittadaru sadiso hutvaTherefore he became wellknown as Kammasapada Speckled Foot
was Speckled Foot tamed
By whom
By the Great Being the Bodhisatta
In which Birthstory Jataka is it stated
Certain commentators say In the Sutasoma Birthstory
But the elders of the Great Minister at Anuradhapura the Maha Vihara say that it is stated in the Jayaddisa Birthstory
Kammasapada was tamed weaned of his cannibalism by the Great Being in the circumstances mentioned in the Jayaddisa Birthstory
The following statement occurs in that story
When born as very son of the king Jayaddisa
Pañcalas sovran chief
To free my sire did I renounce my life
And make even Speckled Foot have faith in me
Some keci however explain spelling the word thus Kammasadhamma
It is said that the traditional Kuru virtuous practice Kuruvattadhamma became stained kammaso jato in that place Therefore it was called Kammasadhamma
The markettown established there too got the same name
Why was it not said Kammasadamme Kurunam nigame using the locative
Because it is said there was no monastery at which the Blessed One could stay in that markettown
Away from the markettown however there was a huge dense jungle in a delightful region watered well
In that jungle the Blessed One lived
making the markettown his place for gathering alms
Ekayano ayam bhikkhave maggo  This is the only way O bhikkhus
Why did the Blessed One teach this Discourse
Because of the ability of the people of the Kurus to take in deep doctrine
The inhabitants of the Kuru country  bhikkhus bhikkhunis upasakas upasikas  by reason of their country being blessed with a perfect climate and through their enjoyment of other comfortable conditions were always healthy in body and in mind
They happy with healthy minds and bodies and having the power of knowledge were capable of receiving deep teachings
Therefore the Blessed One perceiving their ability to appreciate this profound instruction proclaimed to them this Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness which is deep in meaning having set up the subject of meditation in arahantship in twentyone places
For even as a man having got a golden basket should fill it with divers flowers or indeed having got a golden casket should fill it with precious jewels of the seven kinds the Blessed One having got a following of the Kuruland people dispensed it is said deep doctrine
Likewise on that very account there in the Kurus the Blessed One taught other deep teachings the Mahanidana Sutta Mahasatipatthana Sutta Saropama Sutta Rukkhupama Sutta Ratthapala Sutta Magandiya Sutta and the Aneñjasappaya Sutta
Further in that territory of the Kuru people the four classes  bhikkhu bhikkhuni upasaka upasika  generally by nature were earnest in the application of the Arousing of Mindfulness to their daily life At the very lowest even servants usually spoke with mindfulness
At wells or in spinning halls useless talk was not heard
If some woman asked of another woman Mother which Arousing of Mindfulness do you practice and got the reply None at all
then that woman who replied so was reproached thus Your life is shameful though you live you are as if dead
and was taught one of the kinds of Mindfulnessarousing
But on being questioned if she said that she was practicing such and such an Arousing of Mindfulness
then she was praised thus Well done well done Your life is blessed you are really one who has attained to the human state for you the Sammasambuddhas have come to be
The only way  The one way Ekayanoti ekamaggo
There are many words for way
The word used for way here is ayana 
Therefore This is the only way O bhikkhus ekayano ayam bhikkhave maggo means here A single way  O bhikkhus is this way it is not of the nature of a double way ekamaggo ayam bhikkhave maggo na dvedhapathabhuto 
Or it is the only way because it has to be trodden by oneself only ekeneva ayitabbo 
The state of being companionless is twofold without a comrade after abandoning contact with the crowd and in the sense of being withdrawn from craving through tranquillity of mind
Or it is called ekayana because it is the way of the one ekassa ayana
Of the one  of the best of all beings the Blessed One is best Therefore it is called the Blessed Ones Way
Although others too go along that way it is the Buddhas because he creates it
Accordingly it is said He the Blessed One is the creator of the uncreated path O Brahman 
It proceeds only in this Doctrineanddiscipline and not in any other
Accordingly the Master declared Subhadda only in this Doctrineanddiscipline is the Eightfold Way to be found 
And further ekayana means It goes to the one ekam ayati  that is it goes solely to Nibbana
Although in the earlier stages this method of meditation proceeds on different lines in the latter it goes to just the one Nibbana
And that is why Brahma Sahampati said
Whose mind perceiving lifes last dying out
Vibrates with love he knows the only way
That led in ancient times is leading now
And in the future will lead past the flood 
Some keci however construing according to the stanza beginning with the words They do not go twice to the further shore na param digunam yanti say One goes to Nibbana once
therefore it is ekayana  This explanation is not proper
Because in this instruction the earlier part of the Path is intended to be presented
the preliminary part of the Way of Mindfulness proceeding in the four objects of contemplation is meant here and not the supramundane Way of Mindfulness
And that preliminary part of the Path proceeds many times or it may be said that there is many a going on it by way of repetition of practice
Regarding the only way there is the following account of a discussion that took place long ago
The Elder Tipitaka Culla Naga said The Way of Mindfulnessarousing is the preliminary part  
His teacher the Elder Culla Summa said The Way is a mixed one  
The pupil Reverend Sir it is the preliminary part 
The teacher Friend it is the mixed Way 
As the teacher was insistent the pupil became silent
They went away without coming to a decision
On the way to the bathing place the teacher considered the matter He recited the Discourse When he came to the part where it is said O bhikkhus should any person maintain the Four Arousings of Mindfulness in this manner for seven years he concluded that after producing the consciousness of the Supramundane Path there was no possibility of continuing in that state of mind for seven years and that his pupil Culla Naga was right On that very day which happened to be the eighth of the lunar fortnight
 it was the elder Culla Nagas turn to expound the Dhamma
When the exposition was about to begin the Elder Culla Summa went to the Hall of Preaching and stood behind the pulpit After the pupil had recited the preliminary stanzas the teacher spoke to the pupil in the hearing of others
Thus the Elders of old were not envious and did not go about holding up only what they liked as though it were a bundle of sugarcane They took up what was rational they gave up what was not
saying Friend Culla Naga
The pupil heard the voice of his teacher and replied What is it Reverend Sir
The teacher said this To say as I did that the Way is a mixed one is not right You are right in calling it the preliminary part of the Way of Mindfulnessarousing
Thereupon the pupil realising that on a point on which experts of the Dhamma like his learned teacher had floundered fellows of the holy life in the future were more likely to be unsure thought With the authority of a citation from the Discoursecollection I will settle this question Therefore he brought out and placed before his hearers the following statement from the Patisambhida Magga The preliminary part of the Way of Mindfulnessarousing is called the only way
The Excellent Way is the Eightfold way four are truths
dispassion is the best of things belonging to the wise
besides that Way there is no other for the purifying of vision
Walk along that Way so that you may confound Death
and put an end to suffering
Sattanam visuddhiya  For the purification of beings For the cleansing of beings soiled by the stains of lust hatred and delusion and by the defilements of covetise called lawless greed and so forth
All reach the highest purity after abandoning mental taints
By way of physical taints however there is no cleansing of impurities taught in the Dhamma
That through bodily taints men become impure
Or by the washing of the body they become pure  By the Great Seer it was not said
That through mental taints men become impure
And through the cleansing of the mind they become pure By the Great Seer it was declared
Accordingly it is said Mental taints soil beings mental cleansing sanctifies them 
Sokaparidevanam samatikkamaya  For the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation
If this Way is developed it will lead to the casting out of sorrow similar to that experienced by the Minister Santati and the casting out of lamentation similar to that of Patacara
Purge out the things belonging to the past Let there be naught in the world to rise in future times
If whats twixt past and future you dont grasp You will be one who wanders forth serene
With analytical knowledge did Santati reach arahantship after hearing this stanza 
Patacara
For one who is by death oppressed there is No safety seen in children father friends Or others close to one
A shelter true Amongst ones kinsfolk one does never find
reached the fruition of the first stage of arahantship after hearing the following 
Since there is nothing called spiritual development bhavana without laying hold on something whatsoever in material form feeling consciousness and mental objects kaya vedana citta dhammesu kiñci dhammam anamasitva they too overcame sorrow and lamentation just by this Way of Mindfulness
Dukkha domanassanam atthangamaya  For the destruction of suffering and grief  For the cessation of bodily suffering and mental grief
This way maintained by contemplation is conducive to the destruction of suffering similar to that of the Elder Tissa and of grief similar to that of Sakka
Tissa the head of a family at Savatthi renouncing forty crores of gold became a homeless one and dwelt in a forest far from other human beings
His sisterinlaw sent a robber band of five hundred to scour the forest in order to find him and ordered them to kill him when he was found She sent him it is said in five batches of a hundred each in succession
After entering the forest and searching for the elder they in due course came to the place in which he lived and sat round him
When the robbers surrounded him the elder spoke thus Lay disciples why have you come
They replied To kill you
Then the elder said On a security give me my life for just this one night
Said the robbers O recluse who will stand surety for you in a place like this
The elder thereupon took a big stone broke the bones of his legs and said Lay disciples is the security of value
They leaving the elder went to the end of the ambulatory and lighting a fire lay on the ground
The elder contemplating on the purity of his conduct after suppressing his pain
attained arahantship at dawn having fulfilled the recluses regimen in the three watches of the night Giving expression to his feelings he said
A surety let me raise breaking both my legs
To die with lustful mind I loathe and shrink
Having thought thus I saw things as they are
And with the dawn I reached the arahants domain 
There is another story Thirty bhikkhus taking the subject of meditation from the Blessed One went into residence during the rains in a forestdwelling agreeing amongst themselves to practice the duty of the recluse during all the three watches of the night and to avoid one anothers presence
One by one those monks who began to doze early in the morning after doing the recluses duty during the three watches of the night were carried away by a tiger
Not one of those carried away did even utter the words I am taken by a tiger
When thus fifteen bhikkhus had been devoured on uposatha day  after it was asked Friends where are the others  and it became known that they had been devoured by a tiger It was agreed that anyone seized by the tiger thereafter should utter the words I am taken
Then a certain young bhikkhu was seized by the tiger in the same circumstances in which the others were seized earlier
That young bhikkhu said Tiger Reverend Sir
The other bhikkhus carrying sticks and torches went in pursuit of the tiger
The tiger having taken the young bhikkhu up to a rocky place a broken edge over a hollow spot inaccessible to the bhikkhus began to devour its prey from the feet upwards
The pursuing bhikkhus said Good man there is nothing that can be done by us The extraordinary spiritual attainment of bhikkhus is to be seen in such a place 
That bhikkhu even prostrate in the tigers mouth suppressed his pain and developing the wisdom of insight attained the four paths and fruits of sanctitude together with analytical knowledge Then he uttered this ecstatic utterance
Virtuous was I keeping to my vows And wise with growing insight was my mind That had to concentration well attained
Yet because I slacked for just a while A tiger
took my frame of flesh and blood Unto a hill and then my mind did quake
Devour me as you please o tiger eat This body of mine which is bereft of thought
Within the thought of quiet strongly held A blessing will my death become to me
And then there is the story of the elder Pitamalla who in the time he was a layman took the pennon for wrestling in three kingdoms He came to Tambapanni Isle had audience of the king and received royal assistance Once while going through the entrance to the Screened Sitting Hall he heard the following passage from the Notyours chapter of Scripture Material form o bhikkhus is not yours renounce it That renunciation will for a long time be for your welfare and happiness  And he thought Neither material form indeed nor feeling is ones own
and making just that thought a goad he renounced the world At the Great Minister the Maha Vihara at Anuradhapura he was in due course given the lower ordination and the higher When he had mastered the two Codes of Discipline Dve Matika he went to the Gavaravaliya Shrine with thirty other bhikkhus and did the duty of the recluse
While meditating in the open at night there once he was moving on his knees on the ambulatory when his feet were unable to carry him
and a hunter mistaking him for a deer struck him with a spear
the spear had gone deep into the body
The elder removed it and stopping the wound with a wad of grass sat down on a flat stone Making of his misfortune an opportunity for setting energy afoot he developed insight and attained arahantship with analytical knowledge After he had reached the state of arahantship in order to apprise his fellowbhikkhus of his achievement he made a sign by clearing his throat and uttered this saying of joy at final liberation from suffering
The world of the Fully Awakened Man the Chief Holder of Right Views in all the world is this
Give up this form disciples it is not yours
Fleeting truly are component things Ruled by laws of growth and decay
What is produced to dissolution swings Happy it is when things at rest do stay
Then those fellowmonks of the Elder Pitamalla who had come to see him said Reverend Sir if the Buddha were living he would have expressed his approval of your effort by stretching out his hand over the ocean and stroking your head
So in this manner this way is conducive to the destruction of suffering of those like the Elder Tissa
Sakka king of the gods after seeing the five portents afraid of death and griefstricken came to the Buddha and asked a question at the close of the answering of that question by the Buddha Sakka was established in the first stage of arahantship
Eighty thousand other gods were established together with Sakka in the same stage of sanctity
And the life of Sakka again was restored to just its original state through his rebirth once more as the king of the gods
Further it is said that Subrahma the god was partaking of the delights of paradise in the company of a thousand heavenly nymphs There five hundred of the nymphs while picking flowers from a tree died and were reborn in a state of woe
He having seen their rebirth in a state of woe and having understood that the end of his own life was approaching and that he too would at death be reborn in that very state of woe was frightened Then he went to the Buddha with his five hundred remaining nymphs and said this to the Lord
The heart is always in a state of fear And is always full of anguish drear
Concerning things that have now taken place All things which shortly I shall have to face
If theres a place thats free from evry fear That fearfree place wilt thou to me make clear
The Blessed One replied to him as follows
Besides the wakening factors of the truth Besides the virtues of the holy state Besides restraint and relinquishment full
I see nothing that can bless living beings
At the end of the instruction Subrahma and his five hundred nymphs were established in the first stage of awakening and he it is said returned to his paradise having made firm the heavenly fortunate state of life that was his before
It should be understood that this way developed in this manner is conducive to the destruction of grief of those like Sakka
ñayassa adhigamaya  For reaching the right path  The Noble Eightfold Path is called the right path
This preliminary mundane Way of the Arousing of Mindfulness maintained is conducive to the realisation of the Supramundane Way
Nibbanassa sacchikiriyaya  For the attainment of Nibbana  It is said as follows For the attainment the ocular experience by oneself of the deathless which has got the name Nibbana by reason of the absence in it of the lust vana literally sewing weaving from the root va to weave called craving tanha
This way maintained effects the attainment of Nibbana gradually
Although by the phrase For the purification of beings the things meant by the other phrases which follows it are attained the significance of those other phrases that follow the first is not obvious except to a person familiar with the usage of the Dispensation sasana yutti kovido Since the Blessed one does not at first make people conversant with the usage of the Dispensation and after that teach the Doctrine to them
and as he by various discourses sets forth various meanings
he explained the things which the only way effects with the words For the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation and so forth
Or it may be said that the Master explained the things accomplished by the only way in this manner in order to show that every thing which leads to the purification of beings by the only way is dependent on the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation that this overcoming is dependent on the destruction of suffering and grief and that the destruction of suffering and grief is dependent on the reaching of the right path which is in turn dependent on the attainment of Nibbana
Further this is an expression of praise of the only way
Just as the Blessed One by way of eight characteristics expressed praise in the Cha Chakka Sutta and by way of nine characteristics in the Ariyavamsa Sutta just in the same way he expressed praise of this only way through the seven characteristics contained in the words For the purification of beings and so forth
Why did he utter talk of praise of this kind
For the purpose of bringing out the interest of these bhikkhus
The Blessed One thought Having heard the utterance of praise these bhikkhus will believe that his way casts out the four onrushings cattaro upaddave harati namely sorrow produced by distress of heart hadaya santapabhutam sokam lamentation characterised by confused talk vaca vipallabhutam paridevam suffering produced by disagreeable bodily feeling kayikam asatabhutam dukkham and grief produced by disagreeable thought cetasikam asatabhutam domanassam and that it brings the three extraordinary spiritual attainments of purity knowledge and Nibbana visuddhim ñanam Nibbananti tayo visese avahati and will be convinced that this instruction should be studied imam dhammadesanam uggahetabbam mastered pariyapunnitabbam borne in mind dharetabbam and memorized vacetabbam and that this way should be cultivated imañca maggam bhavetabbam
Why did the Buddha teach just Four Arousings of Mindfulness and neither more nor less
By way of what was suitable for those capable of being trained
In regard to the pair of the dullwitted and the keenwitted minds among tamable persons of the craving type and the theorizing type pursuing the path of quietude samatha or that of insight vipassana in the practice of meditation the following is stated For the dullwitted man of craving type the Arousing of Mindfulness through the contemplation of the gross physical body is the Path to Purity for the keenwitted of this type the subtle subject of meditation on the feeling
And for the dullwitted man of the theorizing type the Path to Purity is the Arousing of Mindfulness through a subject not too full of distinctions namely consciousness citta for the keenwitted of this type the subject which teems with distinctions namely the contemplation on things of the mind  mental objects dhammanupassana
For the dullwitted man pursuing quietude the First Arousing of Mindfulness bodycontemplation is the Path to Purity by reason of the feasibility of getting at the mental reflex for the keenwitted of this type because he does not continue to stay in the coarse the second Arousing of Mindfulness the contemplation on feeling is the Path to Purity
And for the dullwitted man pursuing the path of insight the subject of meditation without many distinctions the contemplation on consciousness is the Path to Purity and for the keenwitted of this type the contemplation on mental objects which is full of distinctions
Or it may be said that these Four Arousings of Mindfulness are taught
for casting out the illusions vipallasa concerning beauty pleasure permanence and an ego
The body is ugly There are people led astray by the illusion that it is a thing of beauty In order to show such people the ugliness of the body and to make them give up their wrong idea the First Arousing of Mindfulness is taught
Feeling is suffering There are people subject to the illusion that it gives pleasure In order to show such people the painfulness of feeling and to make them give up their wrong idea the Second Arousing of Mindfulness is taught Consciousness is impermanent There are people who owing to an illusion believe that it is permanent To show them the impermanence of consciousness and to wean them of their wrong belief the Third Arousing of Mindfulness is taught Mental objects are insubstantial are soulless and possess no entity There are people who believe by reason of an illusion that these mental things are substantial endowed with an abiding core or a soul or that they form part of a soul an ego or some substance that abides To convince such errant folk of the fact of the soullessness or the insubstantiality of mental things and to destroy the illusion which clouds their minds the Fourth Arousing of Mindfulness is taught
In the commentary it is said that by way of remembering and of meeting in one thing the Arousing of Mindfulness is only one and that it is fourfold when regarded as a subject of meditation
To a city with four gates men coming from the East with goods produced in the east enter by the east gate men coming from the South men coming from the West and men coming from the North with goods produced in the north enter by the north gate
Nibbana is like the city
The Real Supramundane Eightfold Path is like the citygate
Body mind feelings and mental objects are like the four chief directions in space
Like the people coming from the East with goods produced in the east are those who enter Nibbana by means of bodycontemplation through the Real Supramundane Path produced by the power of bodycontemplation practiced in the fourteen ways
Like the people coming from the South are those who enter by means of feelingcontemplation practiced in the nine ways Like the people coming from the West are those who enter by means of consciousnesscontemplation practiced in the sixteen ways
Like the people coming from the North are those who enter by means of mentalobjectcontemplation practiced in the five ways
Katame cattaro  What are the four This is a question indicating the desire to expound the teaching
Idha  Here In this Dispensation
Bhikkhave  Bhikkhus This is a term for addressing persons who accept the teaching
Bhikkhu is a term to indicate a person who earnestly endeavors to accomplish the practice of the teaching
Others gods and men too certainly strive earnestly to accomplish the practice of the teaching but because of the excellence of the bhikkhustate by way of practice the Master said Bhikkhu
For amongst those who accept the teaching of the Buddha the bhikkhu is the highest owing to fitness for receiving manifold instruction Further when that highest kind of person the bhikkhu is reckoned
the rest too are reckoned as in regard to a royal procession and the like when the king is reckoned by the reckoning of the king the retinue is reckoned
Also the word bhikkhu was used by the Buddha to point out the bhikkhustate through practice of the teaching in this way He who practices this practice of the Arousing of Mindfulness is called a bhikkhu
He who follows the teaching be he a shining one deva or a human is indeed called a bhikkhu
Accordingly it is said
Welldressed one may be
but if one is calm Tamed humble pure
a man who does no harm To aught that lives
that ones a brahman true An ascetic and mendicant too
Kaye  In the body In the corporeal group
The group of big and small corporeal constituents namely things like hair of the head hair of the body nails and teeth in the sense of a collection samuhatthena similar to a herd of elephants a concourse of chariots according to grammatical method sadda nayena
And as in the sense of a collection so also in the sense of the focus of what is filthy and therefore of what is disgusting is it kaya
For the body kaya is the birthplace aya of the disgusting the exceedingly repellent
The birthplace aya is the place of origin uppattidesa
Since these originate from that place ayanti tato it is the place of origin ayo
What originates
The repulsive things like hair of the head
Therefore the body is the place of origin of disgusting or contemptible things kucchitanam ayoti kayo
Kayanupassi  Contemplating the body Possessed of the character of bodycontemplation or of observing the body
Why is the word body used twice in the phrase Contemplating the body in the body  For determining the object and isolating it and for the sifting out thoroughly vinibbhoga of the apparently compact ghana nature of things like continuity santati
Because there is no contemplating of feeling consciousness nor mental objects in the body but just the contemplating of the body only determination through isolation is set forth by the pointing out of the way of contemplating the body only in the property called the body
In the body there is no contemplation of a uniform thing apart from the big and small members of the body or of a man or of a woman apart from such things like the hair of the head and the hair of the body
There can be nothing apart from the qualities of primary and derived materiality in a body Indeed the character of contemplating the collection of the major and the minor corporeal members is like the seeing of the constituents of a cart The character of contemplating the collection of the hair of the head the hair of the body and the like is comparable to the seeing of the component parts of a city and the character of contemplating the collection of primary and derived materiality is comparable to the separation of the leaf covering of a plantaintrunk or is like the opening of an empty fist Therefore by the pointing out of the basis called the body in the form of a collection in many ways the sifting out thoroughly of the apparently compact is shown
In this body apart from the above mentioned collection there is seen no body man woman or anything else Beings engender wrong belief in many ways in the bare groups of things mentioned above
Therefore the men of old said
What he sees that is not seen What is seen that he does not see
Not seeing he is shackled clean And he the shackled fool cannot get free
And here by the passage For the determining of the object by isolating it and for the sifting out thoroughly of the apparently compact nature of things like continuity
this too should be understood This person contemplates in this body only the body he does not contemplate anything else
What does this mean
In this definitely transient suffering soulless body that is unlovely he does not see permanence pleasure a soul nor beauty after the manner of those animals which see water in a mirage Bodycontemplation is only the contemplation of the collection of qualities of transiency suffering soullessness and unloveliness
Because there is no contemplating of the body with reference to a self or to anything belonging to a self owing to the contemplating even of collections of things like the hair of the head there is the character of contemplating in the body the body which is a collection of things like the hair of the head
The meaning should be understood thus too contemplating the body in the body is the seeing of the body as a group of all qualities beginning with impermanence step by step as taught in the passage of the Patisambhida which begins with In this body he contemplates according to impermanence and not permanence 
The bhikkhu sees the body in the body as something impermanent
as something subject to suffering
as something that is soulless
by way of turning away from it and not by way of delighting in it
by freeing himself of passion for it
with thoughts making for cessation and not making for origination
and not by way of laying hold of it but by way of giving it up
Viharati  Lives 
Atapi  Ardent  What burns the defilement of the three planes of becoming is ardour Ardour is a name for energy
Sampajano  Clearly comprehending Endowed with knowledge called circumspection sampajañña
Satima  Mindful Endowed with mindfulness that lays hold of the body as a subject of meditation
because this yogavacara contemplates with wisdom after laying hold of the object with mindfulness There is nothing called contemplation without mindfulness
Therefore the Master said Mindfulness is necessary in all circumstances O bhikkhus I declare 
To point out the things by the influence of which the meditation of the yogi prospers is the purpose of the words Ardent clearly comprehending and mindful
To the nonardent state of mind there is the obstacle of mental lassitude The state of mind that is not clearly comprehending commits blunders of judgment in the business of choosing the right means and in avoiding the wrong The state of mind which is inattentive  the mental state of absence of mindfulness  is incapable of laying hold of the right means and of rejecting the wrong means When the yogi is not ardent not clearly comprehending and not mindful he does not succeed in accomplishing his object To point out the things by the influence of which the meditation of the yogi prospers
is the purpose of the words Ardent clearly comprehending and mindful
After the pointing out of the things that make up the condition connected with the Arousing of Mindfulness through bodycontemplation there is the pointing out of the things that make up the condition which should be abandoned in this practice with the words having overcome in this world covetousness and grief  Vineyya loke abhijjhadomanassam
In this world  In just this body
Here the body kaya is the world loka in the sense of a thing crumbling
As covetousness and grief are abandoned in feeling consciousness and mental objects too the Vibhanga says Even the five aggregates of clinging are the world 
Covetousness stands for sense desire and grief for anger As sense desire and anger are the principal hindrances the abandoning of the hindrances is stated by the overcoming of covetousness and grief
With covetousness are abandoned the satisfaction rooted in bodily happiness delight in the body and the falling into erroneous opinion which takes as real the unreal beauty pleasure permanence and substantiality of the body With the overcoming of grief are abandoned the discontent rooted in bodily misery the nondelight in the culture of bodycontemplation and the desire to turn away from facing the real ugliness suffering impermanence and insubstantiality of the body
By the instruction dealing with the overcoming of covetousness and grief yogic power and yogic skill are shown
Freedom from satisfaction and discontent in regard to bodily happiness and misery the forbearing from delighting in the body the bearingup of nondelight in the course of bodycontemplation
the state of being not captivated by the unreal and the state of not running away from the real  these when practiced produce yogic power and the ability to practice these is yogic skill
There is another method of interpretation of the passage lives contemplating the body in the body ardent and so forth Contemplating refers to the subject of meditation
Lives lives protecting the subject of meditation which here is the body
In the passage beginning with ardent Right Exertion sammappadhana is stated by energy atapa the subject of meditation proper in all circumstances sabbatthika kammatthana or the means of protecting the subject of meditation kammatthana pariharana upaya is stated by mindfulness and clear comprehension sati sampajañña or the quietude that is obtained patiladdha samatha by way of the contemplation on the body kayanupassana is stated by mindfulness insight vipassana by clear comprehension and the fruit of inner culture bhavana phala through the overcoming of covetousness and grief abhijjha domanassa vinaya
Vedanasu Vedananupassi citte cittanupassi dhammesu dhammanupassi viharati  He lives contemplating feeling in the feelings the consciousness in consciousness mental object in mental objects Here the repetition of feelings consciousness and mental objects should be understood according to the reasons given for the repetition of the word body in bodycontemplation
Feeling  The three feelings pleasurable painful and the neither pleasurable nor painful These are only mundane
Consciousness is only mundane and mundane too are mental objects
This statement will be made evident in the analytically expository portion niddesavara
To be sure in whatever way feeling is to be exclusively contemplated here the contemplating in that very way is the meaning of the word Contemplating feelings in the feelings kevalam panidha yatha vedana anupassitabba tatha anupassanto vedanasu vedananupassiti veditabbo
In the contemplation of consciousness and mental objects too this is the method
How should feeling be contemplated upon  it is asked further
Pleasurable feeling because it is the stuff of suffering as suffering Painful feeling because it is the condition of bringing out trouble and so forth as a thorn And the neither pleasurable nor painful feeling because of nonmastery or dependence and so forth as transiency
Accordingly the Master said
Who sees pleasure as suffering Who sees pain as a thorn
Who sees as a thing that is fleeting The neutral peace thats shorn
Of pleasure and pain that bhikkhu will Rightly know and live become still 
Further just all feelings should be contemplated with the thought These are suffering indeed  
For this has been said by the Blessed One All that is felt is in suffering I declare yam kiñci vedayitam tam sabbam dukkhasminti vadami
And pleasure should also be contemplated upon as suffering
All should be explained according as the arahantnun Dhammadinna spoke  Pleasant feeling friend Visakha is agreeable while it lasts and is disagreeable when it changes painful feeling is disagreeable while it lasts and agreeable when it changes the neither pleasant nor painful feeling is agreeable when there is a knowledge of its existence and disagreeable when that knowledge is wanting
The feelings should also be seen according to the seven contemplations beginning with that of impermanence mentioned above 
The remaining division beginning with the worldly and spiritual feelings in the classification of pleasurable feeling and so forth in feelingcontemplation will become clear in the analytical exposition niddesavara
Consciousness and mental objects too should be contemplated upon by way of the diversity of the division of object arammana dominance adhipati conascence sahajata plane bhumi causal action kamma result vipaka noncausative functional process kriya and so forth adi beginning with impermanence aniccadinam anupassananam vesena and by way of the division of consciousness that is with passion and so forth come down in the portion of analytical exposition niddesavare agatasaragadi bhedañca vasena
Mental objects should be contemplated upon by way of own characteristic sallakkhana of impression and the like phusanadi by way of general characteristic samañña lakkhana of impermanence and the like aniccatadi by way of phenomenonemptiness suññta dhamma namely by way of the voidnature called soullessness anattata sankhata suññata sabhavassa to explain which clearly the instruction of the portion dealing with the void in the Abhidhamma proceeded by means of the statement beginning with At that time indeed there are phenomena there are aggregates yam vibhavetum abhidhamme tasmim kho pana samaye dhamma honti khandha hantiti adina suññatavara desana pavatta without any mention of a soul by way of the seven contemplations of impermanence and so forth aniccadi satta anupassananam and by way of the divisions of what is present and what is absent and so forth in the analytical portion niddesavare agata santasantadi bhedanañca vasena
If in the meditators body called the world covetousness and grief are abandoned in the worlds of his feelings and so forth too these are abandoned owing to the earlier abandoning of these by the yogi kamañcettha kayasankhate loke abhijjha domanassam pahinam vedanadi lokesu pi tam pahinameva pubbe pahinatta
Still everywhere the abandoning of the defilements has been stated by way of the different types of persons and by way of the diversity of the thoughtunit in which the development of the different subjects of the Arousing of Mindfulness takes place nana puggalavasena pana nana cittakkhana satipatthana bhavanavasena ca sabbattha vuttam 
The defilements abandoned in one object are abandoned in the remaining objects too ekattha pahinam sesesu pi pahinam hoti
The Blessed Ones exposition of the Arousing of Mindfulness is similar to the action of a worker in mat and basket weaving who wishing to make coarse and fine mats boxes cases and the like should make those goods after getting a mammoth bamboo splitting it into four and reducing each of the parts to strips He did that after dividing into four the one mindfulness that is right ekameva sammasatim by way of the contemplation on the body on feelings on consciousness and on mental objects
Now the Blessed One desirous of bringing about diverse kinds of attainments of distinction in beings by the Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness began to teach the analytically explanatory portion niddesavara with the word And how o bhikkhus 
Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu  Here o bhikkhus a bhikkhu 
Here In this Dispensation of the Buddha which provides the basis for the person producing bodycontemplation in all modes By the word here dispensations other than the Buddhas are excluded as they do not teach bodycontemplation in the complete way it is taught in the Buddhadhamma
For this is said Here is the recluse untenanted by recluses are the other opposing ways of thought 
Araññagato va suññagaragato va  Gone to the forest or to an empty place  By this here is the making clear of the getting of an abode appropriate to the meditator for the culture of mindfulness
The mind of the meditator which for a long time had dwelt on visual and other objects does not like to enter the road of meditation and just like a wild young bull yoked to a cart runs off the road A cowherd wishing to tame a wild calf nourished entirely on the milk of a wild cow ties that calf after leading it away from the cow to a stout post firmly sunk in the ground at a spot set apart for it
That calf having jumped hither and thither and finding it impossible to run away from here will crouch down or lie down at that very post Even so must the bhikkhu who is desirous of taming the wild mind nourished long on the tasty drink of visible and other objects tie that mind to the post of the object of mindfulnessarousing with the rope of remembrance after leading the mind from visible and other objects and ushering it into a forest to the foot of a tree or into an empty place
The mind of the bhikkhu will also jump hither and thither Not obtaining the objects it had long grown used to and finding it impossible to break the rope of remembrance and run away it will finally sit or lie down at that every object by way of partial and full absorption
Therefore the men of old said
As one who wants to break a wild young calf Would tether it to stout stake firmly here
In the same way the yogi should tie fast To meditations object his own mind
In this way this abode becomes appropriate in the meditator
Therefore it is said This is the making clear of an abode appropriate to the meditator for the culture of mindfulness 
The Buddha is like a master of the science of building sites vatthu vijjacariya
As a master in the science of selecting building sites after seeing a stretch of ground good for building a town and after considering it well from all sides advises Build the town here and when the building of the town is happily completed receives high honor from the royal family so the Buddha having well considered from all points the abode suitable for the meditator advises Here should the subject of meditation be yoked on to
When arahantship is gradually reached by the yogi by the expression of the yogis gratitude and admiration with the words Certainly the Blessed One is the Supremely Awakened One the Master receives great honor
The bhikkhu indeed is comparable to a leopard
Just as a great king of leopards concealed in the forest in grassbush junglebush or hillthicket seizes wild buffaloes elks pigs and other beasts this bhikkhu yoking himself to the subject of meditation gains the Four Real Paths and Fruits cattaro magge ceva ariyaphalani ganhati one after another in succession
and therefore the men of old said
As leopard in ambush lies and captures beasts So does this son of the Awakened One
The striving man the man of vision keen
Having into the forest gone seize therein Fruition that truly is supreme
And so the Blessed One pointing out the forest abode the fit place for speedy exertion in the practice of meditation said Gone to the forest and so forth
Indeed to that yogi training in respirationmindfulness according to the method taught thus He thinking I breathe in long understands when he is breathing in long Calming the activity of the body I breathe out thinking thus he trains himself digham va assasanto digham assasamiti pajanati passambhayam kayasankharam passasissamiti sikkhati the four absorptions cattari jhanani arise in the respiration sign assasapassasanimitte uppajjanti
Having emerged from the absorption he lays hold of either the respiration body or the factors of absorption
There the meditating worker in respiration assasapassasa kammika examines the body thinking thus Supported by what is respiration Supported by the basis vatthunissita The basis is the coarse body karajja kaya The coarse body is composed of the Four Great Primaries and the corporeality derived from these cattari mahabhutani upadarupañca  Thereupon he the worker in respiration cognizes the mind in the pentad of mental concomitants beginning with senseimpression The worker in respiration examines the mind and the body sees the Dependent Origination of ignorance and so forth and concluding that this mind and this body are bare conditions and things produced from conditions and that besides these there is neither a living being nor a person becomes to that extent a person who transcends doubt And the yogi who has transcended doubt while cultivating insight applies the three characteristics of impermanence suffering and soullessness to the mind and body together with the conditions and gradually reaches arahantship sappaccaya nama rupe tilakkhanam aropetva vipassanam vaddhento anukkamena arahattam papunati 
The worker in absorption namely he who contemplates upon the factors of absorption also thinks thus Supported by what are these factors of absorption By the basis
The basis is the coarse body The factors of absorption are here representative of the mind The coarse body is the body Having determined thus he searching for the reason of the mind and the body seeks it in Conditions Mode beginning with ignorance concludes that this mind and the body comprise just conditions and things produced by conditions and that besides these there is neither a living being nor a person and becomes to that extent a person who transcends doubt And the yogi who transcends doubt thus while cultivating insight applies the three characteristics of impermanence suffering and soullessness to the mind and the body together with conditions and gradually reaches arahantship
Iti ajjhattam va kaye kayanupassi viharati  Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally This bhikkhu dwells in contemplation of the body in his own respiration body
Bahiddha va kaye kayanupassi viharati  Or he lives contemplating the body in the body externally Or this bhikkhu dwells in contemplation of the body in anothers respirationbody
Ajjhattabahiddha va kaye kayanupassi viharati  Or he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and externally At one time in his own and at another in anothers respirationbody he dwells in contemplation of the body
By this there is reference to the time when the yogis mind moves repeatedly back and forth without laying aside the familiar subject of meditation kalena attano kalena parassa assasapassasakaye etenassa pagunakammatthanam atthapetva aparaparam sañcarana kalo kathito 
Both cannot occur at once eka kale pana idam ubbayam na labbhati 
Samudayadhammanupassi va kayasamim viharati  He lives contemplating originationthings in the body Just as the air moves back and forth depending on the smiths bellows skin the bellows spout and appropriate effort so depending on the coarse body nasal aperture and the mind of the bhikkhu the respirationbody moves back and forth
The things beginning with the body are origination kayadayo dhamma samudayo The person who sees thus is he who lives contemplating originationthings in the body
Vayadhammanupassi va kayasmim viharati  Or he lives contemplating dissolutionthings in the body In whatever way the air does not proceed when the bellows skin is taken off the bellows spout is broken and the appropriate exertion is absent even in that same way when the body breaks up the nasal aperture is destroyed and the mind has ceased to function the respirationbody does not go on Thus through the ending of the coarse body the nasal aperture and the mind there comes to be the ending of the respirations kayadinirodha assasapassasanirodho The person who sees in this way is he who lives contemplating dissolutionthings in the body
Samudayavayadhammanupassi va kayasmim viharati  Or he lives contemplating originationanddissolutionthings in the body He lives contemplating origination at one time and dissolution at another kalena samudayam kalena vayam anupassanto
Atthi kayoti va panassa sati paccupatthita hoti  Or indeed his mindfulness is established with the thought The body exists Mindfulness is established for the yogi through careful scrutiny He thinks There is the body but there is no being no person no woman no man no soul nothing pertaining to a soul no I nothing that is mine no one and nothing belonging to anyone kayoti ca attli na satto na puggalo na itthi na puriso na atta na attaniyam naham na mama na koci na kassaciti evam assa sati paccupatthita hoti
Yavadeva  To the extent necessary It denotes purpose
This is said The mindfulness established is not for another purpose What is the purpose for which it is established
Nanamattaya patissatimattaya  For just knowledge and remembrance That is just for the sake of a wider and wider or further and further measure of knowledge and of mindfulness aparaparam uttaruttari ñanapamanatthaya ceva satipamanatthayaca For the increase of mindfulness and clear comprehension is the meaning
Anissito ca viharati  And he lives independent He lives emancipated from dependence on craving and wrong views
Na ca kiñci loke upadiyati  And clings to naught in the world In regard to no visible shape or consciousness does he think this is my soul or this belongs to my soul
Evampi  Thus also With this expression the Blessed One wound up the instruction on the section on breathing
In this section on breathing the mindfulness which examines the respirations is the Truth of Suffering
The precraving which brings about that mindfulness is the Truth of Origination The nonoccurrence of both is the Truth of Cessation The Real Path which understands suffering abandons origination and takes cessation as object is the Truth of the Way
Thus having endeavored by way of the Four Truths a person arrives at peace This is the portal to emancipation of the bhikkhu devoted to meditation on breathing
The Buddha after dealing in the aforesaid manner with bodycontemplation in the form of respirationmeditation in detail said And further in order to deal exhaustively with bodycontemplation here according to the meditation on the modes of deportment iriyapatha
Gacchanto va gacchamiti pajanati  When he is going understands I am going  In this matter of going readily do dogs jackals and the like know when they move on that they are moving
But this instruction on the modes of deportment was not given concerning similar awareness
because awareness of that sort belonging to animals does not shed the belief in a living being does not knock out the percept of a soul and neither becomes a subject of meditation nor the development of the Arousing of Mindfulness
But the knowledge of this meditator sheds the belief in a living being knocks out the idea of a soul and is both a subject of meditation and the development of the Arousing of Mindfulness
Indeed who goes whose going is it on what account is this going These words refer to the knowledge of the going of the meditating bhikkhu
In the elucidation of these questions the following is said Who goes No living being or person whatsoever
Whose going is itNot the going of any living being or person
On account of what does the going take place On account of the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity
Because of that this yogi knows thus If there arises the thought I shall go that thought produces the process of oscillation the process of oscillation produces expression  The moving on of the whole body through the diffusion of the process of oscillation is called going
The same is the method of exposition as regards the other postures standing and so forth
There too the yogi knows thus If there arises the thought I shall stand that thought produces the process of oscillation The process of oscillation produces bodily expression The raising upright of the whole body from below owing to the diffusion of the process of oscillation is called standing
If there arises the thought I shall sit that thought produces the process of oscillation The process of oscillation produces bodily expression The bending of the lower part of the body and the raising upright of the upper part of the body owing to the diffusion of the process of oscillation is called sitting
If there arises the thought I shall lie down that thought produces the process of oscillation The process of oscillation produces bodily expression The straightening or the spreading of the whole body horizontally or across owing to the diffusion of the process of oscillation is called lying down
He who knows pursues the line of thinking in the following manner A living being goes A living being stands 
but there is no living being going or standing
This talk of a living being going or standing is similar to speech in the following way A cart goes A cart stands In fact there is no going cart and no standing cart
When with bulls a skilled driver is driving one conventionally speaking says A cart goes or A cart stands In the sense of a thing not able to go of itself the body is like the cart
Mindborn oscillation are like the bulls
Mind is like the driver
When the thought I go or the thought I stand arises the process of oscillation producing expression comes to existence By the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity going and the other modes of deportment take place
and then there are these forms of conventional speech A living being goes A living being stands I go I stand
Therefore the commentator said
Just as a ship goes on by winds impelled Just as a shaft goes by the bowstrings force
So goes this body in its forward course Full driven by the vibrant thrust of air
As to the puppets back the dodgethreads tied So to the bodydoll the mind is joined
And pulled by that the body moves stands sits
Where is the living being that without conditions that give it support
can stand or walk by force of its own inner strength
Accordingly this yogi who considers by way of causes and conditions the states of going standing and so forth knows well that he is going when he is in the state of going that he is standing when he stands that he is sitting when he sits and that he is lying down when he lies down as it is told in the passage in the discourse beginning with the words When he is going a bhikkhu understands I am going
Yatha yatha va panassa kayo panihito hoti tatha tatha nam pajanati  Or just as his body is disposed so he understands it
Iti ajjhattam va  Thus internally In this way the bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in the body examining his own four modes of deportment
Bahiddha va  Or externally Or examining the four modes of deportment of another
Ajjhattabahiddha va  Or internally and externally Or examining at one time his own four modes of deportment and at another time anothers four modes of deportment he lives
Samudayadhammanupassi  Contemplating originationthings Also dissolutionthings are included here Origination and dissolution should be dwelt upon by way of the fivefold method beginning with the words He thinking the origination of materiality comes to be through the origination of ignorance in the sense of the origin of conditions sees the arising of the aggregate of materiality
Atthi kayoti va panassa sati paccupatthita hoti  Or indeed his mindfulness is established with the thought The body exists  The exposition of this is to be done in the manner already stated in the preceding section
Here the mindfulness which examines the four modes of deportment is the Truth of Suffering The precraving which brings about that mindfulness is the Truth of Origination The nonoccurrence of either is the Truth of Cessation The Real Path which understands suffering abandons origination and takes cessation as object is the Truth of the Way
The yogi having endeavored thus by way of the Four Truths arrives at peace This is the portal to emancipation up to arahantship of the bhikkhu occupied with the four modes of deportment
Clear comprehension in going forwards and backwards After explaining bodycontemplation in the form of the meditation on the four modes of deportment the Master said And further to explain bodycontemplation by way of the four kinds of clear comprehension catu sampajañña 
Abhikkante patikkante  In going forwards in going backwards Here the meaning is as follows  Going forwards is called going
Going backwards is called turning back
Both these are to be found in all the four modes of deportment
First in going carrying the body to a position in front  bringing the body along  is called going forwards
Turning back  returning thence  is called turning back
And in standing one just standing and bending the body to a position in front does what is called going forwards
and one bending away behind  drawing back  does what is called going backwards
In sitting down one sitting and moving on  creeping on sliding on  to front portion comprising the frame and so forth of the seat i e  chair stool or similar thing does going forwards
and one moving away  sliding back  to the parts comprising the frame and so forth at the back of the chair or stool does what is called turning back
In lying down too the explanation is to be done according to the method stated above
Sampajanakari  Practicing clear comprehension Doing without fail all actions with clear comprehension sampajaññena sabba kicca kari Or the doing of only clear comprehension sampajaññasseva va kari 
For the yogi practices only clear comprehension and is nowhere bereft of clear comprehension in going forwards and going backwards
There are these four kinds of comprehension clear comprehension of purpose satthaka sampajañña of suitability sappaya sampajañña of resort gocara sampajañña and of nondelusion asammoha sampajañña
Among these four kinds of clear comprehension the clear comprehension of purpose is the comprehension of purpose after considering what is worthy and not worthy with the thought Is there any use to one by this going or is there not One does this not having gone immediately just by the influence of the thought at the very moment the thought of going forwards is born
In this context purpose is growth according to the Dhamma by way of visiting a relic shrine Tree of Enlightenment  the Sangha the elders and a place where the dead are cast for seeing the unlovely 
By visiting a relic shrine a Bodhi Tree or the Sangha for producing spiritual interest and by meditating on the waning of that interest one could reach arahantship
by visiting elders and by getting established in their instruction one could reach arahantship and by visiting a place where the dead are cast by seeing a corpse there and by producing the first absorption pathamajjhana in that unlovely object one could reach arahantship
So the visiting of these is purposeful
Some keci however say Increase by way of material gain too is purpose since material gain is helpful for the holy life
Clear comprehension of suitability is the comprehension of the suitable after considering what is suitable and not
For instance the visiting of a relic shrine could be quite purposeful
But when a great offering is made to a relic shrine a multitude of people in a ten or twelve yojana area gather
and men and women according to their position go about adorned like painted figures
And if in that crowd greed could arise for the bhikkhu in an attractive object resentment in a nonattractive one and delusion through prejudice if he could commit the offence of sexual intercourse or if harm could come to the holy life of purity then a place like that relic shrine would not be suitable
When there could be no such harm it would be suitable
The visiting of the Sangha is a purpose of worth
Still when there is allnight preaching in a big pandal in the inner village and there are crowds and one could possibly come to hurt and harm in the way mentioned earlier that place of preaching is not suitable to go to
When there is no hurt or harm possible one may go there as it would then be suitable
In visiting elders who are surrounded by a large following suitability and nonsuitability should also be determined in the way stated above
To visit a place where the dead are cast for beholding a corpse is fit
and to explain the meaning of this the following story has been told It is said that a young bhikkhu went with a novice to get wood for toothcleaners
The novice getting out of the road proceeded in front to a place in search of wood and saw a corpse Meditating on it he produced the first absorption and making the factors of the absorption a basis for developing insight realized the first three fruitions of arahantship while examining the conformations sankhare sammasanto and stood having laid hold of the subject of meditation for realizing the path of full arahantship
The young bhikkhu not seeing the novice called out to him
The novice thought thus From the day I took up the homeless life I have endeavored to let me never be called twice by a bhikkhu
so I will produce the further distinction another day and replied to the bhikkhu with the words Whats the matter reverend sir
Come said the bhikkhu and the novice returned The novice told the bhikkhu as follows Go first by this way then stand facing north at the place I stood for a while and look
The young bhikkhu followed the novices instruction and attained just the distinction reached by the novice
Thus the same corpse became profitable to two people
For the male the female corpse is not suitable
and vice versa Only a corpse of ones own sex is suitable Comprehension of what is suitable in this way is called the clear comprehension of suitability
Further the going on the alms round of that one who has thus comprehended purpose and suitability after leaving and taking up just that resort  among the thirtyeight subjects of meditation  called the subject of meditation after his own heart is clear comprehension of resort
For making manifest this clear comprehension of resort the following set of four should be understood
In the Dispensation of the Buddha a certain bhikkhu on the journey out for alms takes along with him in the mind the subject of meditation but on the journey back from the work of almsgathering he does not bring it along with him having become unmindful of it Another does not take it along with him on the outward journey but returns from the almstour with the subject of meditation in his mind Still another neither takes it along with him on the outward journey nor returns with it on the journey home And lastly there is the fourth kind of bhikkhu who both takes the subject of meditation along with him on the journey out for alms and brings it back with him on the journey home
Among these four kinds there is a certain bhikkhu who lives thus  By day he cleanses his mind of things that becloud  the hindrances nivarana  through meditation on the ambulatory and in the sitting posture By night likewise on the ambulatory and in the sitting posture through meditation in the first watch and in the last watch he cleanses his mind of things that becloud after sleeping in the middle watch Quite early in the day having done the duties connected with the terraces of the relicshrine and the Bhodhitree  sweeping and so forth  he sprinkles the Bodhitree with water places water for drinking and washing and attends to the Khandhaka duties beginning with the duties connected with the teacher and the preceptor
Thereafter having looked to the needs of his body  he enters his dwelling and practices the subject of meditation begun that day tadahe mula bhutam kammatthanam at several sittings dve tayo pallanke usumam gahapento  during two or three sittings while the body happens to be put into a state of warming up When it is time to wander for alms he having got up from the sitting meditationpose and takes his bowl and robe with just the thought of meditation uppermost in mind kammatthana siseneva leaves his dwelling attending only to the thought of meditation kammatthanam manasikarontova  If when going to his alms collecting place the bhikkhus thought of meditation is contemplation on the Buddhas qualities buddhanussati kammatthanam he on arriving at the relicshrine enters the shrines precincts without having put aside his thought of meditation on the Buddha
But should his thought of meditation be something other than the Buddhasubject he having stood at the foot of the stairway leading to the shrineterrace put by his thought of meditation as if it were goods handcarried and acquired the joy begotten of the Buddhasubject of meditation goes up the stairway If the relicshrine is a big one it should be worshipped at four places when the bhikkhu has gone round it three times to the right
If it is a small shrine it should be worshipped by the meditator in eight places when he has gone round it three times to the right just as in the case of the big shrine
By a bhikkhu who having worshipped a relicshrine has reached a Bodhitree shrine even the Bodhitree should be worshipped And he should worship the Bodhitree showing meek demeanour as though he were in the very presence of the Buddha the Bhagava
In this way that monk having worshipped relicshrine and Boddhitree shrine goes to the place where he had put by his first subject of meditation namely to the bottom of the stairway There having taken up the subject of meditation he had put by earlier and robed himself  near the village with the thought of meditation uppermost in mind he enters the village for alms
There people after seeing the bhikkhu say Our venerable one has come and having gone forward to meet the bhikkhu taken his bowl conducted him to the sittinghall or to a house and made him take a seat offer gruel to him Thereafter they wash and anoint his feet and till rice is ready sit in front of him and ask him questions or become desirous of listening to a talk on the Dhamma from him
Even if the people do not ask him to speak to them on the Dhamma the commentators say that a talk on the Dhamma should be given to the people in order to help them The bhikkhus should expound the Dhamma
There is no Dhammatalk separate from the thought of meditation
Therefore after expounding the Dhamma even with the thought of meditation uppermost in mind after partaking of the food with just the thought of meditation uppermost in mind he leaves the village followed by the people who in spite of his requesting them to stop accompanying him There after turning back those who followed him he takes the road to his dwellingplace
Then novices and young bhikkhus who had taken their meal outside the village having left the village earlier than this bhikkhu see this bhikkhu coming And they after going forward to meet him take his bowl and robe
It is said that bhikkhus of old did this duty without looking at the face of the returning bhikkhu and thinking our preceptor our teacher
In ancient times they did this duty according to the arrivinglimit 
Those novices and young bhikkhus question the elder thus Reverend Sir who are these people to you Are they relatives on the maternal side Are they relatives on the paternal side
 Having seen what do you query
 Their affection and respect for you
 Friends what even parents find it hard to do these people do for us Our very robes and bowls are just due to them Owing to these people we know no fear on occasions of fear and know no lack of food on occasions of famine There are no people so helpful to us as these folk Speaking well of these people thus he goes This bhikkhu is spoken of as a person who carries forth the subject of meditation when he leaves his dwelling but does not return with the thought of meditation
If to a bhikkhu who performs the duties detailed above betimes if his kammaproduced caloricity becomes very strong pajjalati lit flames up and lays hold of the derived assimilated material of the body owing to the absence of undigested food in the stomach if sweat exudes from his body and if he is unable to concentrate on his subject of meditation he takes his bowl and the robe quite early in the morning worships the relic shrine speedily and enters the village to get gruel just when the village herds go out of their pens for pasturing After he gets the gruel he goes to sittinghall and drinks it
Then with the swallowing of just two or three mouthfuls the kammaproduced caloricity letting go the material of the body  ie the inner lining of the stomach udara patalam lays hold of the property of the food taken in
And that bhikkhu having got to the assuagement of the distress of the caloric process like a man bathed with a hundred pots of cool water having partaken of the gruel with the thought of meditation uppermost in mind washed bowl and mouth attended to the subject of meditation till the later forenoon meal wandered for alms in the remaining places  in the places where he got no gruel and so where he could still go for alms  and taken the meal with just the thought of meditation uppermost in mind returns having taken up just that subject of meditation which is thence forward present in his mind This person is called the one who does not carry forth but returns with the thought of meditation
And bhikkhus like this one who after drinking gruel and exerting themselves in the development of insight reached the state of arahantship in the Buddhas Dispensation are past all numbering  In the Island of the Lion Race alone sihala dipe yeva there is not a seat of sittinghall in the various villages which is not a place where a bhikkhu having sat and drunk gruel attained arahantship tesu tesu gamesu asanasalaya na tam asanam atthi yattha yagum pivitva arahattam patta bhikkhu natthi
But a bhikkhu who is a loose liver pamada vihari lit liver in negligence carelessness or indolence who is a slacker nikkhitta dhuro lit One who has thrown away the yoke  or the burden of right exertion  and so is an irresponsible person having broken all observances sabba vattani bhinditva whilst living spiritually frozen through the fivefold bondage of mind pañca vidha ceto vinibandha baddha citto viharanto having entered the village for alms without having even shown a sign of the fact that there is a thing called a subject of meditation  and having walked about and eaten his meal in unbefitting company comes out of the village an empty fellow This bhikkhu is called a person who neither carries forth nor returns with the thought of meditation
Who is spoken of with the words This one carries forth and carries back must be known just through the means of the observance of carrying forth and carrying back 
Men of good family desirous of selfimprovement having become homeless ones in the Dispensation of the Buddha when living in a group of ten twenty fifty or a hundred make a covenant of observance with these words Friends you renounced not because you were troubled by creditors not because of fear of punishment from the king and not because of difficulties of subsistence produced by famine and the like but because you were desirous of release here Therefore you should restrain the defilement that is born when going just in the process of going you should restrain the defilement that is born when standing just in the process of standing you should restrain the defilement that is born when sitting just in the process of sitting and you should restrain the defilement that is born when lying down just in the process of lying down
When after the making of such a covenant of observance they go on to a village for alms if there are stones by the road at distances of halfanusabha one usabha and one gavuta
these bhikkhus proceed attending to the subject of meditation with awareness of those stones
If in the course of going a defilement of the mind arises in one just in the course of going one restrains or suppresses it
If one fails to do so one stops
Then he who comes behind one stops too
And one thinks This bhikkhu here knows the unclean thought that has arisen in you unbecoming is that to you Thus having reproved oneself and developed penetrative insight one steps into the Plane of the Noble Ones 
If one is not able to do that one sits down
and he who comes behind sits down too it is said that just is the method
Should one be not able to enter into the Plane of the Noble Ones then one having stopped the defilement goes attending to only the subject of meditation
One does not raise the foot with mind bereft of the subject of meditation
but should one do so one having turned gets back again even to the earlier step Like the elder Maha Phussa the verandahdweller
It is said that this elder dwelt for nineteen years fulfilling the observance of carrying forth and carrying back
Plowmen sowers threshers of grain and other people having seen the elder go in this manner said This elder goes having halted again and again
Why does he do so Has he got confused about the way or has he forgotten something
The elder by just doing the recluses duty with mind yoked to the thought of meditation without giving heed to the talk of the people attained arahantship within twenty years
On the very day be became an arahant a deva who was living at the end of the elders walking path stood emitting a radiance that came from the fingers of the deva
The Four Regents of the Earth Sakka the devaking and Brahma Sahampati came to serve the elder
Maha Tissa the forestdweller also an elder saw that radiance and inquired of the arahant the next day Last night there was a radiance about your reverence what was that 
Diverting the talk the arahant said Radiance is that of light of gem and the like
But on being pressed repeatedly with the words You are concealing he acknowledged saying Yes and informed Tissa of his attainment Like the elder Maha Naga of the Black Creeper Pavilion
He it is said when fulfilling the observance of carrying forth and back the subject of meditation resolved upon keeping to only the postures of standing and of walking for seven years with the thought I will honor the Blessed Ones great struggle
And after fulfilling for sixteen years again the observance of carrying forth and carrying back the subject of meditation he attained arahantship
This is said of him He raises his foot only with mind yoked to the subject of meditation If he raises with mind not yoked thus he turns back again After standing at such a distance from the village as would raise the doubt Is it indeed a cow or a recluse  and robing himself he fills his mouth with a draught of water from the watercarrier slung over the shoulder and hanging under the armpit having washed the bowl with water from the same source
For what reason does he fill his mouth so
He does it thinking Let there be no distraction of the mind even by the uttering of the words May you live long to people coming to worship me or give me alms
But when he is asked the question Reverend Sir which stage of the halfmonth is today concerning the date or when he is questioned about the number of monks he answers after swallowing the water
If there is no questioning about the day and so forth he having spat out the water at the village gate at the time of leaving goes Like the fifty bhikkhus who entered upon the rainy season residence at the Monastery of the Galamba Landing Place
On the fullmoon day of July  they made this covenant of observance  Without attaining arahantship we shall not converse with one another
These bhikkhus used to enter the village for alms filling the mouth with a draught of water
and when questioned about the date and so forth they acted just according to the method mentioned above
In that village people having seen the spots on which mouthfuls of water had been spurted forth by the returning bhikkhus said Today one came today two
And those people thought What indeed is the reason that these bhikkhus neither talk with us nor with each other If they do not speak with each other surely they are persons who have had a dispute amongst themselves and saying Come we must make them forgive one another went  in a body  to the monastery There they saw that no two bhikkhus were in the same place
Then a wise man in that crowd said Good people a place which quarrelsome folk occupy is not like this The relicshrine and the Bodhishrine terraces are well swept The brooms are well arranged And water for drinking and water for washing are well set
Then those people just turned back And the bhikkhu of that monastery attained arahantship within three months and performed a Pure Pavarana ceremony
Thus like the elder Maha Naga dweller in the Black Creeper Pavilion and like the bhikkhus who went into rainy season at the Galamba Ford Monastery the bhikkhu raises his foot only with mind yoked to the thought of meditation Having reached the neighbourhood of the village filled the mouth with a draught of water and looked at the streets he enters the street where there are no quarrelsome drunkards gamesters and such folk or where there are no restive elephants horses and the like
There wandering for alms he does not go speedily like one in a great hurry
since there is no ascetic practice of begging food speedily
He goes rather having become motionless like a water cart on uneven ground
Entering into each house in order spending such time as is suitable for concluding whether there is or not the tendency to offer alms  he receives alms and comes to the inner village outer village or even to the monastery There he seats himself in a place pleasant and good  attends to the thought of meditation with the setting up of the perception of loathsomeness in food and reflects by way of the similes of axlegreasing applying ointment to ulcer and feeding on own childs flesh and eats the food fully followed with awareness of the eight attributes not for sport intoxication adornment or the filling up of those places of his body that have a deficiency of flesh
And he having eaten washes Then he rests for a while the body that is tired with the business of eating He attends to just the thought of meditation in the time after eating as in the time before eating
and in the last watch of the night as in the first watch This person is called one who carries forth and carries back the subject of meditation
The person who fulfills this observance of one who carries forth and carries back called the carrying forth when going out for alms and the bringing back when returning from the almsround reaches arahantship even in the period of youth  if he is possessed of the sufficing condition
the wherewithal to accomplish the destruction of ignorance and its defilements
If he fails to reach arahantship in early age then he reaches it in middle age
if he fails in middle age
then at the time of death
if he fails at the time of death then after becoming a deva
if he fails as a deva then at a time when no Buddha has appeared on earth he is born as a man and realizes the truth as a Buddha who is not able to communicate the truth to others
and if he fails to realize the truth in that way then immediately on meeting a Fully Enlightened Buddha he becomes a person who intuits quickly like the elder Bahiya Daruciriya or a greatly wise one like the elder Sariputta or one of great psychic power like the elder Mogallana the Great or an exponent of ascetic practice like the elder Kassapa the Great or one endowed with clairvoyant power like the elder Anuruddha or an expert in discipline like the elder Upali or an expounder of the Dhamma like the elder Punna Mantaniputta or a forest dweller like the elder Revata or one of great learning like the elder Ananda or one desirous of training like the elder Rahula the Buddhas son
Amongst these four that form the set he who carries forth and carries back the subject of meditation reaches the crest of the clear comprehension of resort
Further nonconfusion in going forwards and so forth is the clear comprehension of nondelusion
That should be understood in the following way  In this Dispensation a monk without confusing himself like a blinded worldling who while going forwards or backwards becomes muddleheaded and believes thus The soul goes forward or The act of going forwards is produced by the soul or I go forwards or The act of going forwards is produced by me and the like
thinks When there is the arising in one of the thought I am going forwards just with that thought appears the process of oscillation originating from mind which brings to birth bodily expression  Thus by the way of the diffusion of the process of oscillation due to mental activity this skeleton called the body goes forward In raising up the foot A paduddharane two processes dhatuyo extension pathavi and cohesion apo are low weak omatta honti dubbala and the other two processes caloricity tejo and oscillation vayo are high powerful adhimatta honti balavatiyo so too in stretching out the foot B atiharane and in shifting away the foot C vitiharane
But in dropping down the raised foot D vossajjane the first two processes are high and powerful and the second low and weak
and likewise in keeping the foot on the ground E sannikkhepane and in pressing the foot against the ground F sannirumbhane
There the material and mental phenomena in A do not occur in B
those in B do not occur in C those in C do not occur in D those in D do not occur in E those in E do not occur in F
These phenomena after coming into existence in the form of several sections links and parts break quickly just in those places crackling like sesamum seeds thrown into a heated pan
In this matter who is the one that goes forward
or whose going forward is there
In the highest sense what takes place is the going the standing the sitting down and the lying down of the processes With material form in the several divisions 
One conscious state arises And quite another ceases
In sequence like a rivers flow These states go 
Clear comprehension in looking straight on and in looking away from the front Here looking straight on alokitam  seeing in the direction in front of oneself purato pekkhanam
Looking away from the front vilokitam  Looking out in all other directions anudisa pekkhanam
And other kinds of seeing by way of turning the eye in the direction above in the direction beneath and in the direction behind are called looking upwards looking downwards and looking backwards Here those are not taken
But just these two  looking straight on and looking away from the front  are taken by way of what is befitting Or by this method it is said all those are also taken 
Here the comprehending of purpose  without having just looked by the force of the thought when the thought I shall look straight on arises is clear comprehension of purpose
That should be understood by making the venerable elder Nanda the example of a person who perceives through experience by the body kaya sakkhi
The following is stated in this connection Should looking straight on in the eastern direction become a thing that must be done by Nanda he looks straight on in the eastern direction having reflected with all his mind thus May no covetous griefproducing mean unskillful mental phenomena flow upon me while I am looking in the eastern direction
There he becomes mindful thus
Further purposefulness and suitability here too should be understood just according to the manner in which they are explained in connection with the worshipping of a relic shrine and so forth
Because clear comprehension of resort is just the keeping to the course of meditation
looking straight on and looking away from the front should be done just according to each persons meditation with the thought of meditation uppermost in mind
Within it is said there certainly is no self or soul which looks straight on or looks away from the front Still at the arising of the thought I shall look straight on and with that thought the process of oscillation originating from mind citta samutthana bringing into being bodily expression viññatti arises
Thus owing to the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity cittakiriyavayodhatu vipphara the lower eyelid goes down and the upper eyelid goes up Surely there is no one who opens with a contrivance Thereupon eyeconsciousness arises fulfilling the function of sight tato cakkhu viññanam dassana kiccam sadhentam uppajjati it is said
Clear comprehension of this kind here is indeed called the clear comprehension of nondelusion evam sampajananam panettha asammoha sampajaññam nama
Further clear comprehension of nondelusion should be also understood here through accurate knowledge of the root  through the casual state and through the temporary state tavakalika bhava
First by way of the accurate knowledge of the root 
There is the mental state of the lifecontinum And there are adverting seeing receiving
Considering determining and impulsion Which is seventh 
There in the course of cognition the lifecontinum goes on fulfilling the function of a factor of the rebirthprocess tattha bhavangam upapatti bhavassa anga kiccam sadhayamanam pavattati after the turning round of the lifecontinum a barely active mind process fulfilling the function of adverting or attending to an object at the sensedoor of the eye goes on tam avattetva kiriya mano dhatu avajjana kiccam sadhayamana from the cessation of that fulfilling the function of seeing eyeconsciousness goes on tannirodha cakkhu viññanam dassana kiccam sadhayamana from the cessation of that a resultant mind process fulfilling the function of receiving goes on tannirodha vipaka mano dhatu sampaticchanna kiccam sadhayamana from the cessation of that a resultant mind consciousness process fulfilling the function of considering goes on tannirodha vipaka mano viññana dhatu santirana kiccam sadhyamana from the cessation of that a barely active mind consciousness process fulfilling the function of determining goes on tannirodha kiriya mano viññana dhatu votthapana kiccam sadhayamana from the cessation of that an impulsion impels seven times tannirodha sattakkhattum javanam javati
Now among the mental states of the lifecontinum and so forth or even in the mental state of the first impulsion there is no looking straight on or looking away from the front by way of lust hatred or ignorance by him who sees in any direction
Also there is no such stained vision by him in the mental state of the second impulsion the third the fourth the fifth sixth or even in the seventh impulsion
But when like soldiers in a battlefield the mental states after breakingup gradually are fallen one atop of another there takes place looking straight on or looking away from the front by way of lust hate and ignorance accompanied by the discriminatory thought This is a woman or This is a man much in the same way as the fallen are distinguished after a battle for in the frenzy of fighting there is no room for recognition of the individuals engaged in the fray
Thus here in the first instance clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood by way of the accurate knowledge of the root 
On an object falling within reach of consciousness at the eyedoor impulsion arises right at the very end when from the movement of the lifecontinum onwards the states of adverting seeing receiving considering and determining having arisen have ceased
That impulsion is like a visitor at the eyedoor which is comparable to a house belonging to the states of adverting and the rest mentioned above born there before the arising of impulsion
As it is not fit for a visitor who has arrived at a strange house for the purpose of getting some assistance from the owners of the house to do any kind of ordering when the owners themselves are silent
so it is unfit for impulsion to be involved in lust hate and ignorance at the eyedoor house of adverting and the other states of mind when those states of mind are themselves not lusting hating or bound up with ignorance Clear comprehension of nondelusion should thus be known by way of the casual state
At the eyedoor the mental states that close with the state of determining arise and break up together with associated phenomena at just those places on which they arise They do not see each other Therefore the mental states that close with determining are brief and temporary
There as in a house of the dead where here is one more to die just at that very instant it is not proper for that one who is to die to be given to delight in dancing and singing and the like even so at a sensedoor when the states of adverting and the rest with associated phenomena have died just where they arose it is not fit for the remaining impulsion that is to die shortly to take delight in anything by way of lust and the like Clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood thus by way of the temporary state 
And further this clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood by way of the reflection on the aggregates bases processes and conditions
To be sure here eye and visible object are materialityaggregate seeing is consciousnessaggregate feeling that is associated with seeing is feelingaggregate perceiving is perceptionaggregate and those beginning with senseimpression are formationaggregate
Thus lookingstraightonandlookingawayfromthefront is seen in the combination of these five aggregates
There who singly looks straight on Who looks away from the front 
In the same way eye is eyebase visible object is materialitybase seeing is mindbase feeling and so forth the associated things are thingbase
Thus lookingstraightonandlookingawayfromthefront is seen in the combination of these four bases
There who singly looks straight on Who looks away from the front
Likewise eye is eyeprocess visible object is materialityprocess seeing is eyeconsciousnessprocess and the things beginning with feeling associated with eyeconsciousness are mindprocess
Thus lookingstraightonandlookingawayfromthefront is seen in the combination of these four processes
There who singly looks straight on Who looks away from the front
Exactly in the manner already stated eye is supportcondition visible object is objectcondition adverting is condition of proximity contiguity decisivesupport absence and disappearance light is condition of decisivesupport and those beginning with feeling are conascencecondition
Thus looking straightonandlookingawayfromthefront is seen in the combination of these conditions
There who singly looks straight on Who looks away from the front 
Here in this way by reflection on the aggregates bases processes and conditions too clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood
Clear comprehension in the bending and the stretching of limbs Sammiñjite pasarite  in bending and in stretching In the bending and the stretching of the joints
The consideration of purpose and lack of purpose in regard to any contemplated act of bending or stretching and the taking up of that which is purposeful after not bending and stretching according to merely the minds inclination is clear comprehension of purpose
In this matter a person who experiences pain every moment due to standing long with bent or stretched hands or feet does not get concentration of mind  his subject of meditation entirely falls away and he does not obtain distinction 
But he who bends or stretches his hands and feet for the proper length of time does not experience pain gets concentration of mind develops his subject of meditation and attains distinction Thus the comprehension of purpose and nonpurpose should be known
Clear comprehension of suitability is the comprehension of the suitable after considering the suitable and the nonsuitable even in a matter that is purposeful
In this connection the following is the method of explanation It is said that on the terrace of the Great Relic Shrine while young bhikkhus were rehearsing the doctrine
young bhikkhunis standing at the back of the bhikkhus were listening to the rehearsal
Then a young bhikkhu came into bodily contact with a bhikkhuni while stretching out his hand and by just that fact became a layman
Another bhikkhu in stretching his foot stretched it into fire and his foot got burnt to the bone
Another stretched his foot on an anthill and was bitten in the foot by a poisonous snake
Another bhikkhu stretched out his hand till it rested on the pole of a robetent a ribbonsnake on the pole bit the hand of that bhikkhu
Therefore the stretching of ones limbs should be done in a suitable and not an unsuitable place
This should be understood here as clear comprehension of suitability 
Clear comprehension of resort should indeed be illustrated by the story of the senior bhikkhu called Great Elder It is said that Great Elder seated in his dayquarters bent his arm quickly whilst talking to his resident pupils and then after putting back his arm to the position in which it first was bent it again slowly
The resident pupils questioned him thus Reverend Sir why after bending the arm quickly did you having placed it in the position in which it first was bend it slowly
Friends until now I did not bend this arm with a mind separate from the subject of meditation ever since I began to attend to the subject of meditation Therefore having put back the arm in the place it was first in I bent
Good Reverend Sir A bhikkhu should be one who acts thus
Here too it should be understood that the nonabandoning of the subject of meditation is clear comprehension of resort 
Within there is no soul that bends or stretches
By the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity bending and stretching occur Indeed here it should be understood that the knowing in this way is clear comprehension of nondelusion
Clear comprehension in wearing shouldercloak and so forth Sanghati patta civara dharane  In wearing the shouldercloak the other robes and the bowl
In this connection purpose is what accrues materially to one on the almsround and what is stated by the Blessed One according to the method beginning with the words for keeping out cold for keeping out heat
Suitable to one who is naturally warmbodied is fine clothing and that is suitable to one who is weak too
To the susceptible to cold is suitable thick clothing made of two pieces of cloth laid one over the other and stitched together 
Nonsuitable to these is clothing contrary to the kind mentioned above
A wornout robe is indeed not suitable
as that robe will even be hindrancecausing when one patches and sews or darns it
Likewise hindrancecausing are robes of silk fine hemp and similar material that stimulate cupidity
For to the lonedweller in the forest such robes are productive of loss of clothing and of life 
The robe acquired by wrong means of livelihood and the robe which decreases the good and increases the bad in the one who wears it are irreversibly not suitable 
Here from the foregoing clear comprehension of the suitable and the nonsuitable should be understood as the holding fast to the line of meditative thought by way of the nonabandoning of the line of contemplation which the commentator is going to state vakkhamana kammatthanassa avijahana vasena clear comprehension of resort should be understood
Within there is nothing called a soul that robes itself
According to the method of exposition adopted already only by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity does the act of robing take place
The robe has no power to think and the body too has not that power
The robe is not aware of the fact that it is draping the body
and the body too of itself does not think I am being draped round with the robe Mere processes clothe a processheap in the same way that a modelled figure is covered with a piece of cloth
Therefore there is neither room for elation on getting a fine robe nor for depression on getting one that is not fine 
Some honor an anthill where a cobra de capello lives a treeshrine and so forth with garlands perfumes incense cloth and similar things Others maltreat these objects Anthill treeshrine and the like are however neither elated by the good nor depressed by the bad treatment Just in the same way there should be no elation on receiving a good robe or depression on getting a bad one Clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood in this connection as the proceeding of reflective thought in this way
And in using the bowl clear comprehension of purpose should be understood by way of the benefit obtainable through the action of one who takes the bowl unhurriedly and thinks Going out to beg with this I shall get alms
To one with a lean body which is weak a heavy bowl is not suitable
And not suitable is a damaged bowl that is tied with thread and stopped in four or five places and hard to wash properly
A bowl that is hard to wash well certainly is not fit There will be inconvenience caused to him who washes that kind of bowl 
A bright bowl which shines like a gem and therefore is capable of stimulating the cupidity of others is not suitable for the same reasons given in regard to robes of silk fine hemp and so forth
Just irreversibly unsuitable are the bowl acquired by wrong means of livelihood and the bowl by which good decreases and evils increase
Through this explanation clear comprehension of suitability in this connection should be understood And by the fact even of the holding fast to the subject of meditation should clear comprehension of resort be understood
Within there is nothing called a self that is taking the bowl
As stated already by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity there is the taking of the bowl
In this matter of taking the bowl the bowl cannot think Hands too cannot think
The bowl does not cognize that it is taken by the hands
Hands do not cognize that the bowl is taken by them
Just processes take a processheap It is comparable to the taking of a redhot vessel with a pair of tongs By way of the proceeding of reflective thought in this way clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood in bowltaking
And further it is like this When kindly people see in a refuge for the helpless unfortunate persons with hands and feet cut off and with blood pus and many maggots in the open wounds and give to the unfortunate persons bandages and medicine in containers
some of the miserable sufferers in the refuge may get thick bandages and containers not shapely
others may get thin bandages and shapely containers None of the sufferers will feel elated or depressed about the kind of bandages and containers they receive
That is because they merely want cloth to cover their wounds and containers for keeping medicine Now the bhikkhu who regards the robe as a bandage the bowl as a medicinecontainer and almsfood as medicine in the bowl
through clear comprehension of nondelusion should be taken as a person endowed with the highest clear comprehension 
Clear comprehension in the partaking of food and drink As to purpose there is the eightfold purpose referred to with the words Not for sport and so forth in the formula of reflection on the four requisites of a bhikkhu
As such should clear comprehension of purpose be known
Nonsuitable to one is the food by which to that one there is discomfort whatever the food may be in quality or taste coarse or fine or bitter or sweet or anything else Suitable is food that does not cause discomfort
Just irreversibly nonsuitable are these the food acquired by wrong means of livelihood and the food by which good decreases and evils increase in one who partakes of it
Food which is got by right means and food which does not cause decrease of good and increase of evil in the one taking it are suitable
In this matter of the partaking of food clear comprehension of suitability should be understood according to the explanation given above and the clear comprehension of resort should be understood by way of the nonabandoning of the subject of meditation
Within there is no eater called a self As stated already by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity only there is the receiving of food in the bowl
by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity only there is the descent of the hand into the bowl
and by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity only the making of the food into suitable lumps the raising of the lumps from the bowl and the opening of the mouth take place
No one opens the jaws with a key No one opens the jaws with a contrivance Just by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity take place the putting of a lump of food in the mouth the pestleaction of the upper row of teeth the mortarwork of the lower row of teeth and the tongues activity comparable to that of the hand collecting together material that is being crushed
Thus that lump of food in the mouth is mixed together with the thin saliva at the end of the tongue and the thick saliva at the root of the tongue
That food in the mortar of the lower teeth turned by the tongue moistened by the saliva and ground fine by the pestle of the upper teeth is not put into the stomach by anyone with a ladle or a spoon Just by the process of oscillation it goes on
There is no one within who having made a straw mat is bearing each lump that goes in Each lump stands by reason of the process of oscillation
There is no one who having put up an oven and lit a fire is cooking each lump standing there By only the process of caloricity the lump of food matures
There is no one who expels each digested lump with a stick or pole Just the process of oscillation expels the digested food
It is oscillation vayodhatu that does the taking onward the moving away from side to side and it is oscillation that bears turns round pulverizes causes the removal of liquidity and expels
Extension pathavidhatu also does bearing up turning round pulverizing and the removal of liquidity
Cohesion apodhatu moistens and preserves wetness
Caloricity tejodhatu ripens or digests the food that goes in
Space akasadhatu becomes the way for the entering of the food
Consciousness viññanadhatu as a consequence of right kind of action knows in any particular situation According to reflection of this sort should the clear comprehension of nondelusion be understood here
Further the clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood through reflection on the unpleasantness connected with food in the following ten ways By way of the need to go to get it  to seek it  the process of eating it  by way of the receptacle  by way of the belly  by way of food that is undigested  by way of food that is digested  by way of the consequences of eating  by way of the trickling or oozing of food from the bodys openings in the form of excretions  and by way of the pollution due to food 
The detailed exposition of the contemplation on the unpleasantness connected with food is given in the Path of Purity 
Clear comprehension of cleansing the body Uccara passavakamme  In defecating and in urinating means When the time is come when the time is proper
if one does not defecate or urinate then ones body perspires ones eyes reel ones mind is not collected and illness in the form of sharp pain fistula and so forth arise for one
But to one who defecates and urinates at the proper time none of these discomforts disadvantages troubles and illnesses arise This is the sense in which this matter should be understood
and in this sense should clear comprehension of purpose in defecation and urination be taken
By defecating or urinating in an improper place one commits disciplinary offences one goes on getting a bad name and one endangers ones life
But to one evacuating the bowels or the bladder in a place suitable for such evacuation those offences or troubles just mentioned above have no reference
And by way of that fitness of place clear comprehension of suitability should be understood By the nonabandoning of the subject of meditation clear comprehension of resort should be understood
Within there is no doer of the act of defecation or urination
Only by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity defecation and urination occur 
just as in a matured boil by the bursting of the boil pus and blood come out without any kind of wishing to come out and just as from an overfull waterpot water comes out without any desire for coming out so too the feces and urine accumulated in the abdomen and the bladder are pressed out by the force of the process of oscillation
Certainly this fecesandurine coming out thus is neither that bhikkhus own nor anothers
It is just bodily excretion
When from a watervessel or calabash a person throws out the old water the water thrown out is neither his nor others
It simply forms parts of a process of cleansing
In the form of reflection proceeding in this way clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood
Clear comprehension of walking and so forth Now we come to the explanation of the instruction dealing with clear comprehension in walking
in standing in a place
in sitting in some position
in sleeping
in speaking and
in keeping silence  Gate thite nisinne sutte jagarite bhasite tunhibhave
By the words When he is going a bhikkhu understands I am going and so froth postures of long duration are indicated
And by the words in going forwards and backwards in bending and in stretching postures of middling duration
and by the words in walking in standing In sleeping postures of short brief duration
Therefore in these three parts of the instruction the practicing of clear comprehension should be known even by the triple method stated here
The Elder Tipitaka Maha Siva indeed said Who after walking or exercising long in the ambulatory stands and reflects The bodily and mental things which existed during the time of exercises on the ambulatory ended just there on the ambulatory is called a doer of clear comprehension in walking
When after standing for a long time in study or answering a question or minding a subject of meditation sits and reflects The bodily and mental things which existed during the time of standing ended just at the time of standing is called a doer of clear comprehension in standing
Who after sitting for a long time in study or other similar work lies down and reflects The bodily and mental things which existed when sitting ended just at the time of sitting is called a doer of clear comprehension in sitting
Who after lying down falls asleep and then after getting up from his sleep reflects The bodily and mental things which existed during the time of sleep ended just during sleep is called a doer of clear comprehension in sleeping and waking
The nonoccurrence of processes which make action or are made of action is sleep the occurrence waking 
He who whilst speaking thinks This sound arises dependent on the lips teeth tongue palate and the act of the mind that accords to that sound speaks mindful and clearly comprehending He who for a long time has studied or expounded the Teaching or recited the words of the subject of meditation or cleared a question and later on becoming silent thinks The bodily and mental things which arose during the time of speaking ended just then is called a doer of clear comprehension in speaking
He who after remaining silent long considering the Teaching or his subject of meditation thinks that the bodily and mental things that existed in the time of silence ended just then that the occurrence of derived material qualities is speech and that the nonoccurrence of these is silence is called a doer of clear comprehension in keeping silence
This dominance of nondelusion stated by the Elder Maha Siva is intended here in this Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness
But in the Discourse on the Fruit of the Homeless Life even the entire fourfold clear comprehension is found
Therefore in a special way here only by way of clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood the state of doing clear comprehension 
In all statements the meaning of the term clear comprehension should be understood by way of only clear comprehension that is endowed with mindfulness
Indeed in the Book of Classifications these are put just in this way One goes forward mindful and clearly comprehending one goes backwards mindful and clearly comprehending 
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally Thus the bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in the body by way of the laying hold of the fourfold comprehension either in his own body or in anothers body or at one time in his own body and in anothers at another time
And here too in contemplating origination and so forth the origin and the dissolution of only the materiality aggregate should in the exposition be taken out
The remainder is to be understood just by the method already stated by the commentator
Here the Truth of Suffering is the mindfulness which lays hold of the fourfold clear comprehension the Truth of Origination is the precraving which originates that mindfulness the nonoccurrence of either is the Truth of Cessation the Real Path already stated is the Waytruth
Thus the bhikkhu having striven by way of the Four Noble Truths reaches peace This is indeed the means of deliverance up to arahantship of one who lays hold of the fourfold clear comprehension
After explaining bodycontemplation by way of the fourfold clear comprehension to explain it by way of the reflection of repulsiveness the Master said And further and so forth
Everything that should be said in connection with the passage beginning with On just this body and so forth is stated in detail taking into consideration all aspects of the matter in the Path of Purity the Visuddhi Magga and its commentary The Casket of the Highest Thing Paramattha Mañjusa a summary of that account is given here
The following is the application of the simile Like the bag with the two openings is the body made up of the four great primaries earth water fire and air The thirtytwo parts beginning with hairofthehead are like the various grains thrown into that bag after mixing them Like a man with seeing eyes is the yogi Comparable to the time when after loosening the bag the various grains become clear to one reflecting is the time when the thirtytwo parts become clear to the yogi
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally The bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in his body or in anothers Sometimes he contemplates the body in his own body at other times in anothers by way of laying hold on things beginning with the hair of the head From here the meaning should be known just in the way already stated by the commentator
Here the mindfulness which lays hold of the thirtytwo parts is the Truth of Suffering Having interpreted thus the portal to emancipation should be understood
The Master having explained bodycontemplation in the form of reflection on the repulsiveness of the thirtytwo parts of the body said And further now to set forth bodycontemplation by way of reflection on the modes of materiality
The elaboration of the meaning together with the application of the simile in this connection is as follows Just as if some cowbutcher or a cowbutchers apprentice a man who works for his keep having killed a cow and made it into parts were sitting at a fourcrossroad just so a bhikkhu reflects by way of the modes on the body in any one of the four postures thus There are in this body the modes of extension cohesion caloricity and oscillation
The cowbutcher does not get rid of the cowpercept while feeding the cow driving it to the place of slaughter tying it and putting it up there killing it and even when seeing the dead carcass of the cow not until he cuts it up and divides it into parts does the perception of a cow disappear
To that butcher sitting after cutting up the cow however the perception of a cow disappears and the perception of flesh comes into being To him there is not this thought I am selling the cow these people are taking away the cow
But to him indeed there occurs this thought I am selling flesh these people indeed are taking away flesh  To the bhikkhu similarly the perception of a being or the perception of a person does not disappear as long as he does not reflect by way of the modes of materiality in this body as it is placed or disposed in whatsoever position after sifting thoroughly the apparently compact aggregation
To him who reflects by way of the modes of materiality however the perception of a being disappears the mind gets established by way of the modes of materiality
Therefore the Blessed One declared A bhikkhu reflects on just this body according as it is placed or disposed by way of the mode of materiality thinking thus There are in this body the mode of solidity the mode of cohesion the mode of caloricity and the mode of oscillation
O bhikkhus in whatever manner a clever cowbutcher or a cowbutchers apprentice having slaughtered a cow and divided it by way of portions should be sitting at the junction of a crossroad in the same manner a bhikkhu reflects thinking thus There are in this body the mode of solidity And the mode of oscillation
The yogi is comparable to the cowbutcher the perception of a being is comparable to the perception of a cow the fourfold posture is comparable to the crossroad and the reflection by way of the modes of materiality is comparable to the state of sitting with the cows flesh in front after dividing the cow into parts Here this is the textual explanation Details of the reflection on the modes of materiality as a subject of meditation however are given in the Path of Purity
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally One dwells contemplating the body in the body thus by way of the laying hold of the four modes of materiality in ones own or in anothers body or at one time in ones own body and at another time in anothers body
From here on the exposition should be known just by the method already mentioned
The mindfulness which lays hold of the four modes of materiality is the Truth of Suffering Thus the portal to deliverance should be known 
After explaining bodycontemplation in the form of the modes of materiality the Master said And further in order to explain bodycontemplation through the nine cemetery contemplations
Uddhumatam  Swollen By reason of the swelled state of the corpse comparable to a pair of windfilled bellows owing to the gradually uprising bloattedness after death
Vinilakam  Blue is stated to be the color of fully differing shades viparibhinnavannam
Blue is that corpse which is reddish in the protuberantly fleshy parts and whitish in the purulent parts while in those parts which are predominantly blue it seems to be as though covered with a blue mantle This is the descriptive statement of the blue corpse
Vipubbakajatam  Festering is the corpse that is full of pus flowing from the broken parts or from the nine openings of the body
So imameva kayam upasamharati ayampi kho kayo evam dhammo evam bhavi evam anatitoti  He thinks of his own body thus
This body of mine too is of the same nature as that body is going to be like that body and has not got past the condition of becoming like that body
This has been stated By the existence of these three life ayu warmth usma consciousness viññanam this body can endure to stand to walk and do other things by the separation of these three however this body is indeed a thing like that corpse is possessed of the nature of corruption is going to become like that will become swollen blue and festering and cannot escape the state of being like that cannot transcend the condition of swelling up become blue and festering
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally Thus by laying hold of the state of swelling and so forth in regard to ones own body or anothers or at one time in regard to ones own and at another in regard to anothers one dwells contemplating the body in the body
Khajjamanam  Whilst it is being eaten When crows and other creatures after sitting on the belly or another part of the corpse are eating the carcass by picking the flesh of the belly of the lips the corners of the eye and so forth
Samamsalohitam  Together with flesh and blood With the flesh and blood still remaining
Nimmamsalohitam  Bloodbesmeared without flesh When though rid of flesh the blood is still not dry
Aññena  In a different place In a different direction
Hatthatthikam  Bone of the hand the sixtyfour kinds of bones of the hand when these are lying in different places separate from one another
In the explanation of the bone of the foot and so forth the method is the same as this
Terovassikani  More than a year old beyond a year in a state of exposure
Putini  Rotten just those in the open become rotten by being exposed to wind sun and rain for over a year
Bones buried in the earth last longer
Cunnakajatani  Become dust scattered in the form of powder
Everywhere according to the method already stated beginning He thinks of his own body thus This body of mine too is of the same nature as that body is going to be like that body and has not got past the condition of becoming like that body
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally Thus through the laying hold of the corpse from the state in which it is being eaten by crows and other creatures to the state when it is dust one dwells contemplating the body in ones own body or in anothers or at one time in ones own body and at another time in anothers body
Further having stopped here one should put together the nine cemetery contemplations thus
Ekahamatam va dvihamatam va tihamatam va  A body dead one two or three day This is the first contemplation Kakehi va khajjamanam  Whilst it is being eaten by crows This portion of the Discourse where the devouring of the body of various kinds of animals is stated refers to the second contemplation Atthikasamkhalikam samamsalohitam naharusambandham  A skeleton together with flesh and blood held in by the tendons This is the third contemplation Nimmamsalohitamakkhitam naharusambandham  A bloodsmeared skeleton without flesh but held in by the tendons This is the fourth Apagatamamsalohitam naharusambandham  A skeleton held in by the tendons but without flesh and not besmeared with blood This is the fifth Atthikani apagatasambandhani  Bones gone loose scattered in all directions This is the sixth Atthikani setani sankhavannupanibhani  Bones white in color like a conch This is the seventh Atthikani puñjakitani terovassikani  Bones more than a year old heaped together This is the eighth Atthikani putini cunnakajatani  Bones gone rotten and become dust This is the ninth
Evam kho bhikkhave  Thus indeed o bhikkhus He said this bringing to an end bodycontemplation after pointing out the nine cemetery contemplations
The mindfulness which lays hold of the nine cemetery contemplations is the Truth of Suffering the previous craving which originates that mindfulness is the Truth of Origin the nonoccurrence of both that mindfulness and the craving is the Truth of Cessation The Real Path that understands suffering casts out the origin and has cessation for its object is the Truth of the Way
Endeavoring in this way by means of the Four Truths one arrives at peace This is for the bhikkhu who lays hold of the nine cemetery contemplations the portal of deliverance up to arahantship
Now these are the fourteen portions which comprise bodycontemplation The section on breathing in and breathing out on the postures on the four kinds of clear comprehension of reflection on repulsiveness on the modes of materiality and on the nine cemetery contemplations
There only the sections on breathing in and breathing out and of the reflection on repulsiveness can become meditationsubjects of full absorption
As the cemetery contemplations are stated by way of consideration of disadvantages dangers or evils all the remaining twelve are only meditationsubjects of partial absorption
The Blessed One having in this way set forth the Arousing of Mindfulness through the fourteenfold method of bodycontemplation now said And now o bhikkhus in order to expound the ninefold method of contemplation of feeling
There the meaning of pleasant feeling  sukham vedanam is as follows The bhikkhu when experiencing a bodily or mental pleasant feeling knows I experience a pleasant feeling
Certainly while they experience a pleasant feeling in sucking the breast and on similar occasions even infants lying on their backs know that they experience pleasure But this meditators knowledge is different
Knowledge of pleasure possessed by infants lying on their backs and other similar kinds of knowledge of pleasure do not cast out the belief in a being do not root out the perception of a being do not become a subject of meditation and do not become the cultivation of the Arousing of Mindfulness
But the knowledge of this bhikkhu casts out the belief in a being uproots the perception of a being is a subject of meditation and is the cultivation of the Arousing of Mindfulness
Indeed the knowledge meant here is concerned with experience that is wisely understood through inquiry
Who feels No being or person
Whose is the feeling Not of a being or person
Owing to what is there the feeling Feeling can arise with things  forms sounds smells and so forth  as objects
That bhikkhu knows therefore that there is a mere experiencing of feeling after the objectifying of a particular pleasurable or painful physical basis or of one of indifference
The words of the Discourse I experience  form a conventional expression indeed for that process of impersonal feeling
It should be understood that the bhikkhu knows that with the objectification of a property or basis he experiences a feeling
It is said that an Elder of Cittala Hill was sick turning over from side to side again and again and groaning with great pain
To him a young bhikkhu said Venerable Sir which part of your body is painful
 A specially painful place indeed there is not as a result of taking certain things for object there is the experiencing of painful feeling replied the Elder
Venerable Sir from the time one knows that is not bearing up befitting said the young bhikkhu
I am bearing up friend said the Elder
Bearing up is excellent Venerable Sir said the young bhikkhu
The Elder bore up
Thereafter the aerial humor caused injury right up to the heart His intestines protruded out and lay in a heap on the bed
The Elder pointed that out to the young bhikkhu and said Friend is bearing up so far befitting
The young bhikkhu remained silent
The Elder having applied concentration with energy attained arahantship with Analytical Knowledge and passed away into the final peace of Nibbana  thus realizing the highest and passing away nearly at the same time
Just as when experiencing a pleasant feeling so too when experiencing a painful feeling a neitherpleasantnorpainful spiritual feeling he understands I experience a neitherpleasantnorpainful spiritual feeling
Thus the Blessed One when expounding the noncorporeal subject of meditation after the corporeal subject of meditation expounds it by way of feeling
For twofold is the subject of meditation the subject of meditation of corporeality or materiality and the subject of meditation which is noncorporeal or nonmaterial
This twofold subject of meditation is also spoken of as the laying hold of the mental and the laying hold of the material
While the Blessed One is expounding the material subject of meditation by way of brief or lengthy reflection he expounds the discernment of the four modes of materiality dhatu
Both those ways of reflection are pointed out fully in the Path of Purity
While expounding however the mental subject of meditation generally the Master expounds it by way of the contemplation on feeling
Threefold indeed is the establishing in the mental subject of meditation by way of senseimpression feeling and mind
How
To some meditator indeed when the material subject of meditation is laid hold of when there is the first impact of mindwithmentalcharacteristics on the object  the senseimpression that arises with the contacting of that object becomes clear
To another the feeling that arises with the experiencing of that object becomes clear
To yet another the consciousness that arises with the knowing of that object becomes clear
When senseimpression becomes clear not only does senseimpression arise together with that senseimpression arise feeling perception volition and consciousness
When feeling becomes clear
the other four too arise
Also when consciousness becomes clear the other four arise
The bhikkhu on reflecting thus Dependent on what is this group of five things knows as follows Dependent on the corporeal base 
That coarse body karaja kaya about which it is said And indeed this consciousness of mine is depending on is bound up with this body that in its actual nature consists of the four great physical things the four great primaries and the physical qualities sourcing from the four great primaries These physical qualities are called derived materiality
Here the bhikkhu sees mind and body thinking The corporeal base aforesaid is body the five beginning with senseimpression are mind
In this connection there are the five aggregates because the body is the aggregate of materiality and the mind the four aggregates of nonmaterial things
There is neither a fivefold aggregation separate from the mind and body nor a mind and body separate from the fivefold aggregation
The bhikkhu who tries to find out what the cause of these five aggregates is sees that these are due to ignorance etc
Henceforth the bhikkhu lives with thorough knowledge thinking that this thing the fivefold aggregation is only something conditioned and includes what is produced from conditioning It is a congeries of bare formations indeed of bare processes He applies to it by way of the mind and body that exist together with conditions according to the gradual succession of insightproducing knowledge the words impermanent subjecttosuffering and soulless
After getting suitable weather conditions a person of advantage to him spiritually food that agrees with him or fitting doctrinal instructions the bhikkhu desirous of realization says Today today fixed in one posture reaches the acme of insight and stands fast in the fruit of arahantship
For the three kinds of persons aforesaid the subject of meditation up to arahantship is expounded in this way
Here however the Blessed One speaking of the nonmaterial or mental subject of meditation speaks by way of feeling
While expounding by way of senseimpression or consciousness the subject of meditation does not become clear It seems dark
But by way of feeling it becomes clear
Why
Because of the clearness of the arising of feeling
Indeed the arising of pleasant or painful feeling is clear
When pleasant feeling arises spreading through and flowing over the whole body making one to utter the words Ah tis joy it is like causing one to eat fresh clarified butter cooled in very cold water a hundred times after being melted again and again also a hundred times it is like causing one to be massaged with an emollient oil worth a hundred pieces and it is like causing one to be cooled of a burning fever with a thousand pots of cold water
When painful feeling arises spreading through and flowing over the whole body making one to bewail with the words Alas what woe it is like the applying on one of a heated plowshare it is like the sprinkling upon one of molten copper and it is comparable to the hurling into dried grass and trees in the forest of bundles of wood firebrands
Thus the arising of pleasant or painful feeling becomes clear
but the arising of the neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling is dark and unclear
The neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling becomes clear to one who grasps it methodically thinking At the disappearance of pleasure and pain the neutral neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling occurs which is contrary to the pleasant and the unpleasant
To what is it comparable
To a deer hunter following the hoof marks of a deer which midway having gone up a flat rock is fleeing The hunter after seeing the hoof marks on the hither and thither side of the rock without seeing any trace in the middle knows by inference Here the animal went up and here it went down in the middle on the flat rock possibly it went through this part Like the hoofmark at the place of going up the arising of pleasurable feeling becomes clear
Like the hoofmark at the place of descent the arising of painful feeling becomes clear
Like the grasping through inference of the part traversed over the rock by the deer is the laying hold of the neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling methodically with the thought At the disappearance of pleasure and pain the neutral neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling occurs which is contrary to the pleasant and the unpleasant
In this manner the Blessed One having expounded at first the form subject of meditation later pointed out the formless subject of meditation by way of feeling having taken it out from the fivefold aggregation distinguishingly
Not only here did he point it out thus In the Cula Tanhasankkhaya the Cula Vedalla the Maha Vedalla the Ratthapala Magandiya Dhatuvibhanga and Aneñjasappaya of the Majjhima Nikaya in the Maha Nidana Sakkapañha and Maha Satipatthana of the Digha Nikaya in the Cula Nidana Rukkhupama and Parivimamsana Suttas of the Samyutta Nikaya in the whole of the Vedana Samyutta of the same Nikaya and in many other discourses did the Master point out the formless subject of meditation by way of feeling having taken out feeling from the fivefold aggregation after first expounding the form subject of meditation
This is another method of understanding understands I experience a pleasant feeling  Sukham vedanam vediyamiti pajanati By the absence of painful feeling at the moment of pleasant feeling he knows while experiencing a pleasant feeling I am experiencing a pleasant feeling
By reason of that knowledge of the experiencing of pleasant feeling owing to the absence now of whatsoever painful feeling that existed before and owing to the absence of this pleasant feeling before the present time feeling is called an impermanent a not lasting and a changeful thing When he knows the pleasant feeling in the pleasant feeling thus there is clear comprehension
For it is said in the th Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya by the Blessed One
When one experiences a pleasant feeling Aggivessana then one does not experience a painful feeling or a neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling Only the pleasant feeling does one then experience When one experiences a painful feeling Aggivessana then one does not experience a pleasant or a neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling Only a painful feeling does one then experience When one experiences a neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling then one does not experience a pleasant or a painful feeling Only a neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling does one then experience
Pleasant feeling indeed Aggivessana is a thing that is impermanent puttogether dependently originating decaying passing away fading and ceasing
So is painful feeling and the neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
The learned real disciple Aggivessana seeing thus turns away from the pleasant feeling even as he does from the painful and the neitherpleasantnorpainful feelings Turning away he detaches himself by absence of attachment he frees himself freed he knows thus I am freed of craving
Destroyed by me is rebirth lived by me is the Highest Life of the Real Way done by me is the work of developing the Real Way that must be developed and there is no more work to be done by me
Pleasant worldly feeling refers to the six joyful feelings connected with the six sensedoors and dependent on that which is tainted by defilements
Pleasant spiritual feeling refers to the six joyful feelings connected with the six sensedoors and not dependent on sensedesire
Painful worldly feeling refers to the six feelings of grief connected with the six sensedoors and dependent on that which is tainted by defilements
Painful spiritual feeling refers to the six feelings of grief connected with the six sensedoors and not dependent on sensedesire
Worldly neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling refers to the six feelings of indifference connected with the six sensedoors and dependent on that which is tainted by defilements
Spiritual neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling refers to the six feelings of indifference connected with the six sensedoors and not dependent on sensedesire
The division into pleasant worldly feeling and so forth is in the th Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya
Ajjhattam  Internally The bhikkhu dwells contemplating feelings in the feelings that are his own by laying hold of the pleasant painful or neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling Or he dwells contemplating feelings in the feelings of others by laying hold of the pleasant painful or neitherpleasantnorpainful feelings in the way told above Or at one time he contemplates his own feelings and at another time anothers
Samudayadhammanupassi  Contemplating originationthings In this contemplation of feeling the bhikkhu dwells seeing the origination and the dissolution of the aggregate of feeling or seeing the origination of feeling at one time and the dissolution of feeling at another time by way of ignorance craving and so forth in the five ways mentioned in the Section on the Modes of Deportment
From here on it should be understood that the exposition is just according to the method followed in the explanation of bodycontemplation
Indeed the mindfulness that lays hold of feeling is the Truth of Suffering Thus the portal of deliverance for the bhikkhu who lays hold of feeling should be understood
After explaining the ninefold Arousing of Mindfulness in regard to feeling the Master began the explanation of the contemplation of consciousness in the sixteenfold way with the words And how o bhikkhus
Saragam cittam  The consciousness with lust Karmically unwholesome eight conscious states of the plane of existence of senseexperience These are together with greed in the sense of springing from it
Vitaragam cittam  The consciousness without lust Karmically wholesome and karmically neutral mundane states of consciousness
Sodosam cittam  The consciousness with hate The two conscious states karmically unwholesome accompanied by grief 
Vitadosam cittam  The consciousness without hate Karmically wholesome and karmically neutral mundane states of consciousness
The other ten karmically unwholesome conscious states of the plane of existence of senseexperience do not associate with either the consciousnesswithhate division or the consciousnesswithouthate division
Samoham cittam  The consciousness with ignorance The conscious state karmically unwholesome linked to doubt  and the conscious state karmically unwholesome linked to agitation 
Because indeed ignorance arises in all karmically bad states the other karmically bad states too should be mentioned here
In just this division all the twelve karmically bad unwholesome or unskillful conscious states are included
Vitamoham cittam  The consciousness without ignorance Karmically wholesome and karmically neutral mundane states of consciousness
Sankhittam cittam  The shrunken state of consciousness The conscious state fallen into sloth and torpor That is called the shrivelled or contracted state of mind
Vikkhittam cittam  The distracted state of consciousness The conscious state accompanied by agitation That is called the dissipated mind
Mahaggatam cittam  The state of consciousness become great The conscious state of the sensuousethereal rupavacara plane of existence and of the purely ethereal arupavacara plane of existence
Amahaggatam cittam  The state of consciousness not become great The conscious state of the plane of existence of senseexperience
Sauttaram cittam  The state of consciousness with some other mental state superior to it That refers to any conscious state belonging to the plane of senseexperience
Anuttaram cittam  The state of consciousness with no other mental state superior to it That refers to any conscious state belonging to the sensuousethereal rupavacara or the purely ethereal arupavacara plane
Samahitam cittam  The quieted state of consciousness It refers to the conscious state of him who has full or partial absorption
Asamahitam cittam  The state of consciousness not quieted It refers to the conscious state without either absorption
Vimuttam cittam  the freed state of consciousness 
Avimuttam cittam  The unfreed state of consciousness That refers to any conscious state without either kind of temporary emancipation In the mundane path lokiya magga of the beginner there is no place for the supramundane kinds of emancipation through extirpation samuccheda stilling patipassaddha and final release nissarana
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally The bhikkhu lives contemplating consciousness in consciousness by laying hold on the consciousness with lust and so forth when these states of consciousness proceed in his own flux or in anothers flux or by laying hold of these conscious states at one time as they proceed in his own flux and at another time as they proceed in anothers flux
Samudayavayadhammanupassi  Contemplating originationanddissolutionthings Here the arising of the aggregate of consciousness should be explained with the pointing out of the origination of consciousness from the origination of ignorance and so forth in the five ways according to the method shown in the Section on the Modes of Deportment And the passing away of consciousness should also be explained in the same way as it is shown in the Section on the Modes of Deportment
From here on there is nothing new in the method of explanation
The mindfulness which lays hold of consciousness is the Truth of Suffering Thus the portal of deliverance up to arahantship of the bhikkhu who lays hold of consciousness as a subject of meditation ought to be understood 
Sensuality After explaining the Arousing of Mindfulness of the sixteenfold contemplation of consciousness the Master said And how o bhikkhus in order to expound the fivefold contemplation of mental objects dhamma  things spiritual and material
Further the laying hold of pure corporeality or materiality was taught by the Blessed One in the instruction on bodycontemplation and in the instruction on the contemplation of feeling and consciousness the laying hold of the purely spiritual
Now in order to teach the laying hold of a mixture of the material and the spiritual he said And how o bhikkhus and so forth
Or in the contemplation on the body the laying hold of the aggregate of corporeality or materiality was spoken of by the Master in the contemplation on feeling the laying hold of the aggregate of feeling in the contemplation on mind the laying hold of the aggregate of consciousness and now in order to speak of even the laying hold of the aggregates of perception and formations he said And how o bhikkhus and so forth
There in the Discourse the word santam  present It means existing by way of occurrence practice or repeated happening
Asantam  not present Not existing by way of nonoccurrence or because of rejection from the mind by way of reflection or concentration
In connection with the hindrances it must be known that the hindrance of sensuality arises because of wrong reflection on an object that is sensuously agreeable pleasant favorable
Such an object is either sensuality itself or that which produces sensuality  the sensualityobject
Wrong reflection is inexpedient reflection reflection on the wrong track Or it is reflection which considers the impermanent as permanent pain as pleasure nonsoul as soul the bad as good Sensedesire arises when wrong reflection occurs plentifully in a sensuously good object
Therefore the Blessed One said that the condition for the arising of fresh sensedesire and for the increase and expansion of existing sensedesire is plentiful wrong reflection on a sensuously auspicious or promising object
Sensedesire is cast out indeed with right reflection on a sensuously inauspicious or unpromising object
Such an object itself or the jhana developed through such an object is meant by the term sensuously inauspicious object
Right reflection is expedient reflection reflection going on the right track It is reflection that considers the facts of impermanence suffering soullessness and of impurity according to reality When there is much right reflection on the sensuously inauspicious or unpromising object sensedesire is knocked out
Therefore the Blessed One said that the condition for keeping out new sensedesire and for casting out old sensedesire is abundant right reflection on the sensuously inauspicious or unpromising object
Further there are six things which lead to the casting out of sensedesire Taking up the sensuously inauspicious subject of meditation application for the development of the jhana on the sensuously inauspicious subject of meditation the guarded state of the controlling faculties of sense moderation in food the sympathy and support of good men in the endeavor stimulating talk that helps the accomplishment of the object in view
Explaining these six it is said Taking up refers to the taking up of the tenfold object sensuously inauspicious impure or bad the man who takes it up will cast out sensedesire Sensedesire will also be cast out by him who develops the jhana on the sensuously inauspicious object of meditation by him who guards the controlling faculties of sense by closing the six sense doors and by him who knows the measure of food for sustenance
and of whom it is said
To stop eating when he could eat some four Or five more lumps for which theres bellyroom And with drinks of water end his begged repast
Enough it is for the comfort of the almsman Who has put aside all thoughts of body and life Who has his thoughts yoked on to cravings wane
It will also be cast out by him who keeps the company of men like the Elder Tissa the worker in the sensuously inauspicious subject of meditation sympathetic towards those who endeavor in accomplishing the casting out of sensedesire and by talk connected with the tenfold sensuously inauspicious object
Therefore it is said by the commentator that six things are conducive to the casting out of sensedesire
Sensedesire cast out by these six things becomes incapable of arising in the future through the attainment of the path of arahantship 
Anger Indeed wrong reflection on an object of resentment produces anger
In this connection anger itself as well as the object which causes anger is called the resentmentobject or the sign of resentment
Wrong reflection has just the same character everywhere
and when it occurs much in the resentmentobject or the resentmentsign anger arises
Therefore the Blessed One said that intense wrong reflection on an object of resentment is the cause of fresh anger and of the increase and expansion of anger already existing
By right reflection of the liberating thought of love the thought of love that frees the heart indeed anger gets cast out
The term love here is applicable both to partial concentration and full concentration 
Heartliberating love is only full concentration
Right reflection has the same character throughout
When it occurs strong in the thought of love anger is removed from the heart
Therefore the Master said There is o bhikkhus the liberation of the mind through love Intense right reflection on love is the condition for keeping out new anger and for throwing out anger that is already in the heart
And it is said that these six things help to cast anger out Taking up the practice of the love subject of meditation applying oneself to the development of jhana on the thought of love reflection on ones action as ones own property abundance of wise consideration sympathetic and helpful companionship of the good and stimulating talk that assists the development of the thought of love and the overthrow of anger
In explanation the commentator said Anger will be put down in one who takes up the love subject of meditation by way of spreading it particularly or separately Or if one takes up the love subject of meditation by way of spreading it generally without particularization or directional restriction in space then too anger will be put down in one
Anger vanishes in one who reflects thus too What will you do to him by becoming angry  Will you be able to destroy things like his virtue  Have you not been born here just by your own actions and will you not also by your own actions get reborn hereafter  Getting angry with another is comparable to the state of him who wishes to strike another with glowing coals redhot crowbar excreta and such other damaging things after taking them up in his bare hands
And what can another who is angry with you do to you  Can he destroy your virtue or any other similar thing of yours  He too has been born here as a result of his actions and will be reborn hereafter just according to his actions Like a present not accepted is that anger of his and like a handful of dust thrown against the wind that anger of his alights on his own head In this way one reflects on ones own action as ones own property and also another persons action as that persons own and puts out anger To one remaining in an abundance of wise consideration after reflecting on action as ones or anothers own property anger vanishes And it vanishes in him who is in the company of a sympathetic friend who delights in developing the jhana of the thought of love like the Elder Assagutta
and through stimulating talk on the thought of love when in any one of the four postures
Therefore it is said Six things are conducive to the casting out of anger
The anger cast out by these six things however is finally destroyed by the attainment of the state of the Anagami the neverreturner 
Sloth and Torpor Through wrong reflection on a state of boredom and the like sloth and torpor come to be
Boredom is just dissatisfaction
Lassitude is bodily laziness
Languidity of body is the bending of the body torpidly in getting up and in similar actions
Lethargy after a meal is a dizziness or slight faint which is due to eating a principal meal It is also called the discomfort which follows such a meal
The minds sluggishness is the dullness of the mind
An abundance of wrong reflection on boredom and similar states of mind produces sloth and torpor
Therefore the Blessed One said that much wrong reflection on boredom lassitude languidity of body lethargy after a meal and the minds sluggishness is a condition for the production of fresh sloth and torpor and the increase and expansion of sloth and torpor already come into being
Through right reflection in inceptive energy and similar states of mind is brought about the overthrow of sloth and torpor
Inceptive energy is the effort first set afoot
Exertion is more powerful than the inceptive energy because it leaves indolence behind
And because of its assailing further and further of the destructive condition progressive endeavor is more powerful than exertion
By the exercise of right reflection intensely on this threefold strenuousness sloth and torpor are cast out
Therefore the Blessed One said that the condition for keeping out new sloth and torpor and for casting out sloth and torpor that is old is abundant right reflection on the element of inceptive energy of exertion and of progressive endeavor
There are six things which lead to the casting out of sloth and torpor The seeing of the reason of sloth and torpor in the fact of eating too much or gluttony the changing of the postures completely reflection on the perception of light staying in the open sympathetic and helpful companionship of the good and stimulating talk that assists in dispelling sloth an torpor
There is the following explanation of these six things The bhikkhu who has eaten gluttonously is assailed by sloth and torpor while doing his recluse duty of meditation in his day or night quarters as by a mighty elephant pressing down on him
but that one who practices moderation in food is not troubled thus with these hindrances In one who thus sees the characteristic of sloth and torpor in gluttony there is the casting out of sloth and torpor
Sloth and torpor disappear in him who changes over from the posture which induces sloth and torpor to another in him who reflects on the brightness or the light of the moon a lamp or a torch by night and on the light or brightness of the sun by day in him who lives in the open in him who associates with sympathetic and helpful companions like the Elder Maha Kassapa who have dispelled sloth and torpor
and by stimulating talk connected with a strict recluseregimen
Therefore it is said Six things lead to the casting out of sloth and torpor
The yogi understands thus sloth and torpor cast out by these six things are stopped from arising forever in the future by the attainment of the path of arahantship 
Agitation and Worry Wrong reflection on mental agitation brings about flurry and worry
Mental agitation is inner turbulence
Actually it is flurry and worry only
Intense wrong reflection on that mental agitation produces flurry and worry
Therefore the Blessed One said that wrong reflection on mental agitation when plentifully done produces fresh flurry and worry and increases and expands flurry and worry already in existence
The casting out of agitation and worry occurs through right reflection on mental tranquillity called concentration
and an abundance of right reflection on mental tranquillity says the Blessed One is a condition for the keeping out of fresh mental agitation and worry and the dispelling of agitation and worry already in the mind
Six things are conducive to the casting out of agitation and worry Knowledge questioning understanding of disciplinary rules association with those more experienced and older than oneself in the practice of things like virtue sympathetic and helpful companionship and stimulating talk that helps the rejection of mental agitation and worry
In explanation it is said as follows Agitation and worry disappear in him who learns in the spirit and in the letter one two three four or five collections of Scripture This is how one gets over agitation and worry by knowledge
Questioning means inquiring much about what is befitting and not according to the practice of the Sangha In him who does this too agitation and worry disappear Then these twin evils disappear in him who has got the mastery of the Discipline due to practical application of and conversance with the nature of the Rule of the Sangha This is the understanding of the disciplinary rules Association with those more experienced and so forth the going to the presence of and the conversing with virtuous elders in the Sangha By such visits mental agitation and worry disappear in one Sympathetic and helpful companionship association with experts of the Disciplinary Rules like the Elder Upali the first of the great masters of the Discipline in the Sangha In such company mental agitation and worry disappear
Stimulating talk in this connection refers particularly to matters of disciplinary practice by which one comes to know what is befitting and what is not By this agitation and worry vanish in one
Therefore is it said that six things lead to the rejection of agitation and worry
but the agitation cast out by these things finally ceases to arise in the future through the attainment of the path of arahantship and the worry cast out by these things finally ceases to arise in the future through the attainment of the path of the nonreturner
Doubt Wrong reflection on things which are founded on doubt brings about the arising of doubt
Things which are founded on doubt are known as just doubt owing to the state of being the reason of doubt again and again
Therefore the Blessed One said that wrong reflection on things founded on doubt is the condition for fresh doubt and for the increase and expansion of doubt already arisen
By right reflection on wholesome things karmically and the like there is the casting out of doubt
Therefore the Blessed One said that right reflection on things which are karmically wholesome and not things blameful and blameless things to be practiced and not to be practiced things of low and high value things dark and fair the counterparts of bad and good done intensely keeps out fresh doubt and casts out doubt that has already come into existence
There are these six things which help to throw out doubt The state of being learned in the Buddhas teaching of inquiring about the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha of understanding thoroughly the nature of the Discipline of being decided about the truth of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha sympathetic and helpful companionship and stimulating talk that helps to dispel doubt
The first has been explained earlier It is the knowledge of the Suttas generally both in the letter and the spirit
The second is obvious The third indicates a state of mastery of the Discipline through practical application and great conversance with it at first hand The fourth is the strong inclination towards or reliance on the Triple Gem called the faith that is capable of settling in the object of the virtues of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha The fifth is association with good companions like the Elder Vakkali bent inclined sliding towards faith mentally
The sixth is stimulating talk on the Triple Gem at all times possible in every state of behavior
One can cast away doubt by means of these six things
but the doubt cast out by these six things does not ever arise in the future only when it is destroyed by the attainment of the first stage of the arahant
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally In this way the bhikkhu lives contemplating the mental objects by laying hold of the five hindrances amongst the mental objects of his own mind or amongst the mental objects in anothers mind or at one time amongst the mental objects of his own mind and at another time amongst the mental objects of anothers mind
Here origination and dissolution only refer to the origination of the five hindrances by way of wrong reflection on sensuously attractive or beautiful objects etc and the dissolution of the five hindrances by wise reflection on the impurity of the sensuous objects etc
Here the mindfulness which lays hold of the hindrances is the Truth of Suffering Thus the portal of deliverance of the bhikkhu who lays hold of the hindrances should be understood
Having expounded the contemplation of mental objects by way of the five hindrances the Master said And further o bhikkhus in order to explain the contemplation of mental objects by way of the fivefold aggregation
Pañcasu upadanakkhandhesu  In the five aggregates of clinging The five aggregates of clinging are the groups that grasp life The congeries of mental objects become the condition of clinging is the meaning
This is a brief indication of these aggregates
For the statement about the aggregates at length the talk on the aggregates in the Path of Purity should be read
Iti rupam  Thus is material form So far is there material form and no further In this way the bhikkhu perceives material form according to nature
In regard to feeling and the things that come afterwards the same is the method of exegesis
This is the brief indication of meaning of the matters referred to here
For the lengthy explanation on these things one should read the talk on the aggregates in the Path of Purity
Iti rupassa samudayo  Thus is the arising of material form The arising of material form and the other aggregates should be known according to the fivefold way through the arising of ignorance and so forth
Iti rupassa atthangamo  Thus is the disappearance of material form The disappearance of material form and the other aggregates should be known according to the fivefold way through the passing away of ignorance and so forth
One should read the talk on the aggregates in the Path of Purity for further explanation
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally In this way the bhikkhu lives contemplating mental objects by laying hold of the fivefold aggregation of clinging amongst his own mental objects or amongst the mental objects of another or at one time in his own and at another time in anothers mental objects
The origination and dissolution of the fivefold aggregate should be brought forward and connected by way of the fifty characteristics of the five groups with the extended application of the words From the arising of ignorance the arising of material form comes to be
From here on according to the method already stated by the commentator should the exposition be
After explaining the contemplation of mental objects by way of the aggregates the Master said And further o bhikkhus in order to explain the contemplation of mental objects by way of the sensebases
Chasu ajjhattika bahiresu ayatanesu  In the six internal and the six external sensebases The eye the ear the nose the tongue the body and the mind are the six internal sensebases and material form mind smell tastes tactual object and mental object are the six external sensebases
Cakkhum pajanati   understands the eye He understands the sensory apparatus of the eye by way of its own distinct function and salient characteristic
Rupe pajanati   understands material form that are visible He understands material form arising from the four producers of corporeality namely karma consciousness climate and nutriment kamma citta utu ahara by way of their own distinctive function and salient characteristic
Yam tadubhayam paticcca uppajjati samyojanam  The fetter that arises dependent on both  He understands according to distinct function and characteristic the tenfold fetter that arises dependent on both eye and forms  the tenfold fetter of sensedesire resentment pride speculative theory doubt belief in rites and ceremonies the desire to go on existing envy avarice and ignorance
How does this tenfold fettering arise  asks one
The fetter of sensuality arises for him who by way of sensuous enjoyment takes delight in a pleasant senseobject become visible at the eyedoor
For him who is annoyed or angry at the sight of an unpleasant object the fetter of resentment arises
and the fetter of pride arises in him who thinks No one but me is able to consider the object wisely
The fetter of speculative theory comes to be in him who takes material form to be permanent and everlasting
The fetter of doubt arises in him who thinks in this way Is the material form a being or a beings
The fetter of the desire to go on existing arises in him who wishes thus To be sure in a favorable state of existence this material form will become easy of access
The fetter of rites and ceremonies arises in him who undertakes to perform rites and ceremonies thinking In the future it will be possible to obtain such an object as this by taking up the observance of rites and ceremonies
The fetter of envy arises in him who contemplates grudgingly Should no others get this material form it would be good indeed
The fetter of avarice arises in one who stints for another the material form belonging to one
The fetter of ignorance arises  with all sensuous passion and the like by way of the relation of conascent nescience
Yathaca anupannassa samyojanassa uppado hoti tañca pajanati  He understands how the arising of the nonarisen fetter comes to be He understands that the fetter had not arisen earlier owing to some cause of nonoccurrence
Yatha ca uppannassa samyojanassa pahanam hoti tañca pajanati  He understands how the abandoning of the arisen fetter comes to be He understands the reason for the abandoning of just the fetter arisen through previous nonabandoning or through occurrence
Yatha ca pahinassa samojanassa ayatim anuppado hoti tañca pajanati  He understands how the nonarising in the future of the abandoned fetter comes to be He understands the reason for the nonarising in the future of even the fetter abandoned by way of rejection of separate factors through right reflection tadangavasena and through absorption vikkhambhana vasena
Owing to what reason does the tenfold fettering cease to arise in the future finally
The path of streamwinning or the first stage of awakening is the reason for final cessation of the five fetters of speculative theory doubt rites and ceremonies envy and avarice
The path of oncereturning or the second stage of awakening is the reason for the final cessation of sensuality and resentment of a gross kind and the residum of these two fetters finally ceases by reason of the statement of the path of neverreturning the third stage of awakening The fact which makes the fetter of pride of the desire to go on existing and of ignorance to cease finally in the future is the path of final purification arahantship the fourth state of awakening
The same is the method of exegesis in sotañca pajanati sadde ca pajanati  He understands the ear and sounds
Further in this connection the talk on the sensebases in full should be understood as stated by the commentator in the Path of Purity
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally The bhikkhu lives contemplating the mental objects by laying hold of the internal sensebases in his own mental objects or in anothers or laying hold of the external sensebases in anothers mental objects or in his own or at one time in his own and at another time in anothers mental objects
Origination and dissolution should be brought forward and connected here by the extended application of the method indicated by the words From the origin of ignorance the origin of the eye to the sensebases of material form in the aggregate of materiality to the mental sensebase in the aggregate of consciousness and to the sensebase of the mental object in the other nonmaterial aggregates according to the method of exegesis already stated by the commentator
The supramundane states should not be taken
From here onward the exposition is according to the method already shown by the commentator
Mindfulness After explaining the contemplation of mental objects by way of the internal and the external sensebases the Master said And further o bhikkhus in order to talk on the contemplation of mental objects by way of the Factors of Enlightenment 
Limbs are members or constituent parts of the awaking mind
Santam  Is present Existing by way of attainment
The enlightenment factor called mindfulness is the enlightenment factor of mindfulness
Because in these enlightenment factors the meditator effectively gets enlightened the meditator is called Complete Enlightenment from the time he begins strenuous contemplation on insight  The sevenfold completeness or harmony beginning with mindfulness by which he awakes effectively rises from the sleep of the defilements or penetrates the Truths is Complete Enlightenment
The components of that Complete Enlightenment or of the harmony called Complete Enlightenment are the factors of enlightenment 
In the other factors of enlightenment the wordmeaning should be understood in the same way
Assantam  Is absent Not existing through lack of attainment
Yatha anuppannassa  How of the nonarisen First is the enlightenment factor of mindfulness There are things which condition the enlightenment factor of mindfulness and an abundance of right reflection on them is the reason that is conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of mindfulness and for the increase the expansion and completion by culture of the arisen enlightenment factor
Thus it comes into being just mindfulness comprises the things which condition the enlightenment factor of mindfulness
Right reflection has just the characteristic already mentioned and when right reflection occurs plentifully in the things which condition the enlightenment factor of mindfulness the enlightenment factor of mindfulness arises
Further four things lead to the arising of the enlightenment factor of mindfulness Mindfulness with clear comprehension the avoiding of person with confused minds association with persons who keep mindfulness ready for application inclination towards mindfulness
In explanation it is said Mindfulness arises through mindfulness with clear comprehension in the seven positions beginning with that of going forwards Mindfulness arises through the avoiding of persons who are confused in mind like crows that come cawing to food thrown through association with persons who keep mindfulness ready for application like the Elder Tissadatta and the Elder Abhaya  and through the state of mind tending for originating mindfulness in all postures in all kinds of behavior or disposition of the body
And the bhikkhu knows that the completion by culture of the enlightenment factor of mindfulness brought into being by these four ways takes place by means of the attainment of the path of arahantship
Investigation of Mental Objects There are karmically good and karmically bad things right and wrong counterparts of bright and dark things and an abundance of right reflection on them is the reason conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of the investigation of mental objects and for the increase expansion and the completion of culture of that enlightenment factor when it has arisen 
Six things lead to the arising of this enlightenment factor Inquiring about the aggregates and so forth the purification of the basis  imparting evenness to the controlling faculties avoiding the ignorant associating with the wise reflecting on the profound difference of the hardtoperceive processes of the aggregates modes  sensebases and so forth and the inclining towards the development of the enlightenment factor of the investigation of mental objects
Inquiring about the aggregates and so forth means seeking the meaning of the aggregates the modes  sensebases controlling faculties powers enlightenment factors way factors absorption factors the meditation for quietude and the meditation for insight
Personal cleanliness is impaired by the excessive length of hair of the head nails hair of the body by the excess of humors and by the dirt of perspiration
cleanliness of impersonal or external things is impaired when robes are worn out dirty and smelly and when the house where one lives is dirty soiled and untidy
So personal cleanliness should be secured by shaving haircutting nailparing the use of pectoral emetics and of purgatives which make the body light and by shampooing bathing and doing other necessary things at the proper time
In similar way external cleanliness should be brought about by darning washing and dyeing ones robes and by smearing the floor of ones house with clay and the like to smoothen and clean it and by doing other necessary things to keep the house clean and tidy
Imparting evenness to the controlling faculties is the equalizing of the controlling faculties of faith energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom 
When faith outstrips the others through overactivity the others are thrown out of gear
Then energy finds it impossible to exert mindfulness to attend to the object concentration to be nondistracted and wisdom to see
Therefore that overactivity of faith should be made to wane either by reflection on the phenomenal nature of the things or by not attending to that thing when thinking of which faith becomes excessive
The story of the Thera Vakkali is the illustration of overactive faith 
If however the controlling faculty of energy becomes too powerful then neither will the faculty of faith be able to do its work of arousing faith in a settled way in its object nor will the remaining controlling faculties be able to perform their functions
Therefore in such a case energy should be made to lessen its activity by the development of the enlightenment factors of calm concentration and equanimity
The story of the Thera Sona is given as an illustration of overdone energy 
Even thus should the incapacity of the rest of the spiritual faculties to function effectively when one of them has become overactive and powerful be understood
Here the wise specially praise the equalizing of faith and wisdom and of concentration and energy
He who is very strong in faith and feeble in wisdom becomes a person who believes in foolish people who have no virtue persons who are not trustworthy
He who has very strong wisdom and feeble faith gets craftyminded
and is like a drugproduced disease that cannot be cured
Such a person thinks that wholesome karma arises with just the intention to do good Going along the wrong way by a species of thought beyond the limits of reason and doing neither almsgiving nor other similar good deeds he is born in a state of woe
By the equalizing of faith and wisdom one believes only in those like the Buddha who are worthy of trust because there is a reason for trusting them
As concentration naturally inclines towards indolence when there is too much of concentration and too little of energy indolence overwhelms the mind
As energy inclines naturally towards restlessness or agitation when there is much energy and little concentration restlessness overwhelms the mind
When concentration is combined well with energy there will be no falling of the mind into indolence
When energy is combined well with concentration there will be no falling of the mind into restlessness 
With the making even functionally of these pairs full absorption occurs
Further to a worker in concentration  a man pursuing the path of quietude samatha  faith that is somewhat strong is met
With faith that is strong the yogi will by believing in and fixing the mind on the object reach full absorption
Concerning concentration and wisdom it is said as follows For the worker in concentration  the man pursuing quietude samatha  strong onepointedness is met by With strong onepointedness he reaches full absorption
For the man pursuing the path of insight vipassana strong wisdom is met if strong wisdom exists he arrives at the penetration of the characteristics
By the equalizing of the concentration and wisdom of the worker in concentration the man pursuing quietude there is just full absorption
Strong mindfulness is met everywhere
Strong mindfulness is met everywhere since it protects the mind from falling into restlessness belonging to faith energy and wisdom and from falling into indolence belonging to concentration
It is likened to the saltflavoring which is in all curries and the ministerofallwork wanted in every business of the king
And because of this the commentator made the following statement And indeed it was said by the Blessed One thus Mindfulness is to be desired everywhere
Why
Because mindfulness is the minds help because mindfulness has just protection as its manifestation and because without mindfulness there is no exerting or restraining of the mind
Avoiding the ignorant is keeping away from foolish folk not grounded in the knowledge of the divisions of the aggregates and so forth
Association with wise folk is fellowship with persons possessed of the knowledge of rise and fall through the laying hold of all the fifty characteristics
Reflecting on the profound differences of the profound process of the aggregates and so forth is the analytic reflection according to wisdom of the movement of the hardtoperceive aggregates and so forth
Inclining towards the enlightenment factor of the investigation of mental objects is the mental state inclining tending and sloping towards the purpose of originating this enlightenment factor in every posture of standing sitting walking and lying down
The yogi understands that the culture of this enlightenment factor arisen thus comes to completion through the path of arahantship
Energy There is the mode of energy that is inceptive the mode of energy that is enduring and the mode of energy that is strong powerful courageous and an abundance of right reflection on these is the reason conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of energy and for the increase expansion and the completion by culture of that enlightenment factor when it has arisen
Eleven things lead to the arising of the enlightenment factor of energy Reflection on the fearfulness of statesofwoe apaya bhaya the seeing of the benefits of energy reflection on the path to be trodden the honoring of alms reflection on the greatness of the heritage the reflection on the greatness of the Master reflection on the greatness of race reflection on the greatness of fellows in the holy life the avoiding of lazy folk the associating with folk who have begun to exert and the inclination towards the development of the enlightenment factor of energy
Reflection on the fearfulness of the statesofwoe as stated in the Devaduta and other Suttas produces in the yogi the thought it is not possible to be energetic when subject to great suffering
Now is the time to rouse energy
The seeing of the benefits of energy is the appreciation of the fact that only by one who has begun to exert himself could the Supramundane Truth be obtained and not by a lazy person
The path trodden by all the Supreme Buddhas the Paccekabuddhas and the Great Disciples has to be trodden by you says the yogi to himself and that path is impossible for an indolent person That is the reflection on the path to be trodden
The yogi thinks thus Those who support you with almsfood and so forth are not relatives of yours are not your servants they do not give you excellent alms thinking We shall live depending on you But they give expecting from their offerings great fruit Also the requisites were not allowed to you by the Master so that you may make use of the requisites and live strongbodied in comfort but they were allowed to you so that you may do the duty of the recluse and escape the round of suffering whilst using the requisites The indolent one does not honor the alms only he who has begun to be energetic honors it Reflection in this way about honoring the alms permitted by the Buddha produces energy as in the case of the Thera Maha Mitta 
The Thera lived in Kassaka Lena 
In the village to which he resorted for alms there was a certain Maha Upasika who taking him as a child of hers looked after him
One day she was preparing to go to the forest and spoke to her daughter thus Here is old rice here milk here ghee and here treacle When your brother the venerable Mitta comes cook the rice and give it to him with milk ghee and treacle You too eat of it I have eaten the cold rice cooked yesterday with gruel
Mother what will you take at noon
Cook a sour gruel with herbs and broken rice and put it by 
Just as the Thera was taking out the bowl  after he had robed himself to go out for alms he heard that talk of the mother and daughter through his clairaudient power at the door of his cave and thought as follows The great lay devotee has eaten stale rice with gruel and will take sour gruel at noon For you she has given old rice milk ghee and treacle She does not expect field or food or cloth from you Only expecting the three good attainments of the human divine and supramundane planes does she give  Will you be able to bestow on her those attainments Indeed her alms is not fit to be taken by you with lust hatred and ignorance Then he put back the bowl into the bowlbag loosened the robeknot refrained from going for alms and returning to the Cultivators Cave put the bowl under his bed the robe on the robe pole and sat down resolved on endeavor thinking I will not go from here without attaining arahantship
This recluse who had been earnest for a long time after developing insight reached the fruit of arahantship even before mealtime and the great destroyer of the corruptions smiling like an opening lotus went out of the cave
To him the guardian deity of the tree near the cave said this
Hail to thee mansteed of finest strain Hail to thee the best of mortal kind
Gone are thy cankers Sorrowless One and so Worthy art thou to take a gift of faith
Having uttered this appreciation the tree deity said Venerable Sir after giving alms to an arahant like you wandering for alms the elderly woman will escape suffering
When the Thera got up and opened the door to observe what the time was he found that it was still quite early So he took his bowl and robe and entered the village
The young girl having prepared the rice sat looking towards the door of her house thinking Now my brother will come
And when the Thera arrived she took the bowl filled it with milkrice alms mixed with ghee and treacle and placed it in his hands
and he departed after giving thanks with the words May there be happiness
and the girl stood there looking at the departing one
The color of the Elder at that time was exceedingly clear and his controlling faculties especially pure and his face was shining like a ripe palmfruit freed from the footstalk
The mother of the girl on returning from the forest inquired Dear did your brother come
The daughter told her everything
The Maha Upasika knowing that her sons renunciation work had that day reached its acme said Dear your brother delights in the Dispensation of the Buddha He is not dissatisfied
There is reflection on the greatness of the heritage when one thinks thus Great indeed is the heritage of the Teacher namely the Seven Real Treasures Sutta Ariya Dhanani These are not to be got by the slothful
The indolent man is like a son disowned by his parents He does not get this parents wealth when they pass away So too it is with the Seven Real Treasures Only the man of energy gets these
Reflection on the greatness of the Master consists in recalling the great events in the teachers life and admonishing oneself thus Does it befit you to be slack after entering the Dispensation of such a Teacher 
Reflection on the greatness of race is carried out by way of the fact that in entering the Buddhas Dispensation one has become the Conquerors son spiritually and that for such a one slacking is not fit
Reflection on the greatness of fellows in the holy life consists of admonishing oneself thus Sariputta Maha Moggallana and the great disciples penetrated the supramundane after much endeavor Are you following their way of life 
The avoiding of lazy folk is the avoiding of people without physical and mental energy who are like a rocksnake lying inert after a full feed And the association with folk who have begun to exert themselves is mixing with those whose minds are turned towards and who are endeavoring for the attainment of Nibbana Inclination towards the development of this enlightenment factor is the inclining sloping and bending of the mind towards right exertion in all postures of sitting standing and so forth
The enlightenment factor that arises in this way comes to completion by culture through the path of arahantship
Joy There are things which condition the enlightenment factor of joy and an abundance of right reflection on these is the reason that is conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of joy and for the increase expansion and completion by culture of the enlightenment factor when it has arisen
Eleven things lead to the arising of the enlightenment factor of joy recollection of the Buddha recollection of the Dhamma recollection of the Sangha recollection of virtue of liberality of the shining ones devas and the recollection of peace upasama the avoiding of bad people association with good people reflection on the discourses inspiring confidence and the inclination towards joy
By recollection of the Buddhas qualities of the qualities of the Dhamma and of the Sangha joy arises
Joy arises also for one who having kept the precepts of fourfold purity unbroken for a long time reflects on ones virtue to laymen who reflect on their virtue through observing the ten and the five precepts to one reflecting on liberality and recollecting ones gift of excellent food to ones fellows in the holy life during a time of scarcity and the like to laymen recollecting their liberality in giving alms to virtuous folk to one reflecting on ones possession of qualities by which beings have reached the state of shining ones  to one reflecting thus by way of peace The passions suppressed by the higher attainments do not occur for sixty or seventy years The avoiding of bad people is the keeping away from rough people who are like dirt on a mules back who show a callous nature through irreverence owing to lack of faithinspired affection for the Buddha and the like in worshipping shrines or elders Good people are those who have much faith in the Buddha and the like and are gentle of mind Discourses which illumine the qualities of and inspire confidence in the Triple Gem are discourses inspiring confidence The inclination towards joy refers to the mind sloping towards this enlightenment factor in all postures of sitting and the like
The completion by culture of this enlightenment factor is through the path of awakening
Calm There are things which condition the enlightenment factor of calm of the body and of the mind and an abundance of right reflection on these things is conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of calm and for the increase expansion and completion by culture of this enlightenment factor when it has arisen
Seven things lead to the arising of the enlightenment factor of calm The resorting to fine food comfortable weather and comfortable postures judgment according to the middle way the avoiding of people who are physically restless the association with people who are physically calm and the inclination towards the development of the enlightenment factor of calm
The resorting to fine food is the resorting to excellent beneficial food that is suitable to one The resorting to comfortable weather and postures means the resorting to weather and postures suitable to one
But he who has the nature of a great man is patient of all kinds of weather and postures Not concerning such a person has the above been said
Judgment according to the middle way is reflection on ones own deed as ones own property and anothers deed as that of others property
The avoiding of people who are physically restless is the keeping away from restless people who go about harassing others with clod and stick
People who are physically calm are those who are quiet because they are restrained on hand and foot The inclination towards the development of this enlightenment factor is the inclining sloping and bending of the mind towards calm in all postures
By the arahants path the completion by culture of this enlightenment factor takes place
Concentration There is the sign of quietude and the sign of nonconfusion and an abundance of right reflection on these is the reason conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of concentration and for the increase expansion and completion by culture of the enlightenment factor of concentration when it has arisen 
There the sign of quietude is just the quietude And in the sense of nondistraction is the sign of nonconfusion to be taken 
Eleven things lead to the arising of concentration Purification of the basis the imparting of evenness to the spiritual controlling faculties skill in taking up the sign of the object of meditation the inciting of the mind on occasion the restraining of the mind on occasion the gladdening of the mind on occasion and the regarding of the mind without interfering on occasion the avoiding of people who are not collected in mind association with people who are collected in mind reflection on the absorptions and the emancipations and the inclination towards the development of the enlightenment factor of concentration
Skill in the taking up of the sign which is the cause for the arising of absorption is skill in taking up the sign
The inciting of the mind on occasion is the applying of the mind vigorously by bringing into being the enlightenment factors of the investigation of mental objects energy and joy when there is excessive laxity of energy and of the application of wisdom and a deficiency of delight in the meditation
The restraining of the mind refers to the checking of the mind that is becoming excessively energetic too strong in the application of wisdom and elated with delight by bringing into being the enlightenment factors of calm concentration and equanimity
The gladdening of the mind means The enlivening with confidence of the mind becomes dissatisfied either through weak application of wisdom or the nonattainment of the bliss of restfulness 
This enlivening is done through reflection on the eight reasons for the upsurge of spiritual feeling namely birth decay disease death the suffering of the four states of woe the samsaric round of suffering in the past and the suffering rooted in the search for nutriment in the present life
and through contemplation on the qualities of the Triple Gem
The regarding of the mind without interfering is the absence of the work of inciting retraining and gladdening the mind which has got to right practice and which proceeds well in the object free from sloth free from restlessness and free from dissatisfaction It is comparable to the state of a charioteer who looks on uninterfering when the horses are going well
The keeping away from persons who have not reached partial or full absorption and are distracted of mind is the avoiding of people who are not collected in mind
Association with persons who have reached those states of absorption is association with people who are collected in mind
The mind inclining sloping and bending towards concentrationproduction in all postures of standing sitting and the like constitutes the inclination for this factor
The completion by culture of the enlightenment factor of concentration is through the path of arahantship
Equanimity There are things which condition the enlightenment factor of equanimity and an abundance of right reflection on these is the reason that is conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of equanimity and for the increase expansion and the completion by culture of the enlightenment factor when it has risen
Five things lead to the arising of the enlightenment factor of equanimity The detached attitude towards beings the detached attitude towards things the avoiding of persons who are egotistical in regard to living beings and things association with people who are neutral in regard to living beings and things and the inclination for developing the enlightenment factor of equanimity
The detached attitude towards beings is brought about by reflection on beings as possessors of their own deeds and by reflection in the highest sense Reflection on beings as possessors of their own deeds is there when a person thinks thus You have been born here by your own deeds in the past and will depart from here and fare according to your own deeds Who then is the being you are attached to  Reflection in the highest sense is thinking in the following way Really no living being exists To whom then can you be attached 
The detached attitude towards things is brought about by reflection on ownerlessness and temporariness A person thinks thus This robe will fade get old become a footcleaning rag and be after that fit only to be taken up at the end of a stick and flung away Surely should there be an owner of this he would not let it come to ruin in this way  This is the reflection on ownerlessness To think that this robe cannot last long and that its duration is short is to reflect on the temporariness of it
These two reflections are applicable in a similar way to the bowl and other things
Persons who are egotistical in regard to living beings are laymen who cherish their own sons and daughters and the like and recluses who cherish their resident pupils mates preceptors and the like And these persons if for instance they are recluses do with their own hands for them whom they cherish haircutting sewing robewashing robedyeing bowllacquering and so forth If even for a short time they do not see their cherished ones they look here and there like bewildered deer and ask Where is such and such novice  or Where is such and such a young bhikkhu And if these recluses are requested by others to send a novice or a young bhikkhu to do some work for them such as haircutting they dont send the novice or young bhikkhu on the pretense that he is not made to do even his own work and that if he is made to do the work of others he would get tired
A person who is egotistical in regard to things is he who cherishes robes bowls beakers walking sticks staffs and so forth and does not let another even touch these When asked for a loan of some article he would say Even I do not use it how can I give it 
A person who is neutral indifferent as regards both living beings and things
is a person who is detached as regards both living beings and things
Inclination for developing this enlightenment factor is the inclining sloping and bending of the mind towards equanimity in all postures of standing and so forth
The completion by culture of the enlightenment factor of equanimity is wrought by the path of awakening
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally The yogi lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects by laying hold of his own enlightenment factors or anothers enlightenment factors or at one time his own enlightenment factors and at another time anothers enlightenment factors
Here origination and dissolution should be known by way of the origination and dissolution of the enlightenment factors
From here on the exposition is just according to the manner already stated 
Having explained thus the contemplation of mental objects by way of the seven factors of enlightenment the Master said And further and so forth in order to explain the meditation by way of the Four Truths
Idam dukkhanti yathabhutam Pajanati  A bhikkhu understands this is suffering according to reality He puts aside craving and understands all things of the three planes of becoming as suffering according to nature He understands according to nature the previous craving that produces and makes to arise that very suffering He understands the nonoccurrence of both suffering and its origin according to nature as Nibbana He understands according to nature the Noble Path which penetrates suffering abandons origination and realizes cessation
The rest of the explanation of the Noble Truths is in the Path of Purity Visuddhi Magga
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally He lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects having laid hold of his own four truths or the four truths of another or at one time his own four truths and at another time anothers four truths
In this explanation of the truths the origination and dissolution of the four truths should be understood according to nature by way of arising and stopping
From here on the explanation is according to the manner already stated
With this have been stated the following twentyone subjects of meditation Breathing Modes of Deportments the Method of the Thirtytwo Parts of the Body the Determination of the Four Modes of Materiality  the Nine Cemetery Contemplations Contemplation of Feeling Contemplation of Consciousness the Laying Hold on the Hindrances the Laying Hold on the Aggregates the Laying Hold on the Sensebases the Laying Hold on the Enlightenment Factors and the Laying Hold on the Truths The Cemetery Contemplations are counted separately
The Contemplation on Breathing the Thirtytwo Parts and the Nine Cemetery Contemplations these eleven are subjects of meditation which produce full absorption
The Dighabhanaka Maha Siva however says that the Nine Cemetery Contemplations are here stated by way of the contemplation of Misery
Therefore according to his view only two subjects Breathing and the Thirtytwo Parts produce full absorption the rest produce only partial absorption
Yo hi koci bhikkhave ime cattaro satipatthane evam bhaveyya  O bhikkhus if anyone develops the Four Arousings of Mindfulness in this manner If any bhikkhu or bhikkhuni or upasaka or upasika
cultivates mindfulness from the beginning according to the method taught here
Titthantu bhikkhave  O bhikkhus let alone
This together with what follows was said by way of the average person capable of being trained
But concerning the person of keen intelligence it was stated as follows Instructed in the morning he will attain in the evening instructed in the evening he will attain in the morning
The Blessed One pointed out the teaching thus Bhikkhus my Dispensation leads to Deliverance in this way closed the instruction that is crowned with arahantship in twentyone places and uttered the following words This is the only way o bhikkhus for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation for the destruction of suffering and grief for reaching the right path for the attainment of Nibbana namely the Four Arousings of Mindfulness
The turn has come for a comment on the Withoutthewalls Discourse placed next to the Jewel Discourse in the Minor Readings which begins thus  Without the walls they stand and wait We shall comment on its meaning after stating the purpose of its inclusion here
Herein although it was not in this order that this Withoutthewalls Discourse was uttered by the Blessed One still the purpose of its inclusion here next to the Jewel Discourse can be understood as follows Either it was uttered for the purpose of showing that although someone neglectful in the practice of profitable action of the various kinds stated in the preceding discourse may be reborn in a place somewhat better than the actual hells and animal womb yet he may still be reborn among such ghosts as these and consequently no one should be negligent therein or else it was uttered for the purpose of showing that some of the beings by whom Vesali was plagued for the allaying of which plagues the Jewel Discourse was uttered were of such kinds as this
Now With this discourse we need to ask
By whom twas told where when and why
The comment is by him done well That can all in due order tell
So as the Commentator I Shall in that way perform the task
By whom was it uttered Where When And why
It may be stated that it was uttered by the Blessed One And that was at Rajagaha on the day following his arrival at Rajagaha the purpose being to give his blessing to the king of Magadha
Ninetytwo aeons ago there was a city called Kasi
The king there was called Jayasena
and his queen was called Sirima The Bodhisatta named Phussa was conceived in her womb After he had eventually discovered complete enlightenment
king Jayasena became possessive with the thought My son made the Great Renunciation and became an Enlightened One The Enlightened One is mine the True Idea is mine the Community is mine  and all the time he himself attended on him allowing no one else a chance to do so
Three of that Blessed Ones younger halfbrothers by a different mother thought Enlightened Ones appear for the whole worlds benefit not for the sake of one person alone and our father allows no one else a chance to attend upon him How can we contrive to attend upon the Blessed One 
Then they thought Let us see if we can find a way
So they had it appear as if the border was in revolt
When the king heard that the border was in revolt he sent his three sons to pacify the border
When that was done and they had come back the king was pleased and offered them a boon  Whatever you want he said take it
They said We want to wait upon the Blessed One
 Take anything but that
They insisted  We have no wish for anything else
 Then take that but set a limit
They asked for seven years but the king would not allow it
Then they asked successively for six five four three two years one year seven months six five four months till they came down to three months
and then the king said You may take it and he allowed them that
When they had obtained the boon they were very contented They approached the Blessed One and after paying homage to himthey said Venerable sir we want to wait upon the Blessed One for three months Venerable sir let the Blessed One consent to this for this threemonths Residence for the Rains 
The Blessed One consented by his silence
Thereupon they sent a letter to a man who was an agent of theirs in the country saying  The Blessed One is to be waited upon by us during these three months Have a dwelling built and prepare everything needed for waiting on the Blessed One 
When he had completed it all he informed them
So after clothing themselves in the yellow cloth they together with two thousand five hundred male retainers conducted the Blessed One to the country waiting on him attentively and they dedicated the dwelling to him and installed him in it
Their treasurer a married householders son had faith and confidence
He took care to give material for alms for the Community headed by the Enlightened One
The country agent received the material and along with eleven thousand men from the countryside he had almsgivings carefully arranged
Now some among those men were disaffected in their hearts
They obstructed the almsgiving themselves ate the stuff to be given and set fire to the refectory
When the Pavarana Ceremony was over the kings sons worshipped the Blessed One and with the Blessed One preceding them they returned to their father
The Blessed One after his return there attained extinction
The king the kings sons the country agent and the treasurer died in due course and with their retinue they were reborn in heaven Those whose hearts had been disaffected were reborn in the hells
And so ninetytwo aeons passed by while these two groups went on being reborn respectively from heaven to heaven and from hell to hell
Then in this auspicious aeon in the time of the Enlightened One Kassapa those with the disaffected hearts were reborn among the ghosts
Now when human beings at that time gave an almsgiving for their own deceased relatives they dedicated it thus  Let it be for our relatives
and those gained excellence thereby
When these ghosts saw that they approached the Blessed One Kassapa and asked him  Venerable sir how can we too gain such excellence
The Blessed One replied  You will not gain it now But in the future there will be an Enlightened One called Gotama In that Blessed Ones time there will be a king called Bimbisara Ninetytwo aeons ago he was your relative When he has given an almsgiving to the Enlightened One he will dedicate it to you You will gain it then
When that was said it seemed to the ghosts as if they had been told  You will gain it tomorrow
Then when one Buddhainterval had passed our Blessed One appeared in the world
and those three kings sons with their two thousand five hundred men fell from the world of gods and were reborn in a Divinecaste clan in the kingdom of Magadha In due course they went forth from the houselife with the seers goingforth and became the three mattedhair ascetics of Gayasisa  The country agent became king Bimbisara and the householder treasurer became the great banker Visakha whose wife named Dhammadinna was a bankers daughter 
And so it was that the whole of the rest of their following was reborn with the kings retinue too
When our Blessed One had appeared in the world then after the seven weeks following upon his enlightenment had gone by he eventually came to Benares where he set the Wheel of the True Idea turning and after the bhikkhus of the Group of Five he disciplined the three mattedhair ascetics with their following of two thousand five hundred and so he came to Rajagaha
And there he established in the fruition of Stream Entry king Bimbisara who had come to visit him that very day and also together with him eleven hosts of Magadhan Divinecaste householders
Then he was invited by the king for the following days meal and he assented On the following day as he entered Rajagaha he was preceded by Sakka Ruler of Gods
controlled and free And with him former mattedhair ascetics Controlled and free
Bright as golden jewel To Rajagaha he came
 who eulogized him with these stanzas the Blessed One went into Rajagaha   And in the kings residence he accepted a great almsgiving
Those ghosts then drew near and waited in the hope  Now the king will dedicate the almsgiving to us now he will dedicate it 
But he thought only about a dwelling place for the Blessed One thus  Where should the Blessed One live  and he did not dedicate that almsgiving to anyone at all
The ghosts finding their hope disappointed made a horrible screeching in the night round the kings residence
The king was disturbed by a sense of urgency and fear and at daybreak he told the Blessed One Venerable Sir I heard such a sound during the night What will happen to me 
The Blessed One told him  Do not be afraid great king no harm will come of it The fact is that former relatives of yours have been reborn among the ghosts and for a whole Buddhainterval they have been kept in expectation of your giving an almsgiving to the Enlightened One and dedicating it to them Yesterday you did not dedicate it and it was because they found their hopes disappointed that they made such a horrible screeching
The king asked  Venerable sir would they obtain it if an almsgiving were given now 
Yes great king
Then venerable sir let the Blessed One accept my invitation for today
The Blessed One accepted
The king went to his residence When he had had a great almsgiving prepared he had the time announced
The Blessed One went together with the Community of Bhikkhus to the royal palace and he sat down on the seat prepared along with the Community of Bhikkhus
The ghosts came and stood without the walls etc thinking  Today we may get it
The Blessed One so had it that they all became apparent to the king
In giving the offeringwater the king made the dedication as follows  Let this be for those relatives and at that same instant lotuscovered pools were generated for those ghosts
They bathed and drank in them till with their troubles weariness and thirst allayed they took on the colour of gold
When the king gave the gruel eatables and comestibles he dedicated them too and at that same moment heavenly gruel eatables and comestibles were generated for them
and when they had eaten them their faculties were refreshed
Thenwhen he gave clothing and lodging he dedicated those too
and heavenly clothing heavenly sandals and heavenly palaces with such various furniture as carpets couches etc were generated for them
This excellence was apparent to all just as the Blessed One had resolved it should be
and the king was highly satisfied
Afterwards when the Blessed One had eaten and shown that he had had enough he uttered these stanzas  Without the walls they stand and wait for the purpose of giving his blessing to the king of Magadha
And at this point what was said in brief in the Schedule namely Of this discourse we need to ask By whom twas told wherewhen and why The comment is by him done well That can all indue order tell has been explained in detail
Now we shall give the commentary in this Withoutthewalls Discourse in due order as follows
In the first stanza  it is the further sides of the walls that is called without the walls 
They stand and wait this phrase asserts their standing and denies their sittingand so on
Now just as they say of one who goes to the further side of enclosures and to the further side of mountains that he goes unhindered through enclosures through mountains  so too here he said of those standing at the further side of the walls without the walls they stand and wait 
And at the junctions and roadforkshere it is both quadruple junctions of  carriageroads and also housejunctions and walljunctions and lightingjunctions that are called junctions
and it is triple junctions of carriageroads that are called  roadforks  Combining these together into one compound he said and at the junctions androadforks
They wait beside the jambs of gates  they stand near the jambs of city gates and house doors
Returning to their erstwhile homes  here  erstwhile homes means both a former relatives home and their own homes in which they formerly lived as owners
They come perceiving both as their own home and that is why returning to their erstwhile homes  is said
So the Blessed One showed the king the many ghosts with their hideous deformed and dreadful bodies who had come to Bimbisaras residence perceiving it as their own house since it was the house of a former relative of theirs although they had not previously lived there and were standing without the walls at the junctions and roadforks and beside the jambs of gates Their existence thus was coessential with the fruit of envy and avarice  There were some wearing long dishevelled beards and hair swarthyfaced with loosejointed dangling emaciated rough blackened limbs who looked like palmyra trees scorched here and there by forest fires there were some whose bodies were inwardly consumed by flames of fire that as it surged up from their bellies with the kindling of hunger and thirst belched from their mouths There were some that owing to their having a gullet no bigger than a needles eye and a mountainous paunch were unable to swallow enough drink and food for their wants even when they got it and so had to relish their own famishedness and parchedness for want of other tastes And there were some that when they found any blood or matter or oilofthejoints oozing from the orifices of each others burst boils and carbuncles orthose of other creatures savoured it as though it were ambrosia So he uttered this stanza
Without the walls they stand and wait And at the junctions and roadforks
Returning to their erstwhile homes They wait beside the jambs of gates 
And when he had said this showing those ghosts he then uttered the second stanza  But when a rich feast is prepared  showing how grim was the result of the action done by them
Herein rich means not little plentiful  as much as is needed is what is meant
It is allowed to substitute the syllable pa for the syllable ba thus transforming bahu into pahu as in such passages as Pahu santo na bharati  does not support a mother    Sn 
Some read pahute and also pahutam 
but those are careless readings
With food and drink annapanamhianne ca panamhi 
Feast khajjabhojje khajje ca bhqjje ca  by that namely anna and pana and khajja and bhojja  he showed the four kinds of nutriment consisting in what is fed on drunk chewed  and supped
Set out  standshaving approached  what is meant is made ready prepared combined
The fact that no man does recall these creatures  when these creatures have appeared in the ghost realm no mother or father or child remembers them
For what reason
It stems from their past acts  it has for its necessary condition the miserly acts classed as nongiving prevention of givingand so on
for that action of theirs does not permit their relatives to remember them
And when he had said this showing that although no little fooddrink etc has been set out and ghosts are wandering round hoping Perhaps something will be given dedicated to us the fact that no one of their relatives remembers them is due to action formerlydone by those ghosts which has this extremely disagreeable ripening then he uttered the third stanza namely So the Blessed One said
But when a rich feast is set out With food and drink of every kind
The fact that no man does recall Those creatures stems from their past acts 
So they who are compassionate At heart do give for relatives again commending to the king the giving of gifts dedicated to relatives who haveappeared in the Ghost Realm
Herein so is a term of comparison
It is construable in two ways either Those who even if they do not recall those creatures owing to their past acts give something no matter what for relatives are compassionate at heart so  or  Those who give for relatives pure good fitting drink and food at these times so great king in the way that you are doing are compassionate at heart 
Do give dadantidenti  do dedicate consign
For relatives for those connected on the mothers and on the fathers side
They who  any sons or daughters or brothers Are hontibhavanti 
Compassionate  benevolent seeking welfare
Pure  spotless good to see delightful to the mindin accordance with the True Idea obtained in accordance with the True Idea
And good  superlative best
At these times  at a time when ghost relatives have come and are standing without the walls and so on
And fitting  suitable becoming fit for Noble Ones use
Drink and food panabhojanampanan ca bhojanan ca 
here anything to be given is intended by the heading drink and food
So commending the Magadhan kings giving drink and food for ghost relatives the Blessed One said 
So they who are compassionate At heart do give for relatives
Such drink and food as may be pure And good and fitting at these times 
And when he had said this he then uttered the first half of the fourth stanza namely  Then let this be for relatives  showing the way in which it is to be given That should be construed with the first half of the third stanza as follows
So they who are compassionate at heart do give for relatives
saying  Then let this be for relatives may relatives have happiness  
Consequently it is the demonstration of the mode of giving that is effected here by the word so  in the sense of mode thus  They give so  Let this be for relatives and not otherwise 
Hereinthis indicates the thing to be given
Vo is only a mere particle as in such passages as Kacci panavo Anuruddha samagga sammodamana and Ye hi vo ariya  it is not the genitive pronoun
Let it befor relatives  let this be for relatives who have appeared in the Ghost Realm
May relatives have happiness  may those relatives who have appeared in the Ghost Realm have happiness when their existence becomes coessential with this
So the Blessed One said  Then let this be for relatives May relatives have happiness  And when he had said this showing in what way a gift should begiven for relatives who have appeared in the Ghost Realm he then uttered the second half of the fourth stanza namely  These ghosts of the departed kin foregathered and assembled there  and the first half of the fifth namely  Will eagerly  for plentiful rich food and drink  showing that although it may be said  Then let this be forrelatives  nevertheless it is not that action done by one gives fruit for another which is never so
but simply that an object dedicated in this way is a necessary condition for ghost relatives themselves to do profitable action and he showed how such profitable action with that as its object generates its fruit at that very moment
Here is the meaning of these two halfstanzas These ghosts of the departed kinwhothere where that almsgivingis being given have foregathered by having come allroundwhat is meant iswho have combined or who have unitedand are assembled what is meant is are come equallythinking  These relatives of ours are dedicating an almsgiving for our benefit 
they will for the plentiful rich food and drink for that rich food and drink dedicated to themselves
eagerly their blessing give  having full faith in the fruit of action and without abandoning their admirationthinking with undistracted cognizance  May this almsgiving be for our benefit and welfare  they are glad and give blessing and are full of happiness and joy
So the Blessed One said  showing how there comes to be profitable action that generates its fruit at the same moment for those who have appeared in the Ghost Realm
These ghosts of the departed kin Foregathered and assembled there
Will eagerly their blessing give For plentiful rich food and drink 
And when he had said this he then uttered the second half of the fifth stanza namely  So may our relatives live long and the first half of the sixth stanza namely  For honour to us has been done showing the kind of thanks giving offered by those relatives once their existence has become coessential with the fruit of profitable action
Here is their meaning So maylivelong maythey have a long lifespan
Our relatives our relations
Owing to whom depending on whom byreason of whom
We have this gain labhamaselabhama
they speak acknowledging the excellence just gained by themselves at that moment
for it is with threefactors namely with their own thanksgiving with the givers dedication and with the excellence of the recipients namely the Community headed by the Buddha that the offering succeeds and generates its fruit at that very moment
and of these three the giver was the special cause
which is why they said Owing to whom we have this gain 
For honour to us has been done honourhas been done to us by those dedicating their almsgiving thus  Then let this be for relatives 
No giver ever lacked the fruit  the givers never lack the fruit of their giving since the action consisting in giving up gives fruit then and there in that continuity in which it was performed
Here it may be asked But how is it then do only relatives reborn in the Ghost Realm gain it or do others gain it too
This has been answered by the Blessed One himself when questioned by Janussoni of the Divine Caste so what need be said by us here
For this is said
 Master Gotama we Divines make almsgivings and give funereal offerings thus  May this serve for departed relatives and kin may departed relatives and kin make use of this gift Does that almsgiving serve for departed relatives and kin Master Gotama Do those departed relatives and kin make useof it
It serves when they are in the place for it Divine not when they are not in the place for it
But Master Gotama what is the place for it and what is not the place for it
Here Divine someoneis a killer of breathing things a taker of what is not given misconducted in sensual desires he speaks falsehood speaks maliciously speaks harshly and gossips he is covetous has cognizanceof ill will and has wrong view On the dissolution of thebody after death he reappears in hell
There he survives and subsists on the kind of nutriment that the denizens of hell have
That is not the place and no almsgiving serves him while he remains there
Here Divine someone is a killer of breathing things    and has wrong view On the dissolution of the body after death hereappears in an animal womb
There he survives and subsists on the kind of nutriment that creatures conceived in the animal womb have
That too is not the place and no almsgiving serves himwhile he remains there
Here Divine someone abstains from killing breathing things from taking what is not given and from misconduct in sensual desires he abstains from false speech from malicious speech from harsh speech and from gossip he is uncovetous has no cognizance of ill will and has right view On the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the company of human beings There he survives and subsists on the kind of nutriment that human beings have  he reappears in the company of the gods
There he survives and subsists on the kind of nutriment that gods have
That too is not the place and no almsgiving serves him while he remains there
However heresomeone is a killer of breathing things    has wrong view
On the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the Ghost Realm
There he survives and subsists on the kind of nutriment that the denizens of the Ghost Realm have or else there he survives and subsists on what his friends or his companions or his relatives and kin offer up for his sake from here in this existence
That is the place and an almsgiving serves him while he remains there
But Master Gotama if that deceased relative has not reappeared in that place who makes use of that almsgiving
There are relatives and kin of his Divine who have reappeared in that place They make use of that almsgiving
But Master Gotama if that deceased relative has not reappeared in that place and if other relatives and kin of his have not reappeared in that place who makes use of that almsgiving
It is impossible Divine it cannot happen that that place should be empty of relatives of his in this long extent of theround of rebirths
and furthermore no giver ever lacked the fruit
So the Blessed One said  And when he had said this showing the king of Magadha how his relatives who had appeared in the Ghost Realm were giving praise supported by their newfound excellence thus Great king these relatives of yours being satisfied with the excellence in the giving are praising you thus 
So may our relatives live long Owing to whom we have this gain
For honour to us has been done No giver ever lacked the fruit  
then he uttered the second half of the sixth stanza namely For there is never ploughing there  and the seventh stanza namely  Nor merchandizing just the same  showing how those who have appeared in the Ghost Realm find their sustenance through what is given from here in the absence of any other such source as ploughing  cattleherding etc as a reason for their obtaining excellence
Here is a comment on the meaning ForGreat Kingtherein the Ghost Realm there is never any kind of ploughing  depending on which those ghosts might obtain excellence
Nor any cattleherding found  not only is there no ploughing  but no cattleherding exists there in the Ghost Realm either depending on which they might obtain excellence
Nor merchandizing just the same  also there is no merchandizing such as could be a cause for their obtaining excellence
Nor bartering for coin of gold there is no buying and selling by means of gold coinage there either such that it could be a cause for their obtaining excellence
The ghosts of the departed kin live there on giving given here  only that there they do live on do make their selfhood continue by means of what is given from here by relatives or friends and companions
Ghosts  creatures that have appeared in the Ghost Realm
Departed gone owing to the time of their own death or else the reading is kalakata in which case the meaning is they have done their time done their dying
There  in that Ghost Realm
So the Blessed One said For there is never ploughing there Nor any cattleherding found Nor merchandizing just the same Nor bartering for coin of gold The ghosts of the departed kin Live there on giving given here And when he had said this he now uttered the pair of stanzas namely As water showered on the hill explaining that meaning with a simile
Here is their meaning Just as  when on the hill  on dry land on a high piece of ground rain is showered down by clouds the water flows down to reach the hollow vale  flows goes to reaches any hollow lowlying piece of ground so the giving of a gift given from here can serve the meaning isbecomes generated manifested forthe ghosts of the departed kin 
since the ghost world is like the hollow place for the water to flow down to and the service of the almsgiving is like the waters flowing down
according as it is said  That is the place and an almsgiving serves him while he remains there 
And just as with the confluence of cascades and springs rills and rivulets pools and meres the great rivers the riverbeds when they are full  can bear the water down to fill the sea  so giving given here can serve the ghosts of the departed kin in the way already stated
So the Blessed One said As water showered on the hill Flows down to reach the hollow vale So giving given here can serve The ghosts of the departed kin As riverbeds when full can bear The water down to fill the sea So giving given here can serve The ghosts of the departed kin And when he had said this and so had explained the meaning with these similes he then uttered the tenth stanza namely  He gave to me  showing that a clansman should give an offering for them recalling as he does so such examples as these since these ghosts are incapable of begging  Give this for me  even when they have come to a relatives house desperate with longing to get something there
Here is its meaning He gave this money to me or this corn and he worked at this task for me by undertaking the management of it himself and he was my kin since he was connected on the mothers or the fathers side or he was my friend since he was capable of being a shelter by his affection or he was my intimate since he was my fellow refuseragwearer in the life gone forth  And so recalling all this in this way let him give gifts then for departed ones let him consign the almsgiving
Another reading is petanam dakkhina dajja 
this means that dajjadaditabba normal gerundive adj
what is that
It is that gift for the departed what is expressed is this this should be done by one who recalls recalling what they used to do in the way beginning  He gave to me 
and then the nominative case of the present participle anussaram should be understood to have the scope of the instrumental that isanussarata
So the Blessed One said 
 He gave to me he worked for me He was my kin friend intimate
Give gifts then for departed ones Recalling what they used to do
And when he had said this showing examples for recollection inthe consigning of an almsgiving for the departed he then uttered the stanza namely  No weeping showing that whilepeople remain overpowered by weeping and sorrow etc on the death of their relatives and give nothing for their benefit their tears and sorrow are only a selfmortification quite sterile of any benefit forthe departed ones
Hereinweeping is the actofweeping weptness  tearshedding by that he indicates bodily distress
Sorrow is the actofsorrowing  sorrowfulness  by that he indicates mental distress
Mourning is the outcrying of one who is affected by loss of relatives his extolling of their special qualities in the way beginning  My onlychild where are you andMy love My darling bythat he indicates verbal distress
So the Blessed One said  No weeping nor yet sorrowing Nor any kind of mourning helps Departed Ones whose kin remain Unhelpful to them acting thus And when he had said showing the unhelpfulness of weeping etcthat as to weeping or sorrowing or any kind of mourning not even all that helps departed ones but their kin who act thus remain only in mere selftorture he then uttered the stanza namely And such an offering as this  showing instead the value of an almsgiving such as that given by the Magadhan king
StanzaHere is its meaning But when this offering Great King is given  as has been done by you today with dedication to ones own relatives well placed in the Community  for them for those departed ghost people then since the Community is the incomparable field of merit for the world  it can serve them long in future can be efficacious fruitful is whatis meant
and so serving it can serve them at once as well  can serve at that very moment instead of long afterwards
And just as it is said of him to whom ideas are perspicuous at that very moment It is perspicuous for a Perfect One at once  so too here what serves at that very moment is said to serve  at once  
Or else what is meant is that it serves in that very place divided into that of the Farnishedandthirsty of the Eatersofvomit of the Livingongiftstoothers of the Consumedbycraving etc of which it is said  That is the place and an almsgiving serves him while he remains there  in which case the adverb thanaso is used in the same way as when in the world outside the Dispensation they say of one giving a kahapana coin that he  gives by kahapanas 
and with this interpretation of the meaning the word serves implies  is manifest is generated 
So the Blessed One saidpointing out the value of the offering given by the king
But when this offering is given Well placed in the Community
For them then it can serve them long In future and at once as well
And when he had said this he then uttered the final stanza praising the king for genuine special qualities on account of the following reasonswhich are these when someone gives such an offering as this the True Idea for relatives is shown by him as the doing of tasks that should be done by relatives for relatives or alternatively an indication is given to the many thus  The True Idea for relatives should be fulfilled by you in doing the tasks that ought to be done by relatives for relatives only in this way and not by selftorture with unhelpful weeping etc and also  High honour is done to the departed by your causing those departed ones to gain heavenly excellence and also strength is furnished for bhikkhus by your supplying with food drink etc the Community headed by the Enlightened One and also no little merit is laid up by you who have evidenced a generous choice equipped with the special qualities of compassion and so on 
So in this final stanza with the line The True Idea for relatives has thus been shown he instructsthe king with a talk on the True Idea
for here the demonstration of the True Idea for relatives is itself the instruction  Then with the second line And how high honour to departed ones is done he urges him in undertaking 
for here the praise  high is itself the urging to undertake that honour again and again
Then with the line And how the bhikkhus can be given strength as well he rouseshim
for here the giving of strength itself is the rousing by increasing his activity in the provision of strength stated as  The provision of strength to those of such kind  
And with the line And how great merit can be stored away by you he encourages him
for here the commemorating of notable merit should itself be understood as the encouraging since it produces encouragement by laying emphasis on his special qualities as they actually are
And when the preaching was ended eightyfour thousand breathing things attained to the True Ideal by reasoned endeavouring due to the sense of urgency occasioned by the emphasis laid on the danger in appearance in the Ghost Realm
And on the following day the Blessed One preached this same Withoutthewalls Discourse to gods and men and so up to the seventh day with a like attainment to the True Ideal
The explanation of the Withoutthewalls Discourse in the Illustrator of Ultimate Meaning the Commentary on the Minor Booksis ended
Why did the Buddha give this discourse saying Monks I shall now expound to you the method of controlling of all cankers
In order to effect the total destruction of cankers in those monks by cleansing their minds of the slightest of impurities and establishing them on the path leading to the total destruction of cankers
Here the method of controlling all cankers means the technique which by itself acts to control and gets rid of all cankers That is to say the means by which the cankers are cleared and put away in a manner that they are destroyed abandoned and never recur as implied by the terms such as extinguished irreversible etc What is indicated by a method of controlling is an effective practical device
Here canker means whatever flows out As it is said it discharges it oozes from the sense faculties that is to say eye ear nose tongue body and the mind
In terms of internal phenomena ie states of consciousness it flows until it reaches the threshold state of the supramundane path insight  the state of gotrabu
Alternatively it is canker in the sense of something that has been fermenting for long like liquor and such other spirits
Thus because it is like a fermented stuff it is canker
Again whatever extends or prolongs is also canker in that it perpetuates the process of suffering in phenomenal existence
Of these definitions of canker the first one stands for asava as defilment the second for asava as kamma
Not only does canker connte defilement and kamma but it also means varieties of distress or misfortune as implied by the last definition
In the discourses the reference Cunda I dont teach the Dhamma only for the riddance of cankers pertaining to the life here and now  implying something as the very rootcause of involvements or conflicts stnds for the cankers as defilements 
Those whereby one is born among the gods Or as a gandhabba or as a bird
Or whereby one goes to the realm of the yakkhas Or one finds a birth amidst human beings
Those cankers they are demolished and annihilated
Here kamma pertaining to the three realms of existence as well as the unwholesome factors following thereof are implied
Again the reference for the purpose of ridding the cankers pertaining to life here and now and for the purpose of warding off the cankers pertaining to life hereafter here the various forms of misfortune such as false accusations by others or being guilty of crimes like murder assault etc or the innumerable oppressive forms of suffering as experienced in the various woeridden fallen states of existence  these stand for asava as misfortune
Whatever is the connotation of canker what is meant in a given context has to be identified and understood in the proper perspective
With regard to the various classifications of cankers the text as found in the Vinaya for the purpose of ridding the cankers pertaining to life here and now and for the purpose of warding off cankers pertaining to life hereafter implies asavas of two distinct types
Similarly the text as found in the Salayatana Vagga there are these three types of cankers bhikkhus the canker of sensual desire the canker of desire for the continuity of existence and the canker of ignorance  implies three types
In several other suttas as well as in the Abhidhamma these three cankers together with the canker of wrong view  constitute a fourfold classification
The text as found in the Nibbedhapariyaya Sutta  mentions this fivefold classification Monks there are cankers which lead to the animal kingdom there are cankers which lead one to the realm of ghosts there are cankers which lead one to the world of human beings and there are cankers which lead one to the divine sphere 
The test as found in the chakka Nipata  Monks there are cankers to be overcome through selfrestraint and so on provides a sixfold classification of asavas 
In this sutta these six coupled with cankers to be overcome through insight form a sevenfold classification
Thus are presented the definitions as well as the classifications of the term asava canker
Now with regards to the term control it means to get rid of cankers that is to say to overcome to ward off and not allow them to arise
As it is said in these texts I enjoin upon you monks to close the door of your rooms when you retire there to take rest  and restraining currents of craving do I exhort with wisdom are they quelled  In both of these text the term control is used in the sense of overcoming
This control by virtue by mindfulness by wisdom by patience and by effort
There he bides by the code of monastic conduct implies control by virtue
for the monastic code of conduct as virtue is one form of control
Similarly one living selfcontrolled by having control by mindfulness is meant
In other words mindfulness itself is a mode of control
Again Restraining do I exhort The currents of craving With wisdom alone Are the quelled  This refers to control by wisdom
Since wisdom controls in the sense of quelling the currents it has been referred to as a mode of control
Again he is one who bears cold heat hunger and thirst Etc and he does not endure an arisen thought of sensuality he gets rid of it etc Imply control by endurance and by effort respectively
All these five modes of control are indicated by the phrase The method of control of all cankers So is to be understood
Of the five modes of control incorporated in the Sabbasava Sutta control by endurance and by effect have been already mentioned
Where it is said wisely reflecting he avoids sitting in such unseemly seats or resorting to such unseemly resorts etc there it refers to control by the monastic code of conduct
And wisely reflecting he lives selfcontrolled by having control by mindfulness
Wherever the expression wisely reflecting occurs it stands for control by wisdom
and by this token the three methods that is overcoming by insight by judicious use and by development also stand for control by wisdom
And by the term method these five types of control are signified which like all phenomena are also subject to arising and passing away Therefore it is to be understood that method implies a dynamic inner state
Thus far whatever has to be made explicit concerning the phrase the method of control of all cankers has now been made
only for him who understands
the terms understandscomprehends are synonyms They mean the same thing though in different words
However specifically ie in this context one who understands means one who is able to rouse wise consideration And one who comprehends means one who comprehends in such a manner that unwise consideration may not arise Wise consideration is thus the underlying purpose
There wise consideration means right thinking and attention according to reality When a thing is impermanent and so on one considers it as impermanent and so on this turning of the mind to the actuality of things the repeated dwelling thereon and the thinking in keeping therewith  this is called the wise consideration
On the other hand unwise consideration is considering in a lopsided manner in a basically wrong way
When a thing is impermanent one considers it to be permanent when a thing really means affliction one considers it to be happiness when a thing is unsubstantial one considers it to be substantial when a thing is repulsive one considers it to be attractive
This kind of wrong consideration or perverted viewing that is to say that turning of the mind in contravention of actuality the repeated dwelling thereon inclining the mind thereto the focusing of attention thereon and thinking to controvert actuality  this is unwise consideration
When one understands how wise consideration arises and one comprehends how unwise consideration does not arise then does the destruction of cankers occur
Now in order to show the fitness of the rationale the Buddha has enunciated Monks for one who unwisely considers  are overcome
What exactly is meant by this Cankers arise because one attends to an object in a distorted or wrong way and similarly they are overcome when one attends to an object in a right way Therefore one who attends ie is able to consider wisely is one who understands and likewise one who attends in a way that unwise consideration does not arise is one who comprehends Briefly this is what is meant
The detailed explanation is as follows obviously the entire discourse is based on two premises denoted by the terms inwise and wise
in other words it has been enunciated by way of the round of repeated rebirths and by way of cessation of the round
The round of phenomenal existence or repeated birth death and rebirth is rooted in unwise consideration and the cessation of the round is rooted in wise consideration
How
Unwise consideration when indulged in produces ignorance and craving for becoming
and when ignorance arises then conditioned by ignorance kammaformations arise conditioned by kamma formations rebirthconsciousness arise and so on Thus there comes about the genesis of the whole mass of suffering
Similarly when craving occurs then conditioned by craving clinging arises etc and there comes about the genesis of the whole mass of suffering 
Just as a ship is broken tormented by the fierce smashing of a hurricane or just as a flock of cattle while crossing the river is caught in a whirlpool or just as oxen tied to the yoke of an oilmill endlessly circling even so a person given much to unwise consideration is tied down to and thoroughly enmeshed in the various phenomenal states of existence He is born now here now there in a certain plane or destiny of a living being which means that his consciousness is established therein Thus the round of repeated existence is rooted in unwise consideration
Contrarily when wise consideration is cultivated one develops the Noble Eightfold Path spearheaded by Right Understanding as indicated by the words of the Blessed One monks for a monk who is endowed with wise consideration this is to be expected namely he will develop the Noble Eightfold Path he will repeatedly practise the Noble Eightfold Path
Right Understanding here is the penetrating intuitive wisdom or insight With the flash of this insight there comes about the extinction of ignorance With the extinction of ignorance there comes about the extinction of kammaformations etc thus there comes about the extinction without a remainder of this whole mass of suffering  Thus the cessation of the round is to be understood as rooted in wise consideration
Therefore the entire Sabbasava Sutta is founded on these two premises denoted by unwise and wise consideration
On the other hand there is the case of a monk Maha Tissabhuta Thera by name a resident of Mandalarama monatery It seems that motivated by a tremendous spiritual urge he had entered the Holy Order and was living an exemplary life of spirituality
Once on his almsround he was confronted with the sight of a female that momentarily disturbed the purity of his mind affecting it by sensual thought However he quickly put down the wrong thought
whether these things are worthy of consideration or not there is no definite criterion in terms of their intrinsic quality though there is in terms of how they are considered
Here the canker of sensedesire means lust or sensuality based on fivefold objects of sense pleasures
The canker of becoming means that form of desire which hankers after rebirth in the divine realms of the Brahmas with subtle forma and beings who are formless It also means those selfdeceptive mystic deviations or wishes associated with the attainment of the jhanas  in that one induces jhana only to enjoy it as well as those perverted ideological views and dogmas known as the eternalistic belief and annihilistic belief
Thus a fourth canker that of wrong view is included here under the canker of becoming
The canker of ignorance means nescience or incomprehension with reference to the Four Noble Truths
There when one considers in a way that one enjoys the pleasures of the senses then the unarisen canker of sensual desire arises and the arisen canker grows
When one considers in a way that one enjoys the sublime or divine states then the unarisen canker of becoming arises and the arisen canker grows
When one considers all the things pertaining to the three realms of existence on the basis of the fourfould mental distortions the impermanent to be permanent etc then the unarisen canker of ignorance arises and the arisen canker grows
since all dormant tendencies occur only in this process of becoming and not in cessation thereof
one should determine to make this personality that is the aggregates cankerfree beginning with the aggregate of corporeality in this manner in this socalled body there are only the elements of earth water and the rest Having determined ones own personality in terms of the four primary elements and the derived corporeality arising therewith
one should examine the consciousness and the mental factors which arise making this body their object and thus comprehend also the four immaterial aggregates 
Thereafter all these five aggregates are intuitively penetrated in terms of the truth of suffering
These five aggregates automatically get reduced to the two principle phenomena of mind and body
and understanding arises that this psycophysical combination namarupa is causally originated
comes into being dependent on conditions by actually identifying the factors such as ignorance craving for becoming mental volition  acting as the psychic nutriment etc thus this is the cause this is the condition dependent on which the namarupa originates
That is he penetrates into the underlying characteristics and the functions of both the causative factors and the phenomena arising conditionally therefrom Then he intuitively understands the characteristic of transitoriness by seeing through the changefulness of the phenomena under scrutiny Then he determines the characteristic of suffering by intuiting affliction intrinsic in the oppressive condition of ceaseless rise and fall
Following this experience he then determines the characteristic of unsubstantiality by intuitively understanding the substancelessness intrinsic in a condition over which one has no hold or control 
Thus having grasped the three characteristics he brings about the arising of the various stages of intuitive insights one after the other and thus attains to the supramundane pathinsight of StreamEntrance
At the moment of gaining the supramundane pathinsight all the Four Noble Truths are presented at once as an integral experience
This is a victory that is achieved at one stroke of conquest In that unique moment one penetrates into the truth of suffering by fully and directly comprehending it penetrates into the cause by uprooting it penetrates into the cessation by realising it and penetrates into the path by developing it
In other words he conquers suffering by means of the conquest of direct knowledge conquers the cause of suffering by means of the conquest of uprooting craving conquers the realisation of Nibbana by means of the conquest of cessation of suffering and conquers the path leading to the cessation of suffering by means of the conquest of development of the Noble Eightfold Path
it should be understood that all these victories are not gained by separate insights but by just one single insight which has the truth of cessation Nibbana as the object and which penetrates the remaining Truths both as a function and as a conquest
At that moment of victory a thought such as this never occurs to him here I am comprehending suffering I am uprooting craving I am realising Nibbana I am developing the Noble Eightfold Path one by one
But by making it the object of his insight as he realises Nibbana the very same insight simultaneously comprehends the actuality of suffering uproots the cause thereof and develops the path leading to the cessation thereof
By means of this insight meditation as he exercises wise reflection these three fetters are also instantaneously severed selfillusion  comprising the twenty types of wrong views  sceptical doubt  comprising the eight kinds  and superstitious belief in rules and rituals  by way of the blind adherence to dogmas and external practices saying purification is brought about only by these rules and these rituals and so on
Regarding the four cankers since selfillusion and superstitious belief in rites and rituals are already included in the canker of wrong views they are both cankers as well as fetters
Sceptical doubt is only a fetter not a canker
But since it has been included within the method of overcoming through supramundane insight it is also to be construed as a canker 
Now when the canker of wrong view is overcome the cankers of sensual desire and of ignorance which coexist with it in four unwholesome states of consciousness accompanied by wrong view are also overcome
because it leads or contributes to Enlightenment it is the component Enlightenment it is called an Enlightenment Factor
Awakens means one wakes up from the slumber of the defilements One penetrates into or fully comprehends the Four Noble Truths One realizes Nibbana the Summum Bonum
But why have only seven Enlightenment Factors been enunciated by the Blessed One not less and not more
By way of their antithetical to the extremes of dullness and disquiet as also by way of being the common factor beneficial to all
Now while three factors of Enlightenment are diametrically opposed to the dull or inactive inclination
three others counteract the disquiet or overactive tendency of the mind
and one functions as the common factor beneficial to all
One develops means one cultivates them That is one rouses them brings them to being repeatedly in ones stream of consciousness
As one gives up abandons one also advances towards Nibbana
Here the defilements of action are themselves action either in so far as sentient beings are defiled by these actions or in so far as these actions are associated with the defilements 
He does an evil action while taking a wrong course of action because of partiality if he treats one who is not the owner as the owner out of affection and the like saying This my friend or my acquaintance or my relative or He is giving me a bribe
He does an evil action while taking a wrong course of action because of enmity if he treats one who is the owner as one who is not the owner either out of a natural hostility or out of an access of anger arisen in that moment saying This is my enemy
He does an evil action while taking a wrong course of action because of delusion if he treats one who is not the owner as the owner out of dullness out of delusion saying this or that
He does an evil action while taking a wrong course of action because of fear if he treats one who is not the owner as the owner out of fearing that This is either a kings favourite or a wrongdoer he could even harm me
Thus while distributing something one gives more out of love thinking This is my acquaintance or else my companion one gives less out or enmity thinking This is my enemy one gives more to someone fearing that If I did not give it to him he could even harm me one gives less to someone and more to someone else without realizing what given or is not being given out of delusion This man belonging to all four types does an evil action while taking the wrong courses of action starting with the one caused by partiality in the order just mentioned
Evident means visible to oneself to be seen by oneself
Loss of wealth means loss of wealth
Increase or quarrels increase of verbal quarrels and bodily quarrels with hand contact
A source of diseases means a culture ground for this and that disease eg eyediseases and so on
Production of disrepute means having drunk liquor one hits both ones mother and ones father one says much not to be said and one does much not to he done
Therefore while incurring blame punishment and mutilation of hands feet and other limbs they incur disrepute both in this world and in the other world Therefore that liquor is said to involve a production of disrepute for them
Exposure of the private parts means though they are parts of the body to be concealed when uncovered they disturb ie eliminate decency therefore they are called private parts Indeed men inebriated by liquor walk with their member uncovered Therefore for them that liquor in that it exposes their private parts is said to be causing the exposure of the private parts
Weakening of understanding means it weakens the understanding that one is responsible for ones actions
His body is unguarded unprotected means while walking at the wrong time he treads upon stumps thorns and the like and he comes across a snake or an ogre and the like And his enemies knowing that he is going to suchandsuch place rob him or kill him in an ambush
In this sense his body is unguarded unprotected
Ones children and wife think Our father our husband is wandering at night What about us So his sons and daughters and his wife wishing to go out while wandering at night meet with misfortune and ruin
In this sense also his children and wife are unguarded unprotected
Property means having heard that his children wife and servants wander at night thieves enter his unattended house and steal what they want
In this sense also his property is unguarded unprotected
He is suspected means he may be suspected even of evil actions done by others for the people will say He must have done it
If he crosses anybodys threshold and there someone else has committed theft or adultery He has done it they say and albeit false ie untrue this rumour grows is attached to him
And many painful experiences  means it is not possible to state the specific amount of pain and the specific amount of sorrow Lacking another man all that must be related to one who wanders at unseemly hours In this sense he faces he confronts many painful experiences 
Where is there dancing means one has to ask in what place dancing by dancers actors etc is going on and has to go to the village or town where it is going on Thinking Tomorrow I am going to a dancing performance today he stops working all day just to prepare his clothes garlands perfumes etc He spends one two or three days there at the dancing performance Then the wealth yet to be produced in spite of meeting with aboundant rains and other favourable conditions is not produced if he does not take action to sow and do the rest Knowing that he is not at home thieves do what they want in his unguarded house Thereby even his already produced wealth is lost
The some exegesis applies to the following sentences starting with where is there singing
For saying I have won in the midst of the assembly one grabs the cloak or the turban of ones opponent The latter in the midst of the assembly says You are disrespecting me Very good Ill teach you a lesson fixing his hatred upon him Thus if one wins one begets hatred
If one loses means being defeated by someone else one mourns for ones cloak or turban or for any other wealth such as gold and money etc that has been taken from him Therefore one grieves Alas I had it Alas I dont have it
Thus if one loses one mourns for ones wealth
When one is in an assembly ones word does not prevail means in a court of law if one is asked as a witness ones word does not stand unquestioned and one will be liable to criticism This is a gambler addicted to dice do not accept his word
One is despised by friends and companions for friends and companions thus speak to him Dear friend you the son of a good family only by name wander as a corrupt and degraded gambler This does not become your caste and lineage From now on dont do it
Even though one is so spoken to one does not follow their word
Therefore they do not stay or sit together with him
Even though they are asked as witnesses for his sake they do not speak
