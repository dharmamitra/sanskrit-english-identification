whom he has set up a keen sense of moral shame and moral dread affection and reverenceThis is the first cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life when it has not been obtained and to its increase maturation and fulfillment by development after it has been obtainedAs he is living in dependence on the Teacher or on a certain fellow monk in the position of a teacher toward whom he has set up a keen sense of moral shame and moral dread affection and reverence he approaches them from time to time and inquires How is this Bhante What is the meaning of this Those venerable ones then disclose to him what has not been disclosed clear up what is obscure and dispel his perplexity about numerous perplexing pointsThis is the second cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual lifeHaving heard that Dhamma he resorts to two kinds of withdrawal withdrawal in body and withdrawal in mindThis is the third cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual lifeHe is virtuous he dwells restrained by the Patimokkha possessed of good conduct and resort seeing clanger in minute faults Having Undertaken the training rules he trains in themThis is the fourth cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual lifeHe has learned much remembers what he has learned and accumulates what he has learnedThose teachings that are good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life  such teachings as these he has learned much of retained in mind recited verbally mentally investigated and penetrated well by viewThis is the fifth cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual lifeHe has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities he is strong firm in exertion not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualitiesThis is the sixth cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual lifeIn the midst of the Sangha he does not engage in rambling and pointless talkEither he himself speaks on the Dhamma or he requests someone else to do so or he adopts noble silenceThis is the seventh cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual lifeHe dwells contemplating arising and vanishing in the five aggregates subject to clinging Such is form such its origin such its passing away such is feeling  such is perception  such are volitional activities  such is consciousness such its origin such its passing awayThis is the eighth cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life when it has not been obtained and to its increase maturation and fulfillment by development after it has been obtainedHis fellow monks esteem him thus This venerable one lives in dependence on the Teacher or on a certain fellow monk in the position of a teacher toward whom he has set up a keen sense of moral shame and moral dread affection and reverenceThis venerable one surely knows and seesThis quality leads to affection respect esteem accord and unityAs this venerable one is living in dependence on the Teacher or on a certain fellow monk in the

spiritual life when it has not been obtained and to its increase maturation and fulfillment by development after it has been obtainedAt SavatthiBhikkhus there are these five aggregates subject to clingingWhat fiveThe form aggregate subject to clinging the feeling aggregate subject to clinging the perception aggregate subject to clinging the volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging the consciousness aggregate subject to clingingSo long as I did not directly know as they really are the five aggregates subject to clinging in four phases I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas Mara and Brahma in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins its devas and humansBut when I directly knew all this as it really is then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with  its devas and humansAnd how bhikkhus are there four phasesI directly knew form its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation I directly knew feeling  perception  volitional formations  consciousness its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessationAnd what bhikkhus is formThe four great elements and the form derived from the four great elementsthis is called formWith the arising of nutriment there is the arising of form With the cessation of nutriment there is the cessation of formThis Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of form that is right view  right concentrationWhatever ascetics and brahmins having thus directly known form its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation are practising for the purpose of revulsion towards form for its fading away and cessation they are practising wellThose who are practising well have gained a foothold in this Dhamma and DisciplineAnd whatever ascetics and brahmins having thus directly known form its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation through revulsion towards form through its fading away and cessation are liberated by nonclinging they are well liberatedThose who are well liberated are consummate onesAs to those consummate ones there is no round for

tactile objects perception of mental phenomenaThis is called perceptionWith the arising of contact there is the arising of perception With the cessation of contact there is the cessation of perceptionThis Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of perception that is right view  right concentrationAnd what bhikkhus are volitional formationsThere are these six classes of volition volition regarding forms volition regarding sounds volition regarding odours volition regarding tastes volition regarding tactile objects volition regarding mental phenomenaThese are called volitional formationsWith the arising of contact there is the arising of volitional formations With the cessation of contact there is the cessation of volitional formationsThis Noble Eightfold Path is

themAnd a certain practiser of mortification called Nigrodha consulted me about the practice of austerityAnd he was delighted with my explanation beyond all measureI will even wait four years and at the end of that time let the monks give me the goingforth and the monastic ordinationBirth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is nothing further hereAnd the Venerable Kassapa became another of the ArahantsAgain I see one who practises little austerityarising in a state of woeAgain I see one who practises little austerityarising after death in a good place a heavenly stateIf a naked ascetic were to do all these things and if this were the measure and practice of the difficulty the great difficulty of being an ascetic or Brahmin it would not be right to say It is hard to be an ascetic it is hard to be a Brahminbecause any householder or householders son  even the slavegirl who draws water  could do this saying Well I will go nakedThat is the perfection of morality He guards the sensedoors etcKassapa a practiser of selfmortification may do all these thingsOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthiin the Eastern Park in the Mansion of Migaras Mother together with a great Sangha of bhikkhusNow on that occasion  the Uposatha day of the fifteenth a fullmoon night  the Blessed One was sitting out in the open surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhusThen a certain bhikkhu rose from his seat arranged his upper robe over one shoulder raised his joined hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and said to him Venerable sirI would ask the Blessed One about a certain point if the Blessed One would grant me the favour of answering my questionWell then bhikkhu sit down in your own seat and ask whatever you wishYes venerable sir that bhikkhu replied Then he sat down in his own seat and said to the Blessed One Arent these the five aggregates subject to clinging venerable sir that is the form aggregate subject to clinging the feeling aggregate subject to clinging the perception aggregate subject to clinging the volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging Those are the five aggregates subject to clinging bhikkhu that is the form aggregate subject to clinging the feeling aggregate subject to clinging the perception aggregate subject to clinging the volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging the consciousness aggregate subject to clingingSaying Good venerable sir that bhikkhu delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones statement Then he asked the Blessed One a further questionBut venerable sir in what are these five aggregates subject to clinging rooted These five aggregates subject to clinging bhikkhu are rooted in desire Venerable sir is that clinging the same as these five aggregates subject to clinging or is the clinging something apart from the five aggregates subject to clinging Bhikkhus that clinging is neither the same as the five aggregates subject to clinging nor is the clinging something apart from the five aggregates subject to clinging But rather the desire and lust for them that is the clinging thereSaying Good venerable sir that bhikkhu  asked the Blessed One a further questionBut venerable sir can there be diversity in the desire and lust for the five aggregates subject to clinging There can be bhikkhu the Blessed One said Here bhikkhu it occurs to someone May I have such form in the future May I have such feeling in the future May I have such perception in the future May I have such volitional formations in the future May I have such consciousness in the future Thus bhikkhu there can be diversity in the desire and lust for the five aggregates subject to clingingSaying Good venerable sir that bhikkhu  asked the Blessed One a further questionIn what way venerable sir does the designation aggregates apply to the aggregates Whatever kind of there is bhikkhu whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near  this is called the form aggregateWhatever kind of feeling there is whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near this is called the feeling aggregate Whatever kind of perception there is whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near this is called the perception aggregate Whatever kind of volitional formations there are whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferioror or superior far or near this is called the volitional formations aggregate Whatever kind of consciousness there is whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near this is called the consciousness aggregateIt is in this way bhikkhu that the designation aggregates applies to the aggregatesSaying Good venerable sir that bhikkhu  asked the Blessed One a further questionWhat is the cause and condition venerable sir for the manifestation of the form aggregate What is the cause and condition for the manifestation of the feeling aggregate  for the manifestation of the perception aggregate  for the manifestation of the volitional formations aggregate  for the manifestation of the consciousness aggregate The four great elements bhikkhu are the cause and conditon for the manifestation of the form aggregateContact is the cause and condition for the manifestation of the feeling aggregateContact is the cause and condition for the manifestation of the perception aggregateContactis the cause and condition for the manifestation of the volitional formations aggregateNameandform is the cause and condition for the manifestation of the consciousness aggregateVenerable sir how does identity view come to be Here bhikkhu the uninstructed worldling who is not a seer of the noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma who is not a seer of superior persons and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma regards form as self or self as possessing form or form as in self or self as in form He regards feeling as self  perception as self  volitional formations as self  consciousness as self or self as possessing consciousness or consciousnessas in self or self as in consciousnessThat is how identity view comes to beBut venerable sir how does identity view not come to be Here bhikkhu the instructed noble disciple who is a seer of the noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma who is a seer of superior persons and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma does not regard form as self or self as possessing form or form as in self or self as in form He does not regard feeling as self  perception as self  volitional formations as self  consciousness as self or self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousnessThat is how identity view does not come to beWhat venerable sir is the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of form What is the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of feeling  in the case of perception  in the case of volitional formations  in the case of consciousness The pleasure and joy bhikkhu that arise in dependence on form this is the gratificationin formThat form is impermanent suffering and subject to change this is the danger in formThe removal and abandonment of desire and lust for form this is the escape from formThe pleasure and joy that arise in dependence on feeling  in dependence on perception  in dependence on volitional formations  in dependence on consciousness this is the gratification in consciousnessThat consciousness is impermanent suffering and subject to change this is the danger in consciousnessThe removal and abandonment of desire and lust for consciousness this is the escape from consciousnessSaying Good venerable sir that bhikkhu delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones statement Then he asked the Blessed One a further questionVenerable sir how should one know how should one see so that in regard to this body with consciousness and in regard to all external signs Imaking minemaking and the underlying tendency to conceit no longer occur within Any kind of form whatsoever bhikkhu whether past future or present internal or extemal gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near  one sees all form as it really is with correct wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfAny kind of feeling whatsoever  Any kind of perception whatsoever  Any kind of volitional formations whatsoever  Any kind of consciousness whatsoever whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near  one sees all consciousness as it really is with correct wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfWhen one knows and sees thus bhikkhu then in regard to this body with consciousness and in regard to all external signs Imaking minemaking and the underlying tendency to conceit no longer occur withinNow on that occasion the following reflection arose in the mind of a certain bhikkhu So it seems that form is nonself feeling is nonself perception is nonself volitional formations are nonself consciousness is nonself What self then will deeds done by what is nonself affect Then the Blessed One knowing with his own mind the reflection in the mind of that bhikkhu addressed the bhikkhus thusIt is possible bhikkhus that some senseless man here obtuse and ignorant with his mind dominated by craving might think that he can outstrip the Teachers Teaching thus So it seems that form is nonself  consciousnessis nonselfWhat self then will deeds done by what is nonself affect Now bhikkhus you have been trained by me through interrogation here and there inregard to diverse teachingsWhat do you think bhikkhu is form permanent or impermanent  Impermanent venerable sir  Is feeling permanent or impermanent  Is perception permanent or impermanentAre volitional formations permanent or impermanent  Is consciousness permanent or impermanent  Impermanent venerable sir Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness  Suffering venerable sir Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self  No venerable sirTherefore  Seeing thus  He understands  there is no more for this state of being These are the ten questions The bhikkhu came to askTwo about the aggregates Whether the same can there beDesignation and the cause Two about identityOne each on gratification And this body with consciousnessAt SavatthiBhikkhus form is impermanentWhat is impermanent is suffering What is suffering is nonself What is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfWhen one sees this thus as it really is with correct wisdom the mind becomes dispassionate and is liberated from the taints by nonclingingFeeling is impermanent  Perception is impermanent  Volitional formations are impermanent  Consciousness is impermanentWhat is impermanent is suffering What is suffering is nonself What is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfWhen one sees this thus as it really is with correct wisdom the mind becomes dispassionate and is liberated from the taints by nonclingingIf bhikkhus a bhikkhus mind has become dispassionate towards the form element it is liberated from the taints by nonclinging If his mind has become dispassionate towards the feeling element  towards the perception element  towards the volitional formations element  towards the consciousness element it is liberated from the taints by nonclingingBeing unagitated he personally attains NibbanaHe understands Destroyed is birth the holy lifehas been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more for this state of being By being liberated it is steadyby being steady it is contentby being content he is not agitatedOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Ayojjha on the bank of the river GangesThere the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thusA man with good sight would inspect it ponder it and carefully investigate itFor what substance could there be in a lump of foamSo too bhikkhus whatever kind of form there is whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near a bhikkhu inspects it ponders it and carefully investigates itFor what substance could there be in formSupposebhikkhus that in the autumn when it is raining and big rain drops are falling a water bubble arises and bursts on the surface of the waterA man with good sight would inspect it ponder it and carefully investigate itFor what substance could there be in a water bubbleSo too bhikkhus whatever kind of feeling there is whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near a bhikkhu inspects it ponders it and carefully investigates itFor what substance could there be in feelingSupposebhikkhus that in the last month of the hot season at high noon a shimmering mirage appearsA man with good sight would inspect it ponder it and carefully investigate it and it would appear to him to be void hollow insubstantialFor what substance could there be in a mirageSo too bhikkhus whatever kind of perception there is whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near a bhikkhu inspects it ponders it and carefully investigates it and it would appear to him to be void hollow insubstantial For what substance could there be in perceptionSuppose bhikkhus that a man needing heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood would take a sharp axe and enter a forestAs he unrolls the coil he would not find even softwoodlet alone heartwoodA man with good sight would inspect it pander it and carefully investigate itFor what substance could there be in the trunk of a plantain treeSo too bhikkhus whatever kind of volitional formations there are whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near a bhikkhu inspects them ponders them and carefully investigatesthemAs he investigates them they appear to him to be void hollow insubstantialFor what substance could there be in volitional formationsSuppose bhikkhus that a magician or a magicians apprentice would display a magical illusion at a crossroadsA man with good sight would inspect it ponder it and carefully investigate itFor what substance could there be in a magical illusionSo too bhikkhus whatever kind of consciousnessthere is whether past future or present internal or externalgrossor subtle inferior or superior far or near a bhikkhu inspects it ponders it and carefully investigatesitFor what substance could there be in consciousnessSeeing thus bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards form revulsion towards feeling revulsion towards perception revulsion towards volitional formations revulsion towards consciousnessExperiencing revulsion he becomes dispassionate Through dispassion hismind is liberatedWhen it is liberated there comes the knowledge Its liberated He understands Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more for this state of being This is what the Blessed One saidHaving said this the Fortunate One the Teacher further said thisBhikkhus suppose that this river Ganges was carrying along a great lump of foamand it would appear to him to be void hollow insubstantialand it would appear to him to be void hollow insubstantialand it would appear to him to be void hollow insubstantialand it would appear to him to be void hollow insubstantialThere he would see the trunk of a large plantain tree straight fresh without a fruitbud coreHe would cut it down at the root cut off the crown and unroll the coiland it would appear to him to be void hollow insubstantialand it would appear to him to be void hollow insubstantialand it would appear to him to be void hollow insubstantialForm is like a lump of foam Feeling like a water bubbleHowever one may ponder it And carefully investigate itWith reference to this body The One of Broad Wisdom has taughtWhen vitality heat and consciousness Depart from this physical bodySuch is this continuum This illusion beguiler of foolsA bhikkhu with energy aroused Should look upon the aggregates thusHe should discard all the fetters And make a refuge for himselfPerception is like a mirage Volitions like a plantain trunkAnd consciousness like an illusion So explained the Kinsman of the SunIt appears but hollow and void When one views it carefullyThat with the abandoning of three things One sees this form discardedThen it lies there cast away Food for others without volitionIt is taught to be a murderer Here no substance can be foundWhether by day or at nightl Comprehending ever mindfulLet him

venerable sir is it said Empty is the world It is Ananda because it is empty of self and of what belongs to self that it is said Empty is the worldAnd what is empty of self and of what belongs to selfThe eye Ananda is empty of self and of what belongs to selfForms are empty of self and of what belongs to self Eyeconsciousness is empty of self and of what belongs to self Eyecontact is empty of

ParkThen in the evening the Venerable Udayi emerged from seclusion and approached the Venerable AnandaHe exchanged greetings with the Venerable Ananda and when they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk he sat down to one side and said to himFriend Ananda in many ways the nature ofl this body has been declared disclosed and revealed by the Blessed One thus For such a reason this body is nonself Is it possible to explain the nature ofthis consciousness in a similar wayto teach proclaim establish disclose analyse and elucidate it thus For such a reason this consciousness is nonself Doesnt eyeconsciousness arise in dependence on the eye and formsYes friendIf the cause and condition for the arising of eyeconsciousness would cease completely and totally without remainderNo friendIn this way friend this has been declared disclosed and revealed by the Blessed One thus For such a reason this conisciousness is nonselfDoesnt earconsciousness arise in dependence on the ear and sounds

anything belonging to a self in these six bases for contactSince he does not recognize anything thus he does not cling to anything in the worldNot clinging he is not agitatedBeing unagitated he

called the diversity of elementsListen to that and attend closely I will speakThe earth element the water element the heat element the air elementThose ascetics or brahmins bhikkhus who do not understand as they really are the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of these four elements these I do not consider to be ascetics among ascetics or brahmins among brahmins and these venerable ones do not by realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge in this very life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism or the goal of brahminhoodAt Savatthi Bhikkhusthere are these four elementsWhat fourBut bhikkhus those ascetics and brahmins who understand as they really are the gratificationthe danger and the escape in the case of these four elements these I consider to be ascetics among ascetics and brahmins among brahmins and these venerable ones by realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge in this very life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism and the goal of brahminhoodAt Savatthi Bhikkhus there are these four elementsWhat fourThe earth element the water element the heat element the air elementThose ascetics or brahmins bhikkhus who do not understand as they really are the origin and the passing away the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of these four elements these I do not consider to be ascetics among ascetics But bhkkhus those ascetics and brahmins who understand as they really are the origin and the passing away the gratification the danger and the escape  in the case of these four elements these I consider to be ascetics among ascetics and brahmins among brahmins and these venerable ones by realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge in this very life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism and the goal of brahminhoodAt Savatthi Bhikkhus those ascetics or brahmins who do not understand the earth element its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation who do not understand the water element  the heat element  the air element its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation these I do not consider to be ascetics among ascetics But bhikkhus those ascetics and brahmins who understand these things these I consider to be ascetics among ascetics and brahmins among brahmins and these venerable ones by realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge in this very life enter and dwell inthe goal of asceticism and the goal of brahminhoodThus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anaithapbdikas ParkThere the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus Venerable sir  those bhikkhus repliedThe Blessed One said this Bhikkhus I will teach you dependent origination Listen to that and attend closely I will speakYes venerable sir those bhikkhus repliedThe Blessed One said thisAnd what bhikkhus is dependent originationWith ignorance as condition volitional formations come to be with volitional formations as condition consciousness with consciousness as condition nameandform with nameandform as condition the six sense bases with the six sense bases as condition contact with contact as condition feeling with feeling as condition craving with craving as condition clinging with clinging as condition existence with existence as condition birth with birth as condition aginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair come to beSuch is the origin of this whole mass of sufferingThis bhikkhus is called dependent originationBut with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations with the cessation of volitional formations cessation of consciousness with the cessation of consciousness cessation of nameandform with the cessation of nameandform cessation of the six sense bases with the cessation of the six sense bases cessation of contact with the cessation of contact cessation of feeling with the cessation of feeling cessation of craving with the cessation of craving cessation of clinging with the cessation of clinging cessation of existence with the cessation of existence cessation of birth with the cessation of birth aginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair ceaseSuch is the cessation of this whole mass of sufferingThis is what the Blessed One saidElated those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed Ones statementAt Savatthi Bhikkhus I will teach you dependent origination and dependently arisen phenomenaListen and attend closely I will speakYes venerable sir those bhikkhus repliedThe Blessed One said thiswhether there is are arising of Tathagatas or no arising of Tathagatas that element still persists the stableness of the Dhamma the fixed course of the Dhamma specific conditionalityAnd he says See With birth as condition bhikkhus aginganddeathWith existence as condition birth  With clinging as condition existence  With craving as condition clinging  With feelingas condition craving  With contact as condition feeling With the six sense bases as condition contact  With nameandform as condition the six sense bases  With consciousness as condition nameandform  With volitional formations as condition consciousness  With ignorance as condition volitional formations whether there is an arising of Tathagatas or no arising of Tathagatas that element still persists the stableness of the Dhamma the fixed course of the Dhamma specific conditionaIityA Tathagata awakens to this and breaks through to itHaving done so he explains it teaches it proclaims it establishes it discloses it analyses it elucidates itAnd he says See With ignorance as condition bhikkhus volitional formationsThus bhikkhus the actuality in this the inerrancy the not otherwiseness specific conditionality this is called dependent originationAnd what bhikkhus are the dependently arisen phenomenaAginganddeath bhikkhus is impermanent conditioned dependently arisen subject to destruction vanishing fading away and cessationBirth is impermanent conditioned dependently arisen subject to destruction vanishing fading away and cessationClinging is impermanent  Craving is impermanent  Feeling is impermanent  Contactis impermanent  The six sense bases are impermanent  Nameandform is impermanent  Consciousness is impermanent  Volitional formations are impermanent  Ignorance is impermanent conditioned dependently arisen subject to destruction vanishing fading away and cessationWhen bhikkhus a noble disciple has clearly seen with correct wisdom as it really is this dependent origination and these dependently arisen phenomena it is impossible that he will back into the past thinking Did I exist in the past Did I not exist in the past What was I in the past How was I in the past Having been what what did I become in the past  Or that he will run forward into the future thinking Will I exist in the future Will I not exist in the future What will I be in the future How will I be in the future Having been what what will I become in the future  Or that he will now be inwardly confused about the present thus Do I exist Do I not exist What am I How am I This beingwhere has it come from and where will it go For what reason is this impossibleBecause bhikkhus the noble disciple has clearly seen with correct wisdom as it really is this dependent origination and these dependently arisen phenomenaAnd what bhikkhus is dependent originationWith birth as condition aginganddeath comes to beA Tathagata awakens to this and breaks through to itHaving done so he explains it teaches it proclaims it establishes it discloses it analyses it elucidates itExistence is impermanent conditioned dependently arisen subject to destruction vanishing fading away and cessationThese bhikkhus are called the dependently arisen phenomenaAt Savatthi Bhikkhus I will teach you fortyfour cases of knowledge Listen to that and attend closely I will speakYes venerable sir those bhikkhus repliedThe Blessed One said thisBhikkhus what are the fortyfour cases of knowledgeKnowledge of aginganddeath knowledge of its origin knowledge of its cessation knowledge of the way leading to its cessation Knowledge of birth  Knowledge of existence  Knowledge of clinging  Knowledge of craving  Knowledge of feeling  Knowledge of contact  Knowledge of the six sense bases  Knowledge of nameandform  Knowledge of consciousness  Knowledge of volitional formations knowledge of their origin knowledge of their cessation knowledge of the way leading to their cessationThese bhikkhus are the fortyfour cases of knowledgeAnd what bhikkhus is aginganddeathThus this aging and this death are together called aginganddeathWith the arising of birth there is the arising of aginganddeath With the cessation of birth there is the cessation of aginganddeath This Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of aginganddeath that is right view  right concentrationWhatever ascetics and brahmins in the future will directly know aginganddeath its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation all these will directly know it in the very same way that I do nowWhen bhikkhus a noble disciple has purified and cleansed these two kinds of knowledgeknowledge of the principle and knowledge of entailment And what bhikkhus is birth  What are the volitional formationsWhen bhikkhus a noble disciple thus understands volitional formations their origin their cessation and the way leading to their cessation this is his knowledge of the principleBy means of this principle that is seen understood immediately attained fathomed he applies the method to the past and to the future  This is his knowledge of entailmentWhen bhikkhus a noble disciple has purified and cleansed these two kinds of knowledge  knowledge of the principle and knowledge of entailment When bhkkhus a noble disciple thus understands aginganddeath its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation this is his knowledge of the principleBy means of this principle that is seen understood immediately attained fathomed he applies the method to the past and to the future thusWhatever ascetics and brahmins in the past directly knew aginganddeath its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation all these directly knew it in the very same way that I do nowThis is his knowledge of entailmenthe is then called a noble disciple who is accomplished in view accomplished in vision who has arrived at this true Dhamma who sees this true Dhamma who possesses a trainees knowledge a trainees true knowledge who has entered the stream of the Dhamma a noble one with penetrative wisdom one who stands squarely before the door to the DeathlessThis Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of volitional formations that is right view  right concentrationhe is then called a noble disciple who is accomplished in view  one who stands squarely before the door to the DeathlessAt SavatthiThen the Venerable Kaccanagotta approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one sideIn what way venerable sir is there right viewThis world Kaccana for the most part depends upon a dualityupon the notion of existence and the notion of nonexistenceIt is in this way Kaccana that there is right viewAll exists Kaccana this is one extremeAll does not exist this is the second extremeWithout veering towards either of these extremes the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma by the middle With ignorance as condition volitional formations come to be with volitional formations as condition consciousness  Such is the origin of this whole mass of sufferingBut with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations with the cessation of volitional formations cessation of consciousness Such is the cessation of this whole mass of sufferingand said to him Venerable sir it is said right view right viewBut for one who sees the origin of the world as it really is with correct wisdom there is no notion of nonexistence in regard to the worldHe has no perplexity or doubt that what arises is only suffering arising what ceases is only suffering ceasing His knowledge about this is independent of othersAnd for one who sees the cessation of the world as it really is with correct wisdom there is no notion of existence in regard to the worldThis world Kaccana is for the most part shackled by engage ment clinging and adherenceBut this one with right view does not become engaged and cling through that engagement and clinging mental standpoint adherence underlying tendency he does not take a stand about my selfAt SavatthiBhikkhus what one intends and what one plans and whatever one has a tendency towards this becomes a basis for the maintenance of consciousnessWhen there is a basis there is a support for the establishing of consciousnessWhen consciousness is established and has come to growth there is the production of future renewed existenceWhen there is the production of future renewed existence future birth aginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair come to beIf bhikkhus one does not intend and one does not plan but one still has a tendency towards something this becomes a basis for the maintenance of consciousnessBut bhikkhus when one does not intend and one does not plan and one does not have a tendency towards anything no basis exists for the maintenance of consciousnessWhen there is no basis there is no support for the establishing of consciousnessWhen consciousness is unestablished and does not come to growth there is no production of future renewed existenceWhen there is no production of future renewed existence future birth aginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair ceaseSuch is the cessation of this whole mass of sufferingSuch is thes origin of this whole mass of sufferingWhen there is a basis there is a support for the establishing of consciousnessSuch is the origin of this whole mass of sufferingAt Savatthi Bhikkhus I will teach you the origin and the passing away of the worldListen to that and attend closely I will speakYes venerable sir the bhikkhus repliedThe Blessed One said thisAnd what bhikkhus is the origin of the worldWith contact as condition feeling comes to be with feeling as condition craving with craving as condition clinging with clinging as condition existence with existence as condition birth with birth as condition aginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair come to beThis bhikkhus is the origin of the worldIn dependence on the ear and sounds  In dependenceon the nose and odours  In dependence on the tongue and tastes  In dependence on the body and tactile objects  In dependence on the mind and mental phenomena mindconsciousness arisesThe meeting of the three is contactWith contact as condition feeling comes to be with feeling as condition craving with craving as condition clinging  existence  birth with birth as conditionaginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair come to beThis bhikkhus is the origin of the worldAnd what bhikkhus is the passing away of the worldIn dependence on the eye and forms eyeconsciousness arisesThe meeting of the three is contactWith contactas condition feeling comes to be with feeling as condition cravingBut with the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving comes cessation of clinging with the cessation of clinging cessation of existence with the cessation of existence cessation of birth with the cessation of birth aginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair cease Such is the cessation of this whole mass of sufferingThis bhikkhus is the passing away of the worldIn dependence on the ear and sounds   In dependence on the mind and mental phenomena mindconsciousness arisesThe meeting of the three is contactWith contact as condition feeling comes to be with feeling

aginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair cease Such is the cessation of this whole mass of sufferingThis bhikkhus is the passing away of the worldIn dependence on the eye and forms eyeconsciousness arisesThe meeting of the three is contactOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Vajjians at KotiggamaThere the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus it is because of not understanding and not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that you and I have roamed and wandered through this long course of samsaraWhat fourIt is bhikkhus because of not understanding and not penetrating the noble truth of suffering that you and I have roamed and wandered through this long course of samsaraIt is because of not understanding and not penetrating the noble truth of the origin of suffering  the noble truth of the cessation of suffering  the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering that you and I have roamed and wandered through this long course of samsaraThat noble truth of suffering bhkkhus has been understood and penetrated That noble truth of the origin of suffering has been understood and penetrated That noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been understood and penetrated That noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering has been understood and penetrated Craving for existence has been cut off the conduit to existence has been destroyed now there is no more renewed existenceThis is what the Blessed One saidHaving said this the Fortunate One the Teacher further said thisBecause of not seeing as they are The Four Noble TruthsWe have wandered through the long course In the various kinds of birthsNow these truths have been seen The conduit to existence is severedCut off is the root of suffering Now there is no more renewed existenceBhikkhus these four things are actual unerring not other wiseThis is suffering this bhikkhus is actual unerring not otherwise  This is the origin of suffering this is actual unerring not otherwise  This is the cessation of suffering  this is actual unerring not otherwise  This is the way leading to the cesation of suffering  this is actual unerring not otherwise  These four things bhikkhus are actual unerring not otherwiseTherefore bhikkhu an exertion should be made to understand This is suffering  An exertion should be made to understand This is the way leading to the cessation of sufferingWhat four For one who knows what for one who sees what does the destruction of the taints come about The destruction of the taints comes about for one who knows and sees This is suffering for one who knows and sees This is the origin of suffering for one who knows and sees This is the cessation of suffering for one who knows and sees This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering It is for one who knows thus for one who sees thus that the destruction of the taints comes about Therefore bhikkhus an exertion should be made to understand This is suffering   An exertion should be made to understand This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering Bhikkhus I say that the destruction of the taints is for one who knows and sees not for one who does not know and does not seeAt SavatthiBhikkhus whatever Arahants Perfectly Enlightened Ones in the past fully awakened to things as they really are all fully awakened to the Four Noble Truths as they really areWhatever Arahants Perfectly Enlightened Ones in the future will fully awaken to things as they really are all will fully awaken to the Four Noble Truths as they really areWhatever Arahants Perfectly Enlightened Ones at present have fully awakened to things as they really are all have fully awakened to the Four Noble Truths as they really areWhat fourThe noble truth of suffering the noble truth of the origin of suffering the noble truth of the cessation of suffering the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of sufferingWhatever Arahants Perfectly Enlightened Ones fully awakened  will fully awaken  have fully awakened to things as they really are all have fully awakened to these Four Noble Truths as they really areTherefore bhikkhus an exertion should be made to understand This is suffering  An exertion should be made to understand This is the way leading to the cessation of sufferingOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambi in a simsapa groveThen the Blessed One took up a few simsaplf leaves in his hand and addressed the bhikkhus thus What do you think bhikkhus which is more numerous these few simsapa leaves that I have taken up in my hand or those in the simsapa grove overhead Venerable sir the simsapa leaves that the Blessed One has taken up in his hand are few but those in the simsapa grove overhead are numerousSotoo bhikkhus the things I have directly known but have not taught you are numerous while the things I have taught you are fewAnd why bhikkhus have I not taught those many thingsBecause they are unbeneficial irrelevant to the fundamentals of the holy life and do not lead to revulsion to dispassion to cessation to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana Therefore I have not taught themAnd what bhikkhus have I taughtI have taught This is suffering I have taught This is the origin of suffering I have taught This is the cessation of suffering I have taught This is the way leading to the cessation of sufferingAnd why bhikkhus have I taught thisBecause this is beneficial relevant to the fundamentals of the holy life and leads to revulsion to dispassion to cessation to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana Therefore I have taught thisTherefore bhikkhus an exertion should be made to understand This is suffering  An exertion should be made to understand This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering Bhikkhus if anyone should speak thus Without having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of suffering as it really is without having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of the origin of suffering as it really is without having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of the cessation of suffering as it really is without having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering as it really is I will completely make an end to suffering  this is impossibleJust as bhikkhus if someone should speak thus Having made a basket of acacia leaves or of pine needles or of myrobalan leavesI will bring water or a palm fruit this would be impossible so too if anyone should speak thus Without having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of sufferingas it really is  I will completely make an end to suffering this is impossibleBut bhikkhus if anyone should speak thus Having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of suffering as it really is having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of the origin of suffering as it really is having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of the cessation of suffering as it really is having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering as it really is I will completely make an end to suffering  this is possibleJust as bhikkhus if someone should speak thus Having a basket of lotus leaves or of kino leaves or of maluva leaves I will bring water or a palm fruit  this would be possible so too if anyone should speak thus Having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of sufferingas it really is  I will completely make an end to suffering  this is possibleTherefore bhikkhus an exertion should be made to understand This is sufferingAn exertionshould be made to understand This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha on Mount Vulture PeakThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Come bhikkhus let us go to Patibhana Peak for the days abidingYes venerable sir those bhikkhus repliedThen the Blessed One together with a number of bhikkhus went to Patibhana PeakA certain bhikkhu saw the steep precipice offPatibhiina Peak and said to the Blessed One That precipice is indeed steep venerable sir that precipice is extremely frightfulBut is there venerable sir any other precipice steeper and more frightful than that one There is bhikkhuBut what venerable sir is that precipice steeper and more frightful than that one Those ascetics and brahmnins bhikkhu who do not understand as it really is This is suffering who do not understand as it really is This is the origin of suffering who do not understand as it really is This is the cessationof suffering who do not understand as it really is This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering  they delight in volitional formations that lead to birth in volitional formations that lead to aging in volitional formations that lead to death in volitional formations that lead to sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despairDelighting in such volitional formationsthey generate volitional formations that lead to birth generate volitional formations that lead to aging generate volitional formations that lead to death generate volitional formations that lead to sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despairHaving generated such volitional formations they tumble down the precipice of birth tumble down the precipice of aging tumble down the precipice of death tumble down the precipice of sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despairBut bhikkhu those ascetics and brahmins who understand as it really is This is suffering  This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering  they do not delight in volitional formations that lead to birth nor in volitional formations that lead to aging nor in volitional formations that lead to death nor in volitional formations that lead to sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despairNot delighting in such volitional formations they do not generate volitional formations that lead to birth nor generate volitional formations that lead to aging nor generate volitional formations that lead to death nor generate volitional formations that lead to sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despairNot having generated such volitional formations they do not tumble down the precipice of birth nor tumble down the precipice of aging nor tumble down the precipice of death nor tumble down the precipice of sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despairThey are freed from birth aging and death freed from sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despairTherefore bhikkhus an exertion should be made to understand This is suffering  An exertion should be made to understand This is the way leading to the cessation of sufferingThey are not freed from birth aging and death not freed from sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despairnot freed from suffering I sayfreed from suffering I sayOn one occasion the Venerable Sariputta was dwelling in Magadha at NalakagamaThen the

destinationWhatever should be done bhikkhus by a compassionate teacher out of compassion for his disciples desiring their welfare that I have done for youThese are the feet of trees bhikkhus these are empty hutsMeditate bhikkhus do not be negligent lest you regret it laterThis is our instruction to youThus have I heard At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Parkand those monks were receptive and attentive concentrating their whole mind intent on listening to the DhammaThen on realizing its significance the Blessed One on that occasion uttered this inspired utteranceThere is monks that base where there is neither earth nor water nor heat nor air neither the base of the infinity of space nor the base of the infinity of consciousness nor the base of nothingness nor the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception neither this world nor another world neither sun nor moonHere monks I say there is no coming no going no standing still no passing away and no being reborn It is not established not moving without supportJust this is the end of sufferingNow on that occasion the Blessed One was instructing rousing inspiring and gladdening the monks with a Dhamma talk connected with NibbanaThus have I heard At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkNow on that occasion the Blessed One was instructing  the monks with a Dhamma talk connected with Nibbana and those monks were receptive intent on listening to the DhammaThen on realizing its significance the Blessed One on that occasion uttered this inspired utteranceThere is monks an unborn unbecome unmade unconditionedIf monks there were no unborn unbecome unmade unconditioned no escape would be discerned from what is born become made conditionedBut because there is an unborn unbecome unmade unconditioned therefore an escape is discerned from what is born become made conditionedThere are monks these two Nibbana elementsWhat are the twoThe Nibbana element with residue remaining and the Nibbana element without residue remainingAnd what monks is the Nibbana element with residue remainingHere a monk is an arahant one whose taints are destroyed who has lived the holy life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached his own goal utterly destroyed the fetters of existence one completely liberated through final knowledgeHowever his five sense faculties remain unimpaired by which he still experiences what is agreeable and disagreeable still feels pleasure and painIt is the destruction of lust hatred and delusion in him that is called the Nibbana element with residue remainingAnd what monks is the Nibbana element without residue remainingHere a monk is an arahant  one completely liberated through final knowledgeFor him here in this very life all that is felt not being delighted in will become cool right hereThat monks is called the Nibbana element without residue remainingThese monks are the two Nibbana elementsBhikkhus these eight persons are worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation an unsurpassed field of merit for the worldWhat eightThe streamenterer the one practicing for realization of the fruit of streamentry the oncereturner the one practicing for realization of the fruit of oncereturning the nonreturner the one practicing for realization of the fruit of nonreturning the arahant the one practicing for realization of the fruit of arahantshipThese eight persons bhikkhus are worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation an unsurpassed field of merit for the worldThe four practicing the way and the four established in the fruitthis is the upright Sahgha composed in wisdom and virtuous behaviorFor people intent on sacrifice for living beings seeking meritmaking merit that ripens in the acquisitions what is given to the Sahgha bears great fruitBhikkhus there are these five facultiesWhat fiveThe faculty of faith  the faculty of wisdomThese are the five faculties One who has completed and fulfilled these five facultiesis an arahant If they are weaker than that one is practising for the realization of the fruit of arahantship if still weaker one is a nonreturner if still weaker one is practising for the realization of the fruit of  nonreturnine if still weaker one is a oncereturner if still weaker one is practising for the realization of the fruit of oncereturning if still weaker one is a streamenterer if still weaker one is practising for the realization of the fruit of streamentryBut bhikkhus I say that one in whom these five faculties are completely and totally absent is an outsider one who stand the faction of worldlings Then the Venerable Sariputta approached the Blessed One paid homage to him and sat down to one sideThe Blessed One then said to him Sariputta this is said A factor for streamentry a factor for streamentryWhat now Sariputta is a factor for streamentry Good good SariputtaAssociation with superior persons Sariputta is a tactor for streamentry Hearing the true Dhamma is a factor for streamentry Careful attention is a factor for streamentry Practice in accordance with the Dhamma is a factor for streamentrySariputta this is said The stream the streamWhat now Sariputta is the stream This Noble Eightfold Path venerable sir is the stream that is right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effortright mindfulness right concentrationGood good SariputtaThis Noble Eightfold Path is the stream

superior persons venerable sir is a factor for streamentry Hearing the true Dhamma is a factor for streamentry Careful attention is a factor for streamentry Practice in accordance with the Dhamma is a factor for streamentryAt SavatthiThere the Blessed One said this Bhikkhus although a wheelturning monarch having exercised supreme sovereign rulership over the four continents with the breakup of the body after death is reborn in a good destination in a heavenly world in the company of the devas of the Tavatimsa realm and there in the Nandana Grove accompanied by a retinue of celestial nymphs he enjoys himself supplied and endowed with the five cords of celestial sensual pleasure still as he does not possess four things he is not freed from hell the animal realm and the domain of ghosts not freed from the plane of misery the bad destinations the nether worldAlthough bhikkhus a noble disciple maintains himself by lumps of almsfood and wears ragrobesstill as he possesses four things he is freed from hell the animal realm and the domain of ghosts freed from the plane of misery the bad destinationsthe nether worldWhat are the fourHere bhikkhus the noble disciple possesses confirmed confidence in the Buddha thus The Blessed One is an arahant perfectly enlightened accomplished in true knowledge and conduct fortunate knower of the world unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed

gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation the unsurpassed field of merit for the worldHe possesses these four thingsAnd bhikkhus between the obtaining of sovereignty over the four continents and the obtaining of the four things the obtaining of sovereignty over the four continents is not worth a sixteenth part of the obtaining of the four thingsHe possesses the virtues dear to the noble onesunbroken untorn unblemished unmottled freeing praised by the wise ungrasped leading to concentrationOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrel SanctuaryNow on that occasion the lay follower Dighavu was sick afflicted gravely illThen the lay follower Dighavu addressed his father the householder jotika thus Come householder approach the Blessed One pay homage to him in my name with your head at his feet and say Venerable sir the lay follower Dighavu is sick afflictedgravely illThen say It would be good venerable sir if the Blessed One would come to the residence of the lay follower Dighavu out of compassion Yes dear the householder Jotika replied and he approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one side and delivered his messageThe Blessed One consented by silenceThen the Blessed One dressed and taking bowl and robe went to the residence of the lay follower Dighavu He then sat down in the appointed seat and said to the lay follower DighavuI hope you are bearing up Dighavu I hope you are getting betterI hope your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing and that their subsiding not their increase is to be discernedVenerable sir I am not bearing up I am not getting betterStrong painful feelings are increasing in me not subsiding and their increase not their subsiding is to be discernedTherefore Dighavu you should train yourself thus I will be one who possesses confirmed confidence in the Buddha thus The Blessed One is  teacher of devas and humans the Enlightened One the Blessed OneI will be one who possesses confirmed confidence in the Dhamma in the Sangha I will be one who possesses the virtues dear to the noble ones unbroken  leading to concentrationIt is in such a way that You should train yourselfVenerable sir as to these four factors of streamentry that have been taught by the Blessed One these things exist in me and I live in conformity with those thingsFor venerable sir I possess confirmed confidence in the Buddha in the Dhamma  in the Sangha I possess the virtues dear to the noble ones unbroken  leading to concentrationTherefore Dighavu established upon these four factors streamentry you should develop further six things that partake of true knowledgeVenerable sir as to these six things that partake of true knowledge that have been taught by the Blessed One these things exist in me and I live in conformity with those thingsFor venerable sir I dwell contemplating impermanencein all formations perceiving suffering in what is impermanent perceiving nonself in what is suffering perceiving abandonment perceiving fading away perceiving cessationHowever venerable sir the thought occurs to me After I am gone may this householder Jotika not fall into distress Dont be concerned about this dear DighavuCome now dear Dighgvu pay close attention to what the Blessed One is saying to youThen the Blessed One having given this exhortation to the lay follower Dighavu rose from his seat and departedThennot long after the Blessed One had left the lay follower Dighavu diedThen a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one sideWhat is his destination what is his future bourn Bhikkhus the lay follower Dighavu was wise He practised in accordance with the Dhamma and did not trouble me on account of the DhammaBhikkhus with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters the lay follower Dighavu has become one of spontaneous birth due to attain Nibbana there without returning from that worldhe pays homage to the Blessed One with his head at the Blessed Ones feetHere Dighavu dwell contemplating impermanence in all formations perceiving suffering in what is impermanent perceiving nonself in what is sufferingperceiving abandonment perceiving fading away perceiving cessationIt is in such a way that you should train yourselfand said to the Blessed One Venerable sir that lay follower named Dighavu to whom the Blessed One gave a brief exhortation has diedBhikkhus those bhikkhus who are accomplished in virtue acomplished in concentration accomplishedin wisdom accomplished in liberation accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation even the sight of those bhikkhus is helpful I say even listening to them even approaching them even attending on them even recollecting them even going forth after them is helpful I sayFor what reasonBecause when one has heard the Dhamma from such bhikkhus one dwells withdrawn by way of two kinds of withdrawalwithdrawal of body and withdrawal of mindDwelling thus withdrawn one recollects that Dhamma and thinks it overDwelling thus mindfully he discriminates that Dhamma with wisdom examines it makes an investigation of itWhenever bhikkhus a bhikkhu dwelling thus mindfully discriminates that Dhamma with wisdom examines it makes an investigation of it on that occasion the enlightenment factor of discrimination of states is aroused by the bhikkhu on that occasion the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of discrimination of states on that occasion the enlightenment factor of discrimination of states comes to fulfilment by development in the bhikkhuWhile he discriminates that Dhamma with wisdom examines it makes an investigation of it his energy is aroused without slackeningWhenever bhikkhus a bhikkhus energy is aroused without slackening as he discriminates that Dhamma with wisdom examines it makes an investigation of it on that occasion the enlightenment factor of energy is aroused by the bhikkhu on that occasion the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of energy on that occasion the enlightenment factor of energy comes to fulfilment by development in the bhikkhuWhen his energy is aroused there arises in him spiritual raptureWhenever bhikkhus spiritual rapture arises in a bhikkhu whose energy is aroused on that occasion the enlightenment factor of rapture is aroused by the bhikkhu on that occasion the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of rapture on that occasion the enlightenment factor of rapture comes to fullfiment by development in the bhikkhuFor one whose mind is uplifted by rapture the body becomes tranquil and the mind becomes tranquilWhenever bhikkhus the body becomes tranquil and the mind becomes tranquil in bhikkhu whose mind is uplifted by rapture on that occasion the enlightenment factor of tranquillity is aroused by the bhikkhu on that occasion the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of tranquillity on that occasion the enlightenment factor of tranquillity comes to fulfilment by development in the bhikkhuFor one whose body is tranquil and who is happy the mind becomes concentratedWhenever bhikkhus a bhikkhu closely looks on with equanimity at the mind thus concentrated on that occasion the enlightenment factor of equanimity is aroused by the bhikkhu on that occasion the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of equanimity on that occasion the enlightenment factor of equanimity comes to fulfilment by development in the bhikkhuBhikkhus when these seven factors of enlightenment have been developed and cultivated in this way seven fruits and benefits may be expectedWhat are the seven fruits and benefitsOne attains final knowledge early in this very lifeIf one does not attain final knowledge early in this very life or at the time of death then with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters one becomes an attainer of Nibbana in the intervalIf one does not attain final knowledge early in this very life or become an attainer of Nibbana in the interval then with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters one becomes an attainer of Nibbana upon landingIf one does not attain final knowledge early in this very life or become an attainer of Nibbana upon landing then with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters one becomes an I attainer of Nibbana without exertionIf one does not attain final knowledge early in this very life or become an attainer of Nibbana without exertion then with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters one becomes an attainer of Nibbana with exertionIf one does not attain final knowledge early in this very life or become an attainer of Nibbana with exertion then with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters one becomes one bound upstream heading towards the Akanittha realmWhen bhikkhus the seven factors of enlightenment have been developed and cultivated in this way these seven fruits and benefits may be expectedWhenever bhikkhus a bhikkhu dwelling thus withdrawn recollects that Dhamma and thinks it over on that occasion the enlightenment factor of mindfulness is aroused by the bhikkhu on that occasion the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness on that occasion the enlightenment factor of mindfulness comes to fulfilment by development in the bhikkhuWhenever bhikkhus the mind becomes concentrated in a bhikkhu whose body is tranquil and who is happy on that occasion the enlightenment factor of concentration is aroused by the bhikkhu on that occasion the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of concentration on that occasion the enlightenment factor of concentration comes to fulfilment by development in the bhikkhuHe closely looks on with equanimity at the mind thus concentratedIf one does not attain final knowledge early in this very life then one attains final knowledge at the time of deathWhen it is said the Exalted One was dwelling at Rājagaha in Jīvaka Komārabhaccas Mango Grove the meaning should be understood thus he was living in Jīvaka Komārabhaccas Mango Grove which was near RājagahaHe was brought to the palace and nurtured by the royal nursemaidsWhen they saw that the baby was still living they gave him the name JīvakaThus as he was raised by the prince they gave him the name KomārabhaccaThe story of Jīvaka is related at length in the Khandhakasand explained in the Samantapāsādikā the commentary to the VinayaOnce when the Exalted Ones body was afflicted by a disorder of the humors Jīvaka treated him with a purgative He then gave the Buddha a pair of Siveyyaka cloths   and at the conclusion of the thanksgiving talk for the cloths he was established in the fruit of streamentry Thereupon he thought I should go to wait upon the Buddha two or three times a day but the Bamboo Grove is too far away My park the Mango Grove is closer Let me build a dwelling there for the Exalted OneHe set up night quarters dayquarters caves huts pavilions etc built a Fragrant Cottage suitable for the Exalted One and erected a coppercolored wall eighteen yards high surrounding the Mango Grove He treated the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha to an offering of a meal and robes and after pouring the giftwater presented the dwellingKing Ajātasattu of Magadha The astrologers predicted Even while he is as yet unborn  he will be the kings enemy  thus Ajātasattu unborn enemyThe king asked her Dear your body has become pallid What is the reason Do not ask great kingDear if you dont express your thoughts to me to whom will you express them Urging her in various ways he convinced her to speakHaving heard he said Dear why do you regard this as terrible  He then sent for his physician had him make an incision in his arm with a golden knife collected the blood in a golden vessel mixed it with water and made her drink itThe astrologers hearing this declared This child in her womb will be the kings enemyHe will kill the kingShe went again and again and did the same thingThe king inquired Why do you go to the park so often  Having learned the reason he said Dear we do not even know whether you have a son or a daughter in your womb If we do this to a child begotten by ourselves a great calamity will appear in our land of IndiaDo not do so Having thus dissuaded her he set a guard over herWhen the child took birth she thought I will kill himSome time later after the prince had attained to growth they showed him to the queenWhen she saw him maternal affection arose within her and she could not have him killedEventually the king appointed his son viceroyOne time Devadatta while in seclusion thought to himself Sāriputta has an assembly of followers Mahāmoggallāna has an assembly of followers Mahākassapa has an assembly of followers Thus each of these maintains his own followingI too will gather a followingHe considered It wont be possible to acquire an assembly without gainSo let me obtain gain Then as related in the Khandhakas by means of the miracle of supernormal power he won the confidence of Prince Ajātasattu The prince came to wait upon him morning and evening with five hundred chariots Aware of his great trust one day Devadatta approached the prince and said In the past O prince men lived long now they are shortlivedTherefore prince you should kill your father and become the king I will kill the Exalted One and become the Buddha Thus he enjoined the prince to kill his fatherThe prince thought Master Devadatta has great spiritual powerThere is nothing he does not know He fastened a dagger to his thigh and entered the inner palace in the middle of the day but being fearful apprehensive alarmed and anxious he muddled up the instructions he was given by Devadatta and the ministers arrested him and examined himThey disputed whether the prince should be killed along with Devadatta and all the bhikkhus in Devadattas assembly Deciding to do whatever the king commanded they reported the matter to the kingThe king demoted those ministers who wanted to kill the prince and Devadatta and promoted those ministers who did not want to kill them He asked the prince Prince why do you want to kill meI want your kingdom your majestyWhen the prince reported to Devadatta that his wish had been grantedThen what should I do venerable sir Cut off the root Kill himBut isnt it true venerable sir that my father should not be killed by a weaponHe said Do not let anyone see him except my motherThe queen put rice in a golden vessel and entered bringing the vessel on her hipAgain the prince asked how he lived and having learned how he ordered Do not let her enter wearing shoesAgain the prince asked and having heard the report he ordered From now on prevent my mother from enteringFrom then on the king did not receive any foodHis body became extremely radiantThe prince asked Father how do you continue to live Learning that he continued to live by walking back and forth and seeing that this body had become extremely radiant the prince thought Now I will prevent him from walking back and forth He ordered his barbers Cut open my fathers feet with a razor smear them with salt and oil and roast them over flameless coals of acacia woodHe asked Why have you come here They reported their instructionsHe said You should do what your king commands They asked him to sit down bowed to him and said Your majesty we are doing what the king has ordered us to do Do not be angry at usThis isnt proper for a righteous king such as yourself Then with the left hand they grabbed his ankles with the right they took a razor cut open his feet smeared them with salt and oil and roasted them over flameless coals of acacia wood the king experienced severe painWhile recollecting the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha he withered up like a garland of flowers thrown upon the terrace of a cetiya and was reborn in the heavenly world of the Four Great Kings as a spirit named Janavasabha in the retinue of VessavaṇaThat same day a son was born to Ajātasattu Two letters reached him simultaneously one telling him of the birth of his son the other of his fathers deathThe ministers thinking First we will report to him the birth of his son handed him that letterThe moment love for his newborn son arose in the king shook his entire body and penetrated through to the marrow of his bonesAt that moment he understood what it means to be a fatherRealizing When I was born my own father felt such love for meThey said How can we release him your majesty and handed him the other letterAs soon as he learned the news he went weeping to his mother and asked her Mother did my father feel love for me when I was born She said Foolish son what are you saying When you were a child you had a small boil on your fingerYou kept on weeping and they couldnt quiet you down so they took you to your father who was sitting in the judgement hallYour father put your finger in his mouthHe couldnt spit out the pus and blood so out of love for you he swallowed themDevadatta then approached Ajātasattu and told the king to order some men to assassinate the Buddha He sent the men given to him  Then Devadatta ascended Vultures Peak himself and with a sling hurled a rock at the Buddha  He even had the elephant Nālāgiri let loose  but no matter what method he used he could not kill the Exalted One When his gains and honor had been lost he asked the Buddha to accept his five proposals  The Buddha did not agree and Devadatta thought to use those points to win over the people He created a schism in the Sangha but Sāriputta and Moggallāna went to his residence won back his followers for the Buddha and returned leading them away When he learned this he vomited hot blood For nine months Devadatta lay on the sickbed after which he was filled with remorse He asked Where is the Teacher now staying When they told him that the Buddha was staying at the Jetavana monastery he said Then take me by my bed and let me see the Teacher But because he had performed kamma which disqualified him from seeing the Exalted One while he was being carried right beside the lotus pond in the Jetavana monastery the earth split open and he fell in and landed in the Great HellThis is a brief accountKing Ajāsattu was sitting on the upper terrace of his palace Why was the king sitting thereFor from the day he killed his father whenever he went to bed as soon as he closed his eyes he felt as if he had been struck by a hundred spears and woke up cryingThus sleep became repugnant to him and he was sitting there in order to ward off sleepWhat recluse or brahmin should we visit tonight By this entire statement the king gives a hintTo whom does he give itTo JīvakaFor what purposeIn order to see the Exalted OneBut couldnt he go to the Exalted One on his ownNo he could notWhyBecause of his great crimesFor his own father whom he had killed was a noble disciple and a supporter of the Exalted One and he himself had supported Devadatta who had done much harm to the Exalted One Thus he had committed great crimes and because of these he could not go to the Exalted One on his ownBut Jīvaka was a supporter of the Exalted One so he gave him a hint thinking I will see the Exalted One like his shadowYes he understoodThen why did he remain silentIn order to avoid being interruptedFor he thought In this assembly there are present many who are supporters of the six teachers Since the teachers on whom they attend are untrained they themselves are not properly trainedIf I should begin to speak about the virtues of the Exalted One they would rise up interrupt me and speak about the virtues of their own teachers Thus I would not be able to complete my talk on the virtues of the TeacherBut as the king has already approached the teachers whom they support he will not be satisfied with their account of virtues knowing such talk to be substanceless Then he will question meWithout being interrupted I will explain the virtues of the Teacher and take the king along with me to meet him Thus though he understood  he remained silent in order to avoid being interruptedThe ministers thought Today the king extols the night in five ways Surely he wishes to approach some recluse or brahmin question him and hear his Dhamma He will show great honor to the whose Dhamma inspires his confidenceAnd it will be fortunate for the one whose recluse wins the support of the royal familyHaving such aims in mind each of the ministers thought I will praise the recluse I support and go taking the king along with me Thus each one began to praise the recluse he personally supportedPūraṇa Kassapa Pūraṇa was the name of this teacherKassapa his clanHe was given the name Pūraṇa  it is said because he was born into a family consisting of ninety nine slaves thus fulfilling the auspicious number He thought to himself Why should I stay here and he fledThieves stole his clothes Not knowing how to cover himself with leaves or grass he entered a village nakedPeople saw him and thought This recluse is an arahat with few wishesThere is no one like him They approached him bringing cakes rice etcthus it is said Pūraṇa Kassapa the leader of an order etcThough dissatisfied he remained silent and tolerated that talk as displeasing as it was to him for he realized If I scold that minister and order him to be grabbed by his neck and expelled the others will become afraid that the same fate will befall them and no one will say anythingMakkhali Gosāla Makkhali was his namehis second name Gosāla derives from the fact that he was born in the village of GosālaOthers however say that he was born in a cowshedHis master pursued him and grabbed the edge of his cloakHe discarded the cloak and fled without clothesThe rest is the same as in the story of PūraṇaAjita Kesakambala Ajita was his nameand he wore a hair blanket A hairblanket is a blanket made out of human hairAs the Buddha says Bhikkhus whatever woven articles of clothing there are the hairblanket is considered the most repulsive of thesePakudha Kaccāyana Pakudha was his nameKaccāyana his clanHe refused to use cool water Even after moving his bowels he did not wash with cool water but only with warm water or oilIf he passed through a river or a puddle of water on the path he thought My moral discipline has been broken He then reestablished his moral discipline by building a mound of sand and continued on his wayHe held the theory of bad luck Sañjaya Belatthaputta His name was Sañjayahe was the son of Belattha thus BelatthaputtaNigaṇtha NātaputtaHe is called Nigaṇtha because he proclaimed the doctrine We have no knots of defilements no ties of defilements we are free from the bonds of defilementsThe name Jīvaka Komāra bhacca means a living person who has been raised by a princeFor as a baby he was found abandoned surrounded by crowsIt is said that when he was still in his mothers womb the queen developed the compulsive urge to drink blood from the kings right armShe considered This compulsive urge that has arisen is terrible I should not report it to anyone Being unable to express it she became thin and paleThe queen heard this and thought They say that when the child comes out from my belly he will kill the king Wishing to have an abortion she went to the park and had her belly trampled upon but abortion did not take placebut guards took the child away from herThe king gave him his kingdomDevadatta said Like a man who beats the kettledrums after caging a jackal you imagine you have finished your workWithin a few days your father considering the contempt you have shown him will himself become king Then kill him by cutting off his foodThe prince had his father thrown into the torture chamber a smokehouse built for the purpose of inflicting punishmentThe king ate the rice and continued to liveThe prince asked him My father how do you continue to live Having learned how he ordered Do not let my mother enter bringing anything on her hipFrom then on the queen entered putting the vessel in her topknotHaving learned about this he ordered Do not let her enter with her hair bound in a topknotThen she put rice inside a pair of golden shoes sealed the shoes put them on and enteredIn this way the king continued to liveFrom then on the queen bathed with scented water anointed her body with the four sweets curd honey ghee and molasses dressed and enteredThe king continued to live by licking her bodyThe queen stood behind the door and cried out O my husband Bimbisāra You did not let me kill him in his infancy You yourself nurtured your own enemy This is the last time I will see you From now on I will never see you again If I have done anything wrong please forgive me my lord  Weeping and wailing she departedbut continued to live by walking back and forth in the happiness of the path and fruit When the king saw the barbers he thought Someone must have informed my son they have come to trim my beardThey went to him bowed down before him and stood uphe said Go men release my fatherand the boil broke open right in his mouthSuch was your fathers love for youWeeping and lamenting he disposed of his fathers bodya detailed account is related in the Khandhakas Thus the king was named Ajātasattu because the astrologers predicted Even while he is as yet unborn he will be the kings enemyIn order to ward off sleepWhen asked what the trouble was he answered NothingThe king uttered the following joyful exclamation As oil which cannot be contained in its barrel spills over and is called an oil slick as water which cannot be contained in a tank inundates the land and is called a flood so when the heart cannot contain a joyous statement the statement becomes excessively strong and unable to remain within it comes out as speech That is called a joyful exclamation Did Jīvaka understand that the king was giving him a hintBecause he was an auspicious slave no one ever told him This is well done or This is badly done This should be done or This has not been doneFrom then on even when he gained a cloak he did not wear it aware It is because I go about without clothes that I received this cloak He took his nakedness as his going forth  Various groups of fivehundred men went forth under himKing Ajātasattu remained silent As a man wishing to eat a sweet golden colored mango would become dissatisfied if a bitter kājara fruit were brought and placed in his hand so the king wishing to hear sweet Dhamma talk concerning such virtues as the jhānas and modes of direct knowledge and stamped with the three characteristics now became extremely dissatisfied with this talk about the virtues of Pūraṇa as he had previously seen this teacher and was dissatisfied with him even then Thus he remained silentBut since he remained silent another minister thinking I will praise the recluse I myself support started to speakIt is said that he was carrying a pot of oil across muddy ground when his master called out Do not stumble  dearDue to carelessness he stumbled and fell Afraid of his master he started to fleethere is no article of clothing more repulsive than thatA hairblanket is cold in cold weather hot in hot weather ugly foulsmelling and uncomfortable to the touch He was the son of Nāta thus NātaputtaOn one occasion a number of elder bhikkhus were dwelling at Kosambi in Ghositas ParkNow on that occasion the Venerable Khemaka was living at Jujube Tree Park sick afflicted gravely illThen in the evening those elder bhikkhus emerged from seclusion and addressed the Venerable Dasaka thus Come friend Dasaka approach the bhikkhu Khemaka and say to him The elders say to you friend Khemaka We hope that you are bearing up friend we hope that you are getting better We hope that your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing and that their subsiding not their increase is to be discernedYes friends the Venerable Dasaka replied and he approached the Venerable Khemaka and delivered his messageThe Venerable Khemaka answered I am not bearing up friend I am not getting better Strong painful feelings are increasing in me not subsiding and their increase not their subsiding is to be discernedThen the Venerable Dasaka approached the elder bhikkhus and reported what the Venerable Khemaka had saidThey told him Come friend Dasaka approach the bhikkhu Khemaka and say to himThe elders say to you friend Khemaka These five aggregates subject to clinging friend have been spoken of by the Blessed One that is the form aggregate subject to clinging the feeling aggregate subject to clinging the perception aggregate subject to clinging the volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging the consciousness aggregate subject to clingingDoes the Venerable Khemaka regard anything as self or as belonging to self among these five aggregates subject to clinging Yes friends the Venerable Dasaka replied and he approached the Venerable Khemaka and delivered his messageThe Venerable Khemaka replied These five aggregates subject to clinging have been spoken of by the Blessed One that is the form aggregate subject to clinging  the consciousness aggregate subject to clingingAmong these five aggregates subject to clinging I do not regard anything as self or as belonging to selfThen the Venerable Dasaka approached the elder bhikkhus and reported what the Venerable Khemaka had saidThey replied Come friend Dasaka approach the bhikkhu Khemaka and say to him The elders say to you friend Khemaka These five aggregates subject to clinging friend have been spoken of by the Blessed One that is the form aggregate subject to clinging  the consciousness aggregate subject to clingingIf the Venerable Khemaka does not regard anything among these five aggregates subject to clinging as self or as belonging to selfthen he is an arahant one whose taints are destroyedYes friends the Venerable Dasaka replied and he approached the Venerable Khemaka and delivered his messageThe Venerable Khemaka replied These five aggregates subject to clinging have been spoken of by the Blessed One that is the form aggregate subject to clinging  the consciousness aggregate subject to clingingI do not regard anything among these five aggregates subject to clinging as self or as belonging to self yet I am not an arahant one whose taints are destroyed Friends the notion I am has not yet vanished in me in relation to these five aggregates subject to clinging but I do not regard anything among them as This I amThen the Venerable Dasaka approached the elder bhikkhus and reported what the Venerable Khemaka had saidThey replied Come friend Dasaka approach the bhikkhu Khemaka and say to him The elders say to you friend Khemaka Friend Khemaka when you speak of this I amwhat is it that you speak of as I amYes friends the Venerable Dasaka replied and he approached the Venerable Khemaka and delivered his messageEnough friend Dasaka Why keep running back and forthThen the Venerable Khemaka leaning on his staffapproached the elder bhikkhus exchanged greetings with them and sat down to one sideThe elder bhikkhus then said to himFriends I do not speak of form as I am nor do I speak of I am apart from formI do not speak of feeling as I am  nor of perception as I am  nor of volitional formations as I am  nor of consciousness as I am nor do I speak of I am apart from consciousnessFriends although the notion I am has not yet vanished in me in relation to these five aggregates subject to clinging still I do not regard anything among them as Thus I amSuppose friends there is the scent of a blue red or white lotusWould one be speaking rightly if one would say The scent belongs to the petals or The scent belongs to the stalk nor The scent belongs to the pistils No friendAnd how friends should one answer if one is to answer rightly Answering rightly friend one should answer The scent belongs to the flower So too friends I do not speak of form as I am nor do I speak of I am apart from formI do not speak of feeling as I am  nor of perception as I am  nor of volitional formations as I am  nor of consciousness as I am nor do I speak of I am apart from consciousnessFriends although the notion I am has not yet vanished in me in relation to these five aggregates subject to clinging still I do not regardanything among them as This I amFriends even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters still in relation to the five aggregates subject to clinging there lingers in him a residual conceit I am a desire I am an underlying tendency I am that has not yet been uprootedSometime later he dwells contemplating rise and fall in the five aggregates subject to clinging Such is form such its origin such its passing away such is feeling  such is perception  such are volitional formations  such is consciousness such its origin such its passing awayAs he dwells thus contemplating rise and fall in the five aggregates subject to clinging the residual conceit I am the desire I am the underlying tendency I am that had not yet been uprootedthis comes to be uprootedSuppose friends a cloth has become soiled and stainedand its owners give it to a laundrymanThe laundryman would scour it evenly with cleaning salt lye or cowdung and rinse it in clean waterEven though that cloth would become pure and clean it would still retain a residual smell of cleaning salt lye or cowdung that had not yet vanishedSo too friends even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters still in relation to the five aggregates subject to clinging there lingers in him a residual conceit I am a desire I am an underlying tendency I am that has not yet been uprootedWhen this was said the elder bhikkhus said to the Venerable Khemaka We did not ask our questions in order to trouble the Venerable Khemaka but we thought that the Venerable Khemaka would be capable of explaining teaching proclaiming establishing disclosing analysing and elucidating the Blessed Ones teaching in detailAnd the Venerable Khemaka has explained taught proclaimed established disclosed analysed and elucidated the Blessed Ones teaching in detailThis is what the Venerable Khemaka saidElated the elder bhikkhus delighted in the Venerable Khemakas statementBring me my staff friend Ill go to the elder bhikkhus myselfFriend Khemakawhen you speak of this I am The owners would put it in a sweetscented basketThe laundryman would then give it back to the ownersand the residual smell of cleaning salt lye or cowdung that had not yet vanished would vanishAs he dwells thus contemplating rise and fall in the five aggregates subject to clinging the residual conceit I am the desire I am the underlying tendency I am that had not yet been uprootedthis comes to be uprootedAnd while this discourse was being spoken the minds of sixty elder bhikkhus and of the Venerable Khemaka were liberated from the taints by nonclingingThus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambi in Ghositas ParkThere the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus is there a method by means of which a bhikkhu who is a trainee standing on the plane of a trainee might understand I am a trainee while a bhikkhu who is one beyond training standing on the plane of one beyond training might understand I am one beyond training Venerable sir our teachings are rooted in the Blessed OneThere is a method bhikkhus by means of which a bhikkhu who is a trainee  might understand I am a trainee while a bhikkhu who is one beyond training  might understand I am one beyond trainingAnd what bhikkhus is the method by means of which a bhikkhu who is a trainee standing on the plane of a trainee understands I am a trainee Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu who is a trainee understands as it really is This is suffering he understands as it really is This is the origin of suffering he understands as it really is This is the cessation of suffering he understands as it really is This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering This is a method means of which a bhikkhu who is a traineestanding on the plane of a trainee understands I am a traineeAgain bhikkhus a bhikkhu who is a trainee considers thus Is there outside here another ascetic or brahmin who teaches a Dhamma so real true actual as the Blessed One does He understands thus There is no other ascetic or brahmin outside here who teaches a Dhamma so real true actual as the Blessed One doesThis too is a method by means of which a bhikkhu who is a trainee standing on the plane of a trainee understandsI am a traineeAgain bhikkhus a bhikkhu who is a trainee understands the five spiritual facultiesthe faculty of faith the faculty of energythe facultyof mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of wisdomAnd what bhikkhus is the method by means of which a bhikkhu who is one beyond training standing on the plane of one beyond training understands I am one beyond trainingHere bhikkhus a bhikkhu who is one beyond training understands the five spiritual facultiesthe faculty of faith  the faculty of wisdomHe dwells having contacted with the body their destination their culmination their fruit their final goal and having pierced it through with wisdom he seesThis is a method by means of which a bhikkhu who is one beyond training standing on the plane of one beyond training understands I am one beyond trainingAgain bhikkhus a bhikkhu who is one beyond training understands the six facultiesthe eye faculty the ear faculty the nose faculty the tongue faculty the body faculty the mind facultyHe understands These six faculties will cease completely and totally without remainder and no other six faculties will arise anywhere in any wayThis too is a method by means of which a bhikkhu who is one beyond training standing on the plane of one beyond training understands I am one beyond training He does not yet dwell having contacted with the body their destination their culmination their fruit their final goal but having pierced it through with wisdom he seesThis too is a method by means of which a bhikkhu who is a trainee standing on the plane of a trainee understands I am a traineeAfter hearing their statements the king thought to himself I do not wish to hear the statements of those who are speakingI wish to hear the statement of that one who is keeping silent like a Supanna bird in the Naga land This isnt helpful to meThen it occurred to him Jvaka is a supporter of the Exalted Buddha the peaceful one He himself is peaceful Therefore like a bhikkhu endowed with vows he sits silently He will not speak unless I speakThe foot of the elephant must be grabbed while the elephant is trampling  Thus he himself took the initiative in consulting himand asked Friend Jivaka why do you keep silentWhile each of these ministers praises the recluse he supports you do not even open your mouthDont you support some recluse as they do Are you poor Didnt my father give you royalties Or do you lack faith in anyone Then Jvaka thought The king wants me to speak about the virtues of the recluse I support This is not the time for me to remain silentI should not speak about the virtues of the Teacher in the way these ministers speak about the virtues of their reclusesby first bowing to the king and then sitting down So he rose up from his seat bowed down to the ground in the direction where the Exalted One was dwelling lifted his hands to his head in reverential salutation and said Great king do not think that I approach any recluse indiscriminately For when my Teacher took conception in the mothers womb when he emerged from the womb when he made his great renunciation when he achieved Enlightenment and when he set in motion the Wheel of the Dhamma the tenthousandfold worldsystem shook So too when he performed the Twin Miracle and when he descended from the heavenly worlds  I will speak about the virtues of the Teacher Listen with a one pointed mind great king  Having said this he then began to speak Your majesty he is the Exalted One a worthy one perfectly enlightened etc When Jvaka had finished explaining the meaning of each term he said Thus great king my Teacher is a worthy one he is perfectly enlightened  he is exaltedSpeaking thus he in effect says Great king even when questioned by a hundred persons like yourself or by a thousand such or by a hundred thousand such the Teacher has the power and ability to grasp their intentions and to answer them You should approach him confidently great king and ask your question When the king heard this talk about the virtues of the Exalted One his entire body was immediately suffused with the five grades of raptureAmong the many different kinds of vehicles elephant vehicles are the best and since one is going to see the best person one should go in the best kind of vehicle Moreover horse vehicles and chariots etc are noisy and their sounds can be heard from the distance but elephant vehicles proceed step by step and thus one does not hear any soundThinking that one should approach the peaceful quiescent Exalted One in peaceful quiet vehicles the king ordered the elephant vehicles to be preparedsimply through his prudenceFor he thought The king says he is going at this time and kings have many enemiesIf some obstacle should arise along the way people will blame me for taking the king out at an improper timeAnd they will blame the Exalted One for giving Dhamma talk without regard for the timeFurther when supported by women men do not become afraid Thus so that the king would go along happily surrounded by his women Jvaka arranged for five hundred female elephants to be prepared He had five hundred of the kings women mounted on these disguised as men carrying swords and spears in their hands surrounding the king He further thought This king does not have the supporting conditions for gaining the paths and fruits in this present existence The Buddhas explain the Dhamma when they have seen the supporting conditions So let me assemble a great multitude of people For then the Teacher having seen someone with the supporting conditions will teach the Dhamma and that will be beneficial to the multitudeHe was suddenly gripped by fear etc Herein there are four kinds of fear fear as mental anxiety  fear as knowledge  fear as a fearful object  and fear as moral dread  Among these fear as mental anxiety is referred to in the passage In dependence on birth there arises fear fright etcFear as knowledge has come down in the passage Those  having heard the Tathgatas teaching of the Dhamma generally fall into fear a sense of urgency and terror Fear as a fearful object is referred to in the passage Is this the fear and dread that is coming  In this they praise fear not valorAmong these here fear as mental anxiety is intendedBy why did the king become afraidBecause of the quietness he suspected Jvaka and thus he became afraidJvaka it is said had already informed the king in the upper terrace of the palace Great king the Exalted One is fond of quietnessHe should be approached quietlythe instruments were merely taken along Also they did not speak aloud but went along giving signals with a snap of the fingersIn the Mango Grove not even the sound of sneezing was heardBecause of the quietness he became uneasy and the following suspicion arose in him regarding Jvakayet not even the sound of sneezing is heard here He must be lying Wishing to usurp the kingship for himself he has deceived me led me out of the city set up an army in front and is going to arrest meFor he has the strength of five elephantsO what harm has befallen me Having become so much afraid he could not conduct himself fearlesslyJvaka thought This king does not know me he does not know that Jvaka does not take anothers lifeIf I do not reassure him he will perish Thus reassuring the king he said Do not be afraid great king etcHe points out the lights burning in the pavilion hall to show A group of thieves does not stay where lamps are burningYou should go where you see those lamps great kingYour majesty should visit the Exalted OnePerhaps if you visit him he might bring peace to your mindAt that very moment he became desirous to go to the Exalted OneThinking If I am to go to the Buddha at this time there is no one apart from Jvaka who can get the vehicles prepared quickly enough he said Then get the elephant vehicles prepared friend JvakaThus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dw elling at Rajagaha on Mount Vulture PeakJvaka undertook the preparations in the way described without being told to do soTherefore I should arrange protection for the king so that no one will blame either myself or the Exalted OneSo he sent out announcements here and there and had it proclaimed Today the king will go to see the Exalted One Let everyone protect the king according to his meansThen the wanderer Sutava approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himWhen they had concluded their greetings and cordial talkAt that time in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this Sutava a bhikkhu who is an arahant  one whose taints are destroyed who has lived the spiritual life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached his own goal utterly destroyed the fetters of existence one completely liberated through final knowledge  is incapable of transgression in five cases He is incapable of intentionally depriving a living being of life he is incapable of taking by way of theft what is not given he is incapable of engaging in sexual intercourse he is incapable of deliberately speaking falsehood he is incapable of storing things up in order to enjoy sensual pleasures as he did in the past when a laymanBhante did I hear that correctly from the Blessed One grasp it correctly attend to it correctly remember it correctly Yes Sutava you heard that correctly grasped it correctly attended to it correctly remembered it correctlyIn the past Sutava and also now I say thus A bhikkhu who is an arahant one whose taints are destroyed  one completely liberated through final knowledge  is incapable of transgression in nine cases He is incapable of intentionally depriving a living being of life he is incapable of taking by way of theft what is not given he is incapable of engaging in sexual intercourse he is incapable of deliberately speaking falsehood he is incapable of storing things up in order to enjoy sensual pleasures as he did in the past when a layman he is incapable of rejecting the Buddha he is incapable of rejecting the Dhamma he is incapable of rejecting the Sahgha he is incapable of rejecting the trainingIn the past Sutava and also now I say thus A bhikkhu who is an arahant  one whose taints are destroyed  one completely liberated through final knowledge  is incapable of transgression in these nine casesBut there were so many torcheshundreds and thousands beyond limithe sat down to One side and said to the Blessed OneBhante on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling right here in Rajagaha the Mountain FortJvaka himself having arranged the kings retinue went along close to the king thinking If any danger arises I will be the first to give my own life for the sake of the kingFear as moral dread is indicated in the passage for from fear the good do no evil Therefore the king prohibited the playing of musical instrumentsand kings generally delight in soundThis Jvaka told me there are  bhikkhus in the Mango Groveand he is going along close beside me and there is not even a single armed man near mebut revealed his own fearfulness to JvakaHe says Go forward twice hurrying along because if he had said this once it would not be firmThus have I heard On one occasion the Venerable Sariputta and the Venerable Candikaputta were dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrel sanctuaryAs soon as the king dismounted from the elephant and set foot on the ground the splendor of the Exalted One suffused his bodyImmediately his entire body broke out into a sweat and his clothes oppressed him so that he felt as if they should be removedHe remembered his own crime and great fear arose in himHe could not go directly to the Exalted One but took Jvaka by the hand and walked around as if touring the monastery grounds saying You have built this well Jvaka you have built this well Thus praising the monastery he gradually approached the door of the pavilion hall Some say because he did not knowThey say that in his youth he had seen the Exalted One when he came to him along with his father but afterwards as a result of associating with evil friends he killed his father sent assassins  set the elephant Dhanapla loose  and having thus become a great criminal he did not meet the Exalted One face to face Because of this they say he did not recognize himBut that is not the reason For the Exalted One sitting in the middle of the pavilion hall surrounded by the company of bhikkhus appeared like the full moon surrounded by the host of stars Marked with the most excellent bodily characteristics adorned with the special features of physical beauty he illuminated the entire monastery with his sixcolored rays Who would not have known himThe king asks this as a mannerism of sovereignty For this is the nature of those of royal family though knowing something they ask as if they do not knowBut Jvaka having heard this question thought to himself This king standing in front of the Buddha asks Where is the Exalted One  This is as if someone standing on the earth were to ask Where is the earth  or as if someone looking up at the sky were to ask Where are the sun and moon  or as if someone standing at the foot of Mount Sineru were to ask Where is SineruI will show him the Exalted One Making a reverential salutation towards the Exalted One he said That is the Exalted One great king etcAs the king surveyed the company of bhikkhus wherever he looked the company sat in complete silenceNot even one bhikkhu was playing with his hands or feet or broke out into a cough Not even one bhikkhu looked up at the king and his royal assembly standing in front of the Exalted One or at the retinue of nautchgirls adorned with all their ornamentsAll sat there looking only at the Exalted OneThe king gaining confidence such peace again and again surveyed the company of bhikkhus sitting there with calm faculties like a clear lake free from mud He then uttered his joyful exclamation May my son the Prince Udyibhadda enjoy such peace as the company of bhikkhus now enjoysThe meaning is May he enjoy the bodily verbal and mental peace and the peaceful conduct which the company of bhikkhus enjoys He did not say this intending O may my son go forth and become peaceful like these bhikkhus Rather having gained confidence seeing the company of bhikkhus he remembered his sonFor that is the nature of people in the world when they have gained something rare or seen something wonderful they remember their dear relatives and friendsMoreover he said this because he was apprehensive about his son and desired peace for himFor he thought My son will ask My father is youngWhere is my grandfather Hearing Your father killed him he might think Then I shall kill my father and rule the kingdom Thus apprehensive about his son he spoke thus desiring this peace for himhis son eventually killed himIn that dynasty parricide took place in five generationsAjātasattu killed bimbisāra udayi killed ajātasattuBut the citizens became angry and thinking These kings destroy their own lineage what do we need them for  they killed NgadsaDo your thoughts great king follow the call of your affection  Why does the Exalted One say thisIt is said that before the king uttered his exclamation the Exalted One had thought The king having come stands here silent and speechless What is he thinking Having read his mind he reflected Being unable to converse with me he surveys the company of bhikkhus and remembers his son I will start a conversation with himThereupon the king thought O how wonderful are the virtues of the Buddha There is no one who has committed such crimes towards the Exalted One as I have I killed his chief supporter  I accepted the request of Devadatta and sent assassins to kill him I released the elephant Nlgiri against him with my support Devadatta hurled a stone at him The Buddha should not even open his mouth towards such a criminal as myself yet he freely addresses me O the Exalted One is wellestablished in the characteristic of a stable one in five modesI should not abandon such a teacher and search for a teacher elsewhere Filled with joy addressing the Exalted One he said Venerable sir I love my son etcI will answer everything This invitation is not shared in common even with paccekabuddhas chief disciples and great disciplesElated that the Exalted One had invited him to ask with the invitation of an Omniscient One the king asked his question on the visible fruits of recluseshipThis is the purport of the kings question similar to the visible fruits discerned for the various worldly crafts and enjoyed by those who live by these crafts Therefore speaking in terms of those who live by those crafts he refers to the various craftsand the fruit of recluseship is the noble fruitAs it is said What bhikkhus is recluseshipIt is this Noble Eightfold PathAnd what are the fruits of recluseshipThe fruits of streamentry of the oncereturner of the nonreturner and of arahatship The king however does not know about theseThus in the text below he asks concerning the examples of the slave and the farmer Do you remember great king   The Exalted One did not answer the question directly but reflected These many royal ministers who have come here are disciples of other religious teachers If I were to speak explaining the negative and positive sides they would complain Our king has come here with great eagerness yet from the time he arrived the recluse Gotama speaks only of the quarrels and controversies of recluses Thus they would not listen carefully to the Dhamma But if the king were to speak they wont be able to complain since they must follow himfor in the world people follow those who are in power It is not troublesome for me venerable sir The intention of the kings statement is thisBut the genuine wise men having heard ones statement praise what is wellspoken and when something is wrongly spoken contradicting the meaning and phrasing of the scriptures they correct it and reformulate itWhy does he ask Where is the Exalted OneThere the Venerable Candikaputta addressed the bhikkhus Friends bhikkhus  Friend  those bhikkhus replied The Venerable Candikaputta said this Friends Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus When friends a bhikkhus mind is consolidated by mind it is fitting for him to declare I understand Destroyed is birth the spiritual life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming back to any state of being Then the Venerable Sariputta said to the Venerable Candikaputta Friend Candikaputta it is not in such a way that Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhusRather Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus When friends a bhikkhus mind is well consolidated by mind it is fitting for him to declare I understand Destroyed is birth the spiritual life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming back to any state of being A second time A third time the Venerable Candikaputta addressed the bhikkhus Friends Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus When friends a bhikkhus mind is consolidated by mind it is fitting for him to declare I understand Destroyed is birth the spiritual life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming back to any state of beingRather Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus When friends a bhikkhus mind is well consolidated by mind it is fitting for him to declare I understand  Destroyed is birth the spiritual life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming back to any state of being And how friend is the mind of a bhikkhu well consolidated by mindHis mind is well consolidated by mind when he knows My mind is without lust His mind is well consolidated by mind when he knows My mind is without hatred His mind is well consolidated by mind when he knows My mind is without delusion His mind is well consolidated by mind when he knows My mind is not subject to lust His mind is well consolidated by mind when he knows My mind is not subject to hatred His mind is well consolidated by mind when he knows My mind is not subject to delusion His mind is well consolidated by mind when he knows My mind is not subject to return to sensesphere existence His mind is well consolidated by mind when he knows My mind is not subject to return to formsphere existence His mind is well consolidated by mind when he knows My mind is not subject to return to formlesssphere existenceEven if powerful sounds cognizable by the ear come into range of the ear  Even if powerful odors cognizable by the nose com e into range of the nose Even if powerful tastes cognizable by the tongue come into range of the tongue Even if powerful tactile objects cognizable by the body come into range of the body Even if powerful phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range of the mind they do not obsess his mind his mind is not at all affectedIt remains steady attained to im perturbability and he observes its vanishingSuppose friend there was a stone pillar eight meters long Four meters would be below ground and four meters above ground If a violent rainstorm should then arrive from the east it would not shake it or make it quake wobble and tremble if a violent rainstorm should then arrive from the west from the north from the south it would not shake it or make it quake wobble and trembleFor what reasonBecause the stone pillar is deep in the ground and is securely plantedSo too friend when a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of the eyeEven if powerful phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range of the mind they do not obsess his mind his mind is not at all affected It remains steady attained to imperturbability and he observes its vanishingA third time the Venerable Sariputta said to the Venerable Candikaputta Friend Candikaputta it is not in such a way that Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhusYet though he said thisWhen friend a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of the eye they do not obsess his mind his mind is not at all affectedudayi was killed by his own son mahāmuṇḍikamahāmuṇḍika was killed by his son Anuruddhaand Anuruddha was killed by his son nāgadāsaIt remains steady attained to imperturbability and he observes its vanishingTherefore immediately after the king uttered his joyful exclamation the Exalted One spoke the above wordsThis is the meaning Great king as rain water falling upon the highlands flows down to the plain so as you survey the company of bhikkhus your affection goes towards your sonKnowing the kings eagerness to ask a question the Exalted One says Ask whatever you wish to great kingHe invites him to ask extending to him the invitation of an Omniscient One  Ask whatever you wish to It is no trouble for me to answerFor they do not say Ask whatever you wish to but Having heard we will try to answerBuddhas however say Ask whatever you wish toinviting spirits kings gods recluses brahmins and wanderers with the invitation of an Omniscient One Is it possible to point out any visible fruit of recluseshipFruit of recluseship  in the ultimate sense recluseship is the pathright view  right concentrationSo then let me give the king the task  Turning that task over to the king he asks Do you remember great king ever asking other recluses and brahmins this questionIt is difficult to speak in the presence of those who pretend to be wise for they find fault with every word and letterAnd there is no genuine wise man equal to the Exalted OneThus the king says It is not troublesome for me venerable sir when the Exalted One or anyone like him is presentThen the Venerable Sariputta approached the Blessed One paid homage to him and sat down to one sideThe Blessed One then said to him  Sariputta when a bhikkhus taints have been destroyed how many powers does he possess by reason of which he can claim to have attained the destruction of the taints My taints have been destroyed  Bhante when a bhikkhus taints have been destroyed  he possesses ten powers by reason of which he can claim to have attained the destruction of the taints My taints have been destroyedWhat ten Here Bhante a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has clearly seen all conditioned phenomena as they really are with correct wisdom as impermanentThis is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed on the basis of which he claim s to have attained the destruction of the taints My taints have been destroyedAgain  a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has clearly seen sensual pleasures as they really are with correct wisdom as similar to a charcoal pitThis is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyedAgain the mind of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed slants slopes and inclines to seclusion it is withdrawn delights in renunciation and is entirely finished with all things that are a basis for the taintsThis is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyedAgain a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has developed and well developed the four establishments of mindfulness Again a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has developed and well developed the four right strivings the four bases for psychic potency the five spiritual faculties the five powers   the seven factors of enlightenment the noble eightfold pathThis is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed On the basis of which he claims to have attained the destruction of the taints My taints have been destroyedThis is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyedBhante when a bhikkhus taints have been destroyed he possesses these ten powers by reason of which he can claim to have attained the destruction of the taints My taints have been destroyedAt SavatthiBhikkhus form is impermanentWhat is impermanent is suffering What is suffering is nonselfWhat is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfFeeling is impermanent Perception is impermanent Volitional formations are impermanent Consciousness is impermanent What is impermanent is suffering What is suffering is nonself What is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfSeeing thus bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards form revulsion towards feeling revulsion towards perception revulsion towards volitional formations revulsion towards consciousnessExperiencing revulsion he becomes dispassionateThrough dispassionhis mindis liberatedWhen it is liberated there comes the knowledge Its liberated He understands Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what had tobe done has been done there is no more for this state of beingTo whatever extent bhikkhus there are abodes of beings even up to the pinnacle of existence these are the foremost in the world these are the best that is the arahantsThis is what the Blessed One saidHaving said this the Fortunate One the Teacher further said thisHappy indeed are the arahants No craving can be found in themCut off is the conceit I am Burst asunder is delusions netThey have reached the unstirred state Limpid are their mindsThey are unsullied in the world  The holy ones without taintsHaving fully understood the five aggregates Ranging in the seven good qualitiesThose praiseworthy superior men Are the Buddhas bosom sonsEndowed with the seven gems Trained in the threefold trainingThose great heroes wander about With fear and trembling abandonedEndowed with the ten factors Those great nagas concentratedAre the best beings in the world No craving can be found in themThe adepts knowledge has arisen in them This body is the last I bearIn regard to the core of the holy life They no longer depend on othersThey do not waver in discrimination They are released from renewed existenceHaving reached the stage of the tamed They are the victors in the worldAbove across and below Delight is no more found in themThey boldly sound their lions roar The enlightened are supreme in the worldAt SavatthiBhikkhus the Tathagata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One liberated by nonclinging through revulsion towards form through its fading away and cessation is called a Perfectly Enlightened OneThe Tathagata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One liberated by nonclinging through revulsion towards feelingA bhikkhu liberated by wisdom liberated by nonclinging through revulsion towards feelingThere in bhikkhus what is the distinction what is the disparity what is the difference between the Tathagatathe Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One and a bhikkhu liberated by wisdom Venerable sir our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One guided by the Blessed One take recourse in the Blessed OneIt would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statementHaving heard it from him the bhikkhus will remember itThen listen and attend closely bhkkhus I will speakYes venerable sir the bhikkhus repliedThe Blessed One said thisThe Tathagata bhikkhus the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One is the originator of the path unarisen before the producer of the path unproduced before the declarer of the path undeclared before He is the knower of the path the discoverer of the path the one skilled in the path And his disciples now dwell following that path and become possessed of it afterwardsThis bhikkhus is the distinction the disparity the difference between the Tathagata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One and a bhikkhu liberated by wisdomA bhikkhu liberated by wisdom liberated by nonclinging through revulsion towards form through its fading away and cessationis called one liberated by wisdom perception  volitional formations  consciousness through its fading away and cessation is called a Perfectly Enlightened One perceptian  volitional formations  consciousness through its fading away and cessation is called one liberated by wisdomAt SavatthiBhikkhus in the evening the lion the king of beasts comes out from his lair Having come out he stretches himself surveys the four quarters all around and roars his lions roar three times Then he sets out in search of gameThose who live in holes enter their holes those who live in the water enter the water those who live in the woods enter the woods and the birds fly up into the air Even those royal bull elephants bound by strong thongs in the villages towns and capital cities burst and break their bonds asunder frightened they urinate and defecate and flee here and thereSo powerful bhikkhus is the lion the king of beasts among the animals so majestic and mightySo too bhikkhus when the Tathagata arises in the world an arahant perfectly enlightened accomplished in true knowledge and conduct fortunate knower of the world unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed teacher of devas and humans the Enlightened One the Blessed Onehe teaches the Dhamma thus Such is form such its origin such its passing away such is feeling  such is perception  such are volitional formations  such is consciousness such its origin such its passing awayThen bhikkhus when those devas who are longlived beautiful abounding in happiness dwelling for a long time in lofty palaces hear the Tathsgatas teaching of the Dhamma they are for the most part filled with fear a sense of urgency and terror saying It seems sir that we are impermanent though we thought ourselves permanentThis is what the Blessed One said Having said this the Fortunate One the Teacher further said thisWhen the lion the king of beasts roars whatever animals hear the sound are for the most part filled with fear a sense of urgency and terrorit seems sir that we are unstable though we thought ourselves stableit seems sir that we are noneternal though we thought ourselves eternalIt seems sir that we are impermanent unstable noneternal included within identitySo powerful bhikkhus is the Tathagata over this world together with its devas so majestic and mightyWhen the Buddha through direct knowledge Sets in motion the Wheel of DhammaThe peerless Teacher in this world With its devas makesthis knownThe cessation of identity And the origin of identiAlso the Noble Eightfold Path That leads to sufferings appeasementThen those devas with long life spans Beautiful

down to one sideand said to him venerable sir I have such confidence in the Blessed OneLofty indeed is this bellowing utterance of yours Sariputta you have roared a definitive categorical lions

sir a king had a frontier city with strong ramparts walls and arches and with a single gateThe gatekeeper posted there would be wise competent and intelligent one who keeps out strangers and admits acquaintancesWhile he is walking along the path that encircles the city he would not see a cleft or an opening in the walls even big enough for a cat to slip throughHe might think Whatever large creatures enter or leave this city all enter and leave through this one gateSo too venerable sir I have understood this by inference from the Dhamma Whatever Arahants Perfectly Enlightened Ones arose in the past all those Blessed Ones had first abandoned the five hindrances corruptions of the mind and weakeners of wisdom and then with their minds well established in the four establishments of mindfulness they had developed correctly the seven factors of enlightenment and there by they had awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenmentAnd venerable sir whatever Arahants Perfectly

devas and humans whatever is seen heard sensed cognized reached sought after examined by the mindall that the Tathagata has fully awakened totherefore he is called the TathagataBhikkhus whatever the Tathagata speaks utters or expounds in the interval between the night when he awakens to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment and the night when he attains final nibbana all that is just so and not otherwisetherefore he is called the TathagataSince he does as he speaks and speaks as he doestherefore he is called the Tathagatatherefore he is called the TathagataHaving directly known all the world

acrossThus indeed they pay him homage the great one free from diffidenceIn this world together with its devas there is no one who can rival youBhikkhus there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the worldWhat fourHere some person attains nibbana through exertion in this very lifeStill another person attains nibbana without exertion in this very lifeAnd how bhikkhus does a person attain nibbana through exertion in this very lifeHere a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the body perceiving the repulsiveness of food perceiving nondelight in the entire world contemplating impermanence in all conditioned phenomenaHe dwells depending upon these five trainee powers the power of faith the power of moral shame the power of moral dread the power of energy and the power of wisdomThese five faculties arise in him prominently the faculties of faith energy mindfulness concentration and wisdomBecause these five faculties are prominent he attains nibbana through exertion in this very lifeThis is how a person attains nibbana through exertion in this very lifeAnd how does a person attain nibbana through exertion with the breakup of the bodyHere a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the bodyHe dwells depending upon these five trainee powers the powers of faith and wisdomThese five faculties arise in him feebly the faculties of faith and wisdomBecause these five faculties are feeble he attains nibbana through exertion with the breakup of the bodyThis is how a person attains nibbana through exertion with the breakup of the bodyAnd how does a person attain nibbana without exertion in this very lifeHere secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhana the fourth jhanaHe

exertion with the breakup of the bodyAnd still another person attains nibbana without exertion with the breakup of the bodyand he has the perception of death well established internallyand he has the perception of death well established internallyThus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThen the Blessed One took up a little bit of soil in his fingernail and addressed the bhkkhus thus Bhikkhus what do you think which is more the little bit of soil that I have taken up in my fingernail or this great earth Venerable sir the great earth is moreSo too bhikkhus for a noble disciple a person accomplished in view who has made the breakthrough the suffering that has been destroyed and eliminated is more while that which remains is triflingOf such great benefit bhikkhus is the breakthrough to the Dhamma of such great benefit is it to obtain the vision of the DhammaIt does not amount to a hundredth part or a thousandth part or a hundred thousandth part of the great earthThe little bit of soil that the Blessed One has taken up in his fingernail is triflingThe latter does not amount to a hundredth part or a thousandth part or a hundred thousandth part of the former mass of suffering that has been destroyed and eliminated as there is a maximum of seven more livesAt SavatthiBhikkhus the eye is impermanent changing becoming otherwise The ear The nose The tongue The body The mind is impermanent changing becoming otherwiseOne who places faith in these teachings and resolves on them thus is called a faithfollower one who has entered the fixed course of rightness entered the plane of superior persons transcended the plane of the worldlings He is incapable of doing any deed by reason of which he might be reborn in hell in theanimal realm or in the domain of ghosts he is incapable of passing away without having realized the fruit of streamentryOne for whom these teachings are accepted thus after being pondered to a sufficient degree with wisdom is called a Dhammafollower one who has entered the fixed course of rightness entered the plane of superior persons transcended the plane of the worldlings He is incapable

knows and sees these teachings thus is called a streamenterer no longer bound to the nether world fixed in destiny with enlightenment as his destinationThus have I heard Once the Lord was staying in Magadha to the east of Rsjagaha by a Brahmin village called Ambasapda to the north of the village on Mount Vediya in the Indasala CaveAnd at that time Sakka lord of the gods felt a strong desire to see the LordAnd Sakka thought Where is the Blessed Lord the fullyenlightened Buddha now stayingThen perceiving where the Lord was Sakka said to the ThirtyThree Gods Gentlemen the Blessed Lord is staying in Magadha in the Indasda Cave How would it be if we were to go and visit the Lord Very good Lord and may good fortune go with you replied the ThirtyThree GodsThen Sakka said to Pancasikha of the gandhabbas The Blessed Lord is staying in Magadha in the Indasala Cave I propose to go to visit himVery good Lord said Pancasikha and taking his yellow beluvawood he followed in attendance on SakkaAnd just as swiftly as a strong man might stretch forth his flexed arm or flex it again Sakka surrounded by the ThirtyThree Gods and attended by Pancasikha vanished from the heaven of the ThirtyThree and appeared in Magadha on Mount VediyaThen a tremendous light shone over Mount Vediya illuminating the village of Ambasapda  so great was the power of the godsso that in the surrounding villages they were saying Look Mount Vediya is on fire today  its burning  its in flames What is the matter that Mount Vediya and Ambaspda are lit up like this and they were so terrified that their hair stood on endThen Sakka said Pancasikha it is hard for the likes of us to get near the Tathagatas when they are enjoying the bliss of meditation and therefore withdrawnBut if you Pancasikha were first to attract the ear of the Blessed Lord then we might afterwards be able to approach and see the Blessed Lord the fullyenlightened Buddha Very good Lord said Paiicasikha and taking his yellow beluvawood lute he approached the Indasala Cave Thinking As far as this is neither too far nor too near to the Lord and he will hear my voice he stood to one sideThen to the strains of his lute he sang these verses extolling the Buddha the Dhamma the Arahants and loveLady your father Timbaru greet Oh Sunshine fair I give him honour dueBy whom was sired a maid as fair as you Who are the cause of all my hearts delightDelightful as the breeze to one who sweats Or as a cooling draught to one who thirstsYour radiant beauty is to me as dear As the Dhamma is to ArahantsJust as medicine to him whos ill Or nourishment to one whos starving stillBring me gracious lady sweet release With water cool from my consuming flamesThe elephant oppressed by summer heat Seeks out a lotuspool upon which floatPetals and pollen of that flower So into your bosom sweet Id plungeAs an elephant urged by the goad Pays no heed to pricks of lance and spearSo I unheeding know not what I do Intoxicated by your beauteous formBy you my heart is tightly bound in bonds All my thoughts are quite transformed and ICan no longer find my former course Im like a fish thats caught on baited hookCome embrace me maiden fair of tights Seize and hold me with your lovely eyes Take me in your arms its all I askMy desire was slight at first O maidOf waving tresses but it grew apaceAs grow the gifts that Arahants receiveWhatever merit I have gained by giftsWhen it ripens be your love most fairTo those Noble Ones may my rewardAs the Sakyans Son in jhana raptIntent and mindful seeks the deathless goalThus intent I seek your love my SunJust as that Sage would be rejoiced if he Were to gain supreme enlightenmentSo Id rejoice to be made one with youIf Sakka Lord of ThreeandThirty Gods Were perchance to grant a boon to meIts you Id crave my love for yous so strong Your father maid so wise I venerateLike a saltree fairly blossomingFor his offsprings sake so sweet and fairWhen he heard this the Lord said Pancasikha the sound of your strings blends so well with your song and your song with the strings that neither prevails excessively over I the otherWhen did you compose these verses on the Buddha the Dhamma the Arahants and loveLord it was when the Blessed Lord was staying on the bank of the River i Neranjara under the goatherds banyan tree prior to his enlightenmentAt that time I fell in love with the lady Bhadda i bright as the sun the daughter of King Timbaru of the gandhabbasBut the lady was in love with somebody else It was Sikhaddi the son of Matali the charioteer whom she favouredAnd when I found that I could not win the lady by any manner of meansI took my yellow beluvawood lute and went to the home of King Timbarii of the gandhabbas and there I sang these versesAnd Lord having heard the verses the lady Bhadda Suriyavaccasa said to me Sir I have not personally seen that Blessed Lord though I heard of him when I went to the Sudhamma Hall of the ThirtyThree Gods to danceAnd since sir you praise that Blessed Lord so highly let us meet todayAnd so Lord I met the ladynot then but laterThen Sakka thought Pancasikha and the Lord are in friendly conversation so he called to Pancasikha My dear Pancasikha salute the Blessed Lord from meVery good Lord said Pancasikha and did soPancasikha may Sakka king of the gods his ministers and followers be happy for they all desire happiness devas humans asuras nagas gandhabbas and whatever other groups of beings there are After this greeting Sakka entered the Indasala Cave saluted the Lord and stood to one sideThen in the Indasala Cave the rough passages became smooth the narrow parts became wide and in the pitchdark cavern it became bright owing to the power of the devasThen the Lord said to Sakka It is wonderful it is marvellous that the Venerable Kosiya with so much so many things to do should come hereLord I have long wished to visit the Blessed Lord but I have always been so busy on behalf of the ThirtyThree that I was unable to comeOnce the Blessed Lord was staying at Savatthi in the Salala hutAt that time the Blessed Lord was seated in some form of meditation and King Vessavanas wife Bhunjati was waiting on him venerating him with palms togetherI said to her Lady please salute the Blessed Lord for me and say Sakka the king of the gods with his ministers and followers pays homage at the Lords feetBut she said Sir it is not the right time to see the Blessed Lord he is in retreatWell then lady when the Blessed Lord rises from his meditation please tell him what I have saidLord did the lady salute you on my behalfShe did salute me King of the Gods and I remember what she saidI also remember that it was the sound of Your Reverences chariotwheels that roused me from my meditationLord those gods who arose in the heaven of the ThirtyThree before I did have told me and assured me that whenever a Tathagata a fullyenlightened Arahant Buddha arises in the world the ranks of devas increase and those of the asuras decline in numberssaying Lord Sakka king of the gods together with his ministers and followers pays homage at the feet of the Blessed Lord for that is the way the Tathagatas greet such mighty beingsand the ThirtyThree Godswith Pancasikha did the sameand I went to Savatthi to see the Lordand does the Lord remember what she said In fact I have witnessed this myselfThere was Lord right here in Kapilavatthu a Sakyan girl called Gopika who had faith in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and who observed the precepts scrupulouslyShe rejected the status of a woman and developed the thought of becoming a manAlso there were three monks who having observed the holy life under the Blessed Lord had been reborn in the inferior condition of gandhabbasThey lived indulging in the pleasures of the five senses as our attendants and servantsAt this Gopaka rebuked them saying What were you about sirs that you did not listen to the Blessed Lords teaching I was a woman who had faith in the Buddha I rejected the status of a woman and was reborn among the ThirtyThree GodsBut you after having observed the holy life under the Blessed Lord have been reborn in the inferior condition of gandhabbasIt is a sorry sight for us to see our fellows in the Dhamma reborn in the inferior condition of gandhabbasAnd being thus rebuked two of those devas immediately developed mindfulness and so attained to the Realm of the Retinue of BrahmaBut one of them remained addicted to sensual pleasuresThen after her death at the breakingup of the body she went to a happy destination being reborn in a heavenstate among the ThirtyThree Godsas one of our sons becoming known as Gopaka the devas sonand I am known as Gopaka the devas sonDisciple once of HimWhoSeesThe name I bore then GopikaIn Buddha Dhamma firmly trustingI served the Sangha cheerfullyFor loyal service paid to hima Sakkason MightyThen former monks I saw whod reachedWe supplied their food and drinkEach for himself must understand That DhammaAnd so Im born a Sakkason MightyHave reappeared in humble stateThat gandhabbaspirits youand female I Am now reborn a male a godAlas lets go and strive amainThey purified their hearts of lustAnd like the elephant that burstsWho sat enthroned in Council HallOutcome is occurrenceIn every case he rejects the doing of evil and of meritHe explains Even though a person does something with the idea I am doing evil evil is not done There is no evilBeings have the idea We are doing evil By both words  he rejects the real condition for defilement ie wrong bodily conduct etc and the real condition for purification ie right bodily conduct etcis the kamma beings do on their own by reason of which they attain the state of a god the state of Mra the state of Brahm the enlightenment of a disciple the enlightenment of a paccekabuddha or the omniscience  This he rejectsDetermination by others is the exhortation and instruction given by others in dependence upon which all people except for the Great Beings  attain ranging from good fortune in the human state up to arahatship He rejects this determination by othersThus this fool strikes a blow at the Wheel of the ConquerorNo personal determination  he rejects the personal determination through which beings attain the aforementioned kinds of successNo power  he denies that beings can establish themselves upon their own power arouse their energy and attain successThe terms energy personal strength and personal fortitude are synonymous with personal determinationThey are brought in separately in order to reject the claim This has occurred through our energy personal strength and personal fortitudeSelfdetermination On seeing which Vasava dismayed Outstripped and left them far behindSee how these of lesser rankGopaka said to VisavaAll sentient beings  he includes camels oxen donkeys etc without exceptionAll living beings  he says this with reference to creatures having one or two facultiesAll creatures  this refers to beings born from eggs or from the wombLord Indra in the world of men A BuddhaAll souls  this refers to rice barley wheat etcbecause they undergo growth he regards them as having soulsAre helpless powerless devoid of energy they have no selfcontrol power or energyAnd these his pupils who had failed In mindfulness when claimed by deathCircumstance  going here and there among the six classes of menNature  the inner nature By this whole statement Makkhali Gosla shows Thus are transformed and achieve diversity due to destiny circumstance and natureWhatever will be will bewhatever will not be will not beThe six classes of men  abiding in the six classes of men they experience pleasure and painHe shows that there is no other plane of pleasure and painThough one of them is left behindFive hundred kinds of kammaThese two on highest wisdom sethe explains a senseless view devised solely by mere reasoningThe same principle applies in the case of five kinds of kamma three kinds of kamma etcBut some say He speaks of five kinds of kamma by way of the five sense facultiesThat truth may yet be realisedFull kamma and halfkamma here his theory is that bodily and verbal kamma are full kamma and mental kamma is halfkammaand three kinds by way of bodily kammaSixtytwo pathways Not knowing the natural language correctly he speaks of sixtytwo pathways as dvahipaipad when it should be dvsahipaipad Sixtytwo subaeons  in a single great aeon there are sixtyfour subaeonsAn end of doubts our homage due The Buddha Victor Lord we givebut since he does not know about two of these he says He declares that there are six classes of men the black the blue the red the yellow the white and the ultimate white The black class is made up of butchers hunters fishermen thieves executioners prison wardens and those in other cruel lines of workThe blue class is made up of bhikkhus For bhikkhus he says eat having thrown thorns into the four requisites His own canonical text says Bhikkhus have thorny behavior By those who dwell in these abodes To him whos crossed the flood and made An end of doubtsEven here they gained the truth and soin hope that we may gain That truthOr alternatively he says that some who have gone forth have thorny behaviorThe red class is made up of the onerobed he Nigahas for these are purer than the former twoThe yellow class is made up of the whiteclothed lay disciples of the naked asceticsThus he makes his own lay supporters superior even to the NigahasThe white class comprises the male and female jvikasfor these he says are purer than the previous fourThe ultimate white class is made up of Nanda Vaccha Kisa Sakiccha and Makkhali GoslaThen the Lord thought Sakka has lived a pure life for a long time Whatever questions he may ask will be to the point and not frivolousand he will be quick to understand my answersfor they are the purest of allSo the Blessed Lord replied to Sakka in this verseAsk me Sakka all that you desireBeing thus invited Sakka ruler of the gods put his first question to the LordHe declares that there are eight stages in the life of man the stage of feebleness the stage of play the stage of learning to walk the erect stage the stage of training the recluse stage the conqueror stage and the prostrate stageThe stage of feebleness  this lasts for seven days following the day of birth for after coming out from the womb beings are feeble and dullThe stage of play  those who have come from an evil destination often cry and howl those who come from a good destination remember it and laughThe stage of learning to walk  this is the stage when the child takes hold of its parents hands or feet or a bed or chair and places its feet on the groundwhereby although they wish to live without hate harming hostility or malignity and in peace they yet live in hate harming one another hostile and malignThe erect stage  this is the stage when it is able to walk on its feetThe stage of training  this is the stage when one has been trained in a craftThe recluse stage  this is the time when one has renounced the household life and gone forth This was Sakkas first question to the Lordand the Lord repliedThe conqueror stage  this is the time when having served a teacher one knowsThe prostrate stage  this is the stage of a bhikkhu a prostrate one a conqueror one who does not say anything a recluse without gainsRuler of the Gods it is the bonds of jealousy and avarice that bind beings so that though they wish to live without hate they yet live in hate harming one nother hostile and malignThis was the Lords replyand Sakka delighted exclaimed So it is Lord so it is WellFarerThrough the Lords answer I have overcome my doubt and got rid of uncertaintyThirtysix realms of dust places where dust accumulates he says this referring to the backs of the hands bottom of the feet etc Seven spheres of percipient beings he says this referring to camels oxen donkeys goats cattle deer and buffaloesSeven spheres of nonpercipient beings he says this referring to rice paddy barley wheat millet beans and kadrsakaBut sir what gives rise to jealousy and avarice what is their origin how are they born how do they arise Owing to the presence of what do they arise owing to the absence of what do they not ariseThen Sakka having expressed his appreciation asked another questionSeven kinds of jointed plants plants grown from joints he refers to sugarcane bamboo reeds etcSeven kinds of gods there are many kinds of godsbut he says there are sevenHuman beings too are of infinite kinds but he says there are sevenSeven kinds of demons  there are numerous kinds of demons but he says there are sevenSeven great lakes he says this mentioning the Kaamua Rathakra Anotatta Shappapta Chaddanta Mandki and KuladahaJealousy and avarice Ruler of the Gods take rise from like and dislike this is their origin this is how they are born how they arise When these are present they arise when these are absent they do not ariseHe describes the duration of a great aeon as the time it would take to drain a single great lake seven times by removing a single drop of water with the tip of a blade of kusagrass once every hundred yearsBut sir what gives rise to like and dislike Owing to the presence of what do they arise owing to the absence of what do they not ariseHis theory asserts that when eightyfour hundred thousand of such great aeons have passed the foolish and the wise make an end to sufferingThe wise man he says cannot purify himself before thisand the fool does not continue on beyondThey arise Ruler of the Gods from desire Owing to the presence of desire they arise owing to the absence of desire they do not ariseBut sir what gives rise to desireDesire Ruler of the Gods arises from thinking When the mind thinks about something desire arises when the mind thinks about nothing desire does not ariseBut sir what gives rise to thinkingThinking Ruler of the Gods arises from the tendency to proliferation When this tendency is present thinking arises when it is absent thinking does not ariseWell sir what practice has that monk undertaken who has reached the right way which is needful and leading to the cessation of the tendency to proliferationBy this moral discipline of the naked ascetics or by any otherObservance should be understood similarlyThat the one who considers himself a wise man should ripen unripened kamma ie that he should purify himself beforehandor eliminate ripened kamma whenever it comes up or that the one who considers himself a fool should continue on beyond the time stated to be the limits that cannot beSasras limits   can neither be shortened nor extended sasra is not shortened for the wise man nor extended for the foolie neither is able to do thatThere is no present world no world beyond For one living in the world beyond this world does not exist and for one living in this world the world beyond does not exist He shows all are annihilated just where they areNo mother no father He says this intending that there are no fruits of right and wrong conduct towards parentsNo beings who have taken rebirth  He says there are no beings who having passed away reappear The earth returns to and merges with the body of earth The internal earth element the external earth elementThe same method with the other elementsHis sense faculties pass over into space CY The six sense faculties including mind enter spaceHis meritorious offerings end in ashes CY The meaning is The gifts he gave such as presents gifts of honor etc all terminate in ashesThey do not go beyond yielding fruitFools give the wise takeAn overview of the three doctrines Among these Pūraṇa with his statement By doing so there is no evil denies kamma because of his doctrine of the inefficacy of actionAjita with his statement One is annihilated with the breakup of the body denies kammic results because he completely rejects a future rearisingMakkhali with his statement There is no cause etc denies bothBy denying kamma one denies its result because there is no result when there is no kamma By denying the result one denies kamma because when there is no result kamma becomes inefficaciousThus all these thinkers by denying both  in effect espouse acausalism  the inefficacy of action  and moral nihilism When people accept these theories and then recite and investigate them while sitting in their dayquarters or nightquarters wrong mindfulness becomes established taking as object  No evil is done or There is no cause or condition or The dead are annihilated The mind becomes onepointed The impulsions run their course  At the first impulsion these people are curable and so too at the second etc But at the seventh they cannot be cured even by the Buddhas they cannot be turned backSomeone might espouse one view among these three another two another three But whether one espouses one two or three views one adopts a wrong view with fixed consequences One has met an obstruction to the path to heaven and an obstruction to the path to liberation It is impossible for him to reach heaven immediately following this present existence much less to reach liberationThis being has become a stump in the round of existence a watchman of the earth Generally one like this does not emerge from existenceTherefore  Should keep far away from such harmful people As one would avoid a venomous snakea person with discernment Desirous of his spiritual growthThe practice of giving is a doctrine of fools CY He shows Fools prescribe giving not the wise Unmade unfashioned Unfashioned means that they have not been constructed by anyone who commands them to be madeUncreated without a creator Uncreated not created by supernormal powerThey do not alter do not change Because they are steady standing firm like a pillar they do not alter ie do not undergo transmutationand do not change ie do not abandon their original natureThe body of earth etc The body of earth is the earth itself or the assemblage of earth because earth is one part of the bodyThere is no killer etc Just as when one strikes a heap of beans with a sword the sword enters in between the beans so the sword enters the space the interstice between the seven bodiesTherein he shows I am taking his life that is only a mere idea A nigaha is restrained with regard to all water etc Restrained with regard to all water  he rejects the use of all cold waterIt is said that he perceives sentient beings in cold water and thus does not use itHe is called a knotless one who is selfperfected etc Selfperfected  one whose mind has attained the peakSelfcontrolled  one who has subdued his mindSelfestablished  one whose mind is well establishedIn his doctrine there is something that accords with the Buddhas teaching but because his theory is not pure it is all counted as viewThe doctrine of Sañjaya is explained by the method stated in the section on doctrines of endless equivocation in the commentary to the Brahmajla Sutta Then Sakka having expressed his appreciation asked I another questionWell sir what practice has that monk undertaken who has acquired the restraint required by the rulesRuler of the Gods I declare that there are two kinds of bodily conduct the kind to be pursued and the kind to be avoidedThe same applies to conduct of speech andto the pursuit of goalsWhy have I declared this in regard to bodily conductThis is how I understood bodily conduct When I observed that by the performance of certain actions unwholesome factors increased and wholesome factors decreased then that form of bodily action was to be avoidedAnd when I observed that by the performance of such actions unwholesome factors decreased and wholesome ones increased then such bodily action was to be followedThat is why make this distinctionThe same applies to conduct of speech andthe pursuit of goalsAnd this Ruler of the Gods is the practice that monk has undertaken who has acquired the restraint required by the rulesAnd Sakka expressed his delight at the Lords answerThen Sakka asked another questionWell sir what practice has that monk undertaken who has acquired control of his sensefacultiesRuler of the Gods I declare that things perceived by the eye are of two kinds the kind to be pursued and the kind to be avoidedThe same applies to things perceived by the earthe nosethe tonguethe body andthe mindAt this Sakka saidLord I understand in full the true meaning of what the Blessed Lord has outlined in briefLord whatever object perceived by the eye if its pursuit leads to the increase of unwholesome factors and the decrease of wholesome ones that is not to be sought afterif its pursuit leads to the decrease of unwholesome factors and the increase of wholesome ones such an object is to be sought afterAnd the same applies to things perceived by the ear the nose the tongue the body and the mindThus I understand in full the true meaning of what the Blessed Lord has outlined in brief and thus through the Lords answer I have overcome my doubt and got rid of uncertaintyThen Sakka asked another questionSir do all ascetics and Brahmins teach the same doctrine practise the same discipline want the same thing and pursue the same goalNo Ruler of the Gods they do notBut why sir do they not do soThe world Ruler of the Gods is made up of many and various elementsSuch being the case beings adhere to one or other of these various things and whatever they adhere to they become powerfully addicted to and declare This alone is the truth everything else is falseTherefore they do not all teach the same doctrine practise the same discipline want the same thing pursue the same goalSir are all ascetics and Brahmins fully proficient freed from bonds perfect in the holy life have they perfectly reached the goalNo Ruler of the GodsWhy is that sirOnly those Ruler of the Gods who are liberated by the destruction of craving are fully proficient freed from the bonds perfect in the holy life and have perfectly reached the goalAnd Sakka rejoiced at the answer as beforeThen Sakka saidPassionsir is a disease a boil a dart It seduces a man drawing him into this or that state of becomingso that he is reborn in high states or lowWhereas other ascetics and Brahmins of differing viewpoints gave me no chance to ask these questionsthe Lord has instructed me at length and thus removed the dart of doubt and uncertainty from meRuler of the Gods do you admit to having asked the same question of other ascetics and BrahminsYes LordThen if you dont mind please tell me what they saidI do not mind telling the Blessed Lord or one like himThen tell me Ruler of the GodsLord I went to those I considered to be ascetics and Brahmins because of their solitary life in the woods and I put these questions to them But instead of giving me a proper answer they asked me in return Who are you Venerable SirI replied that I was Sakka ruler of the godsand they asked me what had brought me thereThen I taught them the Dhammna as far as I had heard it and practised itBut they were very pleased with even that much and they said We have seen Sakka the ruler of the gods and he has answered the questions we put to himAnd they became my pupils instead of my becoming theirsBut I Lord am a disciple of the Blessed Lord a StreamWinner not subject to rebirth in states of woe firmly established and destined for full enlightenment Ruler of the Gods do you admit to having ever previously experienced rejoicing and happiness such as you experience nowYes LordAnd what was that aboutIn the past Lord war had broken out between the gods and the asurasand the gods had defeated the asurasAnd after the battle as victor I thought Whatever is now the food of the gods and what is the food of the asuras henceforth we shall enjoy bothBut Lord such happiness and satisfaction which was due to blows and wounds does not conduce to dispassion detachment cessation peace higher knowledge enlightenment NibbanaBut that happiness and satisfaction that is obtained by hearing the Dhamma from the Blessed Lord which is not due to blows and wounds does conduce to dispassion detachment cessation peace higher knowledge enlightenment NibbanaAnd Ruler of the Gods what things do you call to mind when you admit to experiencing such satisfaction and happiness as thisLord at such a time six things come to mind at which I rejoiceI who merely as a god exist have gainedThe chance by kamma of another earthly lifeThat Lord is the first thing that occurs to meLeaving this nonhuman realm of gods behindUnerringly Ill seek the womb I wish to findThat Lord is the second thingMy problems solved Ill gladly live by Buddhas lawControlled and mindful and with clear awareness filledThat Lord is the third thingAnd should thereby enlightenment arise in meAs onewhoknows Ill dwell and there await my endThat Lord is the fourth thingThen when I leave the human world againIll be Once more a god and one of highest rankThat Lord is the fifth thingMore glorious than devas are the PeerlessAmong whom dwelling I shall make my final homeThat Lord is the sixth thing that occurs to meand these are the six things at which I rejoiceunfulfilled in doubtI thought Hermits who live secluded and austereWhat must I do to gain success and what Course but leads to failure Instead when they found out that I am king Of godsAnd I it was who taught them what I knew Of Dhamma and at that rejoicingBut now  Ive seen the Buddha and my doubts Are all dispelledto him whos drawn the dart Of craving to the Buddha peerless LordJust as Brahmas worshipped by the godsEnlightened One and Teacher unsurpassedThen Sakka ruler of the gods said to Pancasikha of the gandhabbas My dear Pancasikha you have been of great help to me for gaining the ear of the Blessed LordFor it was through your gaining his ear that we were admitted to the presence of the Blessed Lord the Arahant the supremely enlightened BuddhaI will be a father to you you shall be king of the gandhabbas and I will give you Bhadda Suriyavaccasa whom you desiredAnd then Sakka ruler of the gods touched the earth with his hand and called out three times Homage to the Blessed One the Arahant the supremely enlightened Buddha Homage to the Blessed One the Arahant the supremely enlightened Buddha Homage to the Blessed One the Arahant the supremely enlightened BuddhaAnd while he had been speaking in this dialogue the pure and spotless DhammaEye arose within Sakka ruler of the gods and he knew Whatever things have an origin must come to cessationAnd the same thing happened to eighty thousand devas as well Such were the questions which Sakka ruler of the gods was desirous to ask and which the Lord answered for himTherefore this discourse is called Sakkas QuestionsTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkNow a number of bhikkhus were sitting in the assembly hall where they had met together on returning from their almsround after their meal when this discussion arose among them It is wonderful friends it is marvellous how mighty and powerful is the Tathagata For he is able to know about the Buddhas of the past  who attained to final Nibbana cut the tangle of proliferation broke the cycle ended the round and surmounted all suffering  that for those Blessed Ones their birth was thus their names were thus their clans were thus their virtue was thus their state of concentration was thus their wisdom was thus their abiding in attainments was thus their deliverance was thusWhen this was said the venerable Ananda told the bhikkhus Friends Tathagatas are wonderful and have wonderful qualities Tathagatas are marvellous and have marvellous qualitiesHowever their discussion was interruptedThen he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus for what discussion are you sitting together here now And what was your discussion that was interrupted Here venerable sir we were sitting in the assembly hall where we had met together on returning from our almsround after our meal when this discussion arose among us It is wonderful friends it is marvellous their deliverance was thusThen the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda That being so Ananda explain more fully the Tathagatas wonderful and marvellous qualitiesI heard and learned this venerable sir from the Blessed Ones own lips Mindful and fully aware Ananda the Bodhisatta appeared in the Tusita heavenThat mindful and fully aware the Bodhisatta appeared in the Tusita heaven  this I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed OneI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips Mindful and fully aware the Bodhisatta remained in the Tusita heavenI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips For the whole of his lifespan the Bodhisatta remained in the Tusita heavenI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips Mindful and fully aware the Bodhisatta passed away from the Tusita heaven and descended into his mothers wombThis too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed OneI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta passed away from the Tusita heaven and descended into his mothers wombAnd the beings born there perceived each other by that light So other beings indeed have appeared here And this tenthousandfold world system shook and quaked and trembled and there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods appearedThis too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed OneI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta had descended into his mothers womb four young deities came to guard him at the four quarters so that no humans or nonhumans or anyone at all could harm the Bodhisatta or his motherThis too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed OneI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta had descended into his mothers womb she became intrinsically virtuous refraining from killing living beings from taking what is not given from misconduct in sensual pleasures from false speech and from wines liquors and intoxicants which are the basis of negligenceThis too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed OneI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta had descended into his mothers womb no sensual thought arose in her concerning men and she was inaccessible to any man having a lustful mindThis too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed OneI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta had descended into his mothers womb she obtained the five cords of sensual pleasureThis too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed OneI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta had descended into his mothers womb no kind of affliction arose in her she was blissful and free from bodily fatigue She saw the Bodhisatta within her womb with all his limbs lacking no facultySuppose a blue yellow red white or brown thread were strung through a fine beryl gem of purest water eightfaceted well cutThis too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed OneI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips Seven days after the birth of the Bodhisatta his mother died and reappeared in the Tusita heavenI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips Other women give birth after carrying the child in the womb for nine or ten months but not so the Bodhisattas motherThe Bodhisattas mother gave birth after carrying him in her womb for exactly ten monthsThis too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed OneI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips Other women give birth seated or lying down but not so the Bodhisattas motherThe Bodhisattas mother gave birth to him standing upThis too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed OneI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta came forth from his mothers womb first gods received him then human beingsThis too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed OneI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta came forth from his mothers womb he did not touch the earth The four young gods received him and set him before his mother saying Rejoice O queen a son of great power has been born to youThis too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed OneI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta came forth from his mothers womb he came forth unsullied unsmeared by water or humours or blood or any kind of impurity clean and unsulliedSuppose there were a gem placed on Kasi cloth then the gem would not smear the cloth or the cloth the gemWhy is thatBecause of the purity of bothSo too when the Bodhisatta came forthclean and unsulliedThis too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed OneI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta came forth from his mothers womb two jets of water appeared to pour from the sky one cool and one warm for bathing the Bodhisatta and his motherThis too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed OneI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips As soon as the Bodhisatta was born he stood firmly with his feet on the ground then he took seven steps north and with a white parasol held over him he surveyed each quarter and uttered the words of the Leader of the Herd I am the highest in the world I am the best in the world I am the foremost in the worldThis is my last birth now there is no renewal of being for meThis too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed OneI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta came forth from his mothers womb then a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods appeared in the world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas in this generation with its recluses and brahmins with its princes and its peopleAnd even in those abysmal world interspaces of vacancy gloom and utter darkness where the moon and the sun mighty and powerful as they are cannot make their light prevail  there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods appearedAnd the beings born there perceived each other by that light So other beings indeed have appeared hereAnd this tenthousandfold world system shook and quaked and trembled and there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods appearedThat being so Ananda remember this too as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the TathagataVenerable sir since for the Blessed One feelings are known as they arise as they are present as they disappear perceptions are known as they arise as they are present as they disappear thoughts are known as they arise as they are present as they disappearThat is what the venerable Ananda saidThe Teacher approvedfor the Blessed One rose from meditation when it was evening went to the assembly hall and sat down on a seat made readyWhen this was said venerable sir the venerable Ananda said to us Friends Tathagatas are wonderful and have wonderful qualities Tathagatas are marvellous and have marvellous qualitiesThis was our discussion venerable sir that was interrupted when the Blessed One arrivedThis too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed Onethen a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods appeared in the world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas in this generation with its recluses and brahmins with its princes and its peopleAnd even in those abysmal world interspaces of vacancy gloom and utter darkness where the moon and the sun mighty and powerful as they are cannot make their light prevail  there too a great

they disappear thoughts are known as they arise as they are present as they disappearRemember this too Ananda as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Tathagata this too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed OneThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the venerable Anandas wordsTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThere he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus Venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said this Bhikkhus a bhikkhu who is an inquirer not knowing how to gauge anothers mind should make an investigation of the Tathagata in order to find out whether or not he is fully enlightenedVenerable sir our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One guided by the Blessed One have the Blessed One as their resort It would be good if the Blessed One would explain the meaning of these words Having heard it from the Blessed One the bhikkhus will remember itThen listen bhikkhus and attend closely to what I shall sayYes venerable sir the bhikkhus repliedThe Blessed One said thisBhikkhus a bhikkhu who is an inquirer not knowing how to gauge anothers mind should investigate the Tathagata with respect to two kinds of states states cognizable through the eye and through the ear thus Are there found in the Tathagata or not any defiled states cognizable through the eye or through the earWhen he investigates him he comes to know No defiled states cognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the TathagataWhen he comes to know this he investigates him further thus Are there found in the Tathagata or not any mixed states cognizable through the eye or through the ear When he investigates him he comes to know No mixed states cognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the TathagataWhen he comes to know this he investigates him further thus Are there found in the Tathagata or not cleansed states cognizable through the eye or through the ear When he investigates him he comes to know Cleansed states cognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the TathagataWhen he comes to know this he investigates him further thus Has this venerable one attained this wholesome state over a long time or did he attain it recently When he investigates him he comes to know This venerable one has attained this wholesome state over a long time he did not attain it only recentlyWhen he comes to know this he investigates him further thus Has this venerable one acquired renown and attained fame so that the dangers connected with renown and fame are found in himWhen he comes to know this he investigates him further thus Is this venerable one restrained without fear not restrained by fear and does he avoid indulging in sensual pleasures because he is without lust through the destruction of lust When he investigates him he comes to know This venerable one is restrained without fear not restrained by fear and he avoids indulging in sensual pleasure because he is without lust through the destruction of lustNow bhikkhus if others should ask that bhikkhu thus What are the venerable ones reasons and what is his evidence whereby he says That venerable one is restrained without fear not restrained by fear and he avoids indulging in sensual pleasures because he is without lust through the destruction of lust  answering rightly that bhikkhu would answer thus Whether that venerable one dwells in the Sangha or alone while some there are wellbehaved and some are illbehavedand some there teach a group while some here are seen concerned about material things and some are unsullied by material things still that venerable one does not despise anyone because of thatThe Tathagata bhikkhus should be questioned further about that thus Are there found in the Tathagata or not any defiled states cognizable through the eye or through the ear The Tathagata would answer thus No defiled states cognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the TathagataIf asked Are there found in the Tathagata or not any mixed states cognizable through the eye or through the earthe Tathagata would answer thus No mixed states cognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the TathagataIf asked Are there found in the Tathagata or not cleansed states cognizable through the eye or through the earthe Tathagata would answer thus Cleansed states cognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the Tathagata They are my pathway and my domain yet I do not identify with themBhikkhus a disciple should approach the Teacher who speaks thus in order to hear the DhammaThe Teacher teaches him the Dhamma with its higher and higher levels with its more and more sublime levels with its dark and bright counterpartsNow if others should ask that bhikkhu thus What are the venerable ones reasons and what is his evidence whereby he says The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha is practising the good way answering rightly that bhikkhu would answer thus Here friends I approached the Blessed One in order to hear the DhammaThe Blessed One taught me the Dhamma with its higher and higher levels with its more and more sublime levels with its dark and bright counterpartsAs the Blessed One taught the Dhamma to me in this way through direct knowledge of a certain teaching here in that Dhamma I came to a conclusion about the teachings I placed confidence in the Teacher thus The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha is practising the good wayBhikkhus when anyones faith has been planted rooted and established in the Tathagata through these reasons terms and phrases his faith is said to be supported by reasons rooted in vision firm it is invincible by any recluse or brahmin or god or Mara or Brahma or by anyone in the worldThat is how bhikkhus there is an investigation of the Tathagata in accordance with the DhammaThat is what the Blessed One saidFor bhikkhus as long as a bhikkhu has not acquired renown and attained fame the dangers connected with renown and fame are not found in himbut when he has acquired renown and attained fame those dangers are found in himWhen he investigates him he comes to know This venerable one has acquired renown and attained fame but the dangers connected with renown and fame are not found in himAnd I have heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own leeps I am restrained without fear not restrained by fear and I avoid indulging in sensual pleasures because I am without lust through the destruction of lustAs the Teacher teaches the Dhamma to a bhikkhu in this way through direct knowledge of a certain teaching here in that Dhamma the bhikkhu comes to a conclusion about the teachings He places confidence in the Teacher thus The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha is practising the good wayand that is how the Tathagata is well investigated in accordance with the DhammaThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsOn one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in

our guest and as our guest should be honoured respected revered and venerated by us Since this is so sirs it is not proper for Master Gotama to come to see me rather it is proper for me to go to see Master Gotama Sirs this much is the praise of Master Gotama that I have learned but the praise of Master Gotama is not limited to that for the praise of Master Gotama is immeasurable Then the brahmin Canki together with a large company of brahmins went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side Now on that occasion the Blessed One was seated finishing some amiable talk with some very senior brahmins At the time sitting in the assembly was a brahmin student named Kapathika  Young shavenheaded sixteen years old he was a master of the Three Yedas with their vocabularies liturgy phonology and etymology and the histories as a fifth skilled in philology and grammar he was fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man Then the Blessed One rebuked the brahmin student Kapathika thus Let not the venerable Bharadvaja break in and interrupt the talk of the very senior brahmins while they are conversing Let the venerable Bharadvaja wait until the talk is finished When this was said the brahmin Canki said to the Blessed One Let not Master Gotama rebuke the brahmin student Kapathika The brahmin student Kapathika is a clansman he is very learned he has a good delivery he is wise he is capable of taking part in this discussion with Master Gotama Then the Blessed One thought Surely since the brahmins honour him thus the brahmin student Kapathika must be accomplished in the scriptures of the Three Vedas Then the brahmin student Kapathika thought When the recluse Gotama catches my eye I shall ask him a question Then knowing with his own mind the thought in the brahmin student Kapathikas mind the Blessed One turned his eye towards him Then the brahmin student Kapathika thought The recluse Gotama has turned towards me Suppose I ask him a question Then he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama in regard to the ancient brahmanic hymns that have come down through oral transmission and in the scriptural collections the brahmins come to the definite conclusion Only this is true anything else is wrong What does Master Gotama say about this  How then Bharadvaja among the brahmins is there even a single brahmin who says thus I know this I see this only this is true  No Master Gotama How then Bharadvaja among the brahmins is there even a single teacher or a single teachers teacher back to the seventh generation of teachers who says thus I know this I see this only this is true  No Master Gotama How then Bharadvaja the ancient brahmin seers the creators of the hymns the composers of the hymns whose ancient hymns that were formerly chanted uttered and compiled the brahmins nowadays still chant and repeat repeating what was spoken and reciting what was recited  that is Atthaka Vamaka Vamadeva Vessamitta Yamataggi Angirasa Bharadvaja Vasettha Kassapa and Bhagu  did even these ancient brahmin seers say thus We know this we see this only this is true  No Master Gotama So Bharadvaja it seems that among the brahmins there is not even a single brahmin who says thus I know this I see this only this is true anything else is wrong And among the brahmins there is not even a single teacher or a single teachers teacher back to the seventh generation of teachers who says thus I know this I see this only this is true anything else is wrong And the ancient brahmin seers the creators of the hymns the composers of the hymnseven these ancient brahmin seers did not say thus We know this we see this only this is true anything else is wrong Suppose there were a file of blind men each in touch with the next the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not see  So too Bharadvaja in regard to their statement the brahmins seem to be like a file of blind men the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not see What do you think Bharadvaja that being so does not the faith of the brahmins turn out to be groundless  The brahmins honour this not only out of faith Master Gotama  They also honour it as oral tradition Bharadvaja first you took your stand on faith now you speak of oral tradition There are five things Bharadvaja that may turn out in two different ways here and nowFaith approval oral tradition reasoned cogitation and reflective acceptance of a view These five things may turn out in two different ways here and now Now something may be fully accepted out of faith yet it may be empty hollow and false but something else may not be fully accepted out of faith yet it may be factual true and unmistaken Again something may be fully approved ofmay be well cogitatedmay be well reflected upon yet it may be empty hollow and false but something else may not be well reflected upon yet it may be factual true and unmistaken Under these conditions it is not proper for a wise man who preserves truth to come to the definite conclusion Only this is true anything else is wrong But Master Gotama in what way is there the preservation of truth  How does one preserve truth We ask Master Gotama about the preservation of truth If a person has faith Bharadvaja he preserves truth when he says My faith is thus but he does not yet come to the definite conclusion Only this is true anything else is wrong In this way Bharadvaja there is the preservation of truth in this way he preserves truth in this way we describe the preservation of truth  But as yet there is no discovery of truth If a person approves of something if he receives an oral tradition if he reaches a conclusion based on reasoned cogitation if he gams a reflective acceptance of a view he preserves truth when he says My reflective acceptance of a view is thus but he does not yet come to the definite conclusion Only this is true anything else is wrong In this way too Bharadvaja there is the preservation of truth in this way he preserves truth in this way we describe the preservation of truth  But as yet there is no discovery of truth In that way Master Gotama there is the preservation of truth in that way one preserves truth in that way we recognise the preservation of truth But in what way Master Gotama is there the discovery of truth  In what way does one discover truth We ask Master Gotama about the discovery of truth Here Bharadvaja a bhikkhu may be living in dependence on some village or townAnd the Dhamma that this venerable one teaches is profound hard to see and hard to understand peaceful and sublime unattainable by mere reasoning subtle to be experienced by the wise This Dhamma cannot easily be taught by one affected by greed When he has investigated him and has seen that he is purified from states based on greed he next investigates him in regard to states based on hate As he investigates him he comes to know There are no such states based on hate in this venerable one The bodily behaviour and the verbal behaviour of this venerable one are not those of one affected by hate And the Dhamma that this venerable one teaches is profound to be experienced by the wise  This Dhamma cannot easily be taught by one affected by hate When he has investigated him and has seen that he is purified from states based on hate he next investigates him in regard to states based on delusion As he investigates him he comes to know There are no such states based on delusion in this venerable one The bodily behaviour and the verbal behaviour of this venerable one are not those of one affected by delusion And the Dhamma that this venerable one teaches is profoundto be experienced by the wise  This Dhamma cannot easily be taught by one affected by delusion When he has investigated him and has seen that he is purified from states based on delusion then he places faith in him filled with faith he visits him and pays respect to him having paid respect to him he gives ear when he gives ear he hears the Dhamma having heard the Dhamma he memorises it and examines the meaning of the teachings he has memorised when he examines their meaning he gains a reflective acceptance of those teachings when he has gained a reflective acceptance of those teachings zeal springs up when zeal has sprung up he applies his will having applied his will he scrutinises having scrutinised he strives resolutely striving he realises with the body the ultimate truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdomIn this way Bharadvaja there is the discovery of truth in this way one discovers truth in this way we describe the discovery of truth  But as yet there is no final arrival at truth In that way Master Gotama there is the discovery of truth in that way one discovers truth in that way we recognise the discovery of truth But in what way Master Gotama is there the final arrival at truth  In what way does one finally arrive at truth We ask Master Gotama about the final arrival at truth The final arrival at truth Bharadvaja lies in the repetition development and cultivation of those same things In this way Bharadvaja there is the final arrival at truth in this way one finally arrives at truth in this way we describe the final arrivalat truth In that way Master Gotama there is the final arrival at truth in that way one finally arrives at truth in that way we recognise the final arrival at truth But what Master Gotama is most helpful for the final arrival at truth We ask Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for the final arrival at truth Striving is most helpful for the final arrival at truth Bharadvaja If one does not strive one will not finally arrive at truthbut because one strives one does finally arrive at truth But what Master Gotama is most helpful for striving We ask Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for striving Scrutiny is most helpful for striving Bharadvaja If one does not scrutinise one will not striveThat is why scrutiny is most helpful for striving But what Master Gotama is most helpful for scrutiny We ask Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for scrutiny Application of the will is most helpful for scrutiny Bharadvaja If one does not apply ones will one will not scrutiniseThat is why application of the will is most helpful for scrutiny But what Master Gotama is most helpful for application of the will We ask the Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for application of the will Zeal is most helpful for application of the will Bharadvaja If one does not arouse zeal one will not apply ones willThat is why zeal is most helpful for application of the will But what Master Gotama is most helpful for zeal We ask Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for zeal A reflective acceptance of the teachings is most helpful for zeal Bharadvaja If one does not gain a reflective acceptance of the teachings zeal will not spring upThat is why a reflective acceptance of the teachings is most helpful for zeal But what Master Gotama is most helpful for a reflective acceptance of the teachings We ask Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for a reflective acceptance of the teachings Examination of the meaning is most helpful for a reflective acceptance of the teachings Bharadvaja If one does not examine their meaning one will not gain a reflective acceptance of the teachingsThat is why examination of the meaning is most helpful for a reflective acceptance of the teachings But what Master Gotama is most helpful for examination of the meaning We ask Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for examination of meaning Memorising the teachings is most helpful for examining the meaning Bharadvaja If one does not memorise a teaching one will not examine its meaningBut what Master Gotama is most helpful for memorising the teachings We ask Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for memorising the teachings Hearing the Dhamma is most helpful for memorising the teachings Bharadvaja If one does not hear the Dhamma one will not memorise the teachingsThat is why hearing the Dhamma is most helpful for memorising the teachings But what Master Gotama is most helpful for hearing the Dhamma We ask Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for hearing the Dhamma Giving ear is most helpful for hearing the Dhamma Bharadvaja If one does not give ear one will not hear the DhammaThat is why giving ear is most helpful for hearing the Dhamma But what Master Gotama is most helpful for giving ear We ask Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for giving ear Paying respect is most helpful for giving ear Bharadvaja If one does not pay respect one will not give earThat is why paying respect is most helpful for giving ear But what Master Gotama is most helpful for paying respect We ask Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for paying respect Visiting is most helpful for paying respect Bharadvaja If one does not visit a teacher one will not pay respect to himThat is why visiting is most helpful for paying respect But what Master Gotama is most helpful for visiting We ask Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for visiting Faith is most helpful for visiting Bharadvaja If faith in a teacher does not arise one will not visit himThat is why faith is most helpful for visiting We asked Master Gotama about the preservation of truth and Master Gotama answered about the preservation of truth we approve of and accept that answer and so we are satisfied We asked Master Gotama about the discovery of truth and Master Gotama answered about the discovery of truth we approve of and accept that answer and so we are satisfied We asked Master Gotama about the final arrival at truth and Master Gotama answered about the final arrival at truth we approve of and accept that answer and so we are satisfied We asked Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for the final arrival at truth and Master Gotama answered about the thing most helpful for the final arrival at truth we approve of and accept that answer and so we are satisfied Whatever we asked Master Gotama about that he has answered us we approve of and accept that answer and so we are satisfied Formerly Master Gotama we used to think Who are these baldpated recluses these swarthy menial offspring of the Kinsmans feet that they would understand the Dhamma  But Master Gotama has indeed inspired in me love for recluses confidence in recluses reverence for recluses Magnificent Master Gotama  Magnificent Master Gotama  From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life Now it is good see such arahants They are going to see that Master Gotama Since Master Gotama possesses each one of these factors it is not proper for him to come to see me rather it is proper for me to go to see Master Gotama Therefore sirs let all of us go to see the recluse Gotama and guests should be honoured respected revered and venerated by us While the very senior brahmins were conversing with the Blessed One he often broke in and interrupted their talk anything else is wrong anything else is wrong anything else is wrong What five Then a householder or a householders son goes to him and investigates him in regard to three kinds of states in regard to states based on greed in regard to states based on hate and in regard to states based on delusionAre there in this venerable one any states based on greed such that with his mind obsessed by those states while not knowing he might say I know or while not seeing he might say I see or he might urge others to act in a way that would lead to their harm and suffering for a long time  As he investigates him he comes to know There are no such states based on greed in this venerable one  The bodily behaviour and the verbal behaviour of this venerable one are not those of one affected by greed Are there in this venerable one any states based on hate such that with his mind obsessed by those stateshe might urge others to act in a way that would lead to their harm and suffering for a long time Are there in this venerable one any states based on delusion such that with his mind obsessed by those stateshe might urge others to act in a way that would lead to their harm and suffering for a long time That is why striving is most helpful for the final arrival at truth but because one scrutinises one strives but because one applies ones will one scrutinises but because one arouses zeal one applies ones will but because one gains a reflective acceptance of the teachings zeal springs up but because one examines their meaning one gains a reflective acceptance of the teachings but because one memorises a teaching one examines its meaning but because one hears the Dhamma one memorises the teachings but because one gives ear one hears the Dhamma but because one pays respect one gives ear but because one visits a teacher one pays respect to him but because faith in a teacher arises one visits him  So venerable sir I ask the Exalted One The meaning is Just as one cannot obtain oil by grinding sand so I did not obtain anything essential from the doctrines of the six sectarian religious teachers Thus I ask the Exalted One Let me then shave off my hair and beard He shows the thought behind the slaves eagerness to go forth to be as follows If I were to practice giving in my whole life I would not be able to give even a hundredth part of what the king gives in a single day Therefore I will go forthContent with the simplest food and shelter Having abandoned improper ways of seeking  he is content through the highest effacementDelighting in solitude He delights in the three kinds of solitude stated thus There is bodily solitude for those dwelling in physical solitude there is mental solitude for those delighting in renunciation for those who attain to the highest cleansing and there is ultimate solitude for those persons free from the acquisitions for those who have gone beyond formations  One person dwells alone in body having abandoned the company of a group One dwells alone by way of the eight meditative attainments having abandoned the company of the mental defilements And one dwells alone having attained Nibbna having entered the attainment of fruition or the attainment of cessation Listen great king and attend carefully Here the word listen is an injunction to ward off distraction in the earfacultyThe former is for preventing a distorted grasp of the phrasing the latter for preventing a distorted grasp of the meaningWhen a Tathgata arises in the world of beings he does not arise in the world of the gods or in the Brahmaworld but only in the human worldHe does not arise in other worldsystems within the human world but only in this oneand here too not everywhereBy the phrase  its Mras the gods of the sixth sensesphere heaven are includedBy the phrase  its Brahms the Brahms such as those of Brahms retinue etc are includedThe phrase with its recluses and brahmins includes both those recluses and brahmins who are hostile and opposed to the Buddhas dispensation and those who have truly stilled and expelled evilThe phrase this generation includes the world of sentient beingsThus by the first three phrases here the world of beings along with the physical world is includedAnother method By mentioning with its gods the gods of the immaterial world are includedFurther by the phrase with its gods the Buddha speaks of his realization of the entire world delimiting it by the highest plane for among the five destinations the planes included in the destination of the gods are best among these the immaterial planes are very excellent due to their special qualities such as the removal of the suffering of the defilements their endowment with peaceful sublime and imperturbable dwellings and their extremely long lifespanBut some might think Mra is very powerfulhe is the ruler and master of the six sensesphere heavens What has the Buddha realized him too Dispelling their doubts he says  its MrasStill others might think Brahm is very powerful With his ten fingers he radiates light over the ten thousandfold worldsystemsand he experiences the unsurpassed bliss of the jhnic attainments What has he realized him too Dispelling their doubts he says  its BrahmsThen some think There are many recluses and brahmins opposed to the dispensation What has he realized them too Dispelling their doubts he says With its recluses and brahminsThus here is the sequence of terms stated by way of state by way of the mental inclinations of othersBut the Ancients say that the phrase with its gods indicates the rest of the world together with the godsThus with these three phrases he includes all beings found in the three planes of existence presenting them under three different aspects and with the next two phrasesthis generation with its recluses and brahmins its rulers and peoplehe again exhaustively treats the worldThus with these five phrases the three realms of existence are exhaustively presented under different aspectsHe teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning etc Out of compassion for sentient beings the Exalted One even leaves the unsurpassed happiness of solitude and teaches the DhammaAnd whether he teaches much or little the Dhamma he teaches has the quality of being good in the beginning etcAn teaching has a beginning a middle and an end and the dispensation as a whole has a beginning a middle and an endWith regard to a teaching even in a verse of four lines the first line is the beginning the two lines following it the middle and the last line the endIn a sutta with a single sequence of meaning the introduction is the beginning the phrase Thus spoke the Exalted One is the end and what comes in between these is the middleIn a sutta with several sequences of meaning the first sequence is the beginning the final sequence is the end and what comes in betweenwhether one two or manyis the middleWith regard to the dispensation moral discipline concentration and insight are the beginningFor it is said What is the starting point of wholesome statesWellpurified moral discipline and straight view And since it is said There is bhikkhus a middle way awakened to by the Tathgata  the noble path is the middleAnd the end is the fruit and NibbnaThe fruit is called the end in the following passage This is the goal of the holy life this is its essence this is its end And Nibbna is called the end in this passage Friend Viskha the holy life plunges into Nibbna Nibbna is its final resort Nibbna is its end Here the beginning middle and end intended are those of the teachingFor when the Exalted One teaches the Dhamma he teaches it showing moral discipline in the beginning the path in the middle and Nibbna in the endBut the Exalted One teaches without regard for worldly ends with a heart made gentle by the development of loving kindness suffused with the welfare of others with a mind established in delivering others ie with a mind of compassionate intention fixed in the mode of lifting others up from all defilements and from the suffering of the roundTherefore he teaches a purified DhammaHe reveals the holy life The word holy life is found with the following meanings giving service the moral discipline of the five precepts the four immeasurable states abstinence from sexual intercourse contentment with ones own marital partner energy the factors of the Uposatha observance the noble path and the entire dispensationHere it is used to mean the dispensationThus the passage under consideration should be understood as follows He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning etc  fully complete and purifiedBecause they are humble and because they are predominantGenerally when those from noble families go forth they become conceited because of their birthWhen those from brahmin families go forth they become conceited because of their knowledge of the mantrasWhen those from lowclass families go forth they are not able to establish themselves well because of their low birthBut householders boys who plough the earth with sweat flowing from their armpits and backs glistening with perspiration lack such conceit thus they are humble and free from prideWhen they go forth they do not become proud and conceited rather to the best of their ability they learn the entire word of the Buddha do the work of insight and establish themselves in arahatshipAnd those who renounce and go forth from other families are not numerous whereas those from householder families areThus because they are humble and because they are predominant householders are mentioned firstThe household life is crowded a path of dust Even if a couple husband and wife live in a house sixty cubits on an estate of a hundred yojanas household life is still crowded in the sense that it involves obstacles such as lust etc and impediments such as fields land etcIt is a path of dust that is a path for the arising of the dust of lust etc Going forth is like the open air It is like the open air in the sense of being unhinderedFor even if one gone forth is living in a gabled cottage a jewel ornamented mansion or a celestial palace etc with closed doors and windows covered by a roof he is unhindered unattached unboundGoing forth is like the open air in that it gives opportunity for wholesome activity as much as one pleasesThe perfectly complete perfectly purified holy life The holy life of the threefold training is perfectly complete because it is to be accomplished up to the last moment of consciousness making it unbroken even for a single day It is perfectly purified because it is to be accomplished up to the last moment of consciousness making it untainted by the taint of defilements even for a single day He comes to be endowed with wholesome bodily and verbal action his livelihood is purified When proper behavior and resort are mentioned wholesome bodily and verbal action are included However the moral discipline of purified livelihood does not arise in space or among the treetops but in the doors of body and speech Therefore in order to show the doors where it arises it is said He comes to be endowed with wholesome bodily and verbal actionAnd since he is endowed with that his livelihood is purifiedthe words attend carefully are an injunction to strengthen attention to ward off distraction in the mindfacultyBy the former he enjoins one to listen to the Dhamma by the latter to retain in mind the Dhamma that has been heard to examine it etcBy the former he shows This Dhamma possesses phrasing  therefore it should be heardBy the latter he shows It possesses meaning  therefore it should be carefully attended toOr else the word carefully can be construed with both words thus Since this Dhamma is deep in doctrine and deep in teaching listen carefully Since it is deep in meaning and deep in penetration attend to it carefullyHerein great king a tathgata arises in the world There are three kinds of world the physical world the world of sentient beings and the world of formationshere the world of sentient beings is intendedNot only Tathgatas but paccekabuddhas chief disciples the eighty great elders the mothers and fathers of Buddhas worldruling monarchs and other prominent brahmins and householders arise only hereFrom the time the Tathgata was offered the meal of honey and milkrice by Sujt up to the time he reached the path of arahatship he is said to have been arising With the attainment of the fruit of arahatship he is said to have arisenOr alternatively from the time of his great renunciationThis world with its gods etc Therein by the phrase with its gods the gods of the lower five sensesphere heavens are includedor from the time the Tusita heavenor from the time at the feet of the Buddha Dpakara up to the time he reached the path of arahatship he is said to have been arising and with the attainment of the fruit of arahatship he is said to have arisenHere the word arises signifies the state of having arisen explained in the first caseThus the meaning is A Tathgata has arisen in the world but only in the middle region and the phrase with its rulers and people includes conventional gods and the rest of humanityby the word generation with its two qualifying phrases the world of beings only is includedby mentioning  its Mras the gods of the six sensesphere heavenly worlds are includedby mentioning  its Brahms the gods of the finematerial Brahmaworld are includedby mentioning  with its recluses and brahmins etc the human world with its conventional gods and its four social orders or all the rest of the world of beings is includedThus having revealed his realization of the most excellent states with the phrases with its rulers and its people he reveals his realization of the rest of the world of beings delimiting it by way of its most excellent members with the reference to conventional gods and the rest of humanity its Mras the rest of the world together with Mraand  its Brahms the rest of the world together with BrahmHaving realized by his own direct knowledge By this phrase inferential knowledge etc are rejectedHe teaches making it good lovely faultless in the beginning in the middle and in the endThus it is said He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the endTherefore other preachers of the Dhamma also explain the Dhamma in this wayPossessing meaning and phrasing  One whose teaching is concerned with explanations of food men women etc does not teach in a way possessing meaningBut the Exalted One having abandoned such kinds of teaching presents a teaching concerned with the four foundations of mindfulness etcTherefore he teaches the Dhamma possessing meaningOne whose teaching lacks the complete variety of phrases or who confuses the various kinds of sounds is said to have a teaching that is without phrasing But the Exalted One teaches the Dhamma making it complete in phrasing without slurring together any of the distinct kinds of soundTherefore he teaches the Dhamma possessing phrasingFully complete and purified It is fully complete because there is nothing deficient in it and nothing excessive nothing to add or to removeit is purified because it is without corruptionIn the case of one who teaches his doctrine with the intention of obtaining honor and gain the teaching is impureAnd teaching it thus he reveals the holy life the entire dispensation comprised in the threefold training  A householder or a householders son Why does he mention householders firstFurther household life is crowded because it gives little opportunity for wholesome activityand it is a path of dust because like an unchecked dustheap it is a place where dust collects ie the dust of the defilementsTHUS HAVE I HEARDOn one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Sakyan country at Samagama Now on that occasion the Nigantha Nataputta had just died at PavaHow could you understand this Dhamma and DisciplineYour way is wrong My way is rightI am consistent You are inconsistentWhat should have been said first you said last What should have been said last you said firstWhat you had so carefully thought up has been turned inside outYour assertion has been shown upYou are refuted Go and learn better or disentangle yourself if you can It seemed as if there were nothing but slaughter among the Nigantha Nataputtas pupilsAnd his whiteclothed lay disciples were disgusted dismayed and disappointed with the Nigantha Nataputtas pupils as they were with his badly proclaimed and badly expounded Dhamma and Discipline which was unemancipating unconducive to peace expounded by one not fully enlightened and was now with its shrine broken leftwithout a refugeThen the novice Cunda who had spent the Rains at Pava went to the venerable Ananda and after paying homage to him he sat down at one side and told him what was taking placeThe venerable Ananda then said to the novice Cunda Friend Cunda this is news that should be told to the Blessed OneCome let us approach the Blessed One and tell him thisYes venerable sir the novice Cunda repliedThen the venerable Ananda and the novice Cunda went together to the Blessed OneAfter paying homage to him they sat down at one sideOn his death the Niganthas divided split into twoand is now with its shrine broken left without a refugeI thought venerable sir Let no dispute arise in the Sangha when the Blessed One has gone For such a dispute would be for the harm and unhappiness of many for the loss harm and suffering of gods and humansWhat do you think Ananda These things that I have taught you after directly knowing them  that is the four foundations of mindfulness the four right kinds of striving the four bases for spiritual power the five faculties the five powers the seven enlightenment factors the Noble Eightfold Path  do you see Ananda even two bhikkhus who make differing assertions about these thingsNo venerable sir I do not see even two bhikkhus who make differing assertions about these thingsBut venerable sir there are people who live deferential towards the Blessed One who might when he has gone create a dispute in the Sangha aboutlivelihood and about the PatimokkhaSuch a dispute would be for the harm and unhappiness of many for the loss harm and suffering of gods and humansBut should a dispute arise in the Sangha about the path or the way such a dispute would be for the harm and unhappiness of many for the loss harm and suffering of gods and humansHere Ananda a bhikkhu is angry and revengefulSuch a bhikkhu dwells disrespectful and undeferential towards the Teacher towards the Dhamma and towards the Sangha and he does not fulfil the trainingA bhikkhu who dwells disrespectful and undeferential towards the Teacher towards the Dhamma and towards the Sangha and who does not fulfil the training creates a dispute in the Sangha which would be for the harm and unhappiness of many for the loss harm and suffering of gods and humansNow if you see any such root of dispute either in yourselves or externally you should strive to abandon that same evil root of disputeAnd if you do not see any such root of dispute either in yourselves or externally you should practise in such a way that that same evil root of dispute does not erupt in the futureThus there is the abandoning of that evil root of disputeAgain a bhikkhu is contemptuous and domineering envious and avaricious deceitful and fraudulent has evil wishes and wrong view adheres to his own views holds on to them tenaciously and relinquishes them with difficultySuch a bhikkhu dwells disrespectful and undeferential towards the Teacher towards the Dhamma and towards the Sangha and he does not fulfil the trainingA bhikkhu who dwells disrespectful and undeferential towards the Teacher towards the Dhamma and towards the Sangha and who does not fulfil the training creates a dispute in the Sangha which would be for the harm and unhappiness of many for the loss harm and suffering of gods and humansNow if you see any such root of dispute either in yourselves or externally you should strive to abandon that same evil root of disputeAnd if you do not see any such root of dispute either in yourselves or externally you should practise in such a way that that same evil root of dispute does not erupt in the futureThus there is the abandoning of that evil root of dispute thus there is the noneruption of that evil root of dispute in the futureThese are the six roots of disputeAnanda there are these four kinds of litigationWhat fourLitigation because of a dispute litigation because of an accusation litigation because of an offence and litigation concerning proceedingsThese are the four kinds of litigationAnd how is there removal of litigation by confrontationHere bhikkhus are disputing It is Dhamma or It is not Dhamma or It is Discipline or It is not DisciplineThose bhikkhus should all meet together in concordThen having met together the guideline of the Dhamma should be drawn outOnce the guideline of the Dhamma has been drawn out that litigation should be settled in a way that accords with itSuch is the removal of litigation by confrontationAnd so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by removal of litigation by confrontationAnd how is there the opinion of a majorityIf those bhikkhus cannot settle that litigation in that dwelling place they should go to a dwelling place where there is a greater number of bhikkhusThere they should all meet together in concordThen having met together the guideline of the Dhamma should be drawn outOnce the guideline of the Dhamma has been drawn out that litigation should be settled in a way that accords with itSuch is the opinion of a majorityAnd so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by the opinion of a majorityAnd how is there removal of litigation on account of memoryHere one bhikkhu reproves another bhikkhu for such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat Does the venerable one remember having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeatHe says I do not friends remember having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeatIn his case removal of litigation on account of memory should be pronouncedSuch is the removal of litigation on account of memory And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by removal of litigation on account of memoryAnd how is there removal of litigation on account of past insanityHere one bhikkhu reproves another bhikkhu for such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat Does the venerable one remember having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat  He says I do not friends remember having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeatDespite the denial the former presses the latter further Surely the venerable one must know quite well if he remembers having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat He says I had gone mad friend I was out of my mind and when I was mad I said and did many things improper for a recluse I do not remember I was mad when I did thatIn his case removal of litigation on account of past insanity should be pronouncedSuch is the removal of litigation on account of past insanityAnd so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by removal of litigation on account of past insanityAnd how is there the effecting of acknowledgement of an offenceHere a bhikkhu whether reproved or unreproved remembers an offence reveals it and discloses itHe should go to a senior bhikkhu and after arranging his robe on one shoulder he should pay homage at his feet Then sitting on his heels he should raise his hands palms together and say Venerable sir I have committed such and such an offence I confess itThe other says Do you see  Yes I see Will you practise restraint in the future   I will practise restraint in the futureSuch is the effecting of acknowledgement of an offence And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by the effecting of acknowledgement of an offenceAnd how is there the pronouncement of bad character against someoneHere one bhikkhu reproves another for such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat Does the venerable one remember having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeatHe says I do not friends remember having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeatDespite the denial the former presses the latter further Surely the venerable one must know quite well if he remembers having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat He says I do not friends remember having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat But friends I remember having committed such and such a minor offenceDespite the denial the former presses the latter further Surely the venerable one must know quite well if he remembers having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeatHe says Friends when not asked I acknowledge having committed this minor offenceThe other says Friend if you had not been asked you would not have acknowledged committing this minor offence so why when asked would you acknowledge having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat Surely the venerable one must know quite well if he remembers having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeatHe says I remember friends having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeatI was hurried I was confused when I said that I did not remember having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeatSuch is the pronouncement of bad character against someone And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by the pronouncement of bad character against someoneAnd how is there covering over with grassHere when bhikkhus have taken to quarreling and brawling and are deep in disputes they may have said and done many things improper for a recluseThose bhikkhus should all meet together in concordWhen they have met together a wise bhikkhu among the bhikkhus who side together on the one part should rise from his seat and after arranging his robe on one shoulder he should raise his hands palms together and call for an enactment of theSangha thus Let the venerable Sangha hear meWhen we took to quarreling and brawling and were deep in disputes we said and did many things improper for a recluseIf it is approved by the Sangha then for the good of these venerable ones and for my own good in the midst of the Sangha I shall confess by the method of covering over with grass any offences of these venerable ones and any offences of my own except for those which call for serious censure and those connected with the laityThen a wise bhikkhu among the bhikkhus who side together on the other part should rise from his seat and after arranging his robe on one shoulder he should raise his hands palms together and call for an enactment of the Sangha thusWhen we took to quarreling and brawling and were deep in disputes we said and did many things improper for a recluseIf it is approved by the Sangha then for the good of these venerable ones and for my own good in the midst of the Sangha I shall confess by the method of covering over with grass any offences of these venerable ones and any offences of my own except for those which call for serious censure and those connected with the laitySuch is the covering over with grass And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by the covering over with grassHere a bhikkhu maintains bodily acts of lovingkindness both in public

qualities that create love and respect and conduce to helpfulness to nondispute to concord and to unityWhat are the sixThe venerable Ananda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthl in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkNow at that time five hundred brahmins from diverse provinces were staying at Savatthl for some business or otherNow on that occasion a brahmin student named Assalayana was staying at Savatthl Young shavenheaded sixteen years old he was a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies liturgy phonology and etymology and the histories as a fifth skilled in philology and grammar he was fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great ManThen the brahmins thought There is this young brahmin student named Assalayana staying at Savatthl Youngfully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great ManHe will be able to dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertionSo the brahmins went to the brahmin student Assalayana and said to him Master Assalayana this recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castesLet Master Assalayana come and dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertionWhen this was said the brahmin student Assalayana replied Sirs the recluse Gotama is one who speaks the Dhamma Now those who speak the Dhamma are difficult to dispute withI am not able to dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertionA second time the brahmins said to him Master Assalayana this recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castesLet Master Assalayana come and dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertionFor the training of a wanderer has been completed by Master AssalayanaFor the second time the brahmin student Assalayana replied Sirs the recluse Gotama is one who speaks the Dhamma Now those who speak the Dhamma are difficult to dispute withI am not able to dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertionA third time the brahmins said to him Master Assalayana this recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castesLet Master Assalayana come and dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertionFor the training of a wanderer has been completed by Master AssalayanaLet not the Master Assalayana be defeated without having even fought the battleWhen this was said the brahmin student Assalayana repliedSirs the recluse Gotama is one who speaks the Dhamma Now those who speak the Dhamma are difficult to dispute withI am not able to dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertionStill sirs at your bidding I will goThen the brahmin student Assalayana went with a large number of brahmins to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideWhat does Master Gotama say about thatNow Assalayana the brahmin women are seen having their periods becoming pregnant giving birth and giving suckAnd yet those who are born from the wombs of the brahmin women say thus Brahmins are the highest castebrahmins alone are the sons of Brahma the offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of BrahmaAlthough Master Gotama says this still the brahmins think thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of BrahmaWhat do you think Assalayana Have you heard that in Yona and Kamboja and in other outland countries there are only two castes masters and slaves and that masters become slaves and slaves masters So I have heard sirThen on the strength of what argument or with the support of what authority do the brahmins in this case say thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma Although Master Gotama says this still the brahmins think thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of BrahmaWhat do you think Assalayana Suppose a noble were to kill living beings take what is not given misconduct himself in sensual pleasures speak falsely speak maliciously speak harshly gossip be covetous have a mind of ill will and hold wrong view On the dissolution of the body after death would only he be likely to reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell  and not a brahminSuppose a merchanta worker were to kill living beingsand hold wrong view On the dissolution of the body after death would only he be likely to reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell  and not a brahmin No Master GotamaWhether it be a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a worker  those of all four castes who kill living beingsand hold wrong view on the dissolution of the body after death are likely to reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hellThen on the strength of what argument or with the support of what authority do the brahmins in this case say thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma Although Master Gotama says this still the brahmins think thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of BrahmaWhat do you think Assalayana Suppose a brahmin were to abstain from killing living beings from taking what is not given from misconduct in sensual pleasures from false speech from malicious speech from harsh speech and from gossip and were to be uncovetous to have a mind without ill will and to hold right view On the dissolution of the body after death would only he be likely to reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world  and not a noble or a merchant or a worker No Master GotamaWhether it be a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a worker  those of all four castes who abstain from killing living beingsand hold right view on the dissolution of the body after death are likely to reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly worldThen on the strength of what argument or with the support f what authority do the brahmins in this case say thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma Although Master Gotama says this still the brahmins think thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of BrahmaWhat do you think Assalayana Is only a brahmin capable of developing a mind of lovingkindness towards a certain region without hostility and without ill will and not a noble or a merchant or a worker No Master GotamaWhether it be a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a worker  those of all four castes are capable of developing a mind of lovingkindness towards a certain region without hostility and without ill willThen on the strength of what argument or with the support of what authority do the brahmins in this case say thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma Although Master Gotama says this still the brahmins think thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of BrahmaWhat do you think Assalayana Is only a brahmin capable of taking a loofah and bath powder going to the river and washing off dust and dirt and not a noble or a merchant or a worker No Master GotamaWhether it be a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a worker  those of all four castes are capable of taking a loofah and bath powder going to the river and washing off dust and dirtThen on the strength of what argument or with the support of what authority do the brahmins in this case say thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma Although Master Gotama says this still the brahmins think thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of BrahmaWhat do you think Assalayana Suppose a headanointed noble king were to assemble here a hundred men of different birth and say to them Come sirs let any here who have been born into a noble clan or a brahmin clan or a royal clan take an upper firestick of sala wood salala wood sandalwood or padumaka wood and light a fire and produce heat And also let any who have been born into an outcast clan a trapper clan a wicker workers clan a cartwrights clan or a scavengers clan take an upper firestick made from a dogs drinking trough from a pigs trough from a dustbin or from castoroil wood and light a fire and produce heatWhat do you think Assalayana When a fire is lit and heat is produced by someone in the first group would that fire have a flame a colour and a radiance and would it be possible to use it for the purposes of fire while when a fire is lit and heat is produced by someone of the second group that fire would have no flame no colour and no radiance and it would not be possible to use it for the purposes of fire No Master GotamaWhen a fire is lit and heat is produced by someone in the first group that fire would have a flame a colour and a radiance and it would be possible to use it for the purposes of fire And when a fire is lit and heat is produced by someone of the second group that fire too would have a flame a colour and a radiance and it would be possible to use it for the purposes of fire For all fire has a flame a colour and a radiance and it is possible to use all fire for the purposes of fireThen on the strength of what argument or with the support of what authority do the brahmins in this case say thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma Although Master Gotama says this still the brahmins think thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of BrahmaWhat do you think Assalayana Suppose a noble youth were to cohabit with a brahmin girl and a son was born from their cohabitation Should a son born from a noble youth and a brahmin girl be called a noble after the father or a brahmin after the motherHe could be called both Master GotamaWhat do you think Assalayana Suppose a brahmin youth here were to cohabit with a noble girl and a son were to be born from their cohabitation Should the son born from a brahmin youth and a noble girl be called a noble after the mother or a brahmin after the father He could be called both Master GotamaWhat do you think Assalayana Suppose a mare were to be mated with a male donkey and a foal were to be born as the resultShould the foal be called a horse after the mother or a donkey after the father It is a mule Master Gotama since it does not belong to either kindI see the difference in this last case but I see no difference in either of the former casesWhat do you think Assalayana Suppose there were two brahmin students who were brothers born of the same mother one studious and acute and one neither studious nor acuteWhich of them would brahmins feed first at a funeral feast or at a ceremonial milkrice offering or at a sacrificial feast or at a feast for guests On such occasions brahmins would feed first the one who was studious and acute Master Gotama for how could what is given to one who is neither studious nor acute bring great fruit What do you think Assalayana Suppose there were two brahmin students who were brothers born of the same mother one studious and acute but immoral and of bad character and one neither studious nor acute but virtuous and of good characterWhich of them would brahmins feed first at a funeral feast or at a ceremonial milkrice offering or at a sacrificial feast or at a feast for guestsfor how could what is given to one who is immoral and of bad character bring great fruit First Assalayana you took your stand on birth and after that you took your stand on scriptural learning and after that you have come to take your stand on the very ground that purification is for all four castes as I describe itWhen this was said the brahmin student Assalayana sat silent and dismayed with shoulders drooping and head down glum and without responseKnowing this the Blessed One said to him  Once Assalayana when seven brahmin seers were dwelling in leaf huts in the forest this pernicious view arose in them Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of BrahmaThen while walking up and down the courtyard of the seven brahmin seers the seer Devala the Dark spoke thus Where have those worthy brahmin seers gone Where have those worthy brahmin seers gone Then the seven brahmin seers thought Who is walking up and down in the courtyard of the seven brahmin seers like a village lout speaking thus Where have those worthy brahmin seers gone Where have those worthy brahmin seers gone Let us curse him Then the seven brahmin seers cursed the seer Devala the Dark thus Be ashes vile one Be ashes vile one But the more the seven brahmin seers cursed him the more comely beautiful and handsome the seer Devala the Dark becameThen the seven brahmin seers thought Our asceticism is in vain our holy life is fruitless for formerly when we cursed anyone thus Be ashes vile one Be ashes vile one he always became ashes but the more we curse this one the more comely beautiful and handsome he becomesYour asceticism is not in vain sirs your holy life is not fruitlessBut sirs put away your hatred towards meWe have put away our hatred towards you sirWho are you Have you heard of the seer Devala the Dark sirs Yes sir I am he sirsThen the seven brahmin seers went to the seer Devala the Dark and paid homage to him That is so sirBut sirs do you know if the mother who bore you went only with a brahmin and never with a nonbrahmin No sirBut sirs do you know if your mothers mothers back to the seventh generation went only with brahmins and never with nonbrahmins No sirBut sirs do you know if the father who begot you went only with a brahmin woman and never with a nonbrahmin woman No sirBut sirs do you know if your fathers fathers back to the seventh generation went only with brahmin women and never with nonbrahmin women No sirBut sirs do you know how the conception of an embryo in a womb comes aboutSir we know how the conception of an embryo in a womb comes about Here there is a union of the mother and father and it is the mothers season and the being to be reborn is presentThus the conception of an embryo in a womb comes about through the union of these three thingsThen sirs do you know for sure whether that being to be reborn is a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a worker Sir we do not know for sure whether that being to be reborn is a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a workerThat being so sirs then what are you That being so sir we do not know what we areNow Assalayana even those seven brahmin seers on being pressed and questioned and crossquestioned by the seer Devala the Dark on their own assertion about birth were unable to support it But how shall you on being pressed and questioned and crossquestioned by me now on your assertion about birth be able to support it You who rely on the teachers doctrines are not even fit to be their spoonholder PunnaWhen this was said the brahmin student Assalayana said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeThen those brahmins thought This recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castesWho is there able to dispute with him about this assertion and said to the Blessed One Master Gotama the brahmins say thus Brahmins are the highest caste those of any other caste are inferior brahmins are the fairest caste those of any other caste are dark only brahmins are purified not nonbrahmins brahmins alone are the sons of Brahma the offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of BrahmaOn such occasions brahmins would feed first the one who was neither studious nor acute but virtuous and of good character Master GotamaNow the seer Devala the Dark heard thisThen he arranged his hair and beard dressed in ochrecoloured garments put on stout sandals and taking a staff made of gold he appeared in the courtyard of the seven brahmin seersThen he said to them Sirs I heard that while the seven brahmin seers were dwelling in leaf huts in the forest this pernicious view arose in them Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma sees no danger anywhere He does not see any danger anywhere from the dangers which might arise rooted in nonrestraint Why Because due to his restraint he does not face any danger rooted in nonrestraintHe experiences within himself a blameless happiness  He experiences within himself a blameless faultless wholesome bodily and mental happiness accompanied by such phenomena as nonremorse gladness rapture and tranquillity which are based on moral discipline as their proximate cause Having seen a form with the eye The word eye is found in the texts with the following meanings the Buddha eye as it is said he surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha  the eye of Dhamma the wisdom of the lower three paths as it is said There arose in him the dustfree stainless eye of Dhamma Everything else that needs to be said concerning the other terms has been said already in the Visuddhimagga  the universal eye the knowledge of omniscience as it is said Ascend the palace of Dhamma O greatly wise one O universal eye  the wisdom eye the knowledge of past lives and the knowl edge of the destruction of the cankers as it is said The eye arose knowledge arose  the divine eye  the eye as a sense organ as it is said In dependence on the eye and forms eyeconsciousness arises Here the word eye which conventionally signifies the eye as a sense organ is used to signify eyeconsciousness Therefore the meaning of the above statement is Having seen a form with eye consciousnessHe experiences within himself an unblemished happiness  He experiences the purified happiness of the higher consciousness  which is unblemished unadulterated since it is devoid of the blemish of defilements Now as regards the virtue of restraint of faculties shown next to that in the way beginning on seeing a visible object with the eye herein he is a bhikkhu established in the virtue of Pātimokkha restraintOn seeing a visible object with the eye on seeing a visible object with the eyeconsciousness that is capable of seeing visible objects and has borrowed the name eye from its instrumentBut the Ancients said The eye does not see a visible object because it has no mind The mind does not see because it has no eyes But when there is the impingement of door and object he sees by means of the consciousness that has eyesensitivity as its physical basisNow such as this is called an accessory locution  like He shot him with his bow and so onSo the meaning here is this On seeing a visible object with eyeconsciousnessApprehends neither the signs he does not apprehend the sign of woman or man or any sign that is a basis for defilement such as the sign of beauty etc he stops at what is merely seenNor the particulars he does not apprehend any aspect classed as hand foot smile laughter talk looking ahead looking aside etc which has acquired the name particular because of its particularizing defilements because of its making them manifest themselves He only apprehends what is really there Like the Elder Mahā Tissa who dwelt at CetiyapabbataIt seems that as the elder was on his way from Cetiyapabbata to Anurādhapura for alms a certain daughterinlaw of a clan who had quarrelled with her husband and had set out early from Anurādhapura all dressed up and tricked out like a celestial nymph to go to her relatives home saw him on the road and being low minded she laughed a loud laughWondering What is that the elder looked up and finding in the bones of her teeth the perception of foulness  he reached ArahantshipHe saw the bones that were her teeth And kept in mind his first perceptionAnd standing on that very spot The elder became an ArahantBut her husband who was going after her saw the elder and asked Venerable sir did you by any chance see a woman The elder told himWhether it was a man or woman That went by I noticed notBut only that on this high road There goes a group of bonesAs to the words through which etc the meaning is by reason of which because of which nonrestraint of the eye faculty if he if that person left the eye faculty unguarded remained with the eye door unclosed by the doorpanel of mindfulness these states of covetousness etc might invade might pursue might threaten himHe enters upon the way of its restraint he enters upon the way of closing that eye faculty by the doorpanel of mindfulnessIt is the same one of whom it is said he guards the eye faculty undertakes the restraint of the eye facultyHerein there is neither restraint nor nonrestraint in the actual eye facultyOn the contrary when a visible datum as object comes into the eyes focus then after the lifecontinuum has arisen twice and ceased the functional mindelement accomplishing the function of adverting arises and ceasesAfter that eye consciousness with the function of seeingHerein there is neither restraint nor non restraint on the occasion of the lifecontinuum or on any of the occasions beginning with advertingWhy is thatBecause when this happens the door is not guarded nor are the lifecontinuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive seriesLike whatJust as when a citys four gates are not secured although inside the city house doors storehouses rooms etc are secured yet all property inside the city is unguarded and unprotectedBut when virtue etc has arisen in it then the door too is guarded and so also are the lifecontinuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series beginning with advertingLike whatJust as when the city gates are secured although inside the city the houses etc are not secured yet all property inside the city is well guarded well protectedSo also as regards the phrases on hearing a sound with the ear and so onHence it was saidsince neither mindfulness nor forgetfulness arises in dependence on eyesensitivityafter that resultant mindelement with the function of receivingafter that resultant rootcauseless mindconsciousness element with the function of investigatingafter that functional rootcauseless mindconsciousnesselement accomplishing the function of determining arises and ceases Next to that impulsion impelsBut there is nonrestraint if unvirtuousness or forgetfulness or unknowing or impatience or idleness arises at the moment of impulsionWhen this happens it is called nonrestraint in the eye facultysince robbers coming in by the city gates can do as they please so too when unvirtuousness etc arise in impulsion in which there is no restraint then the door too is unguarded and so also are the lifecontinuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series beginning with advertingsince when the city gates are shut there is no ingress for robbers so too when virtue etc have arisen in impulsion the door too is guarded and so also are the lifecontinuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series beginning with advertingThus although it actually arises at the moment of impulsion it is nevertheless called restraint in the eye facultySo it is this virtue which in brief has the characteristic of avoiding apprehension of signs entailing defilement with respect to visible objects etc that should be understood as virtue of restraint of facultiesOn seeing a visible object with the eye if the eye were to see the visible object then belonging to other kinds of consciousness would see too but that is not so WhyBecause the eye has no thought And then were consciousness itself to see a visible object it would see it even behind a wall because of being independent of sense resistance  but that is not so either because there is no seeing in all kinds of consciousnessAnd herein it is consciousness dependent on the eye that sees not just any kindAnd that does not arise with respect to what is enclosed by walls etc where light is excludedBut where there is no exclusion of light as in the case of a crystal or a mass of cloud there it does arise even with respect to what is enclosed by themSo it is as a basis of consciousness that the eye seesWhen there is the impingement of door and object what is intended is when a visible datum as object has come into the eyes focusOne sees one looks for when the consciousness that has eyesensitivity as its material support is disclosing by means of the special quality of its support a visible datum as object that is assisted by light  then it is said that a person possessed of that sees the visible datumAnd here the illuminating is the revealing of the visible datum according to its individual essence in other words the apprehending of it experientially Here it is the sign of woman because it is the cause of perceiving as woman all such things as the shape that is grasped under the heading of the visible data invariably found in a female continuity the unclearcutness of the flesh of the breasts the beardlessness of the face the use of cloth to bind the hair the unclearcut stance walk and so onThe sign of man is in the opposite senseThe sign of beauty here is the aspect of woman that is the cause for the arising of lustBy the word etc the sign of resentment  etc are includedwhich should be understood as the undesired aspect that is the cause for the arising of hateAnd here admittedly only covetousness and grief are specified in the text but the sign of equanimity needs to be included too since there is nonrestraint in the delusion that arises due to overlookingAnd here the sign of equanimity should be understood as an object that is the basis for the kind of equanimity associated with unknowing through overlooking itSo the sign of beauty etc given in brief thus is actually the cause of greed hate and delusionHe stops at what is merely seen according to the Sutta method The seen shall be merely seen  As soon as the colour basis has been apprehended by the consciousnesses of the cognitive series with eyeconsciousness he stops he does not fancy any aspect of beauty etc beyond thatIn one who fancies as beautiful etc the limbs of the opposite sex defilements arisen with respect to them successively become particularized which is why they are called particularsBut these are simply modes of interpreting the kinds of materiality derived from the primaries that are interpreted in such and such wisefor apart from that there is in the ultimate sense no such thing as a hand and so onor since forgetfulness of unknowing is said below As the elder was going along only in keeping his meditation subject in mind since noise is a thorn to those in the early stage he looked up with the noise of the laughter What is thatPerception of foulness is perception of bonesfor the elder was then making bones his meditation subjectThe elder it seems as soon as he saw her teethbones while she was laughing got the counterpart sign with access jhāna because he had developed the preliminarywork well While he stood there he reached the first jhāna Then he made that the basis for insight which he augmented until he attained the paths one after the other and reached destruction of cankersThere is no unvirtuousness in other words bodily or verbal misconduct in the five doors consequently restraint of unvirtuousness happens through the mind door and the remaining restraint happens through the six doorsFor the arising of forgetfulness and the other three would be in the five doors since they are unprofitable states opposed to mindfulness etc and there is no arising of unvirtuousness consisting in bodily and verbal transgression there because fivedoor impulsions do not give rise to intimationAnd the five kinds of nonrestraint beginning with unvirtuousness are stated here as the opposite of the five kinds of restraint beginning with restraint as virtueTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkNow on that occasion the venerable Moliya Phagguna was associating overmuch with bhikkhunisSo much was the venerable Moliya Phagguna associating with bhikkhunis He was associating so much with bhikkhunis that if any bhikkhu spoke dispraise of those bhikkhunis in his presence he would become angry and displeased and would rebuke himThen a certain bhikkhu went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one side and told the Blessed One what was taking placeThen the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus Come bhikkhu tell the bhikkhu Moliya Phagguna in my name that the Teacher calls him Yes venerable sir he replied and he went to the venerable Moliya Phagguna and told him The Teacher calls you friend Phagguna  Yes friend he repliedThe Blessed One asked himPhagguna is it true that you are associating overmuch with bhikkhunisAre you associating so much with bhikkhunis as it seems Yes venerable sir Phagguna are you not a clansman who has gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness Yes venerable sirPhagguna it is not proper for you a clansman gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness to associate overmuch with bhikkhunlsTherefore if anyone speaks dispraise of those bhikkhunls in your presence you should abandon any desires and any thoughts based on the household lifeAnd herein you should train thus My mind will be unaffected and I shall utter no evil words I shall abide compassionate for his welfare with a mind of lovingkindness without inner hateThat is how you should train PhaggunaIf anyone gives those bhikkhums a blow with his hand with a clod with a stick or with a knife in your presenceAnd herein you should train thus My mind will be unaffectedIf anyone should give you a blow with his hand with a clod with a stick or with a knife you should abandon any desires and any thoughts based on the household lifeAnd herein you should train thus My mind will be unaffected and I shall utter no evil words I shall abide compassionate for his welfare with a mind of lovingkindness without inner hateThat is how you should train PhaggunaThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus there was an occasion when the bhikkhus satisfied my mindHere I addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus I eat at a single sessionBy so doing I am free from illness and affliction and I enjoy health strength and a comfortable abidingCome bhikkhus eat at a single sessionBy so doing you will be free from illness and affliction and you will enjoy health strength and a comfortable abidingSo too I had no need to keep on instructing those bhikkhus I had only to arouse mindfulness in themTherefore bhikkhus abandon what is unwholesome and devote yourselves to wholesome statesSuppose there were a big salatree grove near a village or townand some man would appear desiring its good welfare and protectionfor that is how you will come to growth increase and fulfilment in this Dhamma and DisciplineFormerly bhikkhus in this same Savatthl there was a housewife named VedehikaAnd a good report about Mistress Vedehika had spread thus Mistress Vedehika is kind Mistress Vedehika is gentle Mistress Vedehika is peacefulNow Mistress Vedehika had a maid named Kali who was clever nimble and neat in her workThe maid Kali thought A good report about my lady has spread thus Mistress Vedehika is kind Mistress Vedehika is gentle Mistress Vedehika is peacefulHow is it now while she does not show anger is it nevertheless actually present in her or is it absent Or else is it just because my work is neat that my lady shows no anger though it is actually present in herSuppose I test my ladySo the maid Kali got up lateThe Mistress Vedehika said Hey Kali What is it madam What is the matter that you get up so late Nothing is the matter madam Nothing is the matter you wicked girl yet you get up so late and she was angry and displeased and she scowledThen the maid Kali thought The fact is that while my lady does not show anger it is actually present in her not absent and it is just because my work is neat that my lady shows no anger though it is actually present in her not absentSuppose I test my lady a little moreSo the maid Kali got up later in the dayThen Mistress Vedehika said Hey Kali What is it madam What is the matter that you get up later in the day Nothing is the matter madam Nothing is the matter you wicked girl yet you get up later in the day  and she was angry and displeased and she spoke words of displeasureThen the maid Kali thought The fact is that while my lady does not show anger it is actually present in her not absentSuppose I test my lady a little moreSo the maid Kali got up still later in the dayThen Mistress Vedehika said Hey Kali What is it madam What is the matter that you get up still later in the day Nothing is the matter madam Nothing is the matter you wicked girl yet you get up still later in the day and she was angry and displeased and she tooka rollingpin gave her a blow on the head and cut her headThen the maid Kali with blood running from her cut head denounced her mistress to the neighbours See ladies the kind ladys work See ladies the gentle ladys work See ladies the peaceful ladys workHow can she become angry and displeased with her only maid for getting up late How can she take a rollingpin give her a blow on the head and cut her headThen later on a bad report about Mistress Vedehika spread thus Mistress Vedehika is rough Mistress Vedehika is violent Mistress Vedehika is mercilessSo too bhikkhus some bhikkhu is extremely kind extremely gentle extremely peaceful so long as disagreeable courses of speech do not touch himBut it is when disagreeable courses of speech touch him that it can be understood whether that bhikkhu is really kind gentle and peacefulI do not call a bhikkhu easy to admonish who is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish only for the sake of getting robes almsfood a resting place and medicinal requisitesWhy is thatBecause that bhikkhu is not easy to admonish nor makes himself easy to admonish when he gets no robes almsfood resting place and medicinal requisitesBut when a bhikkhu is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish because he honours respects and reveres the Dhamma him I call easy to admonishTherefore bhikkhus you should train thus We shall be easy to admonish and make ourselves easy to admonish because we honour respect and revere the DhammaThat is how you should train bhikkhusBhikkhus there are these five courses of speech that others may use when they address you their speech may be timely or untimely true or untrue gentle or harsh connected with good or with harm spoken with a mind of lovingkindness or with inner hateWhen others address you their speech may be timely or untimely when others address you their speech may be true or untrue when others address you their speech may be gentle or harsh when others address you their speech may be connected with good or with harm when others address you their speech may be spoken with a mind of lovingkindness or with inner hateHerein bhikkhus you should train thus Our minds will remain unaffected and we shall utter no evil words we shall abide compassionate for their welfare with a mind of lovingkindness without inner hateWe shall abide pervading that person with a mind imbued with lovingkindness and starting with him we shall abide pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with lovingkindness abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill willThat is how you should train bhikkhusBhikkhus suppose a man came with a hoe and a basketand said I shall make this great earth to be without earthHe would dig here and there strew the soil here and there spit here and there and urinate here and there saying Be without earth be without earthWhat do you think bhikkhus Could that man make this great earth to be without earth No venerable sirWhy is thatBecause this great earth is deep and immense it cannot possibly be made to be without earthEventually the man would reap only weariness and disappointmentSo too bhikkhus there are these five courses of speech That is how you should train bhikkhusBhikkhus suppose a man came with crimson turmeric indigo or carmineand said I shall draw pictures and make pictures appear on empty spaceWhat do you think bhikkhus Could that man draw pictures and make pictures appear on empty space No venerable sirWhy is thatBecause empty space is formless and invisible he cannot possibly draw pictures there or make pictures appear thereEventually the man would reap only weariness and disappointmentSo too bhikkhus there are these five courses of speech Herein bhikkhus you should train thus Our minds will remain unaffectedand starting with him we shall abide pervading the allencompassing world with a mind similar to empty space abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill willThat is how you should train bhikkhusBhikkhus suppose a man came with a blazing grasstorch and saidWhat do you think bhikkhus Could that man heat up and burn away the river Ganges with that blazing grasstorch No venerable sirWhy is thatBecause the river Ganges is deep and immense it cannot possibly be heated up and burned away with a blazing grasstorchEventually the man would reap only weariness and disappointmentSo too bhikkhus there are these five courses of speechHerein bhikkhus you should train thus Our minds will remain unaffectedand starting with him we shall abide pervading the allencompassing world with a mind similar to the river Ganges abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill willThat is how you should train bhikkhusBhikkhus suppose there were a catskin bag that was rubbed wellrubbed thoroughly wellrubbed soft silky rid of rustling rid of cracklingWhat do you think bhikkhus Could that man make it rustle or crackle with the stick or the potsherd No venerable sirWhy is thatBecause that catskin bag being rubbedrid of rustling rid of cracklingcannot possibly be made to rustle or crackle with the stick or the potsherd Eventually the man would reap only weariness and disappointmentSo too bhikkhus there are these five courses of speech that others may use when they address you their speech may be timely or untimely true or untrue gentle or harsh connected with good or with harm spoken with a mind of lovingkindness or with inner hateWhen others address you their speech may be timely or untimely when others address you their speech may be true or untrue when others address you their speech may be gentle or harsh when others address you their speech may be connected with good or with harm when others address you their speech may be spoken with a mind of lovingkindness or with inner hateHerein bhikkhus you should train thus Our minds will remain unaffected and we shall utter no evil words we shall abide compassionate for their welfare with a mind of lovingkindness without inner hateWe shall abide pervading that person with a mind imbued with lovingkindness and starting with him we shall abide pervading the allencompassing world with a mind similar to a catskin bag abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill willThat is how you should train bhikkhusBhikkhus even if bandits were to sever you savagely limb by limb with a twohandled saw he who gave rise to a mind of hate towards them would not be carrying out my teachingHerein bhikkhus you should train thus Our minds will remain unaffected and we shall utter no evil words we shall abide compassionate for their welfare with a mind of lovingkindness without inner hateWe shall abide pervading them with a mind imbued with lovingkindness and starting with them we shall abide pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with lovingkindness abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill willThat is how you should train bhikkhusBhikkhus if you keep this advice on the simile of the saw constantly in mind No venerable sir Therefore bhikkhus you should keep this advice on the simile of the saw constantly in mindThat will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long timeThat is what the Blessed One saidand if any bhikkhu spoke dispraise of the venerable Moliya Phagguna in those bhikkhunis presence they would become angry and displeased and would rebuke himA bhikkhu endowed with this twelvefold contentment with requisites of any kind may make use of eight requisitesthree robes and almsbowl a knife for cutting toothwood a needle a waistband and a waterstrainerAll these have the purpose of protecting ones body and sustaining ones bellyHowIf when one travels about one wears the three robes one sustains and protects the body thus these are for protecting the bodyIf when drinking one first strains the water with a corner of a robe or uses a robe to accept fruits to be eaten one sustains and protects the belly thus these are for sustaining the bellyThe almsbowl is for protecting the body if one uses it to draw water when bathing or making plaster for ones hutit is for sustaining the belly when one uses it to receive food at meal timeThe knife is for protecting the body if one uses it to cut toothwood or to smoothen the legs and surface of ones bed and chair or the poles of a tentit is for sustaining the belly if one uses it to cut sugarcane or to open a coconut etcThe needle is for protecting the body when one uses it to sew robesit is for sustaining the belly if at the time of eating one uses it to pick up a piece of fruit or cakeThe waterstrainer is for protecting the body when one strains water with it at the time of bathing or making plaster for ones dwellingit is for sustaining the belly when one uses it to strain drinking water or to accept sesame seeds rice grains or honey tree fruits while eatingThis is the limit of requisites for one using eight requisitesBut for one using nine requisites when he stays in a bedroom a bedspread situated there or a key is allowedFor one using ten requisites a sitting couch or a piece of leather is allowedFor one using eleven requisites a walking stick or an oil tube is allowedFor one using twelve requisites an umbrella or a pair of sandals is allowedIt should not be said that of these bhikkhus only the one who uses eight requisites is content and that the others are not content have many desires and are difficult to supportFor they too are content have few desires are easy to support and light in their mode of livingHowever the Exalted One did not explain this discourse by way of those bhikkhus he explained it by way of the one who uses eight requisitesFor this one wraps up his small knife and needle in his water strainer puts the strainer inside his almsbowl hangs the bowl over his shoulder clothes himself in his three robes and waistband and sets out happily wherever he wishesThere is nothing at all he has to turn back for and takeThus showing such a bhikkhus light mode of living the Exalted One says A bhikkhu is content with robes to protect his body and almsfood to sustain his belly etcHe has no attachment or bondage to my monastery my cell my attendantHe is like an arrow released from the bow or like an elephant in rut which has left the herd Using whatever dwelling he likesa jungle thicket the foot of a tree a wooded slopehe stands alone and sits alonein all postures he is alone without a companionHe sets out taking only along with him He goes taking all his minimal eight requisites carrying them on his bodyAt home in the four quarters of the world harboring no aversion in ones heartcontent with anything one getsbearing all hardships undismayedone should walk alone like the rhinoceros  Thus he conducts himself in a manner similar to that of the rhinoceros as explained This in brief is the meaning Having learned that in such and such a region there is a tree with ripened fruits birds come from various directions and eat those fruits picking and tearing at them with their claws wings and beaksIt never occurs to them This is for todays meal that is for tomorrows mealWhen the fruits are finished they do not set up a guard around that tree nor do they set up a feather claw mark or beak mark thererather they lose their concern for that tree and each bird goes in whatever direction it wishes flying off with its wings as its only burdenIn the same way the bhikkhu sets out wherever he wishes without attachment and without concernHence it is said He sets out taking only along with himJust as a bird wherever it goes flies with its wings as its only burden The Buddha next demonstrates this point with the simile of the birdand he went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him sat down at one sidethat you are associating so much with bhikkhunis that if any bhikkhu speaks dispraise of those bhikkhunis in your presence you become angry and displeased and rebuke himand if any bhikkhu speaks dispraise of you in those bhikkhunis presence they become angry and displeased and rebuke himyou should abandon any desires and any thoughts based on the household lifeIf anyone speaks dispraise in your presence you should abandon any desires and any thoughts based on the household lifeAnd herein you should train thus My mind will be unaffectedAnd I had no need to keep on instructing those bhikkhus I had only to arouse mindfulness in themSuppose there were a chariot on even ground at the crossroads harnessed to thoroughbreds waiting with goad lying readyso that a skilled trainer a charioteer of horses to be tamed might mount it and taking the reins in his left hand and the goad in his right hand might drive out and back by any road whenever he likesfor that is how you will come to growth increase and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Disciplineand it was choked with castoroil weedsHe would cut down and throw out the crooked saplings that robbed the sapand he would clean up the interior of the grove and tend the straight wellformed saplingsso that the salatree grove later on would come to growth increase and fulfilmentSo too bhikkhus abandon what is unwholesome and devote yourselves to wholesome states Endowed with this noble aggregate of moral discipline  he resorts to a secluded dwelling What does the Buddha show by thisHe shows the achievement of the requisites for living in the forestFor one who lacks these four requisites  does not succeed in his forest lifeHe would fall under the same category as animals or forest wanderersThe deities residing in the forest would think What is the use of living in the forest for such an evil bhikkhu  They would make frightful sounds strike him on the head with their hands and make him fleeA bad reputation would also spread about concerning him Such and such a bhikkhu having entered the forest did this and that evil deedReviewing his own moral discipline he does not see any stain or blemish and he arouses rapture Exploring that rapture by way of its destruction and falling away he enters upon the plane of the noble onesThe deities residing in the forest are satisfied and speak praise of himHis fame spreads widely like a drop of oil put onto waterTherein secluded means empty that is quiet and noiselessIt is referring to this that it is said in the Vibhaga Secluded even if a dwelling is nearby if it is not crowded with householders and monksA dwelling is a place where one lies down and sits it is a designation for bed and chairThus it is said Dwelling a bed is a dwelling a chair is a dwelling a cushion a pillow a dwelling place a building with a sloping roof a rectangular building with a gabled roof a flat roofed building a natural cave a multistoreyed mansion a circular house a rock cave a bamboo thicket the foot of a tree a pavilion these are also dwellings  Or any place to which bhikkhus return all this is a dwelling Moreover dwellings become fourfold as follows A dwelling place a building with a sloping roof a rectangular building with a gabled roof a flatroofed building a natural cavethese are called dwellingplace dwellingsA bed a chair a cushion a pillow these are called bedandchair dwellingsA rug a piece of leather a straw mat a mat of leavesthese are called spread dwellingsOr any place to which bhikkhus returnthis is called a living space dwellingIts characteristics are explained in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of the Ascetic Practices The foot of a tree is the foot of any secluded tree having cool shadeA mountain is a rock mountainFor when one has bathed and drunk in a rock tank and sits down in the cool shade of a tree fanned by a cool breeze the various quarters all visible the mind becomes onepointedA glen is a mountainous region divided by waterFor there the sand is like silver foil the jungle thicket overhead is like a jewelstudded canopy and the water flows like a mass of jewelsHaving entered such a glen drunk and cooled ones limbs heaped up sand and prepared a seat from ragrobes when one sits down and does the work of a recluse the mind becomes onepointedA hillside cave is a large fissure between two mountains or in a single mountain similar to a tunnelThe characteristics of a cremation ground are explained in the Visuddhimagga A jungle grove is a place beyond the outskirts of a village a place not frequented by men where they do not sow and ploughThence it is said A jungle grove this is a designation for remote dwellingsOne wishing to may make a tent and live hereA heap of straw a pile of strawFor having collected straw from a large heap of straw they build an abode similar to a hillside cave They also throw straw over bushes and brush etc sit beneath it and do the work of a recluseHe sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and sets up mindfulness before him  crosses his legs he binds them with the thighs completely locked holds his body erect he sets the upper part of his body erect aligning the eighteen vertebrae end to endFor when one sits in such a way the skin flesh and sinews do not bend forwardAs those feelings do not arise the mind becomes one pointed and the meditation subject does not fall away but arrives at growth success and maturity sets up mindfulness before him he applies mindfulness towards his meditation subjectThus it is said in the Vibhaga This mindfulness is set up set up well at the tip of the nose or at the sign of the mouth  Having abandoned covetousness for the world Here the five aggregates of clinging are the world  in the sense of decaying and disintegrating  Therefore the meaning here is having abandoned lust for the five aggregates of clinging having suppressed sensual desireHe dwells with a mind free from covetousness with a mind free from covetousness through its being abandoned by way of suppression not like eyeconsciousness which is naturally devoid of covetousnessHe purifies his mind from covetousness he releases his mind from covetousnessIll will the mind is made ill by this and abandons its original nature like spoiled gruelHatred one is defiled by undergoing deformation  or one defiles and destroys othersBoth these words are designations for angerPerceiving light he is endowed with a purified perception free from the hindrances capable of perceiving whether by day or by night a light previously seenthese two are mentioned because they are both helpful to the perception of lightHe is unperplexed about wholesome states because in regard to blameless stateshe does not doubt Are these wholesome How is it that these are wholesome This is a brief explanationWhatever has to be said concerning these five hindrancesthe analysis of their word derivations characteristics etcall has been said in the Visuddhimagga When a bhikkhu sees that these five hindrances are unabandoned within himself he regards that as a debt as a sickness as confinement in prison as slavery as a desert road Here the Exalted One shows the unabandoned hindrance of sensual desire as similar to a debt and the remaining hindrances as similar to sickness etcOne who has taken a loan from others and squandered it cannot defend himself when they tell him to pay back his debt speak to him harshly bind him and beat him he must endure this allSimilarly if someone becomes excited by sensual desire towards someone else and takes that person as an object of a mind associated with craving then he must endure it all when that person the object of his sensual desire speaks to him harshly binds him and beats him his sensual desire is the reason he must endure it An example is the case of women being beaten by the houseowners their parentsinlaw their sensual desire being the reason they must endure it Thus sensual desire should be regarded as a debtOne who is afflicted with a bile disease if he is given such things as honey and sugar will not enjoy their taste because of his bile disease He will spit them out thinking they are bitterSimilarly if one with a mind of ill will is exhorted even slightly by his benevolent preceptor or teacher he will not accept the exhortationHe will reject it saying You oppress me too much  and depart either to wander about here and there or to return to lay lifeJust as the man afflicted with a bile disease cannot enjoy the taste of honey and sugar so one afflicted with anger cannot enjoy the flavor of the Buddhas dispensation that is the happiness of jhna etcOn a festival day a man bound in prison cannot see either the beginning middle or end of the festivalIf he is released the next day and he hears Oh there was a delightful festival yesterday Oh such dances and songs  he cannot give a replyFor what reasonBecause he did not enjoy the festival himselfSimilarly if a bhikkhu is overcome by dullness and drowsiness when a preaching of the Dhamma through variegated methods is taking place he cannot understand its beginning middle or endWhen the preaching is over he hears others speaking praise of it Oh what a preaching of the Dhamma Such arguments and similes  but he cannot give a replyFor what reasonBecause he was overcome by dullness and drowsiness and did not enjoy the Dhamma talkThus dullness and drowsiness should be regarded as confinement in prisonA slave even when playing at a festival may be told There is some urgent task for you to do Go there quicklyIf you dont go Ill cut off your hands and feet your ears or your nose  Thus he goes quicklyand does not get to enjoy the beginning middle or end of the festival For what reasonBecause he is subservient to others Similarly when one who is unskilled in the Vinaya has entered the forest for seclusion he may incur some minor disciplinary offence even perceiving unallowable meat as allowable Then he has to abandon his seclusion and approach a master of the Vinaya to purify his moral discipline Thus he does not get to enjoy the happiness of seclusion WhyBecause he has been overcome by restlessness and worryThus restlessness and worry should be regarded as slaveryA man travelling along a desert road having seen the opportunity for thieves to plunder and kill people becomes anxious and frightened even by the sound of a twig or a bird thinking Thieves have come He goes forward a little stops because of his anxiety and fear and turns back thinking Who knows what will happen if one travels in such a desert The places in which he stops are more numerous than those in which he walksHe reaches a place of safety with trouble and difficulty or he may not reach it at allSimilarly if doubt about the eight cases has arisen in someone he will go on doubting Is the Teacher an Enlightened One or not  and will not be able to resolve and accept it in faithNot being able to do so he does not reach the path or fruitThus just as the traveller on the desert road by doubting whether or not there are thieves repeatedly arouses wavering and vacillation lack of conviction and consternation and creates an obstacle to his reaching a place of safety so by doubting whether or not the Teacher is an Enlightened One one repeatedly arouses wavering and vacillation lack of conviction and consternation and creates an obstacle to ones reaching the plane of the noble ones Thus doubt should be regarded as a desert road But when he sees that these five hindrances have been abandoned within himself he regards that as freedom from debt as good health as release from prison as freedom from slavery as a place of safety Here the Exalted One shows the abandoning of the hindrance of sensual desire as similar to freedom from debt and the abandoning of the remaining hindrances as similar to good health etcThe similarity is as follows A man having taken a loan applies it to his business and achieves success He thinks This debt is a root impediment so he pays back the loan together with the interest and has the promissory note torn upFrom then on no one sends him a messenger or a letter When he sees his creditors he may rise up from his seat or remain seated as he wishes WhyBecause he is no more bound to them no more dependent on themSimilarly a bhikkhu thinks Sensual desire is a root impediment so he develops six things and abandons the hindrance of sensual desireWhen he has thus abandoned sensual desire then just as a man free from debt experiences no fear or consternation when he sees his creditorEven if he sees divine forms no defilement assails himTherefore the Exalted One says that the abandonment of sensual desire is like freedom from debtA man afflicted with a bile disease suppresses that disease with a preparation of medicines From then on he enjoys the taste of such things as honey and sugarSimilarly a bhikkhu thinks Ill will is a major cause of harm so he develops six things and abandons the hindrance of ill willWhen he has thus abandoned ill will then just as the man who has recovered from the bile disease eats such things as honey and sugar and relishes their taste so the bhikkhu having respectfully received the training rules such as the promulgations concerning conduct etc trains himself in them and relishes themTherefore the Exalted One says that the abandonment of ill will is like good healthA man is placed in prison on a festival day On a later festival day he thinks Previously due to my own heedlessness I was bound in prison and thence I did not enjoy the festivalNow I will be heedful Thus he becomes heedful so that his foes do not get the chance  Having enjoyed the festival he utters the joyful exclamation Oh what a festival Oh what a festival  Similarly a bhikkhu thinks Dullness and drowsiness are a major cause of harm so he develops six things and abandons the hindrance of dullness and drowsiness When he has thus abandoned dullness and drowsiness then just as the man freed from imprisonment enjoys the beginning middle and end of the festival even for a week so the bhikkhu enjoys the beginning middle and end of the festival of Dhamma and attains arahatship together with the analytical knowledges Therefore the Exalted One says that the abandonment of dullness and drowsiness is like release from prisonA slave with the help of a friend gives money to his master and frees himself from slavery From then on he can do whatever he wishes toSimilarly a bhikkhu thinks Restlessness and worry are a major cause of harm so he develops six things and abandons the hindrance of restlessness and worryWhen he has thus abandoned restlessness and worry then just as a free man can do whatever he wishes to and no one can forcibly prevent him from doing so so the bhikkhu happily practices the way of renunciation and restlessness and worry cannot forcibly prevent him from doing soTherefore the Exalted One says that the abandonment of restlessness and worry is like freedom from slaveryA strong man having taken his valuables in hand might travel through a desert fully armed accompanied by his retinue Thieves having seen him even from afar would fleeHaving safely crossed the desert and arrived at a place of safety he would become joyful and exuberantSimilarly a bhikkhu thinks Doubt is a major cause of harm so he develops six things and abandons the hindrance of doubtWhen he has thus abandoned doubt then just as the strong man fully armed accompanied by his retinue is fearless and taking no more account of thieves than of grass safely leaves the desert and arrives at a place of safety so the bhikkhu crosses the desert of misconduct and arrives at the supreme place of safetythe deathless the great NibbnaTherefore the Exalted One says that the abandonment of doubt is like a place of safety When he sees that these five hindrances have been abandoned within himself gladness arises Gladness arises the quality of joy arisesWhen he is gladdened rapture arises for one who is joyous rapture arises shaking his entire bodyWhen his mind is filled with rapture his body becomes tranquil for a person whose mind is associated with rapture his mental body becomes tranquil it becomes free from disturbanceHe experiences happiness he experiences bodily and mental happinessHerein bhikkhus you should train thus Our minds will remain unaffectedBut one who has achieved these four requisites succeeds in his forest lifeand starting with him we shall abide pervading the allencompassing world with a mind similar to the earth abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill willthen it is secluded I shall heat up and burn away the river Ganges with this blazing grasstorchand a man came with a stick or a potsherdand said There is this catskin bag that is rubbedrid of rustling rid of crackling I shall make it rustle and crackleAll these are included under the term dwellingHere however the Buddha is showing the dwelling appropriate for a bhikkhu who is similar to a bird at home in all four quarters of the world then he says he resorts to a secluded dwellingTherein a forest a forest is explained as everything beyond the pillar marking the boundary of a village in the case of bhikkhunisbut for the bhikkhu described here it is fitting for his forest dwelling to be at least five hundred bowlengths from the villagedo you see any course of speech trivial or gross that you could not endureThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordssome say it is a place where rivers rush and roarThe open air an uncovered placeand the painful feelings which might arise moment after moment because of their being bent forward do not ariseor he sets it up in the region of the mouthhe acts in such a way that he lets go of covetousness and does not grasp it againDullness is sickness of the minddrowsiness is sickness of mental factors together they are called dullness and drowsinessMindful and clearly comprehending he is endowed with mindfulness and knowledgeThe similarity is as followsand his debt is the reason he must endure itThus ill will should be regarded as a sicknessso the bhikkhu experiences no attachment or bondage towards any external objectHis mind becomes concentrated for one who enjoys this happiness of renunciation the mind becomes concentrated by way of access and by way of absorptionTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at SavatthI in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park Now on that occasion the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son was staying at the residence of a certain householder in Savatthi for some business or otherWhat recluse or brahmin may we go to today to pay our respects Venerable sir this Blessed One is living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkYou may go to pay your respects to that Blessed One venerable sirThen having assented to the householder the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side and asked the Blessed OneMaster Gotama the brahmins say this The householder is accomplishing the true way the Dhamma that is wholesome The one gone forth into homelessness is not accomplishing the true way the Dhamma that is wholesomeWhat does Master Gotama say about this Here student I am one who speaks after making an analysis I do not speak onesidedlyI do not praise the wrong way of practice on the part either of a householder or one gone forthfor whether it be a householder or one gone forth one who has entered on the wrong way of practice by reason of his wrong way of practice is not accomplishing the true way the Dhamma that is wholesomeMaster Gotama the brahmins say this Since the work of the household life involves a great deal of activity great functions great engagements and great undertakings it is of great fruit Since the work of those gone forth involves a small amount of activity small functions small engagements and small undertakings it is of small fruitWhat does Master Gotama say about this Here too student I am one who speaks after making an analysis I do not speak onesidedlyThere is work involving a great deal of activity great functions great engagements and great undertakings which when it fails is of small fruit There is work involving a great deal of activity great functions great engagements and great undertakings which when it succeeds is of great fruit There is work involving a small amount of activity small functions small engagements and small undertakings which when it fails is of small fruit There is work involving a small amount of activity small functions small engagements and small undertakings which when it succeeds is of great fruitWhat student is that work involving a great deal of activitywhich when it fails is of small fruitAgriculture is that work involving a great deal of activitywhich when it fails is of small fruitAnd what student is that work involving a great deal of activitywhich when it succeeds is of great fruitAgriculture again is that work involving a great deal of activitywhich when it succeeds is of great fruitAnd what student is that work involving a small amount of activity which when it fails is of small fruitTrade is that work involving a small amount of activitywhich when it fails is of small fruitAnd what student is that work involving a small amount of activitywhich when it succeeds is of great fruitTrade again is that work involving a small amount of activitywhich when it succeeds is of great fruitJust as agriculture student is work that involves a great deal of activitybut is of small fruit when it fails so the work of the household life involves a great deal of activity great functions great engagements and great undertakings but is of small fruit when it failsJust as agriculture is work that involves a great deal of activityand is of great fruit when it succeeds so the work of the household life involves a great deal of activity great functions great engagements and great undertakings and is of great fruit when it succeedsJust as trade is work that involves a small amount of activityand is of small fruit when it fails so the work of those gone forth involves a small amount of activity small functions small engagements and small undertakings and is of small fruit when it failsJust as trade is work that involves a small amount of activitybut is of great fruit when it succeeds so the work of those gone forth involves a small amount of activity small functions small engagements and small undertakings but is of great fruit when it succeedsMaster Gotama the brahmins prescribe five things for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesomeIf it is not troublesome for you student please state to this assembly the five things that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesomeIt is not troublesome for me Master Gotama when such venerable ones as yourself and others are sitting in the assemblyThen state them studentMaster Gotama truth is the first thing that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesomeAsceticism is the second thingCelibacy is the third thingWhat does Master Gotama say about this How then student among the brahmins is there even a single brahmin who says thus I declare the result of these five things having realised it myself with direct knowledge No Master GotamaHow then student among the brahmins is there even a single teacher or teachers teacher back to the seventh generation of teachers who says thus I declare the result of these five things having realised it myself with direct knowledge  No Master GotamaHow then student the ancient brahmin seers the creators of the hymns the composers of the hymns whose ancient hymns that were formerly chanted uttered and compiled the brahmins nowadays still chant and repeat repeating what was spoken reciting what was recited  that is Atthaka Vamaka Vamadeva Vessamitta Yamataggi Angirasa Bharadvaja Vasettha Kassapa and Bhagu  did even these ancient brahmin seers say thus We declare the result of these five things having realised it ourselves with direct knowledge No Master GotamaSo student it seems that among the brahmins there is not even a single brahmin who says thus I declare the result of these five things having realised it myself with direct knowledge And among the brahmins there is not even a single teacher or a single teachers teacher back to the seventh generation of teachers who says thus I declare the result of these five things having realised it myself with direct knowledge And the ancient brahmin seers the creators of the hymns the composers of the hymnseven these ancient brahmin seers did not say thus We declare the result of these five things having realised it ourselves with direct knowledgeSuppose there were a file of blind men each in touch with the next the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not seeSo too student in regard to their statement the brahmins seem to be like a file of blind men the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not seeWhen this was said the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son was angry and displeased with the simile of the file of blind men and he reviled disparaged and censured the Blessed One saying The recluse Gotama will be worsted Then he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama the brahmin Pokkharasati of the Upamanna clan lord of the Subhaga Grove says thus Some recluses and brahmins here claim superhuman states distinctions in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesFor how could a human being know or see or realise a superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesThat is impossible  How then student does the brahmin Pokkharasati understand the minds of all recluses and brahmins having encompassed them with his own mind Master Gotama the brahmin Pokkharasati does not even understand the mind of his slavewoman Punnika having encompassed it with his own mind so how could he understand thus the minds of all recluses and brahmins Student suppose there were a man born blind who could not see dark and light forms who could not see blue yellow red or pink forms who could not see what was even and uneven who could not see the stars or the sun and moonHe might say thus There are no dark and light forms and no one who sees dark and light forms there are no blue yellow red or pink forms and no one who sees blue yellow red or pink forms there is nothing even and uneven and no one who sees anything even and uneven there are no stars and no sun and moon and no one who sees stars and the sun and moonI do not know these I do not see these therefore these do not existSpeaking thus student would he be speaking rightly No Master GotamaSaying I do not know these I do not see these therefore these do not exist he would not be speaking rightlySo too student the brahmin Pokkharasati is blind and visionlessThat he could know or see or realise a superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones  this is impossibleWhat do you think student What is better for those welltodo brahmins of Kosala such as the brahmin Canki the brahmin Tarukkha the brahmin Pokkharasati the brahmin Janussoni or your father the brahmin Todeyya  that the statements they make accord with worldly convention or flaunt worldly convention That they accord with worldly convention Master GotamaWhat is better for them that the statements they make be thoughtful or thoughtless Thoughtful Master Gotama What is better for them that they make their statements after reflecting or without reflecting After reflecting Master Gotama What is better for them that the statements they make be beneficial or unbeneficial Beneficial Master GotamaWhat do you think student If that is so did the statement made by the brahmin Pokkharasati accord with worldly convention or flaunt worldly convention It flaunted worldly convention Master Gotama Was the statement made thoughtful or thoughtless Thoughtless Master Gotama Was the statement made after reflecting or without reflecting Without reflecting Master Gotama Was the statement made beneficial or unbeneficial Unbeneficial Master GotamaNow there are these five hindrances studentWhat are the fiveThe hindrance of sensual desire the hindrance of ill will the hindrance of sloth and torpor the hindrance of restlessness and remorse and the hindrance of doubt These are the five hindrancesThe brahmin Pokkharasati is obstructed hindered blocked and enveloped by these five hindrancesThat he could know or see or realise a superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones  this is impossibleNow there are these five cords of sensual pleasure studentWhat are the fiveForms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust Sounds cognizable by the earOdours cognizable by the noseFlavours cognizable by the tongueTangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust These are the five cords of sensual pleasureThe brahmin Pokkharasati is tied to these five cords of sensual pleasure infatuated with them and utterly committed to them he enjoys them without seeing the danger in them or understanding the escape from themThat he could know or see or realise a superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones  this is impossibleWhat do you think student Which of these two fires would have a better flame colour and radiance  a fire that might burn in dependence on fuel such as grass and wood or a fire that might burn independent of fuel such as grass and wood If it were possible Master Gotama for a fire to burn independent of fuel such as grass and wood that fire would have a better flame colour and radianceIt is impossible student it cannot happen that a fire could burn independent of fuel such as grass or wood except through the exercise of supernormal powerLike the fire that burns dependent on fuel such as grass and wood I say is the rapture that is dependent on the five cords of sensual pleasureLike the fire that burns independent of fuel such as grass and wood I say is the rapture that is apart from sensual pleasures apart from unwholesome statesAnd what student is the rapture that is apart from sensual pleasures apart from unwholesome statesHere quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusionThis is a rapture apart from sensual pleasures apart from unwholesome statesAgain with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentrationThis too is a rapture apart from sensual pleasures apart from unwholesome statesOf those five things student that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome which of the five do they prescribe as the most fruitful for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome Of those five things Master Gotama that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome they prescribe generosity as the most fruitful for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesomeWhat do you think student Here a brahmin might be holding a great sacrifice and two other brahmins would go there thinking to take part in that great sacrificeOne brahmin among them would think Oh that only I might get the best seat the best water the best almsfood in the refectory that no other brahmin might get the best seat the best water the best almsfood in the refectoryAnd it is possible that the other brahmin not that brahmin gets the best seat the best water the best almsfood in the refectoryThinking about this the first brahmin might become angry and displeasedWhat kind of result do the brahmins describe for this Master Gotama brahmins do not give gifts in such a way thinking Let the others become angry and displeased because of thisRather brahmins give gifts motivated by compassionThat being so student isnt this the brahmins sixth basis for the performance of merit that is the motive of compassion That being so Master Gotama this is the brahmins sixth basis for the performance of merit that is the motive of compassionThose five things student that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome  where do you often see those five things among householders or among those gone forth Those five things Master Gotama that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome I often see among those gone forth seldom among householdersFor the householder has a great deal of activity great functions great engagements and great undertakings he does not constantly and invariably speak the truth practise asceticism observe celibacy engage in study or engage in generosityThus those five things that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome I often see among those gone forth seldom among householdersThose five things student that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome I call equipment of the mind that is for developing a mind that is without hostility and without ill willHere student a bhikkhu is a speaker of truthThinking I am a speaker of truth he gains inspiration in the meaning gains inspiration in the Dhamma gains gladness connected with the DhammaIt is that gladness connected with the wholesome that I call an equipment of the mindHere student a bhikkhu is an asceticone who is celibateone who engages in studyone who engages in generosityThinking I am one who engages in generosity he gains inspiration in the meaning gains inspiration in the Dhamma gains gladness connected with the DhammaIt is that gladness connected with the wholesome that I call an equipment of the mindThus those five things that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome I call equipment of the mind that is for developing a mind that is without hostility and without ill willWhen this was said the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son said to the Blessed One Master Gotama I have heard that the recluse Gotama knows the path to the company of BrahmaWhat do you think student Is the village of Nalakara near here not far from here Yes sir the village of Nalakara is near here not far from hereWhat do you think student Suppose there was a man born and raised in the village of Nalakara and as soon as he had left Nalakara they asked him about the path to the village Would that man be slow or hesitant in answering No Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause that man has been born and raised in Nalakara and is wellacquainted with all the paths to the villageStill a man born and raised in the village of Nalakara might be slow or hesitant in answering when asked about the path to the village but a Tathagata when asked about the Brahmaworld or the way leading to the Brahmaworld would never be slow or hesitant in answering I understand Brahma student and I understand the Brahmaworld and I understand the way leading to the Brahmaworld and I understand how one should practise to reappear in the BrahmaworldMaster Gotama I have heard that the recluse Gotama teaches the path to the company of BrahmaIt would be good if Master Gotama would teach me the path to the company of BrahmaThen student listen and attend closely to what I shall sayYes sir he repliedThe Blessed One said thisWhat student is the path to the company of BrahmaHere a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with lovingkindness likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with lovingkindness abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill willWhen the deliverance of mind by lovingkindness is developed in this way no limiting action remains there none persists thereJust as a vigorous trumpeter could make himself heard without difficulty in the four quarters so too when the deliverance of mind by lovingkindness is developed in this way no limiting action remains there none persists thereThis is the path to the company of BrahmaAgain a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassionwith a mind imbued with appreciative joywith a mind imbued with equanimity likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with equanimity abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill willWhen the deliverance of mind by equanimity is developed in this way no limiting action remains there none persists thereJust as a vigorous trumpeter could make himself heard without difficulty in the four quarters so too when the deliverance of mind by equanimity is developed in this way no limiting action remains there none persists thereThis too is the path to the company of BrahmaWhen this was said the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master GotamaMagnificent Master Gotama Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overturned revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see formsLet Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeAnd now Master Gotama we depart We are busy and have much to doNow is the time student to do as you think fitThen the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones words rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One keeping him on his right he departedcoming in the distance and asked him Now where is Master Bharadvaja coming from in the middle of the day Sir I am coming from the presence of the recluse GotamaSir who am I to know the recluse Gotamas lucidity of wisdomOne would surely have to be his equal to know the recluse Gotamas lucidity of wisdomMaster Bharadvaja praises the recluse Gotama with high praise indeedSir who am I to praise the recluse GotamaThe recluse Gotama is praised by the praised as best among gods and humansSir those five things that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome the recluse Gotama calls equipment of the mind that is for developing a mind that is without hostility and without ill willWhen this was said the brahmin Janussoni got down from his allwhite chariot drawn by white mares and after arranging his upper robe on one shoulder he extended his hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and uttered this exclamation It is a gain for King Pasenadi of Kosala it is a great gain for King Pasenadi of Kosala that the Tathagata accomplished and fully enlightened lives in his realmThen the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son asked the householder in whose residence he was staying Householder I have heard that Savatthi is not devoid of arahantsI praise the right way of practice on the part either of a householder or one gone forthfor whether it be a householder or one gone forth one who has entered on the right way of practice by reason of his right way of practice is accomplishing the true way the Dhamma that is wholesomeStudy is the fourth thingGenerosity is the fifth thing that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesomeThese are the five things that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesomeBut what they say turns out to be ridiculous it turns out to be mere words empty and hollowThere are dark and light forms and those who see dark and light formsthere are the stars and the sun and moon and those who see the stars and the sun and moonBut one gone forth has a small amount of activity small functions small engagements and small undertakings he constantly and invariably speaks the truth practises asceticism observes celibacy engages in study and engages in generosityI go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusNow on that occasion the brahmin Janussoni was driving out of Savatthi in the middle of the day in an allwhite chariot drawn by white maresHe saw the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas sonWhat does Master Bharadvaja think of the recluse Gotamas lucidity of wisdom He is wise is he not  Thus have I heard Once the Venerable Ananda was staying at Savatthi in Jetas grove in Anathapindikas park shortly after the Lords final passing And Subha said to a certain young man Go my lad to where the ascetic Ananda is ask him in my name if he is in good health free from fatigue strong vigorous and dwelling in comfortand say It would be good if the Reverend Ananda would out of compassion visit the dwelling of Subha the son of Todeyya Very good sir replied the young man Then he went to the Venerable Ananda exchanged courtesies with himand sat down to one sideThen he delivered the message The Venerable Ananda replied It is not the right time young manToday I have taken some medicinePerhaps it will be possible to come tomorrow when the time and the occasion are suitableAnd the young man rose returned to Subha and reported what had passed between him and the Venerable Ananda addingMy mission has been thus far accomplished that the Reverend Ananda will probably take the opportunity to come tomorrow And indeed as that night was ending the Venerable Ananda dressed in the early morning took his robe and bowl and accompanied by the Venerable Cetaka came to Subhas dwelling and sat down on the prepared seat Then Subha approached the Venerable Ananda exchanged courtesies with himand sat down to one sideThen he said The Reverend Ananda was for a long time the Reverend Gotamas per sonal attendant dwelling in his presence and near him You Reverend Ananda would know what things the Reverend Gotama praised and with which he aroused exhorted and established people Which Reverend Ananda were those things Subha there were three divisions of things which the Lord praised and with which he aroused exhorted and established peopleWhich three The division of Ariyan morality the division of Ariyan concentration and the division of Ariyan wisdomThese were the three divisions of things which the Lord praisedWell Reverend Ananda what is the division of Ariyan morality which the Reverend Gotama praised Young sir a Tathagata arises in the world an Ara hant fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessedHe having realised it by his own superknowledge proclaims this world with its devas maras and Brahmas its princes and peopleHe preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and displays the fullyperfected and purified holy lifeThus a monk is perfected in moralityThat is the division of Ariyan morality which the Lord praisedIt is wonderful Reverend Ananda it is marvellousThis division of Ariyan morality is perfectly fulfilled not left incompleteAnd I do not see this division of Ariyan morality fulfilled thus anywhere among the ascetics and Brahmins of other schoolsAnd if any of them were to have found this perfection in themselves they would have been so delighted that they would have said Weve done enough The goal of our asceticism has been reached Theres nothing more to be doneAnd yet the Reverend Ananda declares that there is more to be done  Reverend Ananda what is the division of Ariyan concentration which the Reverend Gotama praised And how is a monk guardian of the sensedoorsThis comes to him through concentrationThat is the division of Ariyan concentration which the Lord praisedIt is wonderful Reverend Ananda it is marvellousThis division of Ariyan concentration is perfectly fulfilled not left incompleteAnd I do not see this division of Ariyan concentration fulfilled thus anywhere among the ascetics and Brahmins of other schoolsAnd if any of them were to have found this perfection in themselves they would have been so delighted that they would have said Weve done enough The goal of our asceticism has been reached Theres nothing more to be doneAnd yet the Reverend Ananda declares that there is more to be done Reverend Ananda what is the division of Ariyan wisdom which the Reverend Gotama praised And so with mind concentrated he attains various insightsThat is the division of Ariyan wisdom which the Lord praised with which he aroused exhorted and established peopleBeyond that there is nothing to be doneIt is wonderful Reverend Ananda it is marvellousThis division of Ariyan wisdom is perfectly fulfilled not left incompleteAnd I do not see this division of Ariyan wisdom fulfilled thus anywhere among the ascetics and Brahmins of other schoolsAnd there is nothing further to be doneExcellent Reverend Ananda excellentIt is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oillamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was thereJust so the Reverend Ananda has expounded the Dhamma in various waysReverend Ananda I go for refuge to the Lord Gotama the Dhamma and the SanghaMay the Reverend Ananda accept me as a layfollower who has taken refuge from this day forth as long as life shall last THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering by stages in the Kosalan Country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and eventually he arrived at a Kosalan brahmin village named SalaThe brahmin householders of Sala heard The recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan has been wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and has come to SalaNow a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessedHe declares this world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas this generation with its recluses and brahmins its princes and its people which he has himself realised with direct knowledgeHe teaches the Dhamma good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing and he reveals a holy life that is utterly perfect and pureNow it is good to see such arahantsThen the brahmin householders of Sala went to the Blessed One Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side some exchanged greetings with him and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished sat down at one side some extended their hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and sat down at one side some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed Ones presence and sat down at one side some kept silent and sat down at one sideWhen they were seated they said to the Blessed One Master Gotama what is the cause and condition why some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hellAnd what is the cause and condition why some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world Householders it is by reason of conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of unrighteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hellIt is by reason of conduct in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of righteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly worldWe do not understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotamas utterance which he has spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaningIt would be good if Master Gotama would teach us the Dhamma so that we might understand the detailed meaning of his utteranceThen householders listen and attend closely to what I shall sayYes venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said thisHouseholders there are three kinds of bodily conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct There are four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct There are three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conductAnd how householders are there three kinds of bodily conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conductHere someone kills living beings he is murderous bloodyhanded given to blows and violence merciless to living beingsHe takes what is not givenhe has intercourse with women who are protected by their mother father mother and father brother sister or relatives who have a husband who are protected by law and even with those who are garlanded in token of betrothalThat is how there are three kinds of bodily conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conductAnd how householders are there four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conductwhen summoned to a court or to a meeting or to his relatives presence or to his guild or to the royal familys presence and questioned as a witness thus So good man tell what you know not knowing he says I know or knowing he says I do not know not seeing he says I see or seeing he says I do not seeHe speaks maliciouslyHe speaks harshlyHe is a gossipThat is how there are four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conductAnd how householders are there three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conductHere someone is covetous he covets the wealth and property of others thus Oh may what belongs to another be mine Or he has a mind of ill will and intentions of hate thus May these beings be slain and slaughtered may they be cut off perish or be annihilatedOr he has wrong view distorted vision thus There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed no fruit or result of good and bad actions no this world no other world no mother no father no beings who are reborn spontaneously no good and virtuous recluses and brahmins in the world who have themselves realised by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other worldThat is how there are three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conductSo householders it is by reason of such conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of such unrighteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hellHouseholders there are three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct There are four kinds of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct There are three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductAnd how householders are there three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductHere someone abandoning the killing of living beings abstains from killing living beings with rod and weapon laid aside gentle and kindly he abides compassionate to all living beingsAbandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not givenAbandoning misconduct in sensual pleasures he abstains from misconduct in sensual pleasuresThat is how there are three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductAnd how householders are there four kinds of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductHere someone abandoning false speech abstains from false speechAbandoning malicious speech he abstains from malicious speechAbandoning harsh speech he abstains from harsh speechhe speaks such words as are gentle pleasing to the ear and loveable as go to the heart are courteous desired by many and agreeable to manyThat is how there are four kinds of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductAnd how householders are there three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductHere someone is not covetous he does not covet the wealth and property of others thus Oh may what belongs to another be mine His mind is without ill will and he has intentions free from hate thus May these beings be free from enmity affliction and anxiety May they live happily He has right view undistorted vision thus There is what is given and what is offered and what is sacrificed there is fruit and result of good and bad actions there is this world and the other world there is mother and father there are beings who are reborn spontaneously there are good and virtuous recluses and brahmins in the world who have themselves realised by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other worldThat is how there are three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductSo householders it is by reason of such conduct in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of such righteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly worldIf householders one who observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct should wish Oh that on the dissolution of the body after death I might reappear in the company of welltodo nobles  it is possible that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in the company of welltodo noblesWhy is thatBecause he observes conduct that is in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductIf householders one who observes conduct in

Sangha of bhikkhusFrom today let Master Gotama accept us as lay followers who have gone to him for refuge for lifeTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthl in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park Then the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himMaster Gotama what is the cause and condition why human beings are seen to

spoke in brief without expounding the meaning in detailIt would be good if Master Gotama would teach me the Dhamma so that I might understand in detail the meaning of Master Gotamas statementThen student listen and attend closely to what I shall sayYes sir the brahmin student Subha repliedThe Blessed One said thisHere student some man or woman kills living beings and is murderous bloodyhanded

and arrogant he pays homage to one who should receive homage rises up for one in whose presence he should rise up offers a seat to one who deserves a seat makes way for one for whom he should make way and honours respects reveres and venerates one who should be honoured respected revered and veneratedBecause of performing and undertaking such actionhe reappears in a happy destinationThis is the way student that leads to high birth namely one is not obstinate and arrogantand honours respects reveres and venerates one who should be honoured respected revered and veneratedHere student some man or woman does not visit a recluse or a brahmin and ask Venerable sir what is wholesome What is unwholesome What is blameable What is blameless What should be cultivated What should not be cultivated What kind of action will lead to my harm and suffering for a long time What kind of action will lead to my welfare and happiness for a long timeBecause of performing and undertaking such actionhe reappears in a state of deprivationThis is the way student that leads to stupidity namely one does not visit a recluse or brahmin and ask such questionsBut here student some man or woman visits a recluse or a brahmin and asks Venerable sir what is wholesome What kind of action will lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time Because of performing and undertaking such actionhe reappears in a happy destinationThis is the way student that leads to wisdom namely one visits a recluse or brahmin and asks such questionsThus student the way that leads to short life makes people shortlived the way that leads to long life makes people longlived the way that leads to sickliness makes people sickly the way that leads to health makes people healthy the way that leads to ugliness makes people ugly the way that leads to being beautiful makes people beautiful the way that leads to being uninfluential makes people uninfluential the way that leads to being influential makes people influential the way

the way that leads to stupidity makes people stupid the way that leads to wisdom makes people wiseBeings are owners of their actions student heirs of their actions they originate from their actions are bound to their actions have their actions as their refugeIt is action that distinguishes beings as inferior and superiorWhen this was said the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master GotamaMaster Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overturned revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see formsLet Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideand asked the Blessed OneBut if on the dissolution of the body after death he does not reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world but instead comes back to the human state then wherever he is reborn he is longlivedThis is the way student that leads to long life namely abandoning the killing of living beings one abstains from killing living beings with rod and weapon laid aside gentle and kindly one abides compassionate to all living beingsThis is the way student that leads to sickliness namely one is given to injuring beings with the hand with a clod with a stick or with a knifeBut if instead he comes back to the human state then wherever he is reborn he is healthyBut if instead he comes back to the human state then wherever he is reborn he is uglyeven when criticised a little he is offended becomes angry hostile and resentful and displays anger hate and bitternessBut if instead he comes back to the human state then wherever he is reborn he is beautifulBecause of performing and undertaking such actionhe reappears in a happy destinationThis is the way student that leads to being influential namely one is not envioustowards the gains honour respect reverence salutations and veneration received by othersBut if instead he comes back to the human state then wherever he is reborn he is uninfluentialBut if instead he comes back to the human state then wherever he is reborn he is highbornBecause of performing and undertaking such actionhe reappears in a state of deprivationBut if instead he comes back to the human state then wherever he is reborn he is poorBut if instead he comes back to the human state then wherever he is reborn he is wealthyBut if instead he comes back to the human state then wherever he is reborn he is lowbornBut if instead he comes back to the human state then wherever he is reborn he is stupidBut if instead he comes back to the human state then wherever he is reborn he is wiseI go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the country of the Anguttarapans at a town of theirs named ApanaThen when it was morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Apana for almsHaving entered the grove he sat down at the root of a treePotaliya the householder while walking and wandering for exercise wearing full dress with parasol and sandals also went to the grove and having entered the grove he went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished he stood at one sideThe Blessed One said to him There are seats householder sit down if you likeWhen this was said the householder Potaliya thought The recluse Gotama addresses me as householder and angry and displeased he remained silentA second time the Blessed One said to him There are seats householder sit down if you like And a second time the householder Potaliya thought The recluse Gotama addresses me as householder and angry and displeased he remained silent A third time the Blessed One said to him There are seats householder sit down if you likeWhen this was said the householder Potaliya thought The recluse Gotama addresses me as householder and angry and displeased he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama it is neither fitting nor proper that you address me as householderHouseholder you have the aspects marks and signs of a householderNevertheless Master Gotama I have given up all my works and cut off all my affairsIn what way have you given up all your works householder and cut off all your affairs Master Gotama I have given all my wealth grain silver and gold to my children as their inheritance Without advising or admonishing them I live merely on food and clothingHouseholder the cutting off of affairs as you describe it is one thing but in the Noble Ones Discipline the cutting off of affairs is differentWhat is the cutting off of affairs like in the Noble Ones Discipline venerable sirIt would be good venerable sir if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma showing what the cutting off of affairs is like in the Noble Ones DisciplineThen listen householder and attend closely to what I shall sayYes venerable sir Potaliya the householder repliedThe Blessed One said this  Householder there are these eight things in the Noble Ones Discipline that lead to the cutting off of affairsWhat are the eightWith the support of the nonkilling of living beings the killing of living beings is to be abandoned With the support of taking only what is given the taking of what is not given is to be abandoned With the support of truthful speech false speech is to be abandoned With the support of unmalicious speech malicious speech is to be abandoned With the support of refraining from rapacious greed rapacious greed is to be abandoned With the support of refraining from spiteful scolding spiteful scolding is to be abandoned With the support of refraining from angry despair angry despair is to be abandoned With the support of nonarrogance arrogance is to be abandonedThese are the eight things stated in brief without being expounded in detail that lead to the cutting off of affairs in the Noble Ones DisciplineVenerable sir it would be good if out of compassion the Blessed One would expound to me in detail these eight things that lead to the cutting off of affairs in the Noble Ones Discipline which have been stated in brief by the Blessed One without being expounded in detailThen listen householder and attend closely to what I shall sayYes venerable sir Potaliya the householder repliedThe Blessed One said thisWith the support of the nonkilling of living beings the killing of living beings is to be abandoned So it was said And with reference to what was this saidHere a noble disciple considers thus I am practising the way to the abandoning and cutting off of those fetters because of which I might kill living beingsIf I were to kill living beings I would blame myself for doing so the wise having investigated would censure me for doing so and on the dissolution of the body after death because of killing living beings an unhappy destination would be expectedAnd while taints vexation and fever might arise through the killing of living beings there are no taints vexation and fever in one who abstains from killing living beingsSo it is with reference to this that it was said With the support of the nonkilling of living beings the killing of living beings is to be abandonedWith the support of taking only what is given the taking of what is not given is to be abandoned So it was saidWith the support of truthful speech false speech is to be abandoned So it was saidWith the support of unmalicious speech malicious speech is to be abandoned So it was saidWith the support of refraining from rapacious greed rapacious greed is to be abandoned So it was saidWith the support of refraining from spiteful scolding spiteful scolding is to be abandoned So it was saidWith the support of refraining from angry despair angry despair is to be abandoned So it was saidWith the support of nonarrogance arrogance is to be abandoned So it was said And with reference to what was this saidHere a noble disciple considers thus I am practising the way to the abandoning and cutting off of those fetters because of which I might be arrogantIf I were to be arrogant I would blame myself for this the wise having investigated would censure me for this and on the dissolution of the body after death because of being arrogant an unhappy destination would be expectedBut this arrogance is itself a fetter and a hindranceSo it is with reference to this that it was said With the support of nonarrogance arrogance is to be abandonedThese eight things that lead to the cutting off of affairs in the Noble Ones Discipline have now been expounded in detail But the cutting off of affairs in the Noble Ones Discipline has not yet been achieved entirely and in all waysVenerable sir how is the cutting off of affairs in the Noble Ones Discipline achieved entirely and in all waysIt would be good venerable sir if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma showing me how the cutting off of affairs in the Noble Ones Discipline is achieved entirely and in all waysThen listen householder and attend closely to what I shall sayYes venerable sir Potaliya the householder repliedThe Blessed One said thisWhen he had wandered for alms in Apana and had returned from his almsround after his meal he went to a certain grove for the days abidingThat is how I have given up all my works and cut off all my affairsBut this killing of living beings is itself a fetter and a hindranceAnd while taints vexation and fever might arise through arrogance there are no taints vexation and fever for one who is not arrogantThen a skilled butcher or his apprentice would cut out a skeleton of meatless bones smeared with blood and toss it to the dog What do you think householder Would that dog get rid of his hunger and weakness by gnawing such a skeleton of meatless bones smeared with blood No venerable sir Why is that Because that skeleton consisted only of meatless bones smeared with blood Eventually that dog would reap weariness and disappointment So too householder a noble disciple considers thus Sensual pleasures have been compared to a skeleton by the Blessed One they provide much suffering and much despair while the danger in them is great Haying seen this thus as it actually is with proper wisdom he avoids the equanimity that is diversified based on diversity and develops the equanimity that is unified based on unity where clinging to the material things of the world utterly ceases without remainder Householder suppose a vulture a crow or a hawk seized a piece of meat and flew away and then vultures crows and hawks flew up and pecked and clawed it What do you think householder If that vulture crow or hawk does not quickly let go of that piece of meat wouldnt it incur death or deadly suffering because of that  Yes venerable sir So too householder a noble disciple considers thus Sensual pleasures have been compared to a piece of meat by the Blessed One they provide much suffering and much despair while the danger in them is great Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper wisdomclinging to the material things of the world utterly ceases without remainder Householder suppose a man took a blazing grass torch and went against the wind What do you think householder  If that man does not quickly let go of that blazing grass torch wouldnt that blazing grass torch burn his hand or his arm or some other part of his body so that he might incur death or deadly suffering because of that  Yes venerable sir So too householder a noble disciple considers thus Sensual pleasures have been compared to a grass torch by the Blessed One they provide much suffering and much despair while the danger in them is great Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper wisdomclinging to the material things of the world utterly ceases without remainder Householder suppose there were a charcoal pit deeper than a mans height full of glowing coals without flame or smoke Then a man came who wanted to live and not to die who wanted pleasure and recoiled from painWhat do you think householder  Would that man twist his body this way and that  Why is that Because that man knows that if he falls into that charcoal pit he will incur death or deadly suffering because of that So too householder a noble disciple considers thus Sensual pleasures have been compared to a charcoal pit by the Blessed One they provide much suffering and much despair while the danger in them is great Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper wisdomclinging to the material things of the world utterly ceases without remainder Householder suppose a man dreamt about lovely parks lovely groves lovely meadows and lovely lakesSo too householder a noble disciple considers thus Sensual pleasures have been compared to a dream by the Blessed One they provide much suffering and much despair while the danger in them is great  Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper wisdomclinging to the material things of the world utterly ceases without remainder Householder suppose a man borrowed goods on loan  a fancy carriage and finejewelled earrings Then people seeing him would say Sirs that is a rich man  That is how the rich enjoy their wealth  Then the owners whenever they saw him would take back their things What do you think householder  Would that be enough for that man to become dejected Yes venerable sir Why is that Because the owners took back their things So too householder a noble disciple considers thus Sensual pleasures have been compared to borrowed goods by the Blessed One they provide much suffering and much despair while the danger in them is great  Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper wisdomclinging to material things of the world utterly ceases without remainder Householder suppose there were a dense grove not far from some village or townThen a man came needing fruit seeking fruit wandering in search of fruitThereupon he thought This tree is laden with fruit but none of its fruit has fallen to the ground I know how to climb a treeso let me climb this tree eat as much fruit as I want and fill my bag And he did so Then a second man came needing fruit seeking fruit wandering in search of fruit and taking a sharp axeThereupon he thought This tree is laden with fruit but none of its fruit has fallen to the ground What do you think householder  If that first man who had climbed the tree doesnt come down quickly when the tree falls wouldnt he break his hand or his foot or some other part of his body so that he might incur death or deadly suffering because of that  Yes venerable sir So too householder a noble disciple considers thus Sensual pleasures have been compared to a fruit tree by the Blessed One they provide much suffering and much despair while the danger in them is great Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper wisdom he avoids the equanimity that is diversified based on diversity and develops the equanimity that is unified based on unity where clinging to the material things of the world utterly ceases without remainder Having arrived at that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is due to equanimity this noble disciple recollects his manifold past lives that is one birth two birthsThus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives Having arrived at that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is due to equanimity with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human this noble disciple sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunateand he understands how beings pass on according to their actions Having arrived at that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is due to equanimity by realising for himself with direct knowledge this noble disciple here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints At this point householder the cutting off of affairs in the Noble Ones Discipline has been achieved entirely and in all ways What do you think householder  Do you see in yourself any cutting off of affairs like this cutting off of affairs in the Noble Ones Discipline when it is achieved entirely and in all ways  Venerable sir who am I that I should possess any cutting off of affairs entirely and in all ways like that in the Noble Ones Discipline I am far indeed venerable sir from that cutting off of affairs in the Noble Ones Discipline when it has been achieved entirely and in all ways For venerable sir though the wanderers of other sects are not thoroughbreds we imagined that they are thoroughbreds though they are not thoroughbreds we fed them the food of thoroughbreds though they are not thoroughbreds we set them in the place of thoroughbreds  But though the bhikkhus are thoroughbreds we imagined that they are not thoroughbreds though they are thoroughbreds we fed them the food of those who are not thoroughbreds though they are thoroughbreds we set them in the place of those who are not thoroughbreds  But now venerable sir as the wanderers of other sects are not thoroughbreds we shall understand that they are not thoroughbreds as they are not thoroughbreds we shall feed them the food of those who are not thoroughbreds as they are not thoroughbreds we shall set them in the place of those who are not thoroughbreds But as the bhikkhus are thoroughbreds we shall understand that they are thoroughbreds as they are thoroughbreds we shall feed them the food of thoroughbreds as they are thoroughbreds we shall set them in the place of those who are thoroughbreds Venerable sir the Blessed One has inspired in me love for recluses confidence in recluses reverence for recluses Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama  Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see formsFrom today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeYes venerable sir and preceded and surrounded by those borrowed goods he went to the marketplace and two strong men seized him by both arms and dragged him towards that charcoal pit and on waking he saw nothing of it within which there was a tree laden with fruit but none of its fruit had fallen to the ground I do not know how to climb a treeAnd he did so I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus and he entered the grove and saw the tree laden with fruit he too entered the grove and saw that tree laden with fruit so let me cut this tree down at its root eat as much fruit as I want and fill my bag THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Kuru country at a town of the Kurus named Kammasadhamma on a spread of grass in the fire chamber of a brahmin belonging to the Bharadvaja clanThen when it was morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Kammasadhamma for almsHaving entered the grove he sat down at the root of a tree for the days abidingThen the wanderer Magandiya while walking and wandering for exercise went to the fire chamber of the brahmin belonging to the Bharadvaja clanMaster Magandiya there is the recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clanNow a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessedThis bed has been prepared for that Master Gotamawhen we see the bed of that destroyer of growth Master GotamaBe careful what you say Magandiya be careful what you sayMany learned nobles learned brahmins learned householders and learned recluses have full confidence in Master Gotama and have been disciplined by him in the noble true way in the Dhamma that is wholesomeMaster Bharadvaja even if we saw that Master Gotama face to face we would tell him to his face The recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growthWhy is thatBecause that is recorded in our scripturesIf Master Magandiya has no objection may I tell this to Master Gotama Let Master Bharadvaja be at ease Tell him just what I have saidMeanwhile with the divine ear which is purified and surpasses the human the Blessed One heard this conversation between the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan and the wanderer MagandiyaThen when it was evening the Blessed One rose from meditation went to the brahmins fire chamber and sat down on the spread of grass made readyThen the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideThe Blessed One asked him Bharadvaja did you have any conversation with the wanderer Magandiya about this spread of grass When this was said the brahmin awestruck and with his hair standing on end replied We wanted to tell Master Gotama about that very thingBut this discussion between the Blessed One and the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan was left unfinishedHe exchanged greetings with the Blessed One and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideThe Blessed One said to himMagandiya the eye delights in forms takes delight in forms rejoices in formsWas it with reference to this that you said The recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth It was with reference to this Master Gotama that I said The recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growthWhy is thatBecause that is recorded in our scripturesWas it with reference to this that you said The recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growthIt was with reference to this Master Gotama that I said The recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growthWhy is thatBecause that is recorded in our scripturesWhat do you think Magandiya Here someone may have formerly enjoyed himself with forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust On a later occasion having understood as they actually are the origin the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of forms he might abandon craving for forms remove fever for forms and abide without thirst with a mind inwardly at peaceWhat would you say to him Magandiya Nothing Master GotamaWhat do you think Magandiya Here someone may have formerly enjoyed himself with sounds cognizable by the earwith odours cognizable by the nosewith flavours cognizable by the tonguewith tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust On a later occasion having understood as they actually are the origin the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of tangibles he might abandon craving for tangibles remove fever for tangibles and abide without thirst with a mind inwardly at peaceWhat would you say to him Magandiya Nothing Master GotamaMagandiya formerly when I lived the home life I enjoyed myself provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure with forms cognizable by the eyewith sounds cognizable by the earwith odours cognizable by the nosewith flavours cognizable by the tonguewith tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lustI had three palaces one for the rainy season one for the winter and one for the summerOn a later occasion having understood as they actually are the origin the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of sensual pleasures I abandoned craving for sensual pleasures I removed fever for sensual pleasures and I abide without thirst with a mind inwardly at peaceI see other beings who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures being devoured by craving for sensual pleasuresburning with fever for sensual pleasures indulging in sensual pleasuresWhy is thatSuppose Magandiya a householder or a householders son was rich with great wealth and property and being provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure he might enjoy himself with forms cognizable by the eyewith sounds cognizable by the earwith odours cognizable by the nosewith flavours cognizable by the tonguewith tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lustHaving conducted himself well in body speech and mind on the dissolution of the body after death he might reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world in the retinue of the gods of the ThirtythreeSuppose he saw a householder or a householders son enjoying himself provided and endowed with the five cords of human sensual pleasureWhat do you think Magandiya Would that young god surrounded by the group of nymphs in the Nandana Grove enjoying himself provided and endowed with the five cords of divine sensual pleasure envy the householder or the householders son for the five cords of human sensual pleasure or would he return to human sensual pleasures No Master GotamaWhy notBecause heavenly sensual pleasures are more excellent and sublime than human sensualpleasuresSo too Magandiya formerly when I lived the home life I enjoyed myself provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure with forms cognizable by the eyewith tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lustOn a later occasion having understood as they actually are the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of sensual pleasures I abandoned craving for sensual pleasures I removed fever for sensual pleasures and I abide without thirst with a mind inwardly at peaceI see other beings who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures being devoured by craving for sensual pleasures burning with fever for sensual pleasures indulging in sensual pleasures and I do not envy them nor do I delight thereinWhy is thatBecause there is Magandiya a delight apart from sensual pleasures apart from unwholesome states which surpasses divine bliss Since I take delight in that I do not envy what is inferior nor do I delight thereinSuppose Magandiya there was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs being devoured by worms scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails cauterising his body over a burning charcoal pitThen his friends and companions his kinsmen and relatives would bring a physician to treat himThe physician would make medicine for himThen he might see another leper with sores and blisters on his limbs being devoured by worms scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails cauterising his body over a burning charcoal pitWhat do you think Magandiya Would that man envy that leper for his burning charcoal pit or his use of medicine No Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause when there is sickness medicine has to be made and when there is no sickness medicine does not have to be madeSo too Magandiya formerly when I lived the home lifeas in Since I take delight in that I do not envy what is inferior nor do I delight thereinSuppose Magandiya there was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs being devoured by worms scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails cauterising his body over a burning charcoal pitThen his friends and companions his kinsmen and relatives brought a physician to treat himThe physician would make medicine for himThen two strong men would seize him by both arms and drag him towards a burning charcoal pitWhat do you think Magandiya Would that man twist his body this way and that Yes Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause that fire is indeed painful to touch hot and scorchingWhat do you think Magandiya Is it only now that that fire is painful to touch hot and scorching or previously too was that fire painful to touch hot and scorching Master Gotama that fire is now painful to touch hot and scorching and previously too that fire was painful to touch hot and scorchingFor when that man was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs being devoured by worms scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails his faculties were impaired thus though the fire was actually painful to touch he mistakenly perceived it as pleasantSo too Magandiya in the past sensual pleasures were painful to touch hot and scorching in the future sensual pleasures will be painful to touch hot and scorching and now at present sensual pleasures are painful to touch hot and scorchingBut these beings who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures who are devoured by craving for sensual pleasures who burn with fever for sensual pleasures have faculties that are impaired thus though sensual pleasures are actuallypainful to touch they acquire a mistaken perception of them as pleasantSuppose Magandiya there was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs being devoured by worms scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails cauterising his body over a burning charcoal pitthe more he scratches the scabs and cauterises his body the fouler more evilsmelling and more infected the openings of his wounds would become yet he would find a certain measure of satisfaction and enjoyment in scratching the openings of his woundsWhat do you think Magandiya Have you ever seen or heard of a king or a kings minister enjoying himself provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure who without abandoning craving for sensual pleasures without removing fever for sensual pleasures was able to abide free from thirst with a mind inwardly at peace or who is able or who will be able to so abide No Master GotamaGood MagandiyaI too have never seen or heard of a king or a kings minister enjoying himself provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure who without abandoning craving for sensual pleasures without removing fever for sensual pleasures was able to abide free from thirst with a mind inwardly at peace or who is able or who will be able to so abideOn the contrary Magandiya those recluses or brahmins who abided or abide or will abide free from thirst with a mind inwardly at peace all do so after having understood as they actually are the origin the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of sensual pleasures and it is after abandoning craving for sensual pleasures and removing fever for sensual pleasures that they abided or abide or will abide free from thirst with a mind inwardly at peaceThen at that point the Blessed One uttered this exclamationThe greatest of all gains is health Nibbana is the greatest blissThe eightfold path is the best of paths For it leads safely to the DeathlessWhen this was said the wanderer Magandiya said to the Blessed One It is wonderful Master Gotama it is marvellousWe too have heard this said by earlier wanderers in the tradition of the teachers and it agrees Master GotamaBut Magandiya when you heard that said by earlier wanderers in the tradition of the teachers what is that health what is that Nibbana When this was said the wanderer Magandiya rubbed his limbs with his hands and said This is that health Master Gotama this is that NibbanaMagandiya suppose there was a man born blind who could not see dark and light forms who could not see blue yellow red or pink forms who could not see what was even and uneven who could not see the stars or the sun and moonHe might hear a man with good eyesight saying Good indeed sirs is a white cloth beautiful spotless and clean Then a man would cheat him with a dirty soiled garment thus Good man here is a white cloth for you beautiful spotless and cleanAnd he would accept it and put it on and being satisfied with it he would utter words of satisfaction thus Good indeed sirs is a white cloth beautiful spotless and cleanWhat do you think Magandiya When that man born blind accepted that dirty soiled garment put it on and being satisfied with it uttered words of satisfaction thus Good indeed sirs is a white cloth beautiful spotless and clean   did he do so knowing and seeing or out of faith in the man with good eyesight Venerable sir he would have done so unknowing and unseeing out of faith in the man with good eyesightSo too Magandiya the wanderers of other sects are blind and visionless They do not know health they do not see Nibbana yet they utter this stanza thus The greatest of all gains is health Nibbana is the greatest blissThis stanza was uttered by the earlier Accomplished Ones Fully Enlightened Ones thusThe greatest of all gains is health Nibbana is the greatest blissThe eightfold path is the best of paths For it leads safely to the DeathlessNow it has gradually become current among ordinary peopleYou do not have that noble vision Magandiya by means of which you might know health and see NibbanaI have confidence in Master Gotama thusThen his friends and companions his kinsmen and relatives would bring a physician to treat himThe physician would make a medicine for himWhat do you think Magandiya would that doctor reap weariness and disappointment  Yes Master Gotama So too Magandiya if I were to teach you the Dhamma thus This is that health this is that Nibbana you might not know health or see NibbanaI have confidence in Master Gotama thusHe might hear a man with good eyesight saying Good indeed sirs is a white cloth beautiful spotless and clean and he would go in search of a white clothThen a man would cheat him with a dirty soiled garment thus Good man here is a white cloth for you beautiful spotless and cleanAnd he would accept it and put it onThen his friends and companions his kinsmen and relatives would bring a physician to treat himThe physician would make medicine  emetics and purgatives ointments and counterointments and nasal treatment Together with the arising of his vision his desire and liking for that dirty soiled garment would be abandonedSo too Magandiya if I were to teach you the Dhamma thus This is that health this is that NibbanaTogether with the arising of your vision your desire and lust for the five aggregates affected by clinging might be abandoned Then perhaps you might think Indeed I have long been tricked cheated and defrauded by this mindFor when clinging I have been clinging just to material form I have been clinging just to feeling I have been clingingjust to perception I have been clinging just to formations I have been clinging just to consciousnessI have confidence in Master Gotama thusThen Magandiya associate with true menWhen you associate with true men you will hear the true Dhamma When you hear the true Dhamma you will practise in accordance with the true DhammaWhen you practise in accordance with the true Dhamma you will know and see for yourself thus These are diseases tumours and darts but here these diseases tumours and darts cease without remainderWhen this was said the wanderer Magandiya said Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master GotamaMaster Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see formsI would receive the going forth under Master Gotama I would receive the full admissionMagandiya one who formerly belonged to another sect and desires the going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline lives on probation for four months At the end of four months if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him they give him the going forth and the full admission to the bhikkhus stateBut I recognise individual differences in this matterVenerable sir if those who formerly belonged to another sect and desire the going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline live on probation for four months and if at the end of the four months the bhikkhus being satisfied with them give them the going forth and the full admission to the bhikkhus state then I will live on probation for four years At the end of the four years if the bhikkhus are satisfied with me let them give me the going forth and the full admission to the bhikkhus stateAnd soon not long after his full admission dwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and resolute the venerable Magandiya by realising for himself with direct knowledge here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessnessWhen he had wandered for alms in Kammasadhamma and had returned from his almsround after his meal he went to a certain grove for the days abidingThere he saw a spread of grass preparedfor then the wanderer Magandiya while walking and wandering for exercise came to the brahmins fire chamber and went up to the Blessed Onethat has been tamed by the Tathagata guarded protected and restrained and he teaches the Dhamma for its restraintThe ear delights in soundThe nose delights in odoursThe tongue delights in flavoursThe body delights in tangiblesThe mind delights in mindobjects takes delight in mindobjects rejoices in mindobjectsthat has been tamed by the Tathagata guarded protected and restrained and he teaches the Dhamma for its restraintand I do not envy them nor do I delight thereinBecause there is Magandiya a delight apart from sensual pleasures apart from unwholesome states which surpasses divine bliss Since I take delight in that I do not envy what is inferior nor do I delight thereinAnd at that time the youth Subha Todeyyas son was staying at Savatthi on some business Quite secluded from sense pleasures  He enters and Dwells in the first Jhna This is said in order to show the higher distinctions when the mind is concentrated by access concentration and to show the divisions of concentration when the mind is concentrated by absorption concentrationHe drenches steeps saturates and suffuses his body with this rapture and happiness born of seclusion He drenches he moistens he extends rapture and happiness everywhereSteeps he applies all aroundSaturates he fills as if filling a bellows with airSuffuses he pervades all aroundThere is no part of his entire body in this bhikkhus body with all its parts in the place where the kammically acquired material continuity occurs there is not even the slightest place consisting of skin flesh and blood which is not suffused by the happiness of the first jhnaHis body the material body composed of the four elementsand by means of that medicine the man would be cured of his leprosy and would become well and happy independent master of himself able to go where he likesIn the simile for the second jhna the material body is like the lakeand the happiness of the second jhna is like the waterSo too Magandiya beings who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures who are devoured by craving for sensual pleasures who burn with fever for sensual pleasures still indulge in sensual pleasures the more such beings indulge in sensual pleasures the more their craving for sensual pleasures increases and the more they are burned by their fever for sensual pleasures yet they find a certain measure of satisfaction and enjoyment in dependence on the five cords of sensual pleasurehow well that has been expressed by Master Gotama The greatest of all gains is health Nibbana is the greatest blissfor I am now healthy and happy and nothing afflicts meIn the simile for the fourth jhna the white cloth is mentioned for the purpose of showing suffusion by heatFor there is no suffusion by heat with a soiled cloth with a clean cloth that has just been washed the suffusion by heat is strongFor in this simile the material body is like the cloth and the happiness of the fourth jhna is like the suffusion by heatTherefore just as when a man has bathed well and is sitting covered from the head down by a clean cloth the heat from his body suffuses the entire clothIt is in this way that the meaning should be seen hereA stepbystep explanation of the four jhnas and of the method of developing them is given in the Visuddhimagga Thus they are not explained in detail hereIt should not be thought that at this point only the one who gains the materialform jhnas has been shown but not the one who gains the immaterial jhnasFor there can be no achievement of the higher direct knowledges without achieving mastery in fourteen ways over the eight meditative attainmentsand he would go in search of a white clothIn the text only the materialform jhnas have come downbut the immaterial jhnas should be brought in and explainedAnd although this body Magandiya is a disease a tumour a dart a calamity and an affliction referring to this body you say This is that health Master Gotama this is that NibbanaMaster Gotama is capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I can come to know health and to see NibbanaMagandiya suppose there was a man born blind who could not see dark and light formsor the sun and moonyet by means of that medicine the mans vision would not arise or be purifiedsimilarly there is no part of the bhikkhus material body that is not suffused by the happiness of the fourth jhnaso that there is no part of the cloth not suffused by heatand that would be wearisome and troublesome for meMaster Gotama is capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I can come to know health and to see NibbanaMagandiya suppose there was a man born blind who could not see dark and light formsor the sun and moonand by means of that medicine the mans vision would arise and be purifiedthen he might burn with indignation and enmity towards that man and might think that he ought to be killed thus Indeed I have long been tricked cheated and defrauded by this man with this dirty soiled garment when he told me Good man here is a white cloth for you beautiful spotless and cleanyou might know health and see Nibbana When his mind is thus concentrated  and attained to imperturbability He shows that the bhikkhu has achieved mastery over the eight meditative attainments in fourteen waysThe rest should be understood by the method explained in the Visuddhimagga He directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision Here knowledge and vision can mean path knowledge fruition knowledge the knowledge of omniscience reviewing knowledge or insight knowledgeIn the passage What friend is the holy life lived under the Exalted One for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision  path knowledge is called knowledge and visionIn the passage Then the knowledge and vision arose in the Exalted One that lra Klma had died seven days ago  it is the knowledge of omniscienceIn the passage And the knowledge and vision arose in me Unshakable is my liberation this is my last birth  it is reviewing knowledgeBut here when it is said He directs and inclines to knowledge and vision it is insight knowledge that is called knowledge and visionThis is my body  impermanent subject to rubbing and pressing to dissolution and dispersion It is impermanent in the sense of not being after having beenIt is subject to rubbing because it is anointed with perfume etc in order to remove its bad smellIt is subject to pressing because it is massaged to dispel ailments of the limbsIt is subject to dissolution and dispersion because though maintained in such ways it is its very nature to break up and be scatteredTherein six terms signify originationAnd this is my consciousness supported by it and bound up with it Consciousness is supported by and bound up with the body composed of the four primary elementsThe application of the simile of the gem should be understood as followsThe gem is like the material bodyThe man with keen sight is like the bhikkhu who gains insight The time when the man takes the gem in his hand reviews it and clearly knows This is a gemthis is like the time when the bhikkhu is sitting having directed his mind to insight knowledge and the body composed of the four primary elements becomes clear to him The time when it becomes clear to the man This is a thread running through itthis is like the time when the bhikkhu is sitting having directed his mind to insight knowledge and it becomes clear to him that the pentad inclusive of contact or all states of consciousness and mental factors or insight knowledge alone take that as their objectThis insight knowledge immediately precedes the pathIt is also shown here in order to help one who has attained direct knowledge acquire the means for dispelling fearFor when one hears a fearful sound with the divine ear or recollects fearful aggregates with the recollection of past lives or sees a fearful form with the divine eye fear and terror arise if one has not explored as impermanent etc but they do not arise if one has explored as impermanent etcIn the passage This is another superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones a comfortable dwelling that has been achieved  knowledge and vision is fruition knowledgeHe directs and inclines it he makes his mind slant slide and slope in order to produce insight knowledgeWith my clinging as condition being comes to be with being as condition birth with birth as condition ageing and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair come to be Such is the origin of this whole mass of sufferingMaster Gotama is capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I might rise up from this seat cured of my blindnessalso when children have limbs that have been misshapen during their stay in the womb during infancy they are made to lie between the thighs and are pulled and pushed in order that their limbs may acquire the proper shapethe last two terms together with impermanence signify passing awayWith the cessation of my clinging comes cessation of being with the cessation of being cessation of birth with the cessation of birth ageing and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair cease Such is the cessation of this whole mass of sufferingand the thread running through it is like insight knowledgeHe directly knew Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingbut even so it is shown here because there would be no intermediate place for it once the section on the direct knowledges has begunAnd the venerable Magandiya became one of the arahantsFurther it is shown here at the beginning because the happiness of insight is a separate visible fruit of recluseship leading to the acquisition of the happiness of the paths and fruits He creates another body having material form mindmade complete in all its parts not lacking any faculties Mindmade  produced by mindNot lacking any faculties not deprived of any faculties by way of figureFor if the possessor of supernormal power is white then the form he creates will also be whiteIf his earlobes are unpierced the form will also have earlobes which are unpierced Thus it is similar to him in all respectsThe three similes are stated to show the similarity For the reed inside the sheath is similar to its sheathThough in the text it is said Suppose a man were to pull a snake out from its slough as if he were to pull it out with his hand we should understand that he extracts it mentallyFor no one can pull a snake out from its slough A snake abandons its slough by itself alone through four means by abiding in the law of its species by supporting itself against a log or a tree by its strength that is the effort of dragging its body out from the skin and by feeling disgust towards the old skin as if it were devouring its body Thus the statement of the text should be understood to refer to the mental extraction of the snakethe bhikkhus body is similar to the sheath etc and the created form is similar to the reed etcthe sword is similar to its scabbard since they put a round sword into a round scabbard and a flat sword into a flat scabbardthe snakes slough is similar to the snakeand asked the brahmin For whom has this spread of grass been prepared in Master Bharadvajas fire chamber It seems like a recluses bedIndeed Master Bharadvaja it is an ill sight we seebut Master Gotama has anticipated usI lived in the rains palace for the four months of the rainy season enjoying myself with musicians who were all female and I did not go down to the lower palaceand there surrounded by a group of nymphs in the Nandana Grove he would enjoy himself provided and endowed with the five cords of divine sensual pleasureand by means of that medicine the man would be cured of his leprosy and would become well and happy independent master of himself able to go where he likesI go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusThen the wanderer Magandiya received the going forth under the Blessed One and he received the full admissionBut the method of creation here and the following five kinds of direct knowledgethe modes of supernormal power etchave been explained in full detail in the Visuddhimagga Thus they should be understood by the method stated therehere only the similes are additional The application of the similes here is as follows Therein the skilled potter etc is like the bhikkhu who gains the knowledge of the modes of supernormal powerthe wellprepared clay etc is like the knowledge of the modes of supernormal powerand one who becomes anxious and frightened there cannot distinguish the sounds of kettledrum and tambours the Buddha does not mention a desert road but with the word highway shows a safe roadFor when one is travelling leisurely on a safe road free from dangers having placed a cloth over ones head to ward off wind and the heat of the sun one can easily distinguish the aforesaid soundsThe time when the sounds being heard by the man become clear to him is like the time when the divine and human sounds both distant and near become clear to the meditatorIn the simile for the knowledge of encompassing the minds of othersTherein the man who has gone to the three villages is like the one who gains the knowledge of recollecting past lives the three villages like three existences Just as the actions done that day in the three villages become clear to the man so do the actions done in the three existences become evident to the bhikkhu sitting with his mind directed to the knowledge of recollecting past livesthe upperterraced building in the central square is like the bhikkhus material body the man with keen sight standing in the building like the bhikkhu who has attained the divine eye Those entering a house are like those entering the mothers womb by way of relinking those leaving the house are like those leaving the womb those walking along the streets are like those beings who repeatedly wander in sasra those sitting in front in the open air in the central square are like the beings who have arisen here and there in the three realms of existence The time when these people become clear to the man standing on the upper terrace of the buildingthis is like the time when the beings arisen in the three realms of existence become clear to the bhikkhu sitting with his mind directed to the knowledge of the divine eyeand the making of whatever kind of vessel etc he might desire is like the bhikkhus transformations THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Kuru country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and eventually he arrived at a Kuru town named Thullakotthitain the simile for the divine ear element Since a desert road is fearful and dangerousjust as the mark on a young mans face would become evident to him when he examines his facial reflection so the sixteen states of mind of others become evident to the bhikkhu sitting with his mind directed to the knowledge of encompassing the minds of othersIn the simile for the knowledge of recollecting past lives only the three villages gone to that same day are mentioned This statement is made for ease of teachingbut the immaterial realm does not come into the range of the divine eyeIn the simile for the divine eyeThe brahmin householders of Thullakotthita heard The recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan has been wandering in the Kuru country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and has come to ThullakotthitaNow a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessedHe declares this world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas this generation with its recluses and brahmins its princes and its people which he has himself realised with direct knowledgeHe teaches the Dhamma good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing and he reveals a holy life that is utterly perfect and pureNow it is good to see such arahantsThen the brahmin householders of Thullakotthita went to the Blessed One Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side some exchanged greetings with him and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished sat down at one side some extended their hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and sat down at one side some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed Ones presence and sat down at one side some kept silent and sat down at one sideWhen they were seated the Blessed One instructed urged roused and encouraged them with talk on the DhammaNow at that time a clansman named Ratthapala the son of the leading clan in that same Thullakotthita was sitting in the assemblyThen it occurred to him As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is not easy while living in a home to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shellSuppose I shave off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessnessThen the brahmin householders of Thullakotthita having been instructed urged roused and encouraged by the Blessed One with talk on the Dhamma delighted and rejoiced in his words They then rose from their seats and after paying homage to him they departed keeping him on their rightSoon after they had gone the clansman Ratthapala went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to himVenerable sir I wish to shave off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessnessI would receive the going forth under the Blessed One I would receive the full admissionHave you been permitted by your parents Ratthapala to go forth from the home life into homelessness No venerable sir I have not been permitted by my parentsRatthapala Tathagatas do not give the going forth to anyone who does not have his parents permissionVenerable sir I shall see to it that my parents permit me to go forth from the home life into homelessnessThen the clansman Ratthapala rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One he departed keeping him on his right He went to his parents and told them Mother and father as I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is not easy while living in a home to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shellI wish to shave off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessnessGive me permission to go forth from the home life into homelessnessWhen he had said this his parents replied Dear Ratthapala you are our only son dear and beloved You have been raised in comfort brought up in comfortyou know nothing of suffering dear RatthapalaFor the second timeFor the third time the clansman Ratthapala said to his parents Mother and fathergive me permission to go forth from the home life into homelessnessFor the third time his parents replied Dear RatthapalaThen not receiving his parents permission to go forth the clansman Ratthapala lay down there on the bare floor saying Right here I shall either die or receive the going forthThen the clansman Ratthapalas parents said to him Dear Ratthapala you are our only son dear and beloved You have been raised in comfort brought up in comfortGet up dear Ratthapala eat drink and amuse yourself While eating drinking and amusing yourself you can be happy enjoying sensual pleasures and making meritWe do not permit you to go forth from the home life into homelessnessEven in the case of your death we would lose you unwillinglyWhen this was said the clansman Ratthapala was silentFor the second timeFor the third time the clansman Ratthapala was silentThen the clansman Ratthapalas friends went to him and said Friend Ratthapala you are your parents only son dear and beloved You have been raised in comfort brought up in comfortyou know nothing of suffering friend RatthapalaGet up friend Ratthapala eat drink and amuse yourself While eating drinking and amusing yourself you can be happy enjoying sensual pleasures and making meritYour parents do not permit you to go forth from the home life into homelessnessEven in case of your death they would lose you unwillinglyso how could they give you their permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness while you are still livingFor the second timeFor the third time his friends said to him Friend RatthapalaFor the third time the clansman Ratthapala was silentThen the clansman Ratthapalas friends went to his parents and said to them Mother and father the clansman Ratthapala is lying down there on the bare floor having said Right here I shall either die or get the going forthBut if you give him your permission you will see him after he has gone forthAnd if he does not enjoy the going forth what else can he do thenbut return hereThen dears we give the clansman Ratthapala permission to go forth from the home life into homelessnessBut when he has gone forth he must visit his parentsThen the clansman Ratthapalas friends went to him and told him Get up friend Ratthapala Your parents permit you to go forth from the home life into homelessnessBut when you have gone forth you must visit your parentsThe clansman Ratthapala then got up and when he had regained his strength he went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one sideand told him Venerable sir I have my parents permission to go forth from the home life into homelessnessLet the Blessed One give me the going forthWandering by stages he eventually arrived at SavatthiHe directly knew Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingAnd the venerable Ratthapala became one of the arahantsThen the venerable Ratthapala went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one sideand told him Venerable sir I wish to visit my parents if I have the Blessed Ones permissionThen the Blessed One penetrated mentally the thoughts in venerable Ratthapalas mind When he knew that the clansman Ratthapala was incapable of abandoning the training and returning to the low life he told him Now is the time Ratthapala to do as you think fitWandering by stages he eventually arrived at ThullakotthitaThen when it was morning he dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Thullakotthita for almsNow on that occasion the venerable Ratthapalas father was sitting in the hall of the central door having his hair dressedWhen he saw the venerable Ratthapala coming in the distanceThen at his own fathers house the venerable Ratthapala received neither alms nor a polite refusal instead he received only abuseWhile she was doing so she recognised the characteristic features of his hands his feet and his voiceThen she went to his mother and said Please know my lady that my lords son Ratthapala has arrivedGracious If what you say is true you are no longer a slave Then the venerable Ratthapalas mother went to his father and said Please know householder they say that the clansman Ratthapala has arrivedJust then the venerable Ratthapala was eating the old porridge by the wall of a certain shelterHis father went to him and said Ratthapala my dear surely there isand you will be eating old porridgeHow could we have a house householder when we have gone forth from the home life into homelessnessWe are homeless householderWe went to your house but we received neither alms nor a polite refusal there instead we received only abuseCome dear Ratthapala let us go to the houseEnough householder my meal for today is finishedThen dear Ratthapala consent to accept tomorrows mealThe venerable Ratthapala consented in silenceThen knowing that the venerable Ratthapala had consented his father went back to his own house where he had gold coins and bullion made into a large heap and covered it with mats Then he told the venerable Ratthapalas former wives Come daughtersinlaw adorn yourselves with ornaments in the way Ratthapala found you most dear and loveableWhen night had ended the venerable Ratthapalas father had good food of various kinds prepared in his own house and had the time announced to the venerable Ratthapala It is time dear Ratthapala the meal is readyThen it being morning the venerable Ratthapala dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe he went to his own fathers house and sat down on the seat made readyThen his father had the pile of gold coins and bullion uncovered and said Dear Ratthapala this is your maternal fortune your paternal fortune is another and your ancestral fortune is yet anotherDear Ratthapala you can enjoy the wealth and make meritCome then dear abandon the training and return to the low life enjoy the wealth and make meritHouseholder if you would follow my advice then have this pile of gold coins and bullion loaded on carts and carried away to be dumped midstream in the river GangesWhy is thatBecause householder on account of this there will arise for you sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairThen the venerable Ratthapalas former wives clasped his feet and said to him What are they like my lords son the nymphs for whose sake you lead the holy life We do not lead the holy life for the sake of nymphs sistersOur lords son Ratthapala calls us sisters they cried and right there they faintedThen the venerable Ratthapala told his father Householder if there is a meal to be given then give it Do not harass usEat then dear Ratthapala the meal is readyThen with his own hands the venerable Ratthapalas father served and satisfied him with the various kinds of good foodWhen the venerable Ratthapala had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl he stood up and uttered these stanzasBehold a puppet here pranked outA body built up out of soresSick an object for concernWhere no stability abidesBehold a figure here pranked outWith jewellery and earrings tooA skeleton wrapped up in skinMade attractive by its clothesIts feet adorned with henna dye And powder smeared upon its faceIt may beguile a fool but not A seeker of the further shoreIts hair is dressed in eightfold plaits And unguent smeared upon its eyesIt may beguile a fool but not A seeker of the further shoreA filthy body well adorned Like a newpainted unguent potIt may beguile a fool but not A seeker of the further shoreThe deerhunter set out the snare But the deer did not spring the trapWe ate the bait and now depart Leaving the hunters to lamentAfter the venerable Ratthapala had stood up and uttered these stanzas he went to King Koravyas Migacira garden and sat down at the root of a tree for the days abidingThen King Koravya addressed his gamekeeper thus Good gamekeeper tidy up the Migacira Garden so that we may go to the pleasure garden to see a pleasing spot Yes sire he replied Now while he was tidying up the Migacira Garden the gamekeeper saw the venerable Ratthapala seated at the root of a tree for the days abidingWhen he saw him he went to King Koravya and told him Sire the Migacira Garden has been tidied upThe clansman Ratthapala is there the son of the leading clan in this same Thullakotthita of whom you have always spoken highly he is seated at the root of a tree for the days abidingThen good Migava enough of the pleasure garden for todayNow we shall go to pay respects to that Master RatthapalaThen saying Give away all the food that has been prepared there King Koravya had a number of state carriages prepared and mounting one of them accompanied by the other carriages he drove out from Thullakotthita with the full pomp of royalty to see the venerable RatthapalaHe drove thus as far as the road was passable for carriages and then he dismounted from his carriage and went forward on foot with a following of the most eminent officials to where the venerable Ratthapala wasHe exchanged greetings with the venerable Ratthapala and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished he stood at one sideand said Here is an elephant rug Let Master Ratthapala be seated on itThere is no need great king Sit down I am sitting on my own matKing Koravya sat down on a seat made readyand saidMaster Ratthapala there are four kinds of loss Because they have undergone these four kinds of loss some people here shave off their hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessnessWhat are the fourThey are loss through ageing loss through sickness loss of wealth and loss of relativesAnd what is loss through ageingHere Master Ratthapala someone is old aged burdened with years advanced in life come to the last stageHe considers thus I am old aged burdened with years advanced in life come to the last stageIt is no longer easy for me to acquire unacquired wealth or to augment wealth already acquiredSuppose I shave off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessnessBecause he has undergone that loss through ageing he shaves off his hair and beard puts on the yellow robe and goes forth from the home life into homelessnessThis is called loss through ageingBut Master Ratthapala is now still young a blackhaired young man endowed with the blessing of youth in the prime of lifeMaster Ratthapala has not undergone any loss through ageingWhat has he known or seen or heard that he has gone forth from the home life into homelessnessAnd what is loss through sicknessHere Master Ratthapala someone is afflicted suffering and gravely illHe considers thus I am afflicted suffering and gravely illIt is no longer easy for me to acquire unacquired wealthinto homelessnessBecause he has undergone that loss through sicknessThis is called loss through sicknessBut Master Ratthapala now is free from illness and affliction he possesses a good digestion that is neither too cool nor too warm but mediumMaster Ratthapala has not undergone any loss through sicknessWhat has he known or seen or heard that he has gone forth from the home life into homelessnessAnd what is loss of wealthHere Master Ratthapala someone is rich of great wealth of great possessionsGradually his wealth dwindles awayHe considers thus Formerly I was rich of great wealth of great possessionsGradually my wealth has dwindled awayIt is no longer easy for me to acquire unacquired wealthBecause he has undergone that loss of wealthhe goes forth from the home life into homelessnessThis is called loss of wealthBut Master Ratthapala is the son of the leading clan in this same ThullakotthitaMaster Ratthapala has not undergone any loss of wealthWhat has he known or seen or heard that he has gone forth from the home life into homelessnessAnd what is loss of relativesHere Master Ratthapala someone has many friends and companions kinsmen and relativesGradually those relatives of his dwindle awayHe considers thus Formerly I had many friends and companions kinsmen and relativesGradually those relatives of mine have dwindled awayIt is no longer easy for me to acquire unacquired wealthBecause he has undergone that loss of relativeshe goes forth from the home life into homelessnessThis is called loss of relativesBut Master Ratthapala has many friends and companions kinsmen and relatives in this same ThullakotthitaMaster Ratthapala has not undergone any loss of relativesWhat has he known or seen or heard that he has gone forth from the home life into homelessnessMaster Ratthapala these are the four kinds of loss Because they have undergone these four kinds of loss some people here shave off their hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessnessMaster Ratthapala has not undergone any of theseWhat has he known or seen or heard that he has gone forth from the home life into homelessness Great king there are four summaries of the Dhamma that have been taught by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened Knowing and seeing and hearing them I went forth from the home life into homelessnessWhat are the fourLife in any world is unstable it is swept away this is the first summary of the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened

taught by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened Knowing and seeing and hearing them I went forth from the home life into homelessnessMaster Ratthapala said Life in any world is unstable it is swept awayHow should the meaning of that statement be understood What do you think great king When you were twenty or twentyfive years old were you an expert rider of elephants an expert horseman an expert charioteer an expert archer an expert swordsman strong in thighs and arms sturdy capable in battle When I was twenty or twentyfive years old Master Ratthapala I was an expert rider of elephantsstrong in thighs and arms sturdy capable in battleSometimes I wonder if I had supernormal power then I do not see anyone who could equal me in strengthWhat do you think great king Are you now as strong in thighs and arms as sturdy and as capable in battle No Master RatthapalaNow I am old aged burdened with years advanced in life come to the last stage my years have turned eightySometimes I mean to put my foot here and I put my foot somewhere elseGreat king it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened said Life in any world is unstable it is swept away and when I knew and saw and heard this I went forth from the home life into homelessnessIt is wonderful Master Ratthapala it is marvellousMaster Ratthapala there exist in this court elephant troops and cavalry and chariot troops and infantry which will serve to subdue any threats to usNow Master Ratthapala said Life in any world has no shelter and no protectorHow should the meaning of that statement be understood What do you think great king Do you have any chronic ailment I have a chronic wind ailment Master RatthapalaSometimes my friends and companions kinsmen and relatives stand around me thinking Now King Koravya is about to die now King Koravya is about to die What do you think great king Can you command your friends and companions your kinsmen and relatives Come my good friends and companions my kinsmen and relatives All of you present share this painful feeling so that I may feel less pain Or do you have to feel that pain yourself alone I cannot command my friends and companions my kinsmen and relatives thus Master RatthapalaI have to feel that pain aloneGreat king it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened said Life in any world has no shelter and no protector and when I knew and saw and heard this I went forth from the home life into homelessnessIt is wonderful Master Ratthapala it is marvellousIt is indeed soMaster Ratthapala there exist in this court abundant gold coins and bullion stored away in vaults and depositoriesNow Master Ratthapala said Life in any world has nothing of its own one has to leave all and pass onHow should the meaning of that statement be understood What do you think great king You now enjoy yourself provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure but will you be able to have it of the life to come Let me likewise enjoy myself provided and endowed with these same five cords of sensual pleasure Or will others take over this property while you will have to pass on according to your actions I cannot have it thus of the life to come Master RatthapalaOn the contrary others will take over this property while I shall have to pass on according to my actionsGreat king it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened said Life in any world has nothing of its own one has to leave all and pass on and when I knew and saw and heard this I went forth from the home life into homelessnessIt is wonderful Master Ratthapala it is marvellousIt is indeed soNow Master Ratthapala said Life in any world is incomplete insatiate the slave of cravingHow should the meaning of that statement be understood What do you think great king Do you reign over the rich Kuru country Yes Master Ratthapala I doWhat do you think great king Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man came to you from the east and saidThere are plenty of elephant troops there plenty of cavalry chariot troops and infantryWith your present forces you can conquer itConquer it then great king What would you do We would conquer it and reign over it Master RatthapalaWhat do you think great king Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man came to you from the westfrom the northfrom the southConquer it then great king What would you do Great king it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened said Life in any world is incomplete insatiate the slave of craving and when I knew and saw and heard this I went forth from the home life into homelessnessIt is wonderful Master Ratthapala it is marvellousIt is indeed so That is what the venerable Ratthapala saidAnd having said that he said furtherhe sat down at one side and said to the Blessed One Venerable sir as I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is not easy while living in a home to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shellEven in case of your death we would lose you unwillinglyso how could we give you our permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness while you are still living how could we give you our permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness while you are still livingso how could we give you our permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness while you are still livinghow could we give you our permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness while you are still living When his mind is thus concentrated  he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers When his mind is thus concentrated here the mind of the fourth jhna used as the basis for insight should be understoodTo the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers for the purpose of producing the knowledge of the destruction of the cankersAnd here the path the fruit Nibbna and dissolution are called the destruction of the cankers In the passage knowledge of destruction knowledge of nonarising  the path is called the destruction of the cankersIn the passage Through the destruction of the cankers one is a recluse  it is the fruitIn the passage He who seeks anothers faults Who is ever censoriousHis cankers grow He is far From the destruction of the cankers it is NibbnaAnd in the passage The destruction of the cankers their falling away breakup impermanence and disappearance  it is dissolution Here Nibbna is intendedKnowing and seeing thus  The Buddha explains the path which has reached its peak together with insightHis mind is liberated  from the canker of ignorance When it is liberated the knowledge arises It is liberated By the phrase his mind is liberated the Buddha shows the moment of the pathBy the passage destroyed is birth etc he shows the plane of the reviewing knowledgeAnd how does he understand thisIt is not a past birth that is destroyed for that was already destroyed previouslyIt is not a future one for there is no effort in regard to the futureAnd it is not the present one because that presently existsReply It is the birth which would have arisen if the path had not been fully developed consisting of one four or five aggregates in one four or fiveconstituent existence respectively By the fully developed state of the path that birth is destroyed because it has become impossible for it to arise in the futureHaving reviewed the defilements abandoned by the development of the path he knows that in the absence of defilements even though action occurs it does not bring about relinking in the futureFor the seven learners together with the good worldling are said to be living the holy life the one with cankers destroyed to have lived the holy lifeTherefore reviewing his own living of the holy life he understands The holy life has been livedThe meaning is that the defilements to be abandoned by each path have been abandoned and the root of suffering has been eradicatedFor the good worldling etc are doing what has to be done the one with cankers destroyed has done what had to be doneHence he understands Beyond this presently existing continuum of aggregates occurring in such a mode there is for me no further continuum of aggregatesAt this point ten kinds of knowledge have been expounded insight knowledge the knowledge of the mindmade body the knowledge of the modes of supernormal power the knowledge of the divine ear the knowledge of encompassing the minds of others the knowledge of recollecting past lives the pairthe knowledge of the future and the knowledge of faring on in accordance with kammaaccomplished by means of the divine eye the knowledge of the divine eye  and the knowledge of the destruction of the cankersThe analysis of their objects should be known Therein insight knowledge has seven kinds of objects limited and exalted past future and present internal and externalThe knowledge of the mindmade body takes as its object only the created form base thus its object is limited present and externalThe knowledge of the destruction of the cankers has an object which is immeasurable external and not describable For the rest the division of their objects has been explained in the Visuddhimagga And great king there is no other fruit of recluseship higher or more sublime than this one The Exalted One concludes the teaching with its culmination in arahatship thus There is no fruit of recluseship better in any way than this onethe path of arahatship is also appropriateHe understands as it really is this is suffering He understands as it really is by penetration of its specific essential characteristic the entire truth of suffering thus There is this much suffering and none beyond thisHe directs and inclines  he makes the insight consciousness slant slide and slope in that directionAnd he understands as it really is by penetration of its specific essential characteristic the craving which produces that suffering thus This is the origin of sufferingHe understands as it really is these are the cankers Having shown the truths in their specific identity the Buddha speaks the following passage about the cankers to show them again figuratively by way of the defilementsand the state by the attainment of which both suffering and its origin cease Nibbna their non occurrence thus This is the cessation of suffering and the noble path which brings about its attainment thus This is the way leading to the cessation of sufferingby the phrase when it is liberated the moment of the fruitand by the phrase the knowledge arises It is liberated the moment of reviewing knowledgeHe understands Destroyed is birth  there is nothing further beyond this Query What birth of his is destroyedfor when the one who has destroyed the cankers reviews with that knowledge he understands Destroyed is birth etcThus he understands Destroyed is birthThe holy life has been lived the holy life of the path has been fully livedWhat had to be done has been done the sixteen tasks have been completed by way of the full understanding abandonment realization and development of the Four Noble Truths by the four pathsTherefore reviewing what had to be done by himself he understands What had to be done has been doneThere is nothing further beyond this  he understands Now there is no task of developing the path to be done by me again for this state that is for the the sixteen tasks or for the destruction of the defilementsOr else this can be understood as beyond thisFor the third time his parents said to himDear RatthapalaThese five aggregates stand fully understood cut off at the root like trees With the cessation of the last state of consciousness they will be extinguished like a fire without fuel and will go to the indescribable stateyou know nothing of suffering dear Ratthapala Great king suppose in a mountain glen  The time when the oystershells etc become clear to the man with keen sight standing on the bank seeing themthis is like the time when the Four Noble Truths become clear to the bhikkhu sitting having directed his mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankersHaving listened carefully to the beginning middle and end of the discourse applauding it here and there the king thought For a long time I have asked the ordinary recluses and brahmins these questions but as if threshing chaff I did not gain anything essential Oh the Exalted One is endowed with such excellent qualities He answers these questions of mine creating a great light as if he were lighting a thousand lamps for meFor a long time I have been deceived not knowing the spiritual power of the Buddhas excellent qualities  As he thus recollected the excellent qualities of the Buddha his body was suffused by the five kinds of rapture Revealing his own confidence he then declared himself a lay followerTo show this the passage that begins When the Exalted One had finished speaking is undertakenExcellent venerable sir Excellent venerable sir  The word excellent is used here as an expression of appreciationof fear anger praise haste excitement astonishmentHere it should be understood the repeated exclamation is stated by way of confidence and praiseOr else excellent means extremely lovely extremely desirable extremely pleasing extremely goodHere by one exclamation of excellent the king extols the teaching by the other his own confidenceThis is the purport here Excellent venerable sir is the Exalted Ones teaching of the DhammaExcellent is my confidence dependent on the Exalted Ones teaching of the DhammaThus the statement may be interpreted as follows The word of the Exalted One is excellent because it destroys faults excellent because it promotes the achievement of excellent qualitiesSimilarly because it generates faith and generates wisdom because it possesses meaning and is well phrased because it is clear in terminology and deep in meaning because it is pleasant to the ear and wins the heart because it does not extol himself and does not disparage others because it is cooled by compassion and cleansed by wisdom because it is delightful to listen to and can withstand examination because it is pleasant when heard and beneficial when investigated and so onThe king next extols the teaching with four similesThis is the interpretation of the purportJust as if one were to reveal what was hidden so the Exalted One has revealed the dispensation which had been hidden by the jungle of wrong views from the time the dispensation of the Exalted Buddha Kassapa disappeared Just as if one were to point out the right path to one who was lost so when I was travelling along a false path a wrong path the Exalted One disclosed to me the path to heaven and to liberationAnd just as if one were to bring a lamp into a dark place so when I was submerged in the darkness of delusion and could not see the gemlike forms of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sagha the Exalted One brought me the lamp of the teaching which dispels the darkness of delusion concealing those forms Because the Dhamma has been revealed to me in these ways by the Exalted One the Exalted One has revealed the Dhamma in numerous waysI go for refuge to the Exalted One to the Dhamma and to the Bhikkhu Sagha Having thus extolled the teaching expressing his confidence with a mind of confidence in the Triple Gem he says I go for refuge to the Exalted One etcThis last explanation is given because verbal roots which have the meaning going also have the meaning understanding For this has been said Bhikkhus to whatever extent there are things which are conditioned the Noble Eightfold Path is declared the best of them The Dhamma is not only the noble path and NibbnaFor this is said in the Story of the Heavenly Mansion of the Brahmin Youth ChattaHere the fading of lust is the pathThe Saṅgha consists of those who are united through unity of view and moral discipline In denotation it is the assembly of the eight noble individualsFor this is said in the Story of ChattaThe Bhikkhu Saṅgha is the Saṅgha of bhikkhuslaughter sorrow and confidence  An intelligent person repeats a phrase on occasionshow could they give you their permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness while you are still livingSo give him your permission to go forth from the home life into homelessnessWhen this was said the clansman Ratthapala was silentNow if you do not give him your permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness he will die thereThen the clansman Ratthapala received the going forth under the Blessed One and he received the full admission Before long dwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and resolute the venerable Ratthapala by realising for himself with direct knowledge here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessnessThen the venerable Ratthapala rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One he departed keeping him on his right He then set his resting place in order and taking his bowl and outer robe set out to wander towards ThullakotthitaAs he was wandering for alms from house to house in Thullakotthita he came to his own fathers houseThere he lived in Thullakotthita in King Koravyas Migacira Gardenhe said Our only son dear and beloved was made to go forth by these baldpated reclusesJust then a slavewoman belonging to one of his relatives was about to throw away some old porridgeSeeing this the venerable Ratthapala said to her Sister if that stuff is to be thrown away then pour it into my bowl hereIs there not your own house to go to he goes forth from the home life into homelessnessinto homelessnessinto homelessnesshow well that has been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened Life in any world is unstable it is swept awayIt is indeed sohow well that has been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened Life in any world has no shelter and no protectorhow well that has been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened Life in any world has nothing of its own one has to leave all and pass onPlease know great king that I have come from the east and there I saw a large country powerful and rich very populous and crowded with peopleOr else he extols the word of the Exalted One itself referring in each case to a double meaningJust as if one were to turn upright what had been turned upside down so when I had turned away from the true Dhamma and had fallen into a false Dhamma the Exalted One helped me to emerge from that false Dhammathere is plenty of ivory there and plenty of gold coins and bullion both unworked and worked and plenty of women for wivesWe would conquer it too and reign over it Master RatthapalaThe meaning is The Exalted One is my refuge my supreme resort the destroyer of misery the provider of welfareWith this intention I go to the Exalted One I devote myself to him I follow him I attend upon him Or else I know and understand thushow well that has been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened Life in any world is incomplete insatiate the slave of cravingTherefore it is said that I go can also mean I know I understandThe word Dhamma is derived from the verb supports  because it supports those who have achieved the path who have realized cessation who are practicing as instructed preventing them from falling into the four planes of misery In denotation the Dhamma is the noble path and Nibbnabut also the scriptural Dhamma together with the noble fruitsI see men wealthy in the worldThe fading of lust the wishless and the sorrowlessThe unconditioned state attractive Sweet potent well analyzed This Dhamma I approach for refugeA king who has conquered the earth by forceMost other people too not just a kingHis relatives lament and rend their hairthe wishless and the sorrowless is the fruitProdded with stakes he burns upon the pyrethe unconditioned state is NibbānaWhile his heirs take over his wealthand the attractive sweet potent well analyzed is the aggregates of Dhamma analyzed into the three Pitakas Longevity is not acquired with wealth Nor can prosperity banish old ageThe rich and poor alike shall feel Deaths touchBetter is wisdom here than any wealthAs one goes to the womb and the next worldJust as a robber caught in burglarySensual pleasures varied sweet delightfulAs fruits fall from the tree so people tooIn whom gifts given bring great fruit Those four purified pairs of menThose eight persons seers of Dhamma This Saṅgha I approach for refugeTo this extent the king has declared his threefold going for refugeThen not long after the venerable Ratthapala had received the full admission a halfmonth after he had received the full Ratthapala admission the Blessed One having stayed at Thullakotthita as long as he chose set out to wander towards Savatthiand there he lived at Savatthl in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Parkwho yet From ignorance give not their gathered wealthGreedily they hoard away their richesLonging still for further sensual pleasuresAnd rules over the land the ocean boundsIs yet unsated with the seas near shoreAnd hungers for its further shore as wellEncounter death with craving unabatedWith plans still incomplete they leave the corpseDesires remain unsated in the worldCrying Ah me Alas Our love is deadThey bear away the body wrapped in shroudsTo place it on a pyre and burn it thereClad in a shroud he leaves his wealth behindAnd as he dies no relatives or friendsCan offer him shelter and refuge herethis being Must pass on according to his actionsAnd as he dies nothing can follow himNot child nor wife nor wealth nor royal estateShort is this life as all the sages say Eternity it knows not only changeThe fool and sage as well shall feel it tooBut while the fool lies stricken by his follyNo sage will ever tremble at the touchSince by wisdom one gains the final goalWhile failing to reach the goal from life to lifeFor people through ignorance do evil deedsRenewing the successive round of birthsAnother of little wisdom trusting himGoes also to the womb and the next worldIs made to suffer for his evil deedSo people after death in the next worldAre made to suffer for their evil deedsIn many different ways disturb the mindSeeing the danger in these sensual tiesI chose to lead the homeless life O KingBoth young and old fall when this body breaksSeeing this too O King I have gone forthBetter is the recluses life assuredBut something more remains to be doneBut something more remains to be doneI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One on a wandering tour among the Kurus with a large community of monks arrived at Thullakotthita a town of the KurusThe brahmans  householders of Thullakotthita heard it said Gotama the contemplative  the son of the Sakyans having gone forth from the Sakyan clan  has arrived at ThullakotthitaAnd of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread He is indeed a Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone a knower of the cosmos an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed teacher of human  divine beings awakened blessedHe has made known  having realized it through direct knowledge  this world with its devas maras  brahmas its generations with their contemplatives  brahmans their rulers  common peopleHe has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end has expounded the holy life both in its particulars  in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pureIts good to see such a worthy oneSo the brahmans  householders of Thullakotthita went to the Blessed One On arrival some of them bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side Some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one side Some of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palmtopalm over their hearts Some of them sat to one side having announced their name  clan Some of them sat to one side in silenceAs they were sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused and encouraged them with a talk on DhammaNow at that time a clansman named Ratthapala the son of the leading clan in that same Thullakotthita was sitting in that assemblyThe thought occurred to him As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shellWhat if I having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe were to go forth from the household life into homelessness Then the brahmans  householders of Thullakotthita having been instructed urged roused  encouraged by the Blessed Ones talk on Dhamma delighted  rejoiced in his words Rising from their seats bowing down to him they left keeping him on their rightThen Ratthapala not long after the brahmans  householders of Thullakotthita had left approached the Blessed One and on arrivalLord I want  having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe  to go forth from the household life into homelessnessMay I receive the goingforth in the Blessed Ones presence May I

with your death we would not want to be separated from youso how could we  while youre alive  give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessnessThen Ratthapala not getting his parents permission to go forth from the household life into homelessness lay down right there on the bare floor saying Here will be my death or my goingforthAnd he went without food for one day two days three days four five six days He went without food for seven daysHis parents said to him Ratthapala dear you are our only son dear  appealing raised in comfort brought up in

household life into homelessness where else will he goHell return right hereSo please give him permission to go forth from the household life into homelessnessThen dears we give our permission for Ratthapala to go forth from the household life into homelessnessBut when he has gone forth he must visit his parentsThen Ratthapalas friends went to him and said Get up Ratthapala Your parents give their permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessnessBut when you have gone forth you must visit your parentsThen Ratthapala got up and on regaining strength went to the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One I have received my parents permission lord to go forth from the household life into homelessnessMay the Blessed One give me the goingforth Then Ratthapala the clansman obtained the goingforth in the Blessed Ones presence he obtained admissionAnd not long after his admission one half month after his admission the Blessed Onehaving stayed at Thullakotthita as long as he liked  set out wandering to SavatthiWandering by stages he eventually arrived at SavatthiThere he lived at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryAs for Ven Ratthapala  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for the sake of this worldAnd thus Ven Ratthapala became another one of the arahantsThen Ven Ratthapala went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord I want to visit my parents if you give me permissionThen the Blessed One encompassing Ven Ratthapalas awareness with his awareness considered  understoodVen Ratthapala is incapable of leaving the training and reverting to the lower life So he said to him Now is the time Ratthapala for you to do as you see fitThen Ven Ratthapala rising from his seat bowing down to the Blessed One and keeping him on his right departed Putting his lodgings in order and carrying his bowl  robes set out wandering toward ThullakotthitaWandering by stages he eventually arrived at ThullakotthitaThere he stayed in Thullakotthita in King Koravyas Migacira gardenThen early in the morning  putting on his under robe and carrying his bowl  robes  he went into Thullakotthita for almsNow at that time Ven Ratthapalas father was in the middle doorporch having his hair combedHe saw Ven Ratthapala coming from afar and on seeing him So Ven Ratthapala  instead of receiving a gift or a polite refusal at his own fathers house  got nothing but abuseJust then a slavewoman belonging to one of his relatives was about to throw away some dayold porridgeSo Ven Ratthapala said to her Sister if that is to be thrown away pour it here into my bowlWhile she was pouring the dayold porridge into this bowl she recognized his hands feet  voiceSo she went to his mother and said May it please you to know my lady that masterson Ratthapala has arrivedHey if what you say is true I give you your freedom Then Ven Ratthapalas mother went to his father and said May it please you to know householder that they say the clansman Ratthapala has arrivedNow at that time Ven Ratthapala was sitting by a wall eating the dayold porridgeHis father went to him and said

are homeless householder We went to your house but  instead of receiving a gift or a polite refusal  we got nothing but abuseCome dear Ratthapala Lets go homeEnough householder My meal for today is finishedIn that case dear Ratthapala acquiesce to the meal for tomorrowSo Ven Ratthapala acquiesced in silenceUnderstanding Ven Ratthapalas acquiesence his father went to his house and having the floor coated with fresh cow dung had a great heap of gold  silver made two great heaps made  one of gold one of silver  so large that a man standing on the near side could not see a man standing on the far side just as a man standing on the far side could not see a man standing on the near Hiding them behind screens he set out a seat between them surrounded by a curtain Addressing Ven Ratthapalas former wives he said to them Come daughtersinlaw Adorn yourself in the ornaments that our son Ratthapala used to find dear  appealingThen as the night was ending Ven Ratthapalas father had exquisite staple  nonstaple foods prepared in his own house and had the time announced to Ven Ratthapala Its time dear Ratthapala The meal is readyThen early in the morning  putting on his under robe and carrying his bowl  robes  Ven Ratthapala went to his fathers house and on arrival sat down on the seat made readyThen his father revealing the heap of gold  silver said to him This my dear Ratthapala is your mothers inheritance The other is your fathers the other your grandfathers enough that you can enjoy wealth and make meritCome my dear Ratthapala Leave the training and revert to the lower life Enjoy wealth and make merit Householder if youd do as I say you would have this heap of gold  silver loaded on carts and hauled away to be dumped midstream in the river GangesWhy is thatThis wealth will be the cause of your sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairThen clasping each of his feet Ven Ratthapalas former wives said to him What are they like dear masterson those nymphs for whose sake you lead the holy life Sisters we dont lead the holy life for the sake of nymphsSisters he calls us  And they fell down right there in a faintThen Ven Ratthapala said to his father Householder if theres food to be given then give it Dont harass usEat then my dear Ratthapala The meal is readySo with his own hands Ven Ratthapalas father served and satisfied him with exquisite staple and nonstaple foodsWhen he had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl Ven Ratthapala stood up and recited these versesLook at the image beautified a heap of festering wounds shored upill but the object of many resolves where there is nothing lasting or sureLook at the form beautified with earrings  gemsa skeleton wrapped in skin made attractive with clothesFeet reddened with henna a face smeared with powderenough to deceive a fool but not a seeker for the further shoreHair plaited in eight pleats eyes smeared with unguentenough to deceive a fool but not a seeker for the further shoreLike a newly painted unguent pot  a putrid body adornedenough to deceive a fool but not a seeker for the further shoreThe hunter set out the snares but the deer didnt go near the trapHaving eaten the bait we go leaving the hunters to weepAfter reciting these verses while standing Ven Ratthapala went to King Koravyas Migacira On arrival he sat down in the shade of a tree for the days abidingThen King Koravya said to his gamekeeper Clean up the Migacira pleasure garden I am going there to see the beautiful groundsAs you say your majesty the gamekeeper responded to the king As he was cleaning up Migacira he saw Ven Ratthapala sitting in the shade of a tree for the days abidingOn seeing him he went to the king and said Migacira has been cleaned up for you your majestyAnd the clansman Ratthapala  the son of the leading clan in this Thullakotthita of whom you have often spoken highly  is there sitting in the shade of a tree for the days abidingIn that case my dear gamekeeper never mind about the pleasure garden for todayI am now going to pay my respects to that Master RatthapalaThen saying Give away all the staple and nonstaple foods that have been prepared King Koravya had auspicious vehicles harnessed Mounting an auspicious vehicle he set out from Thullakotthita accompanied by other auspicious vehicles in full royal pomp to see Ven RatthapalaGoing as far by vehicle as the ground would permit he dismounted and went to Ven Ratthapala accompanied by many eminent members of his courtOn arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with Ven Ratthapala After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he stood to one sideAs he was standing there he said to Ven Ratthapala May Master Ratthapala sit here on the elephant rugNever mind great king You sit there I am sitting on my own seatSo King Koravya sat down on the seat preparedAs he was sitting there he said to Ven RatthapalaWhich fourLoss through aging loss through illness loss of wealth  loss of relativesWhat did he know or see or hear that Master Ratthapala went forth from the home life into homelessness Great king there are four Dhamma summaries stated by the Blessed One

When you were twenty or twentyfive years old  an expert elephant rider an expert horseman an expert charioteer an expert archer an expert swordsman  were you strong in arm  strong in thigh fit  seasoned in warfare Yes Master Ratthapala when I was twenty or twentyfive years old I was strong in arm  strong in thigh fit  seasoned in warfareIt was as if I had supernormal power I do not see anyone who was my equal in strengthAnd what do you think great king Are you even now as strong in arm  strong in thigh as fit  as seasoned in warfare Not at all Master RatthapalaIm now a feeble old man aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life  years oldSometimes thinking I will place my foot here I place it somewhere elseIt was in reference to this great king that the Blessed

friends  advisors relatives  bloodkinsmen stand around me saying This time King Koravya will dieThis time King Koravya will dieAnd what do you think great king Can you say to your friends  advisors

Or will this wealth fall to others while you pass on in accordance with your kamma Oh no Master Ratthapala I cant say Even in the afterlife I will enjoy myself in the same way endowed  replete with the very same pleasures of the five sensesThis wealth will fall to others while I pass on in accordance with my kammaIt was in reference to this great king that the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened said The world is without ownership One has to pass on leaving everything behind Having known  seen  heard this I went forth from the home life into homelessnessIts amazing Master RatthapalaIts astoundinghow well that has been said by the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened The world is without ownership One has to pass on leaving everything behindFor the world really is without ownership Master Ratthapala One has to pass on leaving everything behindNow Master Ratthapala you say The world is insufficient insatiable a slave to cravingHow is the meaning of this statement to be understood What do you think great king Do you now rule over the prosperous country of Kuru That is so Master Ratthapala I rule over the prosperous country of KuruWhat do you think great king Suppose a trustworthy reliable man of yours were to come to you from the east On arrival he would say to youMay it please your majesty to know I have come from the east There I saw a great country powerful  prosperous populous  crowded with peoplePlenty are the elephant troops there plenty the cavalry troops chariot troops  infantry troopsPlenty is the ivorywork there plenty the gold  silver both worked  unworked Plenty are the women for the takingIt is possible with the forces you now have to conquer itConquer it great king What would you do  Having conquered it Master Ratthapala I would rule over itNow what do you think great king Suppose a trustworthy reliable man of yours were to come to you from the west the north the south the other side of the oceanOn arrival he would say to you May it please your majesty to know I have come from the other side of the ocean There I saw a great country powerful  prosperous populous  crowded with peoplePlenty are the elephant troops there plenty the cavalry troops chariot troops  infantry troopsPlenty is the ivorywork there plenty the gold  silver both worked  unworked Plenty are the women for the takingIt is possible with the forces you now have to conquer itConquer it great king  What would you do Having conquered it Master Ratthapala I would rule over it tooIt was in reference to this great king that the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened said The world is insufficient insatiable a slave to craving Having known  seen  heard this I went forth from the home life into homelessnessIts amazing Master RatthapalaIts astoundinghow well that has been said by the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened The world is insufficient insatiable a slave to cravingFor the world really is insufficient Master Ratthapala Its insatiable a slave to cravingThat is what Ven Ratthapala saidHaving said that he further said thissaid to him As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shellso how could we  while youre alive  give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness A third time Ratthapalas parents said to him Ratthapala dear you are our only son dear  appealing raised in comfort brought up in comfortHow could your parents  while youre alive  give their permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessnessGet up friend Ratthapala Eat drink  enjoy yourselfHow could your parents  while youre alive  give their permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness As he went for alms from house to house in Thullakotthita he came to his own fathers housesaid It was by these shavenheaded contemplatives that our only son dear  appealing was made to go forthThere are cases where having suffered these four kinds of loss men shave off their hair  beard put on the ochre robe and go forth from the home life into homelessnessBut Master Ratthapala has suffered none of theseI see in the world people with wealthwho from delusion dont make a gift of the treasure theyve gainedGreedy they stash it awayhoping for even more sensual pleasuresA king who by force has conquered the worldand rules over the earth to the edge of the seadissatisfied with the oceans near shorelongs for the oceans far shore as wellKings  others  plenty of people go to death with craving unabatedUnsated they leave the body behindhaving not had enough of the worlds sensual pleasuresOnes relatives weep  pull out their hairOh woe our loved one is dead they cryCarrying him off wrapped in a piece of cloththey place him on a pyre then set him on fireSo he burns poked with sticksin just one piece of cloth leaving all his possessions behindThey are not shelters for one who has died not relatives friends or companionsHis heirs take over his wealthwhile the being goes on in line with his kammaNo wealth at all follows the dead one not children wives dominion or richesLong life cant be gotten with wealth nor agingwarded off with treasure The wise say this life is next to nothing  impermanent subject to changeThe rich  the poor touch the touch of DeathThe foolish  wise are touched by it tooBut while fools lie as if slain by their follythe wise dont tremble when touched by the touchThus the discernment by which one attains to mastery is better than wealth for those who havent reached masterygo from existence to existenceout of delusion doing bad deedsOne goes to a womb  to the next worldfalling into the wandering on  one thing after another while those of weak discernment trusting in onealso go to a womb  to the next worldJust as an evil thief caught at the breakinis destroyed by his own actso evil people  after dying in the next world are destroyed by their own actsSensual pleasures  variegated enticing sweet in various ways disturb the mindSeeing the drawbacks in sensual objectsthats why O king I went forthJust like fruits people fall young  old  at the breakup of the bodyKnowing this O king I went forthThe contemplative life is better for sureTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at SavatthI in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThen while the venerable Malunkyaputta was alone in meditation the following thought arose in his mind These speculative views have been undeclared by the Blessed One set aside and rejected by him namely the world is eternal and the world is not eternal the world is finite and the world is infinite the soul is the same as the body and the soul is one thing and the body another and after death a Tathagata exists and after death a Tathagata does not exist and after death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist and after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not existThe Blessed One does not declare these to me and I do not approve of and accept the fact that he does not declare these to meIf he declares to me either the world is eternal or the world is not eternalor after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist then I will lead the holy life under him if he does not declare these to me then I will abandon the training and return to the low lifeThen when it was evening the venerable Malunkyaputta rose from meditation and went to the Blessed OneAfter paying homage to him he sat down at one side and told himHere venerable sir while I was alone in meditation the following thought arose in my mind These speculative views have been undeclared by the Blessed OneIf he does not declare these to me then I will abandon the training and return to the low lifeHow then Malunkyaputta did I ever say to you Come Malunkyaputta lead the holy life under me and I will declare to you the world is eternalor after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist No venerable sir Did you ever tell me I will lead the holy life under the Blessed One and the Blessed One will declare to me the world is eternalor after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist  No venerable sir That being so misguided man who are you and what are you abandoning If anyone should say thus I will not lead the holy life under the Blessed One until the Blessed One declares to me the world is eternalor after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist that would still remain undeclared by the Tathagata and meanwhile that person would dieThe man would say I will not let the surgeon pull out this arrow until I know whether the man who wounded me was a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a worker And he would say I will not let the surgeon pull out this arrow until I know the name and clan of the man who wounded me until I know whether the man who wounded me was tall or short or of middle height until I know whether the man who wounded me was dark or brown or goldenskinned until I know whether the man who wounded me lives in such a village or town or city until I know whether the bow that wounded me was a long bow or a crossbow until I know whether the bowstring that wounded me was fibre or reed or sinew or hemp or bark until I know whether the shaft that wounded me was wild or cultivated until I know with what kind of feathers the shaft that wounded me was fitted  whether those of a vulture or a crow or a hawk or a peacock or a stork until I know with what kind of sinew the shaft that wounded me was bound  whether that of an ox or a buffalo or a lion or a monkey until I know what kind of arrow it was that wounded me  whether it was hooftipped or curved or barbed or calftoothed or oleander All this would still not be known to that man and meanwhile he would dieSo too Malunkyaputta if anyone should say thus I will not lead the holy life under the Blessed One until the Blessed One declares to me the world is eternalor after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exis that would still remain undeclared by the Tathagata and meanwhile that person would dieMalunkyaputta if there is the view the world is eternal the holy life cannot be lived and if there is the view the world is not eternal the holy life cannot be lived Whether there is the view the world is eternal or the view the world is not eternal there is birth there is ageing there is death there are sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair the destruction of which I prescribe here and nowTherefore Malunkyaputta remember what I have left undeclared as undeclared and remember what I have declared as declaredAnd what have I left undeclaredThe world is eternal  I have left undeclared The world is not eternal  I have left undeclared The world is finite  I have left undeclared The world is infinite  I have left undeclared The soul is the same as the body  I have left undeclared The soul is one thing and the body another  I have left undeclared After death a Tathagata exists  I have left undeclared After death a Tathagata does not exist  I have left undeclared After death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist  I have left undeclared After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist  I have left undeclaredWhy have I left that undeclaredBecause it is unbeneficial it does not belong to the fundamentals of the holy life it does not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to NibbanaThat is why I have left it undeclaredAnd what have I declaredThis is suffering  I have declared This is the origin of suffering  I have declared This is the cessation of suffering  I have declared This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering  I have declaredWhy have I declared thatBecause it is beneficial it belongs to the fundamentals of the holy life it leads to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to NibbanaThat is why I have declared itTherefore Malunkyaputta remember what I have left undeclared as undeclared and remember what I have declared as declaredThat is what the Blessed One saidso I shall go to the Blessed One and ask him the meaning of thisIf the Blessed One knows the world is eternal let the Blessed One declare to me the world is eternal if the Blessed One knows the world is not eternal let the Blessed One declare to me the world is not eternalIf the Blessed One does not know either the world is eternal or the world is not eternal then it is straightforward for one who does not know and does not see to say I do not know I do not seeIf the Blessed One knows the world is finitethe world is infinitethe soul is the same as the body the soul is one thing and the body anotherIf the Blessed One does not know either after death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist or after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist then it is straightforward for one who does not know and does not see to say I do not know I do not seeIf the Blessed One knows after death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist let the Blessed One declare that to me if the Blessed One knows after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist let the Blessed One declare that to meafter death a Tathagata existsafter death a Tathagata does not existSuppose Malunkyaputta a man were wounded by an arrow thickly smeared with poisonand his friends and companions his kinsmen and relatives brought a surgeon to treat himIf there is the view the world is finitethe world is infinite the soul is the same as the bodythe soul is one thing and the body anotherafter death a Tathagata existsafter death a Tathagata does not exist the holy life cannot be livedIf there is the view after death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist the holy life cannot be lived and if there is the view after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist the holy life cannot be lived Whether there is the view after death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist or the view after death a

HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthl in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkNow on that occasion the brahmin Janussoni was driving out of Savatthi in the middle of the day in an allwhite chariot drawn by white maresHe saw the wanderer Pilotika coming in the distanceand asked himNow where is Master Vacchayana coming from in the middle of the daySir I am coming from the presence of the recluse GotamaWhat does Master Vacchayana think of the recluse Gotamas lucidity of wisdomHe is wise is he notSir who am I to know the recluse Gotamas lucidity of wisdomOne would surely have to be his equal to know the recluse Gotamas lucidity of wisdomMaster Vacchayana praises the recluse Gotama with high praise indeedSir who am I to praise the recluse GotamaThe recluse Gotama is praised by the praised as best among gods and humansWhat reasons does Master Vacchayana see that he has such confidence in the recluse GotamaSir suppose a wise elephant woodsman were to enter an elephant woodand were to see in the elephant wood a big elephants footprint long in extent and broad acrossHe would come to the conclusion Indeed this is a big bull elephantMaster Vacchaya So too when I saw four footprints of the recluse Gotama I came to the conclusion The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha is practising the good wayWhat are the fourSir I have seen here certain learned nobles who were clever knowledgeable about the doctrines of others as sharp as hairsplitting marksmen they wander about as it were demolishing the views of others with their sharp witsWhen they hear The recluse Gotama will visit such and such a village or townthey formulate a question thus We will go to the recluse Gotama and ask him this questionIf he is asked like this he will answer like this and so we will refute his doctrine in this wayand if he is asked like that he will answer like that and so we will refute his doctrine in that wayThey hear The recluse Gotama has come to visit such and such a village or townThey go to the recluse Gotamaand the recluse Gotama instructs urges rouses and encourages them with a talk on the DhammaAfter they have been instructed urged roused and encouraged by the recluse Gotama with a talk on the Dhamma they do not so much as ask him the question so how should they refute his doctrineIn actual fact they become his disciples When I saw this first footprint of the recluse Gotama I came to the conclusion The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha is practising the good wayAgain I have seen certain learned brahmins who were clever Again I have seen certain learned householders who were clever Again I have seen certain learned recluses who were cleverThey do not so much as ask him the question so how should they refute his doctrineIn actual fact they ask the recluse Gotama to allow them to go forth from the home life into homelessnessand he gives them the going forthNot long after they have gone forth dwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and resolute by realising for themselves with direct knowledge they here and now enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessnessThey say thus We were very nearly lost we very nearly perished for formerly we claimed that we were recluses though we were not really recluses we claimed that we were brahmins through we were not really brahmins we claimed that we were arahants though we were not really arahantsBut now we are recluses now we are brahmins now we are arahantsWhen I saw these four footprints of the recluse Gotama I came to the conclusion The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha is practising the good wayWhen this was said the brahmin Janussoni got down from his allwhite chariot drawn by white mares and arranging his upper robe on one shoulder he extended his hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and uttered this exclamation three times Honour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened Honour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened Honour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedPerhaps some time or other we might meet Master Gotama and have some conversation with himThen the brahmin Janussoni went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideand related to the Blessed One his entire conversation with the wanderer PilotikaThereupon the Blessed One told him At this point brahmin the simile of the elephants footprint has not yet been completed in detailAs to how it is completed in detail listen and attend carefully to what I shall say Yes sir the brahmin Janussoni repliedThe Blessed One said thisBrahmin suppose an elephant woodsman were to enter an elephant woodand were to see in the elephant wood a big elephants footprint long in extent and broad acrossA wise elephant woodsman would not yet come to the conclusion Indeed this is a big bull elephantWhy is thatIn an elephant wood there are small sheelephants that leave a big footprint and this might be one of their footprintsHe follows itand sees in the elephant wood a big elephants footprint long in extent and broad across and some scrapings high upA wise elephant woodsman would not yet come to the conclusion Indeed this is a big bull elephantWhy is thatIn an elephant wood there are tall sheelephants that have prominent teeth and leave a big footprint and this might be one of their footprintsHe follows it furtherand sees in the elephant wood a big elephants footprint long in extent and broad across and some scrapings high up and marks made by tusksA wise elephant woodsman would not yet come to the conclusion Indeed this is a big bull elephantWhy is thatIn an elephant wood there are tall sheelephants that have tusks and leave a big footprint and this might be one of their footprintsHe follows it furtherand sees in the elephant wood a big elephants footprint long in extent and broad across and some scrapings high up and marks made by tusks and brokenoff branchesAnd he sees that bull elephant at the root of a tree or in the open walking about sitting or lying downHe comes to the conclusion This is that big bull elephantSo too brahmin here a Tathagata appears in the world accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessedHe declares this world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas this generation with its recluses and brahmins its princes and its people which he has himself realised with direct knowledgeHe teaches the Dhamma good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing and he reveals a holy life that is utterly perfect and pureA householder or householders son or one born in some other clan hears that DhammaOn hearing the Dhamma he acquires faith in the TathagataPossessing that faith he considers thus Household life is crowded and dusty life gone forth is wide openIt is not easy while living in a home to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shellSuppose I shave off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessnessOn a later occasion abandoning a small or a large fortune abandoning a small or a large circle of relatives he shaves off his hair and beard puts on the yellow robe and goes forth from the home life into homelessnessHaving thus gone forth and possessing the bhikkhus training and way of life abandoning the killing of living beings he abstains from killing living beings with rod and weapon laid aside gentle and kindly he abides compassionate to all living beingsAbandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not given taking only what is given expecting only what is givenby not stealing he abides in purityAbandoning incelibacy he observes celibacy living apart abstaining from the vulgar practice of sexual intercourseAbandoning false speech he abstains from false speech he speaks truth adheres to truth is trustworthy and reliable one who is no deceiver of the worldAbandoning malicious speech he abstains from malicious speech he does not repeat elsewhere what he has heard here in order to divide those people from these nor does he repeat to these people what he has heard elsewhere in order to divide these people from thosethus he is one who reunites those who are divided a promoter of friendships who enjoys concord rejoices in concord delights in concord a speaker of words that promote concordAbandoning harsh speech he abstains from harsh speechhe speaks such words as are gentle pleasing to the ear and loveable as go to the heart are courteous desired by many and agreeable to manyAbandoning gossip he abstains from gossip he speaks at the right time speaks what is fact speaks on what is good speaks on the Dhamma and the Discipline at the right time he speaks such words as are worth recording reasonable moderate and beneficialHe abstains from injuring seeds and plants He practises eating only in one part of the day abstaining from eating at night and outside the proper time He abstains from dancing singing music and theatrical shows He abstains from wearing garlands smartening himself with scent and embellishing himself with unguents He abstains from high and large couches He abstains from accepting gold and silver He abstains from accepting raw grain He abstains from accepting raw meat He abstains from accepting women and girls He abstains from accepting men and women slaves He abstains from accepting goats and sheep He abstains from accepting fowl and pigs He abstains from accepting elephants cattle horses and mares He abstains from accepting fields and land He abstains from going errands and running messages He abstains from buying and selling He abstains from false weights false metals and false Measures He abstains from cheating deceiving defrauding and trickery He abstains from wounding murdering binding brigandage plunder and violenceHe becomes content with robes to protect his body and with almsfood to maintain his stomachand wherever he goes he sets out taking only these with himJust as a bird wherever it goes flies with its wings as its only burden so too the bhikkhu becomes content with robes to protect his body and with almsfood to maintain his stomachand wherever he goes he sets out taking only these with himPossessing this aggregate of noble virtue he experiences within himself a bliss that is blamelessOn seeing a form with the eye he does not grasp at its signs and featuresSince if he left the eye faculty unguarded evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him he practises the way of its restraint he guards the eye faculty he undertakes the restraint of the eye facultyOn hearing a sound with the earOn smelling an odour with the noseOn tasting a flavour with the tongueOn touching a tangible with the bodyOn cognizing a mindobject with the mind he does not grasp at its signs and featuresSince if he left the mind faculty unguarded evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him he practises the way of its restraint he guards the mind faculty he undertakes the restraint of the mind facultyPossessing this noble restraint of the faculties he experiences within himself a bliss that is unsulliedHe becomes one who acts in full awareness when going forward and returning who acts in full awareness when looking ahead and looking away who acts in full awareness when flexing and extending his limbs who acts in full awareness when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl who acts in full awareness when eating drinking consuming food and tasting who acts in full awareness when defecating and urinating who acts in full awareness when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and keeping silentPossessing this aggregate of noble virtue and this noble restraint of the faculties and possessing this noble mindfulness and full awareness he resorts to a secluded resting place the forest the root of a tree a mountain a ravine a hillside cave a charnel ground a jungle thicket an open space a heap of strawOn returning from his almsround after his meal he sits down folding his legs crosswise setting his body erect and establishing mindfulness before himAbandoning covetousness for the world he abides with a mind free from covetousness he purifies his mind from covetousnessAbandoning ill will and hatred he abides with a mind free from ill will compassionate for the welfare of all living beings he purifies his mind from ill will and hatredAbandoning sloth and torpor he abides free from sloth and torpor percipient of light mindful and fully aware he purifies his mind from sloth and torporAbandoning restlessness and remorse he abides unagitated with a mind inwardly peaceful he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorseAbandoning doubt he abides having gone beyond doubt unperplexed about wholesome states he purifies his mind from doubtHaving thus abandoned these five hindrances imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states he enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusionThis brahmin is called a footprint of the Tathagata something scraped by the Tathagata something marked by the Tathagatabut a noble disciple does not yet come to the conclusion The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One

charnel ground a jungle thicket an open space a heap of strawOn returning from his almsround after his meal he sits down folding his legs crosswise setting his body erect and establishing mindfulness before himAbandoning covetousness for the world he abides with a mind free from covetousness he purifies his mind from covetousness Abandoning ill will and hatred he abides with a mind free from ill will compassionate for the welfare of all living beings he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred Abandoning sloth and torpor he abides free from sloth and torpor percipient of light mindful and fully aware he purifies his mind from sloth and torpor Abandoning restlessness and remorse he abides unagitated with a mind inwardly peaceful he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse Abandoning doubt he abides having gone beyond doubt unperplexed about wholesome states he purifies his mind from doubtBhikkhus suppose a man were to take a loan and undertake businessOr suppose a man were afflicted suffering and gravely ill and his food would not agree with him and his body had no strengthOr suppose a man were imprisoned in a prisonhouseOr suppose a man were a slave not selfdependent but dependent on others unable to go where he wantsOr suppose a man with wealth and property were to enter aroad across a desertSo too bhikkhus when these five hindrances are unabandoned in himself a bhikkhu sees them respectively as a debt a disease a prisonhouse slavery and a road across a desert  Having abandoned these five hindrances imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states he enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusionHe makes the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of seclusionJust as a skilled bath man or a bath mans apprentice heaps bath powder in a metal basin and sprinkling it gradually with water kneads it until the moisture wets his ball of bath powderAgain bhikkhus with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentrationHe makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of concentrationJust as though there were a lake whose waters welled up from belowAgain bhikkhus with the fading away as well of rapture a bhikkhu abides in equanimity and mindful and fully aware still feeling pleasure with the body he enters upon and abides in the third jhana on account of which noble ones announce He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindfulHe makes the pleasure divested of rapture drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pleasure divested of raptureJust as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses some lotuses that are born and grow in the water thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it and cool water drenches steeps fills and pervades them to their tips and their roots so that there is no part of all those lotuses unpervaded by cool waterAgain bhikkhus with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana which has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimityHe sits pervading this body with a pure bright jhnana so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pure bright mindJust as though a man were sitting covered from the head down with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his whole body unpervaded by the white cloth  When his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of past livesHe recollects his manifold past lives that is one birth two birthsThus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past livesJust as a man might go from his own village to another village and then back again to his own villageSo too a bhikkhu recollects his manifold past lives Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past livesWhen his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beingsThus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human he sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and he understands how beings pass on according to their actionsWhen his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of the taintsHe understands as it actually is This is suffering This is the origin of suffering This is the cessation of suffering This is the way leading to the cessation of sufferingWhen he knows and sees thus his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of being and from the taint of ignoranceWhen it is liberated there comes the knowledge It is liberated He understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingJust as if there were a lake in a mountain recess clear limpid and undisturbedSo too a bhikkhu understands as it actually is This is suffering He understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being Bhikkhus a bhikkhu such as this is called a recluse a brahmin one who has been washed one who has attained to knowledge a holy scholar a noble one an arahantAnd how is a bhikkhu a recluseHe has quieted down evil unwholesome states that defile bring renewal of being give trouble ripen in suffering and lead to future birth ageing and deathThat is how a bhikkhu is a recluseAnd how is a bhikkhu a brahminHe has expelled evil unwholesome states that defile and lead to future birth ageing and deathThat is how a bhikkhu is a brahminAnd how is a bhikkhu one who has been washedHe has washed off evil unwholesome states that defile and lead to future birth ageing and deathThat is how a bhikkhu is one who has been washedAnd how is a bhikkhu one who has attained to knowledgeHe has known evil unwholesome states that defile and lead to future birth ageing and deathThat is how a bhikkhu is one who has attained to knowledgeAnd how is a bhikkhu a holy scholarThe evil unwholesome states that defileand lead to future birth ageing and death have streamed away from himThat is how abhikkhu is a holy scholarAnd how is a bhikkhu a noble oneEvil unwholesome states that defile and lead to future birth ageing and death are far away from himThat is how a bhikkhu is a noble oneAnd how is a bhikkhu an arahantEvil unwholesome states that defile bring renewal of being give trouble ripen in suffering and lead to future birth ageing and death are far away from himThat is how a bhikkhu is an arahantThat is what the Blessed One saidand so that the services of those whose robes almsfood resting place and medicinal requisites we use shall bring them great fruit and benefit and so that our going forth shall not be in vain but fruitful and fertileWe will guard the doors of our sense faculties On seeing a form with the eye we will not grasp at its signs and featuresand his business were to succeedso that he could repay all the money of the old loan and there would remain enough extra to maintain a wifethen on considering this he would be glad and full of joybut later he would recover from the affliction and his food would agree with him and his body would regain strengththen on considering this he would be glad and full of joybut later he would be released from prison safe and secure with no loss to his propertythen on considering this he would be glad and full of joybut later on he would be released from slavery selfdependent independent of others a freed man able to go where he wantsthen on considering this he would be glad and full of joybut later on he would cross over the desert safe and secure with no loss to his propertythen on considering this he would be glad and full of joyBut when these five hindrances have been abandoned in himself he sees that as freedom from debt healthiness release from prison freedom from slavery and a land of safetyso too a bhikkhu makes the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of seclusionsoaks it and pervades it inside and out yet the ball itself does not oozethen the cool fount of water welling up in the lake would make the cool water drench steep fill and pervade the lake so that there would be no part of the whole lake unpervaded by cool water and would not be replenished from time to time by showers of rainso too a bhikkhu makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of concentrationso too a bhikkhu makes the pleasure divested of rapture drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pleasure divested of rapturego too a bhikkhu sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pure bright mindhe might think I went from my own village to that village and there I stood in such a way sat in such a way spoke in such a way kept silent in such a way and from that village I went to that other village and there I stood in such a way sat in such a way spoke in such a way kept silent in such a way and from that village I came back again to my own villageJust as though there were two houses with doors and a man with good sight standing there between them saw people entering the houses and coming out and passing to and froso too with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human a bhikkhu sees beings passing away and reappearing and he understands how beings pass on according to their actionsThese are the taints This is the origin of the taints This is the cessation of the taints This is the way leading to the cessation of the taintsso that a man with good sight standing on the bank could see shells gravel and pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about and restinghe might think There is this lake clear limpid and undisturbedand there are these shells gravel and pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about and restingThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsand we will not laud ourselves and disparage others on account of that purified bodily conduct  bhikkhus you should train thusand we will not laud ourselves and disparage others on account of that purified verbal conduct  bhikkhus you should train thusand we will not laud ourselves and disparage others on account of that purified mental conduct  bhikkhus you should train thusand we will not laud ourselves and disparage others on account of that purified livelihood  Bhikkhus you should train thusSince if we left the mind faculty unguarded evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade us we will practise the way of its restraint we will guard the mind faculty we will undertake the restraint of the mind faculty  Bhikkhus you should train thusNow bhikkhus you may think thus We are possessed of shame and fear of wrongdoing our bodily conduct verbal conduct mental conduct and livelihood have been purified we guard the doors of our sense faculties we are moderate in eating and we are devoted to wakefulness That much is enough and you may rest content with that muchand it had no inflow from east west north or south and would not be replenished from time to time by showers of rainWhen he feels a feeling terminating with the body he understands I feel a feeling terminating with the body When he feels a feeling terminating with life he understands I feel a feeling terminating with life He understands On the dissolution of the body with the ending of life all that is felt not being delighted in will become cool right hereIt is not inconvenient for me venerable sir Now there was a clansman named Pukkusati who had gone forth from the home life into homelessness out of faith in the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One went to the venerable Pukkusati and said to him If it is not inconvenient for you bhikkhu I will stay one night in the workshopThe potters workshop is large enough friendThen the Blessed One spent most of the night seated in meditationThen the Blessed One thought This clansman conducts himself in a way that inspires confidenceSuppose I were to question himSo he asked the venerable Pukkusati  Under whom have you gone forth bhikkhuWho is your teacherWhose Dhamma do you profess Friend there is the recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clanNow a good report of that Blessed Gotama has been spread to this effect That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessedI have gone forth under that Blessed OneBut bhikkhu where is that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened now living There is friend a city in the northern country named SavatthiThe Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened is now living thereBut bhikkhu have you ever seen that Blessed One before Would you recognise him if you saw him No friend I have never seen that Blessed One before nor would I recognise him if I saw himThen the Blessed One thought This clansman has gone forth from the home life into homelessness under meSuppose I were to teach him the DhammaSo the Blessed One addressed the venerable Pukkusati thus Bhikkhu I will teach you the DhammaListen and attend closely to what I shall say Yes friend the venerable Pukkusati replied Bhikkhu this person consists of six elements six bases of contact and eighteen kinds of mental exploration and he has four foundations The tides of conceiving do not sweep over one who stands upon these foundations and when the tides of conceiving no longer sweep over him he is called a sage at peaceOne should not neglect wisdom should preserve truth should cultivate relinquishment and should train for peace This is the summary of the exposition of the six elementsBhikkhu this person consists of six elements So it was saidAnd with reference to what was this said There are the earth element the water element the fire element the air element the space element and the consciousness elementSo it was with reference to this that it was said Bhikkhu this person consists of six elementsBhikkhu this person consists of six bases of contact So it was saidAnd with reference to what was this saidThere are the base of eyecontact the base of earcontact the base of nosecontact the base of tonguecontact the base of bodycontact and the base of mindcontactSo it was with reference to this that it was said Bhikkhu this person consists of six bases of contactBhikkhu this person consists of eighteen kinds of mental exploration So it was saidAnd with reference to what was this saidOn seeing a form with the eye one explores a form productive of joy one explores a form productive of grief one explores a form productive of equanimity On hearing a sound with the ear On smelling an odour with the nose On tasting a flavour with the tongue On touching a tangible with the body On cognizing a mindobject with the mind one explores a mindobject productive of joy one explores a mindobject productive of grief one explores a mindobject productive of equanimitySo it was with reference to this that it was said Bhikkhu this person consists of eighteen kinds of mental explorationBhikkhu this person has four foundations So it was saidAnd with reference to what was this saidSo it was with reference to this that it was said Bhikkhu this person has four foundationsOne should not neglect wisdom should preserve truth should cultivate relinquishment and should train for peace So it was saidAnd with reference to what was this saidHow bhikkhu does one not neglect wisdomThere are these six elements the earth element the water element the fire element the air element the space element and the consciousness elementWhat bhikkhu is the earth elementThe earth element may be either internal or externalWhat is the internal earth elementWhatever internally belonging to oneself is solid solidified and clungto that is headhairs bodyhairs nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bonemarrow kidneys heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs large intestines small intestines contents of the stomach feces or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is solid solidified and clungto this is called the internal earth elementNow both the internal earth element and the external earth element are simply earth elementAnd that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfWhen one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom one becomes disenchanted with the earth element and makes the mind dispassionate towards the earth elementWhat bhikkhu is the water elementThe water element may be either internal or externalWhat is the internal water elementWhatever internally belonging to oneself is water watery and clungto that is bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease spittle snot oilofthejoints urine or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is water watery and clungto this is called the internal water elementNow both the internal water element and the external water element are simply water elementAnd that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfWhen one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom one becomes disenchanted with the water element and makes the mind dispassionate towards the water elementWhat bhikkhu is the fire elementThe fire element may be either internal or externalWhat is the internal fire elementWhatever internally belonging to oneself is fire fiery and clungto that is that by which one is warmed ages and is consumed and that by which what is eaten drunk consumed and tasted gets completely digested or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is fire fiery and clungto this is called the internal fire elementNow both the internal fire element and the external fire element are simply fire elementAnd that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfWhen one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom one becomes disenchanted with the fire element and makes the mind dispassionate towards the fire elementWhat bhikkhu is the air elementThe air element may be either internal or externalWhat is the internal air elementWhatever internally belonging to oneself is air airy and clung to that is upgoing winds downgoing winds winds in the belly winds in the bowels winds that course through the limbs inbreath and outbreath or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is air airy and clungto this is called the internal air elementNow both the internal air element and the external air element are simply air elementAnd that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfWhen one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom one becomes disenchanted with the air element and makes the mind dispassionate towards the air elementWhat bhikkhu is the space elementThe space element may be either internal or externalWhat is the internal space elementWhatever internally belonging to oneself is space spatial and clungto that is the holes of the ears the nostrils the door of the mouth and that aperture whereby what is eaten drunk consumed and tasted gets swallowed and where it collects and whereby it is excreted from below or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is space spatial and clungto this is called the internal space elementNow both the internal space element and the external space element are simply space elementAnd that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfWhen one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom one becomes disenchanted with the space element and makes the mind dispassionate towards the space elementWhat does one cognize with that consciousnessOne cognizes This is pleasant one cognizes This is painful one cognizes This is neitherpainfulnorpleasantWhen one feels a pleasant feeling one understands I feel a pleasant feelingIn dependence on a contact to be felt as painful there arises a painful feelingWhen one feels a painful feeling one understands I feel a painful feelingOne understands With the cessation of that same contact to be felt as painful its corresponding feeling  the painful feeling that arose in dependence on that contact to be felt as painful  ceases and subsidesIn dependence on a contact to be felt as neitherpainfulnorpleasant there arises a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelingWhen one feels a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling one understands I feel a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelingOne understands With the cessation of that same contact to be felt as neitherpainfulnorpleasant its corresponding feeling  the neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling that arose in dependence on that contact to be felt as neitherpainfulnorpleasant  ceases and subsidesBhikkhu just as from the contact and friction of two firesticks heat is generated and fire is produced and with the separation and disjunction of these two firesticks the corresponding heat ceases and subsides so too in dependence on a contact to be felt as pleasantIf I were to direct this equanimity so purified and bright to the base of infinite consciousnessto the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception and to develop my mind accordinglythen this equanimity of mine supported by that base clinging to it would remain for a very long timeHe understands thus If I were to direct this equanimity so purified and bright to the base of infinite space and to develop my mind accordingly this would be conditionedHe understands thus Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingIf he feels a pleasant feeling he understands It is impermanent there is no holding to it there is no delight in itIf he feels a pleasant feeling he feels it detached if he feels a painful feeling he feels it detached if he feels a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling he feels it detachedBhikkhu just as an oillamp burns in dependence on oil and a wick and when the oil and wick are used up if it does not get any more fuel it is extinguished from lack of fuel so too when he feels a feeling terminating with the body He understands On the dissolution of the body with the ending of life all that is felt not being delighted in will become cool right hereHis deliverance being founded upon truth is unshakeableFor that is false bhikkhu which has a deceptive nature and that is true which has an undeceptive nature  NibbanaTherefore a bhikkhu possessing this truth possesses the supreme foundation of truthFor this bhikkhu is the supreme noble truth namely Nibbana which has an undeceptive natureFormerly when he was ignorant he acquired and developed attachmentsnow he has abandoned them cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump done away with them so that they are no longer subject to future arisingTherefore a bhikkhu possessing this relinquishment possesses the supreme foundation of relinquishmentFor this bhikkhu is the supreme noble relinquishment namely the relinquishing of all attachmentsFormerly when he was ignorant he experienced covetousness desire and lustnow he has abandoned them cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump done away with them so that they are no longer subject to future arisingFormerly when he was ignorant he experienced anger ill will and hatenow he has abandoned them cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump done away with them so that they are no longer subject to future arisingFormerly when he was ignorant he experienced ignorance and delusionnow he has abandoned them cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump done away with them so that they are no longer subject to future arisingThe tides of conceiving do not sweep over one who stands upon these foundations and when the tides of conceiving no longer sweep over him he is called a sage at peace So it was saidAnd with reference to what was this saidBhikkhu I am is a conceiving I am this is a conceiving I shall be is a conceiving I shall not be is a conceiving I shall be possessed of form is a conceiving I shall be formless is a conceiving I shall be percipient is a conceiving I shall be nonpercipient is a conceiving I shall be neitherpercipientnornonpercipient is a conceivingConceiving is a disease conceiving is a tumour conceiving is a dartBy overcoming all conceivings bhikkhu one is called a sage at peaceAnd the sage at peace is not born does not age does not die he is not shaken and is not agitatedFor there is nothing present in him by which he might be born Not being born how could he age Not ageing how could he die Not dying how could he be shaken Not being shaken why should he be agitatedSo it was with reference to this that it was said The tides of conceiving do not sweep over one who stands upon these foundations and when the tides of conceiving no longer sweep over him he is called a sage at peaceBhikkhu bear in mind this brief exposition of the six elementsThereupon the venerable Pukkusati thought Indeed the Teacher has come to me The Sublime One has come to me The Fully Enlightened One has come to me  Then he rose from his seat arranged his upper robe over one shoulder and prostrating himself with his head at the Blessed Ones feet he said Venerable sir a transgression overcame me in that like a fool confused and blundering I presumed to address the Blessed One as friendVenerable sir may the Blessed One forgive my transgression seen as such for the sake of restraint in the futureSurely bhikkhu a transgression overcame you in that like a fool confused and blundering you presumed to address me as friendBut since you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma we forgive youFor it is growth in the Noble Ones Discipline when one sees ones transgression as such makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma and undertakes restraint in the futureVenerable sir I would receive the full admission under the Blessed OneBut are your bowl and robes complete bhikkhu Venerable sir my bowl and robes are not completeBhikkhu Tathagatas do not give the full admission to anyone whose bowl and robes are not completeThen the venerable Pukkusati having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones words rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One keeping him on his right he departed in order to search for a bowl and robesThen while the venerable Pukkusati was searching for a bowl and robes a stray cow killed himThen a number of bhikkhus went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him they sat down at one sideWhat is his future course Bhikkhus the clansman Pukkusati was wise He practised in accordance with the Dhamma and did not trouble me in the interpretation of the DhammaWith the destruction of the five lower fetters the clansman Pukkusati has reappeared spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and will attain final Nibbana there without ever returning from that worldThat is what the Blessed One saidbut there is a homeless one already staying thereIf he agrees then stay as long as you like venerable sirand on that occasion he was already staying in the potters workshopThen the Blessed One entered the potters workshop prepared a spread of grass at one end and sat down folding his legs crosswise setting his body erect and establishing mindfulness in front of himLet the venerable one stay as long as he likesand the venerable Pukkusati also spent most of the night seated in meditationthat Blessed One is my teacherI profess the Dhamma of that Blessed OneThe Blessed One said thisThere are the foundation of wisdom the foundation of truth the foundation of relinquishment and the foundation of peaceThen there remains only consciousness purified and brightIn dependence on a contact to be felt as pleasant there arises a pleasant feelingOne understands With the cessation of that same contact to be felt as pleasant its corresponding feeling  the pleasant feeling that arose in dependence on that contact to be felt as pleasant  ceases and subsidesSuppose bhikkhu a skilled goldsmith or his apprentice were to prepare a furnace heat up the crucible take some gold with tongs and put it into the crucible From time to time he would blow on it from time to time he would sprinkle water over it and from time to time he would just look on That gold would become refined well refined completely refined faultless rid of dross malleable wieldy and radiant Then whatever kind of ornament he wished to make from it whether a golden chain or earrings or a necklace or a golden garland it would serve his purpose So too bhikkhu then there remains only equanimity purified and bright malleable wieldy and radiantThen there remains only equanimity purified and bright malleable wieldy and radiantto be felt as painfulto be felt as neitherpainfulnorpleasant there arises a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelingOne understands With the cessation of that same contact to be felt as neitherpainfulnorpleasant its corresponding feelingHe understands thus If I were to direct this equanimity so purified and bright to the base of infinite space and to develop my mind accordinglythen this equanimity of mine supported by that base clinging to it would remain for a very long timeIf I were to direct this equanimity so purified and bright to the base of infinite consciousnessto the base of nothingnessto the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception and to develop my mind accordingly this would be conditionedHe does not form any condition or generate any volition tending towards either being or nonbeingSince he does not form any condition or generate any volition tending towards eitherbeing or nonbeing he does not cling to anything in this world When he does not cling he is not agitated When he does not cling he is not agitated When he is not agitated he personally attains Nibbanato the base of nothingnessIf he feels a painful feeling he understands It is impermanent there is no holding to it there is no delight in itTherefore a bhikkhu possessing this wisdom possesses the supreme foundation of wisdomFor this bhikkhu is the supreme noble wisdom namely the knowledge of the destruction of all sufferingSo it was with reference to this that it was said One should not neglect wisdom should preserve truth should cultivate relinquishment and should train for peaceFor this bhikkhu is the supreme noble peace namely the pacification of lust hate and delusionTherefore a bhikkhu possessing this peace possesses the supreme foundation of peaceThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsand told him Venerable sir the clansman Pukkusati who was given brief instruction by the Blessed One has died What is his destinationTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Magadhan country and eventually arrived at Rajagaha There he went to the potter Bhaggava and said to him  If it is not inconvenient for you Bhaggava I will stay one night in your workshopceases and subsidesTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkNow on that occasion a pernicious view had arisen in a bhikkhu named Arittha formerly of the vulture killers thus As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are not able to obstruct one who engages in themSeveral bhikkhus having heard about this went to the bhikkhu Arittha and asked himExactly so friends As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are not able to obstruct one who engages in themThen these bhikkhus desiring to detach him from that pernicious view pressed and questioned and crossquestioned him thus Friend Arittha do not say so Do not misrepresent the Blessed One it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One The Blessed One would not speak thusFor in many discourses the Blessed One has stated how obstructive filings are obstructions and how they are able to obstruct one who engages in themThe Blessed One has stated how sensual pleasures provide little gratification much suffering and much despair and how great is the danger in themWith the simile of the skeleton with the simile of the piece of meat with the simile of the grass torch with the simile of the pit of coals with the simile of the dream with the simile of the borrowed goods with the simile of the tree laden with fruit with the simile of the slaughterhouse with the simile of the sword stake with the simile of the snakes head the Blessed One has stated how sensual pleasures provide little gratification much suffering and much despair and how great is the danger in themYet although pressed and questioned and crossquestioned by them in this way the bhikkhu Arittha formerly of the vulture killers still obstinately adhered to that pernicious view and continued to insist upon itSince the bhikkhus were unable to detach him from that pernicious view they went to the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus Come bhikkhu tell the bhikkhu Arittha formerly of the vulture killers in my name that the Teacher calls him Yes venerable sir he replied and he went to the bhikkhu Arittha and told him The Teacher calls you friend AritthaYes friend he replied and he went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him sat down at one sideThe Blessed One then asked him Arittha is it true that the following pernicious view has arisen in you As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are not able to obstruct one who engages in them Exactly so venerable sir As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are not able to obstruct one who engages in themMisguided man to whom have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma in that wayMisguided man in many discourses have I not stated how obstructive things are obstructionsI have stated how sensual pleasures provide little gratification much suffering and much despair and how great is the danger in themWith the simile of the skeleton with the simile of the piece of meat with the simile of the grass torch with the simile of the pit of coals with the simile of the dream with the simile of the borrowed goods with the simile of the tree laden with fruit with the simile of the slaughterhouse with the simile of the sword stake with the simile of the snakes head I have stated how sensual pleasures provide little gratification much suffering and much despair and how great is the danger in themBut you misguided man have misrepresented us by your wrong grasp and injured yourself and stored up much demeritThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus what do you think Has this bhikkhu Arittha formerly of the vulture killers kindled even a spark of wisdom in this Dhamma and Discipline How could he venerable sir No venerable sirWhen this was said the bhikkhu Arittha formerly of the vulture killers sat silent dismayed with shoulders drooping and head down glum and without responseThen knowing this the Blessed One told him Misguided man you will be recognised by your own pernicious viewI shall question the bhikkhus on this matterThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus do you understand the Dhamma taught by me as this bhikkhu Arittha formerly of the vulture killers does when he misrepresents us by his wrong grasp and injures himself and stores up much demerit No venerable sirFor in many discourses the Blessed One has stated how obstructive things are obstructions and how they are able to obstruct one who engages in themThe Blessed One has stated how sensual pleasures provide little gratification much suffering and much despair and how great is the danger in themWith the simile of the skeletonwith the simile of the snakes head the blessed One has stated how great is the danger in themGood bhikkhus It is good that you understand the Dhamma taught by me thusFor in many discourses I have stated how obstructive things are obstructions and how they are able to obstruct one who engages in themI have stated how sensual pleasures provide little gratification much suffering and much despair and how great is the danger in themWith the simile of the skeleton with the simile of the snakes head I have stated how great is the danger in themBut this bhikkhu Arittha formerly of the vulture killers misrepresents us by his wrong grasp and injures himself and stores up much demerit  Here bhikkhus some misguided men learn the Dhamma  discourses stanzas expositions verses exclamations sayings birth stories marvels and answers to questions Not examining the meaning of those teachings with wisdom they do not gain a reflective acceptance of themInstead they learn the Dhamma only for the sake of criticising others and for winning in debatesSuppose a man needing a snake seeking a snake wandering in search of a snakeand because of that he would come to death or deadly sufferingWhy is thatBecause of his wrong grasp of the snakeSo too here some misguided men learn the DhammaHere bhikkhus some clansmen learn the Dhamma  discoursesanswers to questions  and having learned the Dhamma they examine the meaning of those teachings with wisdomExamining the meaning of those teachings with wisdom they gain a reflective acceptance of themThey do not learn the Dhamma for the sake of criticising others and for winning in debatesSuppose a man needing a snake seeking a snake wandering in search of a snakeThen although the snake might wrap its coils round his hand or his arm or his limbs still he would not come to death or deadly suffering because of thatWhy is thatBecause of his right grasp of the snakeSo too here some clansmen learn the DhammaTherefore bhikkhus when you understand the meaning of my statements remember it accordingly Yes venerable sir the bhikkhus repliedThe Blessed One said thisBhikkhus suppose a man in the course of a journeysaw a great expanse of water whose near shore was dangerous and fearful and whose further shore was safe and free from fear but there was no ferryboat or bridge going to the far shoreThen he thought There is this great expanse of water whose near shore is dangerous and fearful and whose further shore is safe and free from fear but there is no ferryboat or bridge going to the far shoreSuppose I collect grass twigs branches and leaves and bind them together into a raft and supported by the raft and making an effort with my hands and feet I got safely across to the far shoreAnd then the man collected grass twigs branches and leaves and bound them together into a raft and supported by the raft and making an effort with his hands and feet he got safely across to the far shoreThen when he had got across and had arrived at the far shore he might think thusThis raft has been very helpful to me since supported by it and making an effort with my hands and feet I got safely across to the far shoreSuppose I were to hoist it on my head or load it on my shoulder and then go wherever I wantNow bhikkhus what do you think By doing so would that man be doing what should be done with that raft No venerable sirBy doing what would that man be doing what should be done with that raftHere bhikkhus when that man got across and had arrived at the far shore he might think thus This raft has been very helpful to me since supported by it and making an effort with my hands and feet I got safely across to the far shoreSuppose I were to haul it onto the dry land or set it adrift in the water and then go wherever I wantNow bhikkhus it is by so doing that that man would be doing what should be done with that raftSo I have shown you how the Dhamma is similar to a raft being for the purpose of crossing over not for the purpose of grasping  Bhikkhus there are these six standpoints for viewsWhat are the sixHere bhikkhus an untaught ordinary person who has no regard for noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma regards material form thus This is mine this I am this is my self He regards feeling thus This is mine this I am this is my self He regards perception thus This is mine this I am this is my self He regards formations thus This is mine this I am this is my self He regards what is seen heard sensed cognized encountered sought mentally pondered thus This is mine this I am this is my self And this standpoint for views namely This is self this the world after death I shall be permanent everlasting eternal not subject to change I shall endure as long as eternity  this too he regards thus This is mine this I am this is my selfBhikkhus a welltaught noble disciple who has regard for noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma regards material form thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self He regards feeling thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self He regards perception thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self He regards formations thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self He regards what is seen heard sensed cognized encountered sought mentally pondered thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self And this standpoint for views namely This is self this the world after death I shall be permanent everlasting eternal not subject to change I shall endure as long as eternity  this too he regards thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfSince he regards them thus he is not agitated about what is nonexistent  When this was said a certain bhikkhu asked the Blessed One Venerable sir can there be agitation about what is nonexistent externally There can be bhikkhu the Blessed One saidHere bhikkhu someone thinks thus Alas I had it Alas I have it no longer Alas may I have it Alas I do not get itThen he sorrows grieves and laments he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraughtThat is how there is agitation about what is nonexistent externallyVenerable sir can there be no agitation about what is nonexistent externally There can be bhikkhu the Blessed One saidHere bhikkhu someone does not think thus Alas I had it Alas I have it no longer Alas may I have it Alas I do not get itThen he does not sorrow grieve and lament he does not weep beating his breast and become distraughtThat is how there is no agitation about what is nonexistent externallyVenerable sir can there be agitation about what is nonexistent internallyThere can be bhikkhu the Blessed One saidHere bhikkhu someone has the view This is self this the world after death I shall be permanent everlasting eternal not subject to change I shall endure as long as eternityHe hears the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata teaching the Dhamma for the elimination of all standpoints decisions obsessions adherences and underlying tendencies for the stilling of all formations for the relinquishing of all attachments for the destruction of craving for dispassion for cessation for NibbanaHe thinks thus So I shall be annihilated So I shall perish So I shall be no moreThen he sorrows grieves and laments he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraughtThat is how there is agitation about what is nonexistent internallyVenerable sir can there be no agitation about what is nonexistent internally There can be bhikkhu the Blessed One saidHere bhikkhu someone does not have the view This is selfI shall endure as long as eternityHe hears the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata teaching the Dhamma for the elimination of all standpoints decisions obsessions adherences and underlying tendencies for the stilling of all formations for the relinquishing of all attachments for the destruction of craving for dispassion for cessation for NibbanaHe does not think thus So I shall be annihilated So I shall perish So I shall be no moreThen he does not sorrow grieve and lament he does not weep beating his breast and become distraughtThat is how there is no agitation about what is nonexistent internally No venerable sir Good bhikkhusI too do not see any possession that is permanent everlasting eternal not subject to change and that might endure as long as eternityBhikkhus you may well cling to that doctrine of self that Would not arouse sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair in one who clings to itBut do you see any such doctrine of self bhikkhus No venerable sir Good bhikkhusI too do not see any doctrine of self that would not arouse sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair in one who clings to itBut do you see any such support of views bhikkhus No venerable sir Good bhikkhusI too do not see any support of views that would not arouse sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair in one who takes it as a supportBhikkhus there being a self would there be what belongs to my self  Yes venerable sir Or there being what belongs to a self would there be my self  Yes venerable sir Bhikkhus since a self and what belongs to a self are not apprehended as true and established then this standpoint for views namely This is self this the world after death I shall be permanent everlasting eternal not subject to change I shall endure as long as eternity  would it not be an utterly and completely foolish teaching What else could it be venerable sir It would be an utterly and completely foolish teachingBhikkhus what do you think Is material form permanent or impermanent  Impermanent venerable sir Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness  Suffering venerable sir Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self  No venerable sirBhikkhus what do you think Is feeling Is perception Are formations Is consciousness permanent or impermanent  Impermanent venerable sir Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness  Suffering venerable sir Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self  No venerable sirTherefore bhikkhus any kind of material form whatever whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near all material form should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfAny kind of feeling whatever Any kind of perception whatever Any kind of formations whatever Any kind of consciousness whatever whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near all consciousness should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfSeeing thus bhikkhus a welltaught noble disciple becomes disenchanted with material form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with formations disenchanted with consciousness  Being disenchanted he becomes dispassionateThrough dispassion his mind is liberated When it is liberated there comes the knowledge It is liberatedHe understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being  Bhikkhus this bhikkhu is called one whose shaft has been lifted whose trench has been filled in whose pillar has been uprooted one who has no bar a noble one whose banner is lowered whose burden is lowered who is unfetteredAnd how is the bhikkhu one whose shaft has been liftedHere the bhikkhu has abandoned ignorance has cut it off at the root made it like a palm stump done away with it so that it is no longer subject to future arisingThat is how the bhikkhu is one whose shaft has been liftedAnd how is the bhikkhu one whose trench has been filled inHere the bhikkhu has abandoned the round of births that brings renewed being has cut it off at the root so that it is no longer subject to future arisingThat is how the bhikkhu is one whose trench has been filled inAnd how is the bhikkhu one whose pillar has been uprootedHere the bhikkhu has abandoned craving has cut it off at the root so that it is no longer subject to future arisingThat is how the bhikkhu is one whose pillar has been uprootedAnd how is the bhikkhu one who has no barHere the bhikkhu has abandoned the five lower fetters has cut them off at the root so that they are no longer subject to future arisingThat is how the bhikkhu is one who has no barAnd how is the bhikkhu a noble one whose banner is lowered whose burden is lowered who is unfetteredHere a bhikkhu has abandoned the conceit I am has cut it off at the root so that it is no longer subject to future arisingThat is how the bhikkhu is a noble one whose banner is lowered whose burden is lowered who is unfetteredBhikkhus when the gods with Indra with Brahma and with Pajapati seek a bhikkhu who is thus liberated in mind they do not find anything of which they could say The consciousness of one thus gone is supported by thisWhy is that  So saying bhikkhus so proclaiming I have been baselessly vainly falsely and wrongly misrepresented by some recluses and brahmins thus The recluse Gotama is one who leads astray he teaches the annihilation the destruction the extermination of an existing beingAs I am not as I do not proclaim so have I been baselessly vainly falsely and wrongly misrepresented by some recluses and brahmins thus The recluse Gotama is one who leads astray he teaches the annihilation the destruction the extermination of an existing beingIf others abuse revile scold and harass the Tathagata for that the Tathagata on that account feels no annoyance bitterness or dejection of the heartAnd if others honour respect revere and venerate the Tathagata for that the Tathagata on that account feels no delight joy or elation of the heartIf others honour respect revere and venerate the Tathagata for that the Tathagata on that account thinks thus They perform such services as these for the sake of what had earlier come to be fully understoodTherefore bhikkhus if others abuse revile scold and harass you on that account you should not entertain any annoyance bitterness or dejection of the heartAnd if others honour respect revere and venerate you on that account you should not entertain any delight joy or elation of the heartIf others honour respect revere and venerate you on that account you should think thus They perform such services as these for the sake of what had earlier come to be fully understood  Therefore bhikkhus whatever is not yours abandon it when you have abandoned it that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long timeWhat is it that is not yoursMaterial form is not yours Abandon it When you have abandoned it that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long timeFeeling is not yours Abandon it When you have abandoned it that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long timePerception is not yours Abandon it When you have abandoned it that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long timeFormations are not yours Abandon them When you have abandoned them that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long timeConsciousness is not yours Abandon itWhen you have abandoned it that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long timeBhikkhus what do you think If people carried off the grass sticks branches and leaves in this Jeta Grove or burned them or did what they liked with them would you thinkPeople are carrying us off or burning us or doing what they like with us  No venerable sirWhy notBecause that is neither our self nor what belongs to our self So too bhikkhus whatever is not yours abandon it when you have abandoned it that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long timeWhat is it that is not yoursMaterial form is not yoursFeeling is not yours Perception is not yours Formations are not yours Consciousness is not yours Abandon it When you have abandoned it that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time  Bhikkhus the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear open evident and free of patchworkIn the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus which is clear open evident and free of patchwork there is no future round for manifestation in the case of those bhikkhus who are arahants with taints destroyed who have lived the holy life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached the true goal destroyedthe fetters of being and are completely liberated through final knowledgeBhikkhus the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear free of patchworkIn the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus which is clear free of patchwork those bhikkhus who have abandoned the five lower fetters are all due to reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that worldBhikkhus the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear free of patchworkIn the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus which is clear free of patchwork those bhikkhus who have abandoned the three lower fetters and attenuated lust hate and delusion are all oncereturners returning once to this world to make an end of sufferingBhikkhus the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear free of patchworkIn the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus which is clear free of patchwork those bhikkhus who have abandoned three fetters are all streamenterers no longer subject to perdition bound for deliverance and headed for enlightenmentBhikkhus the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear free of patchworkBhikkhus the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear open evident and free of patchworkIn the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus which is clear open evident and free of patchwork those bhikkhus who have sufficient faith in me sufficient love for me are all headed for heavenThat is what the Blessed One saidand after paying homage to him they sat down at one side and told him all that had occurredadding Venerable sir since we could not detach the bhikkhu Arittha formerly of the vulture killers from this pernicious view we have reported this matter to the Blessed Onefor this will lead to this misguided mans harm and suffering for a long time Bhikkhus that one can engage in sensual pleasures without sensual desires without perceptions of sensual desire without thoughts of sensual desire  that is impossiblebut having learned the Dhamma they do not examine the meaning of those teachings with wisdomand they do not experience the good for the sake of which they learned the DhammaThose teachings being wrongly grasped by them conduce to their harm and suffering for a long timesaw a large snakeand grasped its coils or its tailIt would turn back on him and bite his hand or his arm or one of his limbsThose teachings being wrongly grasped by them conduce to their harm and suffering for a long timeand they experience the good for the sake of which they learned the DhammaThose teachings being rightly grasped by them conduce to their welfare and happiness for a long timesaw a large snakeand caught it rightly with a cleft stickand having done so grasped it rightly by the neckand when you do not understand the meaning of my statements then ask either me about it or those bhikkhus who are wise   Bhikkhus I shall show you how the Dhamma is similar to a raft being for the purpose of crossing over not for the purpose of graspingListen and attend closely to what I shall sayBhikkhus when you know the Dhamma to be similar to a raft you should abandon even good states how much more so bad statesThose teachings being rightly grasped by them conduce to their welfare and happiness for a long time  Bhikkhus you may well acquire that possession that is permanent everlasting eternalnot subject to change and that might endure as long as eternity But do you see any such possession bhikkhusBhikkhus you may well take as a support that view that would not arouse sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair in one who takes it as a supportOne thus gone I say is untraceable here and nowBhikkhus both formerly and now what I teach is suffering and the cessation of sufferingIn the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus which is clear free of patchwork those bhikkhus who are Dhammafollowers or faithfollowers are all headed for enlightenmentThe bhikkhus were satisfiedand delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsFriend Arittha is it true that such a pernicious view has arisen in you and how they are able to obstruct one who engages in themfor this will lead to your harm and suffering for a long timeTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryThen the wanderer Vacchagotta went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideand said to the Blessed One  I have had conversations with Master Gotama for a long timeIt would be good if Master Gotama would teach me in brief the wholesome and the unwholesomeI can teach you the wholesome and the unwholesome in brief Vaccha and I can teach you the wholesome and the unwholesome at length Still I will teach you the wholesome and the unwholesome in briefListen and attend closely to what I shall sayYes sir he repliedThe Blessed One said thisVaccha greed is unwholesome nongreed is wholesome hate is unwholesome nonhate is wholesome delusion is unwholesome nondelusion is wholesomeIn this way threethings are unwholesome and the other three things are wholesomeKilling living beings is unwholesome abstention from killing living beings is wholesome taking what is not given is unwholesome abstention from taking what is not given is wholesome misconduct in sensual pleasures is unwholesome abstention from misconduct in sensual pleasures is wholesome false speech is unwholesome abstention from false speech is wholesome malicious speech is unwholesome abstention from malicious speech is wholesome harsh speech is unwholesome abstention from harsh speech is wholesome gossip is unwholesome abstention from gossip is wholesome covetousness is unwholesome uncovetousness is wholesome ill will is unwholesome nonill will is wholesome wrong view is unwholesome right view is wholesomeIn this way ten things are unwholesome and the other ten things are wholesomeWhen a bhikkhu has abandoned craving cut it off at the root made it like a palm stump done away with it so that it is no longer subject to future arising then that bhikkhu is an arahant with taints destroyed one who has lived the holy life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached the true goal destroyed the fetters of being and is completely liberated through final knowledgeis there any one bhikkhu Master Gotamas disciple who by realising for himself with direct knowledge here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by

white leading lives of celibacy are accomplished in this Dhamma this holy life is thus complete in that respectIf only Master Gotama bhikkhus and bhikkhunis men lay followers clothed in whiteJust as the river Ganges inclines towards the sea slopes towards the sea flows towards the sea and merges with the sea so too Master Gotamas assembly with its homeless ones and its householders inclines towards Nibbana slopes towards Nibbana flows towards Nibbana and merges with NibbanaMagnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusI would receive the going forth under Master Gotama I would receive the full admissionVaccha one who formerly belonged to another sect and desires the going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline lives on probation for four monthsAt the end of four months if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him they give him the going forth and the full admission to the bhikkhus state But I recognise individual differences in this matterVenerable sir if those who formerly belonged to another sect and desire the going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline live on probation for four months and if at the end of the four months the bhikkhus being satisfied with them give them the going forth and the full admission to the bhikkhus state then I will live on probation for four yearsAt the end of the four years if the bhikkhus are satisfied with me let them give me the going forth and the full admission to the bhikkhus stateThen the wanderer Vacchagotta received the going forth under the Blessed One and he received the full admissionNot long after his full admission a halfmonth after his full admission the venerable Vacchagotta went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one sideand told the Blessed One Venerable sir I have attained whatever can be attained by the knowledge of a disciple in higher training by the true knowledge of a disciple in higher training Let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma furtherIn that case Vaccha develop further two things serenity and insightWhen these two things are developed further they will lead to the penetration of many elementsTo the extent that you may wish May I wield the various kinds of supernormal power having been one may I become many having been many may I become one may I appear and vanish may I go unhindered through a wall through an enclosure through a mountain as though through space may I dive in and out of the earth as though it were water may I walk on water without sinking as though it were earth seated crosslegged may I travel in space like a bird with my hand may Itouch and stroke the moon and sun so powerful and mighty may I wield bodily mastery even as far as the Brahmaworld  you will attain the ability to witness any aspect therein there being a suitable basisTo the extent that you may wish May I with the divine ear element which is purified and surpasses the human hear both kinds of sounds the divine and the human those that are far as well as near  you will attain the ability to witness any aspect therein there being a suitable basisTo the extent that you may wish May I understand the minds of other beings of other persons having encompassed them with my own mind May I understand a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust may I understand a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate may I understand a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion may I understand a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted may I understand an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted may I understand a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed may I understand a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated may I understand a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated  you will attain the ability to witness any aspect therein there being a suitable basisTo the extent that you may wish May I recollect my manifold past lives that is one birth two birthsThus with their aspects and particulars may I recollect my manifold past lives  you will attain the ability to witness any aspect therein there being a suitable basisTo the extent that you may wish May I with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human see beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunateand may I understand how beings pass on according to their actions  you will attain the ability to witness any aspect therein there being a suitable basisTo the extent that you may wish May I by realising for myself with direct knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints  you will attain the ability to witness any aspect therein there being a suitable basisThen the venerable Vacchagotta having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones words rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One keeping him on his right he departedBefore long dwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and resolute the venerable Vacchagotta by realising for himself with direct knowledge here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessnessHe directly knew Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingAnd the venerable Vacchagotta became one of the arahantsNow on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were going to see the Blessed OneThe venerable Vacchagotta saw them coming in the distanceSeeing them he went to them and asked themWe are going to see the Blessed One friendIn that case may the venerable ones pay homage in my name with their heads at the Blessed Ones feet saying Venerable sir the bhikkhu Vacchagotta pays homage with his head at the Blessed Ones feet Then say The Blessed One has been worshipped by me the Sublime One has been worshipped by meYes friend those bhikkhus repliedThen they went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him they sat down at one sideand told the Blessed One Venerable sir the venerable Vacchagotta pays homage with his head at the Blessed Ones feet and he says The Blessed One has been worshipped by me the Sublime One has been worshipped by meAnd deities also told me this The bhikkhu Vacchagotta has attained the threefold true knowledge and has great supernormal power and mightThat is what the Blessed One saidApart from Master Gotama and the bhikkhusApart from Master Gotama and the bhikkhus and bhikkhunisApart from Master Gotama the bhikkhus and bhikkhunls and the men lay followers clothed in white leading lives of celibacyApart from Master Gotama the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis and the men lay followers clothed in white both those leading lives of celibacy and those enjoying sensual pleasuresApart from Master Gotama the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis and the men lay followers clothed in white both those leading lives of celibacy and those enjoying sensual pleasures and the women lay followers clothed in white leading lives of celibacyand women lay followers clothed in white leading lives of celibacy were accomplished in this Dhamma but no women lay followers clothed in white enjoying sensual pleasures were accomplished then this holy life would be deficient in that respectbut because Master Gotama bhikkhus and bhikkhunis men lay followers clothed in white both those leading lives of celibacy and those enjoying sensual pleasures and women lay followers clothed in white both those leading lives of celibacy and those enjoying sensual pleasures are accomplished in this Dhamma this holy life is thus complete in that respectWhere are the venerable ones going Bhikkhus having encompassed his mind with my own mind I already knew of the bhikkhu Vacchagotta The bhikkhu Vacchagotta has attained the threefold true knowledge and has great supernormal power and mightThose bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsApart from Master GotamaTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Kasi country together with a large Sangha of bhikkhusThere he addressed the bhikkhus thus  Bhikkhus I abstain from eating at nightBy so doing I am free from illness and affliction and I enjoy health strength and a comfortable abidingCome bhikkhus abstain from eating at nightBy so doing you too will be free from illness and affliction and you will enjoy health strength and a comfortable abidingYes venerable sir they repliedThen as the Blessed One was wandering by stages in the Kasi country he eventually arrived at a Kasi town called KitagiriThere he lived in this Kasi town KitagiriBy so doing they are free from illness and affliction and they enjoy health strength and a comfortable abidingCome friends abstain from eating at nightBy so doing you too will be free from illness and affliction and you will enjoy health strength and a comfortable abidingWhen this was said the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka told those bhikkhus Friends we eat in the evening in the morning and in the day outside the proper timeBy so doing we are free from illness and affliction and we enjoy health strength and a comfortable abidingWhy should we abandon a benefit visible here and now to pursue a benefit to be achieved at a future timeWe shall eat in the evening in the morning and in the day outside the proper timeSince the bhikkhus were unable to convince the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka they went to the Blessed OneAfter paying homage to him they sat down at one side and told him all that had occurredThen the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus Come bhikkhu tell the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka in my name that the Teacher calls themYes venerable sir he replied and he went to the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka and told them The Teacher calls you friendsYes friend they replied and they went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him sat down at one sideThe Blessed One then said Bhikkhus is it true that when a number of bhikkhus went and told you Friends the Blessed One and the Sangha now abstain from eating at nightWe shall eat in the evening in the morning and in the day outside the proper time Yes venerable sirBhikkhus have you known me to teach the Dhamma in such a way as this Whatever this person experiences whether pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase No venerable sir Yes venerable sirAnd if it were unknown by me unseen unfound unrealised uncontacted by wisdom thus Here when someone feels a certain kind of pleasant feeling unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish

destroyed the fetters of being and are completely liberated through final knowledge that they still have work to do with diligenceWhy is thatThey have done their work with diligenceI say of such bhikkhus who are in higher training whose minds have not yet reached the goal and who are still aspiring to the supreme security from bondage that they still have work to do with diligenceWhy is thatBecause when those venerable ones make use of suitable resting places and associate with good friends and balance their spiritual faculties they may by realising for themselves with direct

still has work to do with diligenceBhikkhus there is a fourphrased statement and when it is recited a wise man would quickly understand itI shall recite it to you bhikkhusTry to understand itVenerable sir who are we that we should understand the DhammaBhikkhus even with a teacher who is concerned with material things an heir to material things attached to material things such haggling by his disciples would not be proper If we get this we will do it if we dont get this we wont do it so what should be said when the teacher is the Tathagata who isutterly detached from material thingsBhikkhus for a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the Teachers Dispensation it is proper that he conduct himself thus The Blessed One is the Teacher I am a disciple the Blessed One knows I do not knowFor a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the Teachers Dispensation the Teachers Dispensation is nourishing and refreshingFor a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the Teachers Dispensation it is proper that he conduct himself thus Willingly let only my skin sinews and bones remain and let the flesh and blood dry up on my body but my energy shall not be relaxed so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength manly energy and manly persistenceFor a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the Teachers Dispensation one of two fruits may be expected either final knowledge here and now or if there is a trace of clinging left nonreturnThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words Now on that occasion the bhikkhus named Assaji and Punabbasuka were residing at KitagiriThen a number of bhikkhus went and told them Friends the Blessed One and the Sangha of bhikkhus now abstain from eating at nightCome friends abstain from eating at night you told those bhikkhus Friends we eat in the eveningWhy should we abandon a benefit visible here and now to pursue a benefit to be achieved at a future timeBhikkhus have you not known me to teach the Dhamma in such a way as this Here when someone feels a certain kind of pleasant feeling unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish but when someone feels another kind of pleasant feeling unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase Here when someone feels a certain kind of painful feeling unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish but when someone feels another kind of painful feeling unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase Here when someone feels a certain kind of neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish but when someone feels another kind of neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase Good bhikkhusBut because it is known by me contacted by wisdom thus Here when someone feels a certain kind of painful feeling

sevenhe is no more capable of being negligentThis kind of person is called one liberatedbywisdomhe is no more capable of being negligentThis kind of person is called a bodywitnessHere some person does not contact with the body and abide in those liberations that are peaceful and immaterial transcending forms but some of his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom and his faith is planted rooted and established in the TathagataThis kind of person is called a DhammafollowerBhikkhus I do not say that final knowledge is achieved all at once On the contrary final knowledge is achieved by gradual training by gradual practice by gradual progressAnd how does there come to be gradual training gradual practice gradual progressHere one who has faith in a teacher visits him when he visits him he pays respect to him when he pays respect to him he gives ear one who gives ear hears the Dhamma having heard the Dhamma he memorises it he examines the meaning of the teachings he has memorised when he examines their meaning he gains a reflective acceptance of those teachings when he has gained a reflective acceptance of those teachings zeal springs up in him when zeal has sprung up he applies his will having applied his will he scrutinises having scrutinised he strives resolutely striving he realises with the body the ultimate truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdomThere has not been that faith bhikkhus and there has not been that visiting and there has not been that paying of respect and there has not been that giving ear and there has not been that hearing of the Dhamma and there has not been that memorising of the Dhamma and there has not been that examination of the meaning and there has not been that reflective acceptance of the teachings and there has not been that zeal and there has not been that application of will and there has not been that scrutiny and there has not been that strivingBhikkhus you have lost your way bhikkhus you have been practising the wrong wayHow far you have strayed misguided men from this Dhamma and Disciplineadding Venerable sir since we were unable to convince the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka we have reported this matter to the Blessed OneThis kind of person is called one attainedtoviewTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthl in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThere he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus Venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said this  Bhikkhus do you remember the five lower fetters as taught by me When this was said the venerable Malunkyaputta replied Venerable sir I remember the five lower fetters as taught by the Blessed OneBut Malunkyaputta in what way do you remember the five lower fetters as taught by me Venerable sir I remember personality view as a lower fetter taught by the Blessed One I remember doubt as a lower fetter taught by the Blessed One I remember adherence to rules and observances as a lower fetter taught by the Blessed One I remember sensual desire as a lower fetter taught by the Blessed One I remember ill will as a lower fetter taught by the Blessed OneIt is in this way venerable sir that I remember the five lower fetters as taught by the Blessed OneMalunkyaputta to whom do you remember my having taught these five lower fetters in that wayWould not the wanderers of other sects confute you with the simile of the infantFor a young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion personality so how could personality view arise in himA young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion teachings so how could doubt about teachings arise in himYet the underlying tendency to doubt lies within himA young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion rules so how could adherence to rules and observances arise in himYet the underlying tendency to adhere to rules and observances lies within himA young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion sensual pleasures so how could sensual desire arise in himYet the underlying tendency to sensual lust lies within himA young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion beings so how could ill will towards beings arise in himYet the underlying tendency to ill will lies within himWould not the wanderers of other sects confute you with this simile of the infant Thereupon the venerable Ananda said It is the time Blessed One it is the time Sublime One for the Blessed One to teach the five lower fettersHaving heard it from the Blessed One the bhikkhus will remember itThen listen Ananda and attend closely to what I shall sayYes venerable sir the venerable Ananda repliedThe Blessed One said thisHere Ananda an untaught ordinary person who has no regard for noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma abides with a mind obsessed and enslaved by personality view and he does not understand as it actually is the escape from the arisen personality viewHe abides with a mind obsessed and enslaved by doubtHe does not abide with a mind obsessed and enslaved by doubtThere is a path Ananda a way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters that anyone without coming to that path to that way shall know or see or abandon the five lower fetters  this is not possibleJust as when there is a great tree standing possessed of heartwood it is not possible that anyone shall cut out its heartwood without cutting through its bark and sapwood so too there is a path this is not possibleThere is a path Ananda a way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters that someone by coming to that path to that way shall know and see and abandon the five lower fetters  this is possibleJust as when there is a great tree standing possessed of heartwood it is possible that someone shall cut Out its heartwood by cutting through its bark and sapwood so too there is a path this is possibleSuppose Ananda the river Ganges were full of water right up to the brim so that crows could drink from itSo too when the Dhamma is being taught to someone for the cessation of personality if his mind does not enter into it and acquire confidence steadiness and decision then he can be regarded as like the feeble manSuppose Ananda the river Ganges were full of water right up to the brim so that crows could drink from itSo too when the Dhamma is being taught to someone for the cessation of personality if his mind enters into it and acquires confidence steadiness and decision then he can be regarded as like the strong manAnd what Ananda is the path the way to the abandoning of the five lower fettersHere with seclusion from objects of attachment with the abandoning of unwholesome states with the complete tranquillization of bodily inertia quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusionHe turns his mind away from those statesStanding upon that he attains the destruction of the taints But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints then because of that desire for the Dhamma that delight in the Dhamma with the destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes one due to reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that worldThis is the path the way to the abandoning of the five lower fettersAgain with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana Again with the fading away as well of rapture a bhikkhuenters upon and abides in the third jhana Again with the abandoning of pleasure and pain a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana which has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimityWhatever exists therein of material form feeling perception formations and consciousness he sees those states as impermanent as not self He turns his mind away from those states and directs it towards the deathless element He turns his mind away from those states and directs it towards the deathless element He turns his mind away from those states and directs it towards the deathless elementThis is the path the way to the abandoning of the five lower fettersAgain with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact with nonattention to perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite spaceWhatever exists therein of feeling perception formations and consciousness he sees those states as impermanent as not selfThis is the path the way to the abandoning of the five lower fettersAgain by completely surmounting the base of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousnessWhatever exists therein of feeling perception formations and consciousness he sees those states as impermanent as not selfThis is the path the way to the abandoning of the five lower fettersAgain by completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of nothingnessWhatever exists therein of feeling perception formations and consciousness he sees those states as impermanent as suffering as a disease as a tumour as a barb as a calamity as an affliction as alien as disintegrating as void as not self He turns his mind away from those states and directs it towards the deathless element thus This is the peaceful this is the sublime that is the stilling of all formations the relinquishing of all attachments the destruction of craving dispassion cessation Nibbana Standing upon that he attains the destruction of the taints But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints then because of that desire for the Dhamma that delight in the Dhamma with the destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes one due to reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that worldThis is the path the way to the abandoning of the five lower fettersVenerable sir if this is the path the way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters then how is it that some bhikkhus here are said to gain deliverance of mind and some are said to gain deliverance by wisdom The difference here Ananda is in their faculties I sayThat is what the Blessed One saidYet the underlying tendency to personality view lies within him A welltaught noble disciple who has regard for noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma does not abide with a mind obsessed and enslaved by personality view he understands as it actually is the escape from the arisen personality viewand when that personality view has become habitual and is uneradicated in him it is a lower fetterby adherence to rules and observancesby sensual lustby ill will and he does not understand as it actually is the escape from arisen ill willand when that ill will has become habitual and is uneradicated in him it is a lower fetterand personality view together with the underlying tendency to it is abandoned in himby adherence to rules and observancesby sensual lustby ill will he understands as it actually is the escape from the arisen ill willand ill will together with the underlying tendency to it is abandoned in himand then a feeble man came thinking By swimming across the stream with my arms I shall get safely across to the further shore of this river Ganges yet he would not be able to get safely acrossand then a strong man came thinking By swimming across the stream with my arms I shall get safely across to the further shore of this river Ganges and he would be able to get safely acrossWhatever exists therein of material form feeling perception formations and consciousness he sees those states as impermanent as suffering as a disease as a tumour as a barb as a calamity as an affliction as alien as disintegrating as void as not selfand directs it towards the deathless element thus This is the peaceful this is the sublime that is the stilling of all formations the relinquishing of all attachments the destruction of craving dispassion cessation NibbanaThe venerable Ananda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Vesall in the grove outside the city to the west Now on that occasion Sunakkhatta son of the Licchavis had recently left this Dhamma and DisciplineThe recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma merely hammered out by reasoning following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to himThen when it was morning the venerable Sariputta dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Vesall for almsThen he heard Sunakkhatta son of the Licchavis making this statement before the Vesall assemblyThe Blessed One said Sariputta the misguided man Sunakkhatta is angryThinking to discredit the Tathagata he actually praises himSariputta this misguided man Sunakkhatta will never infer of me according to Dhamma That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessedAnd he will never infer of me according to Dhamma That Blessed One enjoys the various kinds of supernormal power having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one he appears and vanishes he goes unhindered through a wall through an enclosure through a mountain as though through space he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth seated crosslegged he travels in space like a bird with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty he wields bodily mastery even as far as the BrahmaworldAnd he will never infer of me according to Dhamma With the divine ear element which is purified and surpasses the human that Blessed One hears both kinds of sounds the heavenly and the human those that are far as well as nearAnd he will never infer of me according to Dhamma That Blessed One encompasses with his own mind the minds of other beings other persons He understands a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust he understands a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate he understands a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion he understands a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted he understands an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted he understands a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed he understands a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated he understands a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberatedWhat are the tenAnd that is a Tathagatas power that the Tathagata has by virtue of which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of BrahmaAgain the Tathagata understands as it actually is the results of actions undertaken past future and present with possibilities and with causesThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain the Tathagata understands as it actually is the ways leading to all destinationsThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain the Tathagata understands as it actually is the world with its many and different elementsThat too is a Tathagatas powerSAgain the Tathagata understands as it actually is how beings have different inclinationsThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain the Tathagata understands as it actually is the disposition of the faculties of other beings other personsThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain the Tathagata understands as it actually is the defilement the cleansing and the emergence in regard to the jhanas liberations concentrations and attainmentsThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain the Tathagata recollects his manifold past lives that is one birth two birthgThat too is a Tathagatas powerThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain by realising for himself with direct knowledge the Tathagata here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taintsThat too is a Tathagatas power that the Tathagata has by virtue of which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of BrahmaThe Tathagata has these ten Tathagatas powers possessing which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of BrahmaSariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesThe recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma merely hammered out by reasoning following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him  unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as surely as if he had been carried off and put there he will wind up in hellJust as a bhikkhu possessed of virtue concentration and wisdom would here and now enjoy final knowledge so it will happen in this case Sariputta the Tathagata has these four kinds of intrepidity possessing which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of BrahmaWhat are the fourWhile you claim full enlightenment you are not fully enlightened in regard to certain thingsAnd seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidityWhile you claim to have destroyed the taints these taints are undestroyed by youAnd seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidityThose things called obstructions by you are not able to obstruct one who engages in themAnd seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidityWhen you teach the Dhamma to someone it does not lead him when he practises it to the complete destruction of sufferingAnd seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidityA Tathagata has these four kinds of intrepidity possessing which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of BrahmaSariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of meSariputta there are these eight assembliesWhat are the eightAn assembly of nobles an assembly of brahmins an assembly of householders an assembly of recluses an assembly of gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings an assembly of gods of the heaven of the Thirtythree an assembly of Maras retinue an assembly of BrahmasPossessing these four kinds of intrepidity the Tathagata approaches and enters these eight assembliesSariputta there are these four kinds of generationWhat are the fourEggborn generation wombborn generation moistureborn generation and spontaneous generationWhat is eggborn generationThere are these beings born by breaking out of the shell of an egg this is called eggborn generationWhat is wombborn generationThere are these beings born by breaking out from the caul this is called wombborn generationWhat is moistureborn generationThere are these beings born in a rotten fish in a rotten corpse in rotten dough in a cesspit or in a sewer this is called moistureborn generationWhat is spontaneous generationThere are gods and denizens of hell and certain human beings and some beings in the lower worlds this is called spontaneous generationThese are the four kinds of generationSariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of meSariputta there are these five destinationsWhat are the fiveI understand hell and the path and way leading to hell And I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hellI understand the animal realm and the path and way leading to the animal realm And I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in the animal realmI understand the realm of ghosts and the path and way leading to the realm of ghosts And I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in the realm of ghostsI understand human beings and the path and way leading to the human world And I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear among human beingsI understand the gods and the path and way leading to the world of the gods And I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly worldI understand Nibbana and the path and way leading to Nibbana And I also understand how one who has entered this path will by realising for himself with direct knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taintsBy encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hellAnd then later on with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human I see that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell and is experiencing extremely painful racking piercing feelingsSuppose there were a charcoal pit deeper than a ans height full of glowing coals without flame or smokeThen a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that he will come to this same charcoal pitSo too by encompassing mind with mindBy encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in the animal realmAnd then later on with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human I see that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in the

has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in the realm of ghostsAnd then later on I see that he has reappeared in the realm of ghosts and is experiencing much painful feelingSuppose there were a tree growing on uneven ground with scanty foliage casting a dappled shadowand then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same treeThen a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves that he will come to this same treeSo too by encompassing mind with mindBy encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will

secured by bars with shuttered windowsThen a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves that he will come to this same mansionSo too by encompassing mind with mindBy encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that by realising for himself with direct knowledge he here and now will enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taintsAnd then later on I see that by realising for himself with direct knowledge he here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind anddeliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints and is experiencing extremely pleasant feelingsSuppose there were a pond with clean agreeable cool water transparent with smooth banks delightfulThen a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves that he will come to this same pondSo too by encompassing mind with mindThese are the five destinationsSariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones The recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma merely hammered out by reasoning following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him  unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as surely as if he had been carried off and put there he will wind up in hellJust as a bhikkhu possessed of virtue concentration and wisdom would here and now enjoy final knowledge so it will happen in this case I say that unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as surely as if he had been carried off and put there he will wind up in hellSariputta I recall having lived a holy life possessing four factorsI have practised asceticism  the extreme of asceticism I have practised coarseness  the extreme of coarseness I have practised scrupulousness  the extreme of scrupulousness I have practised seclusion  the extreme of seclusionSuch was my asceticism Sariputta that I went naked rejecting conventions licking my hands not coming when asked not stopping when asked I did not accept food brought or food specially made or an invitation to a mealI kept to one house to one morsel I kept to two houses to two morsels I kept to seven houses to seven morsels I lived on one saucerful a day on two saucerfuls a day on seven saucerfuls a day I took food once a day once every two days once every seven days and so on up to once every fortnight I dwelt pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervals I was an eater of greens or millet or wild rice or hideparings or moss or ricebran or ricescum or sesamum flour or grass or cowdungI lived on forest roots and fruits I fed on fallen fruits I clothed myself in hemp in hempmixed cloth in shrouds in refuse rags in tree bark in antelope hide in strips of antelope hide in kusagrass fabric in bark fabric in woodshavings fabric in headhair wool in animal wool in owls wings I was one who pulled out hair and beard pursuing the practice of pulling out hair and beard I was one who stood continuously rejecting seats I was one who squatted continuously devoted to maintaining the squatting position I was one who used a mattress of spikes I made a mattress of spikes my bed I dwelt pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times daily including the evening Thus in such a variety of ways I dwelt pursuing the practice of tormenting and mortifying the bodySuch was my asceticismSuch was my coarseness SariputtaIt never occurred to me Oh let me rub this dust and dirt off with my hand or let another rub this dust and dirt off with his handSuch was my coarsenessSuch was my scrupulousness Sariputta that I was always mindful in stepping forwards and stepping backwards I was full of pity even for the beings in a drop of water thus Let me not hurt the tiny creatures in the crevices of the groundSuch was my scrupulousnessSuch was my seclusion Sariputta that I would plunge into some forest and dwell thereAnd when I saw a cowherd or a shepherd or someone gathering grass or sticks or a woodsman I would flee from grove to grove from thicket to thicket from hollow to hollow from hillock to hillockWhy was thatSo that they should not see me or I see themJust as a forestbred deer on seeing human beings flees from grove to grove from thicket to thicket from hollow to hollow from hillock to hillock so too when I saw a cowherd or a shepherdI would go on all fours to the cowpens when the cattle had gone out and the cowherd had left them and I would feed on the dung of the young suckling calvesAs long as my own excrement and urine lasted I fed on my own excrement and urineSuch was my great distortion in feedingI would plunge into some aweinspiring grove and dwell there  a grove so aweinspiringAnd there came to me spontaneously this stanza never heard beforeChilled by night and scorched by day Alone in aweinspiring grovesNaked no fire to sit beside The sage yet pursues his questI would make my bed in a charnel ground with the bones of the dead for a pillowAnd cowherd boys came up and spat on me urinated on me threw dirt at me and poked sticks into my earsYet I do not recall that I ever aroused an evil mind of hate against themSuch was my abiding in equanimitySariputta there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through foodThey say Let us live on kolafruitsNow I recall having eaten a single kolafruit a daySariputta you may think that the kolafruit was bigger at that timeThrough feeding on a single kolafruit a day my body reached a state of extreme emaciationBecause of eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stemsBecause of eating so little the projections on my spine stood forth like corded beadsBecause of eating so little my ribs jutted out as gaunt as the crazy rafters of an old roofless barnBecause of eating so little the gleam of my eyes sank far down in their sockets looking like a gleam of water that has sunk far down in a deep wellBecause of eating so little my scalp shrivelled and withered as a green bitter gourd shrivels and withers in the wind and sunif I tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my handsSariputta there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through foodThey say Let us live on beans Let us live on sesamum Let us live on riceNow I recall having eaten a single rice grain a daySariputta you may think that the rice grain was bigger at that timeThrough feeding on a single rice grain a day my body reached a state of extreme emaciationBecause of eating so littleYet Sariputta by such conduct by such practice by such performance of austerities I did not attain any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesWhy was thatBecause I did not attain that noble wisdom which when attained is noble and emancipating and leads the one who practises in accordance with it to the complete destruction of sufferingSariputta there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through the round of rebirthsThere are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through some particular kind of rebirthBut it is impossible to find a kind of rebirth that I have not been reborn in already in this long journey except for the gods of the Pure AbodesThere are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through some particular abodeBut it is impossible to find a kind of abode that I have not already dwelt in except for the gods of the Pure AbodesThere are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through sacrificeBut it is impossible to find a kind of sacrifice that has not already been offered up by me in this long journey when I was either a headanointed noble king or a welltodo brahminThere are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes through fireworshipBut it is impossible to find a kind of fire that has not already been worshipped by me in this long journey when I was either a headanointed noble king or a welltodo brahminSariputta there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this As long as this good man is still young a blackhaired young man endowed with the blessing of youth in the prime of life so long is he perfect in his lucid wisdomBut when this good man is old aged burdened with years advanced in life and come to the last stage being eighty ninety or a hundred years old then the lucidity of his wisdom is lostBut it should not be regarded soI am now old agedburdened with years advanced in life and come to the last stage my years have turned eightyNow suppose that I had four disciples with a hundred years lifespan perfect in mindfulness retentiveness memory and lucidity of wisdomJust as a skilled archer trained practised and tested could easily shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palm tree suppose that they were even to that extent perfect in mindfulness retentiveness memory and lucidity of wisdom Suppose that they continuously asked me about the four foundations of mindfulness and that I answered them when asked and that they remembered each answer of mine and never asked a subsidiary question or paused except to eat drink consume food taste urinate defecate and rest in order to remove sleepiness and tirednessStill the Tathagatas exposition of the Dhamma his explanations of factors of the Dhamma and his replies to questions would not yet come to an endSariputta even if you have to carry me about on a bed still there will be no change in the lucidity of the Tathagatas wisdomRightly speaking were it to be said of anyone A being not subject to delusion has appeared in the world for the welfare and happiness of many out of compassion for the world for the good welfare and happiness of gods and humans it is of me indeed that rightly speaking this should be saidThen he said to the Blessed One It is wonderful venerable sir it is marvellousAs I listened to this discourse on the Dhamma the hairs of my body stood upVenerable sir what is the name of this discourse on the Dhamma As to that Nagasamala you may remember this discourse on the Dhamma as The Hairraising DiscourseThat is what the Blessed One saidand when he teaches the Dhamma to anyone it leads him when he practises it to the complete destruction of sufferingWhen he had wandered for alms in Vesall and had returned from his almsround after his meal he went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one sideand told the Blessed One what Sunakkhatta was sayingand his words are spoken out of angerfor it is praise of the Tathagata to say of him When he teaches the Dhamma to anyone it leads him when he practises it to the complete destruction of suffering Sariputta the Tathagata has these ten Tathagatas powers possessing which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of BrahmaHere the Tathagata understands as it actually is the possible as possible and the impossible as impossibleThus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past livesAgain with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human the Tathagata sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate I say that unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as surely as if he had been carried off and put there he will wind up in helland he understands how beings pass on according to their actionshe will wind up in hellSariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of mehe will wind up in hellAnd seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidityyet I see no ground for thinking that fear or timidity might come upon me thereI recall having approached many hundred assemblies of nobles many hundred assemblies of brahmins many hundred assemblies of householders many hundred assemblies of recluses many hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings many hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Thirtythree many hundred assemblies of Maras retinue many hundred assemblies of BrahmasAnd formerly I had sat with them there and talked with them and held conversations with themhe will wind up in hellHell the animal realm the realm of ghosts human beings and godsand then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same charcoal pitand then later on he sees that he has fallen into that charcoal pit and is experiencing extremely painful racking piercing feelingspiercing feelings and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same cesspitand then later on he sees that he has fallen into that cesspit and is experiencing extremely painful racking piercing feelingspiercing feelingsand then later on he sees that he is sitting or lying in the shade of that tree experiencing much painful feelingmuch painful feelingand then later on he sees that he is sitting or lying in the shade of that tree experiencing much pleasant feelingmuch pleasant feelingand in it there was a couch spread with rugs blankets and sheets with a deerskin coverlet with a canopy as well as crimson pillows for both head and feetand then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same mansionand then later on he sees that he is sitting or lying in that upper chamber in that mansion experiencing extremely pleasant feelingsextremely pleasant feelingsand nearby a dense woodand then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only towards that same pondand then later on he sees that he has plunged into the pond bathed drunk and relieved all his distress fatigue and fever and has come out again and is sitting or lying in the wood experiencing extremely pleasant feelingsextremely pleasant feelingsI received nothing from a pot from a bowl across a threshold across a stick across a pestle from two eating together from a pregnant woman from a woman giving suck from a woman lying with a man from where food was advertised to be distributed from where a dog was waiting from where flies were buzzing I accepted no fish or meat I drank no liquor wine or fermented brew it never occurred to me thusSuch was my seclusionthat normally it would make a mans hair stand up if he were not free from lustWhen those cold wintry nights came during the eightdays interval of frost I would dwell by night in the open and by day in the grove In the last month of the hot season I would dwell by day in the open and by night in the groveand they eat kolafruits they eat kolafruit powder they drink kolafruit water and they make many kinds of kolafruit concoctionsyet you should not regard it sothe kolafruit was then at most the same size as nowBecause of eating so little my backside became like a camels hoofand they eat rice they eat rice powder they drink rice water and they make many kinds of rice concoctionsyet you should not regard it sothe rice grain was then at most the same size as nowthe hair rotted at its roots fell from my body as I rubbedBut it is impossible to find a realm in the round that I have not already passed through in this long journey except for the gods of the Pure Abodesand had I passed through the round as a god in the Pure Abodes I would never have returned to this worldbut meanwhile those four disciples of mine with their hundred years lifespan would have died at the end of those hundred yearsNow on that occasion the venerable Nagasamala was standing behind the Blessed One fanning himHe was making this statement before the Vesall assembly The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones Here I see no ground on which any recluse or brahmin or god or Mara or Brahma or anyone else at all in the world could in accordance with the Dhamma accuse me thus I see no ground on which any recluse or anyone at all could accuse me thus I see no ground on which any recluse or anyone at all could accuse me thusI see no ground on which any recluse or anyone at all could accuse me thusthat just as the bole of a tinduka tree accumulating over the years cakes and flakes off so too dust and dirt accumulating over the years caked off my body and flaked offBecause of eating so little my belly skin adhered to my backbone thus if I touched my belly skin I encountered my backbone and if I touched my backbone I encountered my belly skinthe hair rotted at its roots fell from my body as I rubbed Because of eating so littleThe venerable Nagasamala was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsAnd what are the effluents to be abandoned by seeingThere is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill personwho has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for people of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhammadoesnt discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attentionThis being so he doesnt attend to ideas fit for attention and attends to ideas unfit for attentionAnd what are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends toWhatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen effluent of sensuality arises in him and the arisen effluent of sensuality increases the unarisen effluent of becoming arises in him and the arisen effluent of becoming increases the unarisen effluent of ignorance arises in him and the arisen effluent of ignorance increases These are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends toAnd what are the ideas fit for attention that he doesnt attend toWhatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen effluent of sensuality doesnt arise in him and the arisen effluent of sensuality is abandoned the unarisen effluent of becoming doesnt arise in him and the arisen effluent of becoming is abandoned the unarisen effluent of ignorance doesnt arise in him and the arisen effluent of ignorance is abandoned These are the ideas fit for attention that he doesnt attend toThrough his attending to ideas unfit for attention and through his not attending to ideas fit for attention both unarisen effluents arise in him and arisen effluents increaseThis is how he attends inappropriately Was I in the pastWas I not in the pastWhat was I in the pastHow was I in the pastHaving been what what was I in the pastShall I be in the futureShall I not be in the futureWhat shall I be in the futureHow shall I be in the futureHaving been what what shall I be in the futureOr else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present Am IAm I notWhat am IHow am IWhere has this being come fromWhere is it boundAs he attends inappropriately in this way one of six kinds of view arises in himThe view I have a self arises in him as true  established or the view I have no self  or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self  or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive notself  or the view It is precisely by means of notself that I perceive self arises in him as true  established or else he has a view like this This very self of minethe knower that is sensitive here  there to the ripening of good  bad actionsis the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will endure as long as eternityThis is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of viewsBound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging  death from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair He is not freed I tell you from suffering  stressThe wellinstructed disciple of the noble oneswho has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for people of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhammadiscerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attentionThis being so he doesnt attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends to ideas fit for attention And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he doesnt attend toWhatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen effluent of sensuality arises in him and the arisen effluent of sensuality increases the unarisen effluent of becoming arises in him and the arisen effluent of becoming increases the unarisen effluent of ignorance arises in him and the

of becoming is abandoned the unarisen effluent of ignorance doesnt arise in him and the arisen effluent of ignorance is abandoned These are the ideas fit for attention that he does attend toThrough his not attending to ideas unfit for attention and through his attending to ideas fit for attention unarisen effluents do not arise in him and arisen effluents are abandonedHe attends appropriately This is stress  This is the origination of stress  This is the cessation of stress  This is the way leading to the cessation of stressAs he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him selfidentification view doubt and grasping at habits  practicesThese are called the effluents to be abandoned by seeingAnd what are the effluents to be abandoned by restrainingThere is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately dwells restrained with the restraint of the eyefacultyThe effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were to dwell unrestrained with the restraint of the eyefaculty do not arise for him when he dwells restrained with the restraint of the eyefacultyReflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the earfaculty   Reflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the nosefaculty   Reflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the tonguefaculty   Reflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the bodyfaculty   Reflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the intellectfacultyThe effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were to dwell unrestrained with the restraint of the intellectfaculty do not arise for him when he dwells restrained with the restraint of the intellectfacultyThese are called the effluents to be abandoned by restrainingAnd what are the effluents to be abandoned by usingThere is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately uses the robe simply to counteract cold to counteract heat to counteract the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles simply for the purpose of covering the parts of the body that cause shameReflecting appropriately he uses alms food not playfully nor for intoxication nor for putting on bulk nor for beautification but simply for the survival  continuance of this body for ending its afflictions for the support of the holy life thinking Thus will I destroy old feelings and not create new feelings  I will maintain myself be blameless  live in comfort Reflecting appropriately he uses lodging simply to counteract cold to counteract heat to counteract the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles simply for protection from the inclemencies of weather and for the enjoyment of seclusionReflecting appropriately he uses medicinal requisites that are used for curing the sick simply to counteract any pains of illness that have arisen and for maximum freedom from diseaseThe effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to use these things do not arise for him when he uses them These are called the effluents to be abandoned by usingAnd what are the effluents to be abandoned by toleratingThere is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately endures He tolerates cold heat hunger  thirstthe touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles illspoken unwelcome words  bodily feelings that when they arise are painful racking sharp piercing disagreeable displeasing  menacing to lifeThe effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to tolerate these things do not arise for him when he tolerates themThese are called the effluents to be abandoned by toleratingAnd what are the effluents to be abandoned by avoidingThere is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately avoids a wild elephant a wild horse a wild bull a wild dog a snake a stump a bramble patch a chasm a cliff a cesspool an open sewerReflecting appropriately he avoids sitting in the sorts of unsuitable seats wandering to the sorts of unsuitable habitats and associating with the sorts of bad friends that would make his observant companions in the holy life suspect him of evil conductThe effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to avoid these things do not arise for him when he avoids themThese are called the effluents to be abandoned by avoidingAnd what are the effluents to be abandoned by destroyingThere is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately doesnt tolerate an arisen thought of sensuality He abandons it destroys it dispels it  wipes it out of existence Reflecting appropriately he doesnt tolerate an arisen thought of ill will Reflecting appropriately he doesnt tolerate an arisen thought of harmfulness Reflecting appropriately he doesnt tolerate arisen evil unskillful qualities He abandons them destroys them dispels them  wipes them out of existenceThe effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to destroy these things do not arise for him when he destroys themThese are called the effluents to be abandoned by destroyingAnd what are the effluents to be abandoned by developingThere is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting go He develops analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening persistence as a factor for awakening rapture as a factor for awakening calm as a factor for awakening concentration as a factor for awakening equanimity as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting goThe effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to develop these qualities do not arise for him when he develops themThese are called the effluents to be abandoned by developingWhen a monks effluents that should be abandoned by seeing have been abandoned by seeing his effluents that should be abandoned by restraining have been abandoned by restraining his effluents that should be abandoned by using have been abandoned by using his effluents that should be abandoned by tolerating have been abandoned by tolerating his effluents that should be abandoned by avoiding have been abandoned by avoiding his effluents that should be abandoned by destroying have been abandoned by destroying his effluents that should be abandoned by developing have been abandoned by developing then he is called a monk who dwells restrained with the restraint of all the effluents He has severed craving thrown off the fetters andthrough the right penetration of conceithas made an end of suffering  stress That is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks responded to himThe Blessed One said Monks the ending of the effluents is for one who knows  sees I tell you not for one who doesnt know  doesnt seeFor one who knows what  sees whatAppropriate attention  inappropriate attentionWhen a monk attends inappropriately unarisen effluents arise and arisen effluents increase When a monk attends appropriately unarisen effluents do not arise and arisen effluents are abandonedThere are effluents to be abandoned by seeing those to be abandoned by restraining those to be abandoned by using those to be abandoned by tolerating those to be abandoned by avoiding those to be abandoned by destroying and those to be abandoned by developingThus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThere the Venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus thus Friends bhikkhus Friend they repliedThe Venerable Sariputta said thisOne of right view one of right view is said friendsIn what way is a noble disciple one of right view whose view is straight who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma Indeed friend we would come from far away to learn from the Venerable Sariputta the meaning of this statementIt would be good if the Venerable Sariputta would explain the meaning of this statementHaving heard it from him the bhikkhus will remember itThen friends listen and attend closely to what I shall sayYes friend the bhikkhus repliedThe Venerable Sariputta said thisWhen friends a noble disciple understands the unwholesome the root of the unwholesome the wholesome and the root of the wholesome in that way he is one of right view whose view is straight who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true DhammaAnd what friends is the unwholesome what is the root of the unwholesome what is the wholesome what is the root of the wholesomeKilling living beings is unwholesome taking what is not given is unwholesome misconduct in sensual pleasures is unwholesome false speech is unwholesome malicious speech is unwholesome harsh speech is unwholesome gossip is unwholesome covetousness is unwholesome ill will is unwholesome wrong view is unwholesome This is called the unwholesomeAnd what is the root of the unwholesomeGreed is a root of the unwholesome hate is a root of the unwholesome delusion is a root of the unwholesome This is called the root of the unwholesomeAnd what is the wholesomeAbstention from killing living beings is wholesome abstention from taking what is not given is wholesome abstention from misconduct in sensual pleasures is wholesome abstention from false speech is wholesome abstention from malicious speech is wholesome abstention from harsh speech is wholesome abstention from gossip is wholesome noncovetousness is wholesome nonill will is wholesome right view is wholesome This is called the wholesomeAnd what is the root of the wholesomeNongreed is a root of the wholesome nonhate is a root of the wholesome nondelusion is a root of the wholesome This is called the root of the

Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen early in the morning several monks adjusted their lower robes and carrying their bowls  outer robes went into Sāvatthī for almsThe thought occurred to them Its still too early to go into Sāvatthī for alms What if we were to visit the park of the wanderers of other persuasionsSo they headed to the park of the wanderers of other persuasions On arrival they exchanged courteous greetings with the wanderers of other persuasions After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they sat to one sideAs they were sitting there the wanderers of other persuasions said to them Friends Gotama the contemplative describes the comprehension of sensuality We too describe the comprehension of sensuality He describes the comprehension of forms We too describe the comprehension of forms He describes the comprehension of feelings We too describe the comprehension of feelings So what is the difference what the distinction what the distinguishing factor between him and us in terms of his teaching and ours his message and ours The monks neither delighting nor disapproving of the words of the wanderers of other persuasions got up from their seats We will learn

Blessed Ones wordsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks repliedThe Blessed One saidMonks before my selfawakening when I was still just an unawakened Bodhisatta the thought occurred to me Why dont I keep dividing my thinking into two sorts So I made thinking imbued with sensuality thinking imbued with ill will  thinking imbued with harmfulness one sort and thinking imbued with renunciation thinking imbued with nonill will  thinking imbued with harmlessness another sortAnd as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with sensuality arose in meI discerned that Thinking imbued with sensuality has arisen in meand that leads to my own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of both It obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to UnbindingAs I noticed that it leads to my own affliction it subsided As I noticed that it leads to the affliction of others  to the affliction of both  it obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding it subsidedWhenever thinking imbued with sensuality had arisen I simply abandoned it dispelled it wiped it out of existenceAnd as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with ill will  harmfulness arose in meI discerned that Thinking imbued with harmfulness has arisen in meand that leads to my own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of both It obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding As I noticed that it leads to my own affliction it subsided As I noticed that it leads to the affliction of others to the affliction of both it obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding it subsidedWhenever thinking imbued with harmfulness had arisen I simply abandoned it dispelled it wiped it out of existenceWhatever a monk keeps pursuing with his thinking  pondering that becomes the inclination of his awarenessIf a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with sensuality abandoning thinking imbued with renunciation his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with sensualityIf a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with ill will  harmfulness abandoning thinking imbued with harmlessness his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with harmfulnessJust as in the last month of the Rains in the autumn season when the crops are ripening a cowherd would look after his cowsHe would tap  poke  check  curb them with a stick on this side  thatWhy is thatBecause he foresees flogging or imprisonment or a fine or public censure arising from that if he let his cows wander into the cropsIn the same way I foresaw in unskillful qualities drawbacks degradation  defilement and I foresaw in skillful qualities rewards related to renunciation  promoting cleansingAnd as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with renunciation arose in meI discerned that Thinking imbued with renunciation has arisen in meand that leads neither to my own affliction nor to the affliction of others nor to the affliction of both It fosters discernment

Thinking imbued with harmlessness has arisen in meand that leads neither to my own affliction nor to the affliction of others nor to the affliction of both It fosters discernment promotes lack of

itWhy is thatSo that my mind would not be disturbedWhatever a monk keeps pursuing with his thinking  pondering that becomes the inclination of his awarenessIf a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with renunciation abandoning thinking imbued with sensuality his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with renunciationIf a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with nonill will harmlessness abandoning thinking imbued with harmfulness his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with harmlessnessJust as in the last month of the hot season when all the crops have been gathered into the village a cowherd would look after his cows While resting under the shade of a tree or out in the open he simply keeps himself mindful of those cows In the same way I simply kept myself mindful of those mental qualities Unflagging persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established My body was calm  unaroused my mind concentrated  singleQuite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationWith the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations I entered  remained in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceWith the fading of rapture I remained in equanimity mindful  alert and physically sensitive of pleasure I entered  remained in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  I entered  remained in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past livesI recollected my manifold past livesie  one birth two  five ten   Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes  detailsThis was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the night Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away  reappearance of beingsI saw  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing  These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  I saw beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kammaThis was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the night Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentationsI discerned as it had come to be that This is stress  This is the origination of stress  This is the cessation of stress  This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are fermentations  This is the origination of fermentations  This is the cessation of fermentations  This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations My heart thus knowing thus seeing was released from the fermentation of sensuality released from the fermentation of becoming released from the fermentation of ignorance With release there was the knowledge Released  I discerned that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for this world This was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the night Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteSuppose monks that in a forested wilderness there were a large lowlying marshin dependence on which there lived a large herd of deerand a certain man were to appear not desiring their benefit not desiring their welfare not desiring their rest from bondageHe would close off the safe restful path that led to their rapture and would open up a false path set out a male decoy place a female decoyand thus the large herd of deer would eventually fall into ruin disaster  decimationThen suppose that a certain man were to appear to that same large herd of deer desiring their benefit desiring their welfare desiring their rest from bondageHe would open up the safe restful path that led to their rapture would close off the false path take away the male decoy destroy the female decoyand thus the large herd of deer would eventually come into growth increase  abundanceI have given this simile in order to convey a meaningThe meaning is this The large lowlying marsh stands for sensualityThe large herd of deer stands for beingsThe man not desiring their benefit not desiring their welfare not desiring their rest from bondage stands for Mara the Evil OneThe false path stands for the eightfold wrong path i e  wrong view wrong resolve wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness  wrong concentrationThe male decoy stands for passion  delightThe female decoy stands for ignoranceThe man desiring their benefit desiring their welfare desiring their rest from bondage stands for the Tathagata the Worthy One the Rightly Selfawakened OneThe safe restful path that led to their rapture stands for the noble eightfold path i e  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness  right concentrationSo monks I have opened up the safe restful path closed off the false path removed the male decoy destroyed the femaleWhatever a teacher should do  seeking the welfare of his disciples out of sympathy for them  that have I done for youOver there are the roots of trees over there empty dwellings Practice jhana monks Dont be heedless Dont later fall into regretThis is our message to you That is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks repliedThe Blessed One saidWhen a monk is intent on the heightened mind there are five themes he should attend to at the appropriate timesWhich fiveThere is the case where evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  arise in a monk while he is referring to and attending to a particular themeHe should attend to another theme apart from that one connected with what is skillful When he is attending to this other theme apart from that one connected with what is skillful then those evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itJust as a skilled carpenter or his apprentice would use a small peg to knock out drive out and pull out a large one in the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  arise in a monk while he is referring to and attending to a particular theme he should attend to another theme apart from that one connected with what is skillfulWhen he is attending to this other theme apart from that one connected with what is skillful then those evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itIf evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to this other theme connected with what is skillful he should scrutinize the drawbacks of those thoughts Truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful these thoughts of mine are blameworthy these thoughts of mine result in stress As he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itJust as a young woman  or man  fond of adornment would be horrified humiliated and disgusted if the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human being were hung from her neck in the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to this other theme connected with what is skillful he should scrutinize the drawbacks of those thoughts Truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful these thoughts of mine are blameworthy these thoughts of mine result in stress As he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itIf evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts he should pay no mind and pay no attention to those thoughtsAs he is paying no mind and paying no attention to them those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itJust as a man with good eyes not wanting to see forms that had come into range would close his eyes or look awayin the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts he should pay no mind and pay no attention to those thoughts As he is paying no mind and paying no attention to them those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itIf evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is paying no mind and paying no attention to those thoughts he should attend to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughtsAs he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itJust as the thought would occur to a man walking quicklyWhy am I walking quicklyWhy dont I walk slowly So he walks slowlyThe thought occurs to him Why am I walking slowlyWhy dont I stand So he standsThe thought occurs to him Why am I standingWhy dont I sit down So he sits downThe thought occurs to him Why am I sittingWhy dont I lie down So he lies downIn this way giving up the grosser posture he takes up the more refined oneIn the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is paying no mind and paying no attention to those thoughts he should attend to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts As he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itIf evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughtsthen  with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he should beat down constrain and crush his mind with his awarenessAs  with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he is beating down constraining and crushing his mind with his awareness those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itJust as a strong man seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the shoulders would beat him down constrain and crush him in the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughtsthen  with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he should beat down constrain and crush his mind with his awarenessAs  with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he is beating down constraining and crushing his mind with his awareness those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itNow when a monk  attending to another themescrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughtspaying no mind and paying no attention to those thoughtsattending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughtsbeating down constraining and crushing his mind with his awareness steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itHe is then called a monk with mastery over the ways of thought sequencesHe thinks whatever thought he wants to and doesnt think whatever thought he doesntHe has severed craving thrown off the fetters and  through the right penetration of conceit  has made an end of suffering and stressThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas ParkThen when it was morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Sāvatthī for almsThen a number of bhikkhus went to the venerable nanda and said to him Friend nanda it is long since we heard a talk on the Dhamma from the Blessed Ones own lipsIt would be good if we could get to hear such a talk friend nandaThen let the venerable ones go to the brahmin Rammakas hermitage Perhaps you will get to hear a talk on the Dhamma from the Blessed Ones own lipsYes friend they repliedThen when the Blessed One had wandered for alms in Sāvatthī and had returned from his almsround after his meal he addressed the venerable nanda nanda let us go to the Eastern Park to the Palace of Migāras Mother for the days abidingYes venerable sir the venerable nanda repliedThen the Blessed One went with the venerable nanda to the Eastern Park the Palace of Migāras Mother for the days abidingThen when it was evening the Blessed One rose from meditation and addressed the venerable nanda nanda let us go to the Eastern Bathing Place to batheYes venerable sir the venerable nanda repliedThen the Blessed One went with the venerable nanda to the Eastern Bathing Place to batheWhen he was finished he came up out of the water and stood in one robe drying his limbsThen the venerable nanda said to the Blessed One Venerable sir the brahmin Rammakas hermitage is nearbyThat hermitage is agreeable and delightfulVenerable sir it would be good if the Blessed One went there out of compassionThe Blessed One consented in silenceThen the Blessed One went to the brahmin Rammakas hermitageNow on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were sitting together in the hermitage discussing the DhammaThe Blessed One stood outside the door waiting for their discussion to endWhen he knew that it was over he coughed and knockedand the bhikkhus opened the door for himThe Blessed One entered sat down on a seat made readyand addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus for what discussion are you sitting together here nowAnd what was your discussion that was interruptedVenerable sir our discussion on the Dhamma that was interrupted was about the Blessed One himself Then the Blessed One arrivedGood bhikkhusIt is fitting for you clansmen who have gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness to sit together to discuss the DhammaWhen you gather together bhikkhus you should do either of two things hold discussion on the Dhamma or maintain noble silenceBhikkhus there are these two kinds of search the noble search and the ignoble searchAnd what is the ignoble searchHere someone being himself subject to birth seeks what is also subject to birth being himself subject to ageing he seeks what is also subject to ageing being himself subject to sickness he seeks what is also subject to sickness being himself subject to death he seeks what is also subject to death being himself subject to sorrow he seeks what is also subject to sorrow being himself subject to defilement he seeks what is also subject to defilementAnd what may be said to be subject to birthWife and children are subject to birth men and women slaves goats and sheep fowl and pigs elephants cattle horses and mares gold and silver are subject to birthThese acquisitions are subject to birthand one who is tied to these things infatuated with them and utterly committed to them being himself subject to birth seeks what it also subject to birthAnd what may be said to be subject to ageingWife and children are subject to ageing men and women slaves goats and sheep fowl and pigs elephants cattle horses and mares gold and silver are subject to ageingThese acquistions are subject to ageingand one who is tied to these things infatuated with them and utterly committed to them being himself subject to ageing seeks what is also subject to ageingAnd what may be said to be subject to sicknessWife and children are subject to sickness men and women slaves goats and sheep fowl and pigs elephants cattle horses and mares are subject to sicknessThese acquisitions are subject to sicknessand one who is tied to these things infatuated with them and utterly committed to them being himself subject to sickness seeks what is also subject to sicknessAnd what may be said to be subject to deathWife and children are subject to death men and women slaves goats and sheep fowl and pigs elephants cattle horses and mares are subject to deathThese acquisitions are subject to deathand one who is tied to these things infatuated with them and utterly committed to them being himself subject to death seeks what is also subject to deathAnd what may be said to be subject to sorrowWife and children are subject to sorrow men and women slaves goats and sheep fowl and pigs elephants cattle horses and mares are subject to sorrowThese acquisitions are subject to sorrowand one who is tied to these things infatuated with them and utterly committed to them being himself subject to sorrow seeks what is also subject to sorrowAnd what may be said to be subject to defilementWife and children are subject to defilement men and women slaves goats and sheep fowl and pigs elephants cattle horses and mares gold and silver are subject to defilementThese acquisitions are subject to defilementand one who is tied to these things infatuated with them and utterly committed to them being himself subject to defilement seeks what is also subject to defilementThis is the ignoble searchAnd what is the noble searchHere someone being himself subject to birth having understood the danger in what is subject to birth seeks the unborn supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being himself subject to ageing having understood the danger in what is subject to ageing he seeks the unageing supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being himself subject to sickness having understood the danger in what is subject to sickness he seeks the unailing supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being himself subject to death having understood the danger in what is subject to death he seeks the deathless supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being himself subject to sorrow having understood the danger in what is subject to sorrow he seeks the sorrowless supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being himself subject to defilement having understood the danger in what is subject to defilement he seeks the undefiled supreme security from bondage NibbānaThis is the noble searchBhikkhus before my enlightenment while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisatta I too being myself subject to birth sought what was also subject to birth being myself subject to ageing sickness death sorrow and defilement I sought what was also subject to ageing sickness death sorrow and defilementThen I considered thus Why being myself subject to birth do I seek what is also subject to birth Why being myself subject to ageing sickness death sorrow and defilement do I seek what is also subject to ageing sickness death sorrow and defilementSuppose that being myself subject to birth having understood the danger in what is subject to birth I seek the unborn supreme security from bondage Nibbāna Suppose that being myself subject to ageing sickness death sorrow and defilement having understood the danger in what is subject to ageing sickness death sorrow and defilement I seek the unageing unailing deathless sorrowless and undefiled supreme security from bondage Nibbāna Later while still young a blackhaired young man endowed with the blessing of youth in the prime of life though my mother and father wished otherwise and wept with tearful faces I shaved off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and went forth from the home life into homelessnessHaving gone forth bhikkhus in search of what is wholesome seeking the supreme state of sublime peace I went to ḷāra Kālāmaand said to him Friend Kālāma I want to lead the holy life in this Dhamma and Discipline ḷāra Kālāma replied The venerable one may stay here This Dhamma is such that a wise man can soon enter upon and abide in it realising for himself through direct knowledge his own teachers doctrineI soon quickly learned that DhammaAs far as mere lipreciting and rehearsal of his teaching went I could speak with knowledge and assurance and I claimed I know and seeand there were others who did likewiseI considered It is not through mere faith alone that ḷāra Kālāma declares By realising for myself with direct knowledge I enter upon and abide in this Dhamma  Certainly ḷāra Kālāma abides knowing and seeing this DhammaThen I went to ḷāra Kālāma and asked him Friend Kālāma in what way do you declare that by realising for yourself with direct knowledge you enter upon and abide in this DhammaIn reply he declared the base of nothingnessI considered Not only ḷāra Kālāma has faith energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom I too have faith energy mindfulness concentration and wisdomSuppose I endeavour to realise the Dhamma that ḷāra Kālāma declares he enters upon and abides in by realising for himself with direct knowledge I soon quickly entered upon and abided in that Dhamma by realising for myself with direct knowledgeThen I went to ḷāra Kālāma and asked himFriend Kālāma is it in this way that you declare that you enter upon and abide in this Dhamma by realising for yourself with direct knowledgeThat is the way friendIt is in this way friend that I also enter upon and abide in this Dhamma by realising for myself with direct knowledgeIt is a gain for us friend it is a great gain for us that we have such a venerable one for our companion in the holy lifeSo the Dhamma that I declare I enter upon and abide in by realising for myself with direct knowledge is the Dhamma that you enter upon and abide in by realising for yourself with direct knowledgeAnd the Dhamma that you enter upon and abide in by realising for yourself with direct knowledge is the Dhamma that I declare I enter upon and abide in by realising for myself with direct knowledgeSo you know the Dhamma that I know and I know the Dhamma that you knowAs I am so are you as you are so am ICome friend let us now lead this community together Thus ḷāra Kālāma my teacher placed me his pupil on an equal footing with himself and awarded me the highest honourBut it occurred to me This Dhamma does not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbāna but only to reappearance in the base of nothingnessNot being satisfied with that Dhamma disappointed with it I left Still in search bhikkhus of what is wholesome seeking the supreme state of sublime peace I went to Uddaka Rāmaputta and said to him Friend I want to lead the holy life in this Dhamma and DisciplineUddaka Rāmaputta replied The venerable one may stay here This Dhamma is such that a wise man can soon enter upon and abide in it himself realising through direct knowledge his own

DhammaIn reply Uddaka Rāmaputta declared the base of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionI considered Not only Rāma had faith energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom I too have faith energy

you knowAs Rāma was so are you as you are so was RāmaCome friend now lead this community Thus Uddaka Rāmaputta my companion in the holy life placed me in the position of a teacher and accorded me the highest honourBut it occurred to me This Dhamma does not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbāna but only to reappearance in the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception Not being satisfied with that Dhamma disappointed with it I leftStill in search bhikkhus of what is wholesome seeking the supreme state of sublime peace I wandered by stages through the Magadhan country until eventually I arrived at Uruvelā at SenānigamaThere I saw an agreeable piece of ground a delightful grove with a clearflowing river with pleasant smooth banks and nearby a village for alms resortI considered This is an agreeable piece of ground this is a delightful grove with a clearflowing river with pleasant smooth banks and nearby a village for alms resortThis will serve for the striving of a clansman intent on strivingAnd I sat down there thinking This will serve for striving Then bhikkhus being myself subject to birth having understood the danger in what is subject to birth seeking the unborn supreme security from bondage Nibbāna I attained the unborn supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being myself subject to ageing having understood the danger in what is subject to ageing seeking the unageing supreme security from bondage Nibbāna I attained the unageing supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being myself subject to sickness having understood the danger in what is subject to sickness seeking the unailing supreme security from bondage Nibbāna I attained the unailing supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being myself subject to death having understood the danger in what is subject to death seeking the deathless supreme security from bondage Nibbāna I attained the deathless supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being myself subject to sorrow having understood the danger in what is subject to sorrow seeking the sorrowless supreme security from bondage Nibbāna I attained the sorrowless supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being myself subject to defilement having understood the danger in what is subject to defilement seeking the undefiled supreme security from bondage Nibbāna I attained the undefiled supreme security from bondage NibbānaThe knowledge and vision arose in me My deliverance is unshakeable this is my last birth now there is no renewal of being I considered This Dhamma that I have attained is profound hard to see and hard to understand peaceful and sublime unattainable by mere reasoning subtle to be experienced by the wiseBut this generation delights in attachment takes delight in attachment rejoices in attachmentIt is hard for such a generation to see this truth namely specific conditionality dependent originationAnd it is hard to see this truth namely the stilling of all formations the relinquishing of all acquisitions the destruction of craving dispassion cessation NibbānaIf I were to teach the Dhamma others would not understand me and that would be wearying and troublesome for meThereupon there came to me spontaneously these stanzas never heard beforeEnough with teaching the Dhamma That even I found hard to reachFor it will never be perceived By those who live in lust and hateWhich goes against the worldly stream Subtle deep and difficult to seeThose dyed in lust wrapped in darkness Will never discern this abstruse DhammaConsidering thus my mind inclined to inaction rather than to teaching the DhammaThen bhikkhus the Brahmā Sahampati knew with his mind the thought in my mind and he considered The world will be lost the world will perish since the mind of the Tathāgata accomplished and fully enlightened inclines to inaction rather than to teaching the DhammaThen just as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm the Brahmā Sahampati vanished in the Brahmaworld and appeared before meHe arranged his upper robe on one shoulder and extending his hands in reverential salutation towards me said Venerable sir let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma let the Sublime One teach the DhammaThere are beings with little dust in their eyes who are wasting through not hearing the DhammaThere will be those who will understand the DhammaThe Brahmā Sahampati spoke thusand then he said furtherIn Magadha there have appeared till nowImpure teachings devised by those still stainedOpen the doors to the DeathlessLet them hear The Dhamma that the Stainless One has foundJust as one who stands on a mountain peakCan see below the people all aroundSo O Wise One Allseeing SageAscend the palace of the DhammaLet the Sorrowless One this human breed Engulfed in sorrowsurvey overcome by birth and old ageArise victorious herocaravan leader Debtless one and wander in the worldLet the Blessed One teach the DhammaThere will be those who will understand Then I listened to the Brahmās pleading and out of compassion for beings I surveyed the world with the eye of a BuddhaSurveying the world with the eye of a Buddha I saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in their eyes with keen faculties and with dull faculties with good qualities and with bad qualities easy to teach and hard to teach and some who dwelt seeing fear and blame in the other worldJust as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses some lotuses that are born and grow in the water thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it and some other lotuses that are born and grow in the water rest on the waters surface and some other lotuses that are born and grow in the water rise out of the water and stand clear unwetted by it so too surveying the world with the eye of a Buddha I saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in their eyes with keen faculties and with dull faculties with good qualities and with bad qualities easy to teach and hard to teach and some who dwelt seeing fear and blame in the other worldThen I replied to the Brahmā Sahampati in stanzasOpen for them are the doors to the DeathlessLet those with ears now show their faithThinking it would be troublesome I did not speakthe Dhamma subtle and sublime O Brahmā Then the Brahmā Sahampati thought The Blessed One has consented to my request that he teach the Dhamma  And after paying homage to me keeping me on the right he thereupon departed at onceI considered thus To whom should I first teach the Dhamma Who will understand this Dhamma quickly It then occurred to me ḷāra Kālāma is wise intelligent and discerning he has long had little dust in his eyesSuppose I taught the Dhamma first to ḷāra KālāmaHe will understand it quicklyThen deities approached me and said Venerable sir ḷāra Kālāma died seven days agoAnd the knowledge and vision arose in me ḷāra Kālāma died seven days agoI thought ḷāra Kālāmas loss is a great oneIf he had heard this Dhamma he would have understood it quickly I considered thus To whom should I first teach the Dhamma Who will understand this Dhamma quicklyIt then occurred to me Uddaka Rāmaputta is wise intelligent and discerning he has long had little dust in his eyesSuppose I taught the Dhamma first to Uddaka RāmaputtaHe will understand it quicklyThen deities approached me and said Venerable sir Uddaka Rāmaputta died last nightAnd the knowledge and vision arose in me Uddaka Rāmaputta died last nightI thought Uddaka Rāmaputtas loss is a great oneIf he had heard this Dhamma he would have understood it quickly I considered thus To whom should I first teach the Dhamma Who will understand this Dhamma quicklyIt then occurred to me The bhikkhus of the group of five who attended upon me while I was engaged in my striving were very helpfulSuppose I taught the Dhamma first to themThen I thought Where are the bhikkhus of the group of five now livingAnd with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human I saw that they were living at Benares in the Deer Park at IsipatanaThen bhikkhus when I had stayed at Uruvelā as long as I chose I set out to wander by stages to BenaresBetween Gayā and the Place of Enlightenment the jīvaka Upaka saw me on the roadand said Friend your faculties are clear the colour of your skin is pure and brightUnder whom have you gone forth friend Who is your teacher Whose Dhamma do you profess I replied to the jīvaka Upaka in stanzasI am one who has transcended all a knower of all Unsullied among all thingsrenouncing all By cravings ceasing freed Having known this all For myself to whom should I point as teacherI have no teacher and one like me Exists nowherein all the world With all its gods because I have No person for my counterpartI am the Accomplished One in the world I am the Teacher SupremeI alone am a Fully Enlightened One Whose fires are quenched and extinguishedI go now to the city of Kāsi To set in motion the Wheel of DhammaIn a world that has become blind I go to beat the drum of the Deathless By your claims friend you ought to be the Universal Victor The victors are those like me Who have won to destruction of taintsI have vanquished all evil states Therefore Upaka I am a victor When this was said the jīvaka Upaka said May it be so friend  Shaking his head he took a bypath and departedThen bhikkhus wandering by stages I eventually came to Benares to the Deer Park at Isipatana and I approached the bhikkhus of the group of fiveThe bhikkhus saw me coming in the distanceand they agreed among themselves thus Friends here comes the recluse Gotama who lives luxuriously who gave up his striving and reverted to luxuryWe should not pay homage to him or rise up for him or receive his bowl and outer robeBut a seat may be prepared for him If he likes he may sit down However as I approached those bhikkhus found themselves unable to keep their pactOne came to meet me and took my bowl and outer robe another prepared a seat and another set out water for my feethowever they addressed me by name and as friendThereupon I told them Bhikkhus do not address the Tathāgata by name and as friendThe Tathāgata is an Accomplished One a Fully Enlightened OneListen bhikkhus the Deathless has been attained I shall instruct you I shall teach you the DhammaPractising as you are instructed by realising for yourselves here and now through direct knowledge you will soon enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness When this was said the bhikkhus of the group of five answered me thus Friend Gotama by the conduct the practice and the performance of austerities that you undertook you did not achieve any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones Since you now live luxuriously having given up your striving and reverted to luxury how will you have achieved any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones When this was said I told them The Tathāgata does not live luxuriously nor has he given up his striving and reverted to luxuryThe Tathāgata is an Accomplished One a Fully Enlightened OneListen bhikkhus the Deathless has been attainedfrom the home life into homelessnessA second time the bhikkhus of the group of five said to me Friend Gotamahow will you have achieved any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesA second time I told them The Tathāgata does not live luxuriouslyfrom the home life into homelessnessA third time the bhikkhus of the group of five said to me Friend Gotamahow will you have achieved any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones When this was said I asked them Bhikkhus have you ever known me to speak like this beforeNo venerable sirBhikkhus the Tathāgata is an Accomplished One a Fully Enlightened OneListen bhikkhus the Deathless has been attained I shall instruct you I shall teach you the DhammaPractising as you are instructed by realising for yourselves here and now through direct knowledge you will soon enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness I was able to convince the bhikkhus of the group of fiveThen I sometimes instructed two bhikkhus while the other three went for almsand the six of us lived on what those three bhikkhus brought back from their almsroundSometimes I instructed three bhikkhus while the other two went for almsand the six of us lived on what those two bhikkhus brought back from their almsroundThen the bhikkhus of the group of five thus taught and instructed by me being themselves subject to birth having understood the danger in what is subject to birth seeking the unborn supreme security from bondage Nibbāna attained the unborn supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being themselves subject to ageing sickness death sorrow and defilement having understood the danger in what is subject to ageing sickness death sorrow and defilement seeking the unageing unailing deathless sorrowless and undefiled supreme security from bondage Nibbāna they attained the unageing unailing deathless sorrowless and undefiled supreme security from bondage NibbānaThe knowledge and vision arose in them Our deliverance is unshakeable this is our last birth there is no renewal of being Bhikkhus there are these five cords of sensual pleasureWhat are the fiveForms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust Sounds cognizable by the earOdours cognizable by the noseFlavours cognizable by the tongueTangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lustThese are the five cords of sensual pleasureAs to those recluses and brahmins who are tied to these five cords of sensual pleasure infatuated with them and utterly committed to them and who use them without seeing the danger in them or understanding the escape from them it may be understood of them They have met with calamity met with disaster the Evil One may do with them as he likes Suppose a forest deer who was bound lay down on a heap of snaresit might be understood of him He has met with calamity met with disaster the hunter can do with him as he likesand when the hunter comes he cannot go where he wants So too as to those recluses and brahmins who are tied to these five cords of sensual pleasureit may be understood of them They have met with calamity met with disaster the Evil One may do with them as he likesAs to those recluses and brahmins who are not tied to these five cords of sensual pleasure who are not infatuated with them or utterly committed to them and who use them seeing the danger in them and understanding the escape from them it may be understood of them They have not met with calamity not met with disaster the Evil One cannot do with them as he likes Suppose a forest deer who was unbound lay down on a heap of snaresit might be understood of him He has not met with calamity not met with disaster the hunter cannot do with him as he likesand when the hunter comes he can go where he wants So too as to those recluses and brahmins who are not tied to these five cords of sensual pleasureit may be understood of them They have not met with calamity not met with disaster the Evil One cannot do with them as he likesSuppose a forest deer is wandering in the forest wilds he walks confidently stands confidently sits confidently lies down confidentlyWhy is thatBecause he is out of the hunters rangeSo too quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhāna which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusionThis bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Māra to have become invisible to the Evil One by depriving Māras eye of its opportunityAgain with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhāna which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentrationThis bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded MāraAgain with the fading away as well of rapture a bhikkhu abides in equanimity and mindful and fully aware still feeling pleasure with the body he enters upon and abides in the third jhāna on account of which noble ones announce He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindfulThis bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded MāraAgain with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhāna which has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimityThis bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded MāraAgain with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact with nonattention to perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite spaceThis bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded MāraAgain by completely surmounting the base of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousnessThis bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded MāraAgain by completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of nothingnessThis bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded MāraAgain by completely surmounting the base of nothingness a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionThis bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Māra to have become invisible to the Evil One by depriving Māras eye of its opportunityAgain by completely surmounting the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feeling And his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdomThis bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Māra to have become invisible to the Evil One by depriving Māras eye of its opportunityand to have crossed beyond attachment to the world He walks confidently stands confidently sits confidently lies down confidentlyWhy is thatBecause he is out of the Evil Ones range That is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas ParkThere the venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus thus Friends bhikkhusFriend they repliedThe venerable Sāriputta said this Friends just as the footprint of any living being that walks can be placed within an elephants footprint and so the elephants footprint is declared the chief of them because of its great size so too all wholesome states can be included in the Four Noble TruthsIn what fourIn the noble truth of suffering in the noble truth of the origin of suffering in the noble truth of the cessation of suffering and in the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of sufferingAnd what is the noble truth of sufferingBirth is suffering ageing is suffering death is suffering sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are suffering not to obtain what one wants is suffering in short the five aggregates affected by clinging are sufferingAnd what are the five aggregates affected by clingingThey are the material form aggregate affected by clinging the feeling aggregate affected by clinging the perception aggregate affected by clinging the formations aggregate affected by clinging and the consciousness aggregate affected by clingingAnd what is the material form aggregate affected by clingingIt is the four great elements and the material form derived from the four great elementsAnd what are the four great elementsThey are the earth element the water element the fire element and the air elementWhat friends is the earth elementThe earth element may be either internal or externalWhat is the internal earth elementWhatever internally belonging to oneself is solid solidified and clungto that is headhairs bodyhairs nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bonemarrow kidneys heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs intestines mesentery contents of the stomach feces or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is solid solidified and clungtothis is called the internal earth elementNow both the internal earth element and the external earth element are simply earth elementAnd that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfWhen one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom one becomes disenchanted with the earth element and makes the mind dispassionate toward the earth elementNow there comes a time when the water element is disturbedand then the external earth element vanishesWhen even this external earth element great as it is is seen to be impermanent subject to destruction disappearance and changewhat of this body which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while I or mine or I am  there can be no considering that as So then if others abuse revile scold and harass a bhikkhu who has seen this element as it actually is he understands thus This painful feeling born of earcontact has arisen in meThat is dependent not independentDependent on whatDependent on contactThen he sees that contact is impermanent that feeling is impermanent that perception is impermanent that formations are impermanent and that consciousness is impermanentAnd his mind having made an element its objective support enters into that new objective support and acquires confidence steadiness and resolutionNow if others attack that bhikkhu in ways that are unwished for undesired and disagreeable by contact with fists clods sticks or kniveshe understands thus This body is of such a nature that contact with fists clods sticks and knives assail itBut this has been said by the Blessed One in his advice on the simile of the saw Bhikkhus even if bandits were to sever you savagely limb by limb with a twohandled saw he who gave rise to a mind of hate towards them would not be carrying out my teachingSo tireless energy shall be aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness established my body shall be tranquil and untroubled my mind concentrated and unifiedAnd now let contact with fists clods sticks and knives assail this body for this teaching of the Buddhas is being practised by meWhen that bhikkhu thus recollects the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha if equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in himthen he arouses a sense of urgency thus It is a loss for me it is no gain for me it is bad for me it is no good for me that when I thus recollect the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in meJust as when a daughterinlaw sees her fatherinlaw she arouses a sense of urgency to please him so too when that bhikkhu thus recollects the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha if equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in him then he arouses a sense of urgencyBut if when he recollects the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha equanimity supported by the wholesome becomes established in him then he is satisfied with itAt that point friends much has been done by that bhikkhuWhat friends is the water elementThe water element may be either internal or externalWhat is the internal water elementWhatever internally belonging to oneself is water watery and clungto that is bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease spittle snot oilofthejoints urine or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is water watery and clungto this is called the internal water elementNow both the internal water element and the external water element are simply water elementAnd that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfWhen one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom one becomes disenchanted with the water element and makes the mind dispassionate toward the water elementNow there comes a time when the external water element is disturbedIt carries away villages towns cities districts and countriesThere comes a time when the waters in the great ocean sink down a hundred leagues two hundred leagues three hundred leagues four hundred leagues five hundred leagues six hundred leagues seven hundred leaguesThere comes a time when the waters in the great ocean stand seven palms deep six palms deeptwo palms deep only a palm deepThere comes a time when the waters in the great ocean stand seven fathoms deep six fathoms deeptwo fathoms deep only a fathom deepThere comes a time when the waters in the great ocean stand half a fathom deep only waist deep only knee deep only ankle deepThere comes a time when the waters in the great ocean are not enough to wet even the joint of a fingerWhen even this external water element great as it is is seen to be impermanent subject to destruction disappearance and change what of this bodywhich is clung to by craving and lasts but a while There can be no considering that as I or mine or I am So then if others abuse revile scold and harass a bhikkhu who has seen this element as it actually is he understands thusAt that point too friends much has been done by that bhikkhuWhat friends is the fire elementThe fire element may be either internal or externalWhat is the internal fire elementWhatever internally belonging to oneself is fire fiery and clungto that is that by which one is warmed ages and is consumed and that by which what is eaten drunk consumed and tasted gets completely digested or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is fire fiery and clungto this is called the internal fire elementNow both the internal fire element and the external fire element are simply fire elementAnd that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfWhen one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom one becomes disenchanted with the fire element and makes the mind dispassionate toward the fire elementNow there comes a time when the external fire element is disturbedIt burns up villages towns cities districts and countriesIt goes out due to lack of fuel only when it comes to green grass or to a road or to a rock or to water or to a fair open spaceThere comes a time when they seek to make a fire even with a cocks feather or a hideparingWhen even this external fire element great as it is is seen to be impermanent subject to destruction disappearance and changewhat of this body which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while There can be no considering that as I or mine or I am So then if others abuse revile scold and harass a bhikkhu who has seen this element as it actually is he understands thusAt that point too friends much has been done by that bhikkhuWhat friends is the air elementThe air element may be either internal or externalWhat is the internal air elementWhatever internally belonging to oneself is air airy and clungto that is upgoing winds downgoing winds winds in the belly winds in the bowels winds that course through the limbs inbreath and outbreath or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is air airy and clungto this is called the internal air elementNow both the internal air element and the external air element are simply air elementAnd that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfWhen one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom one becomes disenchanted with the air element and makes the mind dispassionate toward the air elementNow there comes a time when the external air element is disturbedIt sweeps away villages towns cities districts and countriesThere comes a time in the last month of the hot season when they seek wind by means of a fan or bellows and even the strands of straw in the dripfringe of the thatch do not stirWhen even this external air element great as it is is seen to be impermanent subject to destruction disappearance and changewhat of this body which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while I or mine or I am  there can be no considering that as So then if others abuse revile scold and harass a bhikkhu who has seen this element as it actually isAt that point too friends much has been done by that bhikkhuFriends just as when a space is enclosed by timber and creepers grass and clay it comes to be termed just house so too when a space is enclosed by bones and sinews flesh and skin it comes to be termed just material formIf friends internally the eye is intact but no external forms come into its range and there is no corresponding conscious engagement then there is no manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousnessIf internally the eye is intact and external forms come into its range but there is no corresponding conscious engagement then there is no manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousnessBut when internally the eye is intact and external forms come into its range and there is the corresponding conscious engagementthen there is the manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousnessThe material form in what has thus come to be is included in the material form aggregate affected by clinging The feeling in what has thus come to be is included in the feeling aggregate affected by clinging The perception in what has thus come to be is included in the perception aggregate affected by clinging The formations in what has thus come to be are included in the formations aggregate affected by clinging The consciousness in what has thus come to be is included in the consciousness aggregate affected by clingingHe understands thus This indeed is how there comes to be the inclusion gathering and amassing of things into these five aggregates affected by clingingNow this has been said by the Blessed One One who sees dependent origination sees the Dhamma one who sees the Dhamma sees dependent originationAnd these five aggregates affected by clinging are dependently arisenThe desire indulgence inclination and holding based on these five aggregates affected by clinging is the origin of sufferingThe removal of desire and lust the abandonment of desire and lust for these five aggregates affected by clinging is the cessation of sufferingAt that point too friends much has been done by that bhikkhuIf friends internally the ear is intact but no external sounds come into its rangeinternally the nose is intactinternally the tongue is intactinternally the body is intact If friends internally the mind is intact but no external mindobjects come into its range and there is no corresponding conscious engagement then there is no manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousnessIf internally the mind is intact and external mindobjects come into its range but there is no corresponding conscious engagement then there is no manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousnessBut when internally the mind is intact and external mindobjects come into its range and there is the corresponding conscious engagement then there is the manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousnessThe material form in what has thus come to be is included in the material form aggregate affected by clinging The feeling in what has thus come to be is included in the feeling aggregate affected by clinging The perception in what has thus come to be is included in the perception aggregate affected by clinging The formations in what has thus come to be are included in the formations aggregate affected by clinging The consciousness in what has thus come to be is included in the consciousness aggregate affected by clingingHe understands thus This indeed is how there comes to be the inclusion gathering and amassing of things into these five aggregates affected by clingingNow this has been said by the Blessed One One who sees dependent origination sees the Dhamma one who sees the Dhamma sees dependent originationAnd these five aggregates affected by clinging are dependently arisenThe desire indulgence inclination and holding based on these five aggregates affected by clinging is the origin of sufferingThe removal of desire and lust the abandonment of desire and lust for these five aggregates affected by clinging is the cessation of sufferingAt that point too friends much has been done by that bhikkhu That is what the venerable Sāriputta saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the venerable Sāriputtas wordsI heard thus At one time the Blessed One lived in a peaked hall in the Great forest in VesāliAt that time Saccaka the son of Nigan tha a clever disputant considered wise by many lived in VesāliHe would go about Vesāli saying I do not see a recluse a brahmin a leader of a crowd a teacher of a crowd or one acknowledging he is perfect and rightfully enlightened not shivering trembling and sweating when invited to a dispute by meEven a lifeless pillar drawn to a dispute by me would shiver and trembleso what of a human beingThen venerable Assaji putting on robes in the morning taking bowl and robes entered Vsāli for almsSaccaka the son of Nigantha walking and wandering for exercise saw venerable Assaji coming in the distanceand approached venerable Assaji exchanged friendly greetingsand standing on a side said Good Assaji how are the disciples of the recluse Gotama trained and in what section are they given a lot of the trainingThen venerable Assaji said Aggivessana the Blessed One gives his disciples a lot of advice and trains the disciples much in this sectionBhikkhus matter is impermanent Feelings are impermanent Perceptions are impermanent Determinations are impermanent and consciousness is impermanentBhikkhus matter is not self Feelings are not self Perceptions are not self Determinations are not self and consciousness is not selfAll determinations are impermanent All things are not selfAggivessana the Blessed One advises the bhikkhus much on this and the training is much on thisGood Assaji we heard something that should not be heard If the recluse Gotama is of this viewindeed we should meet him for a conversation on this To dispel doubts on this viewAt that time about five hundred Licchavis were assembled in the assembly hall for some purposeThen Saccaka the son of Nigan tha approached them and said Come Licchavis today there is a dispute between me and the recluse GotamaIf the recluse Gotama affirms this view of his disciple bhikkhu Assaji we will draw the recluse Gotama to a dispute pulling him about and dragging him about Like a strong man taking a sheep by its long fleece would pull it and drag it aboutOr like a strong brewer of liqueur submerging a huge crater in a deep pond would shake it about and holding it by the ears would shake it about In the same manner we would pull and drag about the recluse Gotama in a disputeLike an elephant of sixty cubits descending a deep pond would enjoy the game of washing hemp We would enjoy the game of washing hemp with the recluse GotamaCome Licchavis there will be a dispute between me and the recluse GotamaThen a certain Licchavi would say What has the recluse Gotama a dispute with Saccaka the son of Nigantha Or is it that Saccaka the son of Nigantha has a dispute with the recluse GotamaAnother Licchavi would say What is resplendent Saccaka the son of Nigan tha drawing the recluse Gotama for a dispute Or is the recluse Gotama drawing Saccaka the son of Nigantha for a disputeThen Saccaka the son of Nigantha approached the gabled hall in the Great forest followed by about five hundred LicchavisAt that time many bhikkhus were doing the walking meditation in the openThen Saccaka the son of Nigantha approached those bhikkhus and asked Where does good Gotama abide at this timewe like to see himAggivessana the Blessed One has entered the great forest and is seated at the root of a tree to spend the dayThen Saccāka the son of Nigantha approached the Great forest and the Blessed One exchanging friendly greetings with himsat on a sideThen some of those Licchavis worshipped the Blessed One and sat on a side Some exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a sidesome clasped their hands in the direction of the Blessed One and sat on a side some voiced their names and clans and sat on a side and others sat on a side silentlySaccaka the son of Nigantha then said thus to the Blessed One We would ask a certain question from good Gotama If good Gotama would give us leave and would explain it to usThe Blessed One said ask Aggivessana what you desireHow does good Gotama advise the disciples and in what sections are they given much trainingAggivessana I advise and train my disciple much in this manner Bhikkhus matter is impermanent Feelings are impermanent Perceptions and determinations are impermanent Consciousness is impermanentBhikkhus matter is not self Feelings are not self Perceptions and determinations are not self Consciousness is not selfAll determinations are impermanent All things are not selfAggivessana I advise my disciples and train them much in this sectionGood Gotama a comparison occurs to meSay it AggivessanaLike these seed groups and vegetable groups that grow and develop established and supported on earthSo also all powerful work that has to be done should be done established and supported on earthIn the same manner this person established in matter with the material self accrues merit or demerit This feeling person established in feelings accrues merit or demerit The perceiving person established in perceptions accrues merit or demerit The determining person established in determinations accrues merit or demerit The conscious person established in consciousness accrues merit or demeritAggivessana do you say Matter is my self Feelings are my self Perceptions are my self Determinations are my self Conscioussness is my selfGood Gotama I say matter is my self Feelings are my self Perceptions are my self Determinations are my self Consciousness is my self so also this large crowd says itWhat does this large crowd say about your viewYou should dispute on your viewGood Gotama I say matter is my self Feelings are my self Perceptions are my self Determinations are my self and conscioussness is my selfThen I will cross question you on this and you may reply as it pleases youAggivessana do head anointed warrior kings like king Pasenadi of Kosala king Ajātasattu of Magadha wield power over their kingdoms to execute those that have to be executed to produce those that have to be produced and to banish those that have to be banishedYes good Gotama the head anointed warrior kings such as king Pasenadi of Kosala and king Ajātasattu of Magadha wield power in their kingdoms to execute those that have to be executed to produce those that have to be produced and to banish those that have to be banishedEven the leaders gathered here of the Vajjis and Mallas wield power in their kingdoms to execute those that have to be executed to produce those that have to be produced and to banish those that have to be banishedso there are no doubts about head anointed warrior kings like king Pasenadi of Kosala and king Ajātasattu of MagadhaAggivessana you say matter is your self do you wield power over that matter as may my matter be thus and not thusWhen this was said Saccaka the son of Nigantha became silentFor the second time the Blessed One asked Aggivessana you say matter is your self do you wield power over that matter as may my matter be thus and not thusFor the second time Saccaka the son of Nigantha became silentThen the Blessed One said explain it Aggivessana It is not the time for you to be silentIf someone does not reply a rightful question asked by the Thus Gone One up to the third time his head splits into seven piecesAt that moment Vajrapāni the demon was seen in space with a flaming thunderbolt in his hand as though to split the head of Saccaka the son of Nigantha if he did not reply the rightful question asked up to the third time by the Thus gone OneVajrapāni the demon was seen by the Blessed One and Saccaka the son of NiganthaThen Saccaka the son of Nigantha frightened and with hairs standing on end sought the refuge and protection of the Blessed One said Good Gotama ask me I will explainAggivessana you that say matter is your self do you wield power over that matter as may my matter be thus and not otherwiseNo good GotamaAttend carefully and reply AggivessanaWhat you said earlier does not agree with what you say nowAggivessana you that say feelings are your self do you wield power over those feelings as may my feelings be thus and not otherwiseNo good GotamaAttend carefully and reply AggivessanaWhat you said earlier does not agree with what you say nowAggivessana you that say perceptions are your self do you wield power over those perceptions as may my perceptions be thus and not otherwiseNo good GotamaAttend carefully and reply AggivessanaWhat you said earlier does not agree with what you say nowAggivessana you that say determinations are your self do you wield power over those determinations as may my determinations be thus and not otherwiseNo good GotamaAttend carefully and reply AggivessanaWhat you said earlier does not agree with what you say nowAggivessana you that say consciousness is your self do you wield power over that consciousness as may my consciousness be thus and not otherwiseNo good GotamaAttend carefully and reply AggivessanaWhat you said earlier does not agree with what you say nowWhat do you think ggivessana is matter permanent or impermanentImpermanent good GotamaThat impermanent thing is it unpleasant or pleasantUnpleasant good GotamaThat impermanent unpleasant changing thing is it suitable to be considered that is mine that I be that is my selfNo good GotamaAggivessana are feelingsare perceptions are determinations is consciousness permanent or impermanentImpermanent good GotamaThat impermanent thing is it unpleasanat or pleasantUnpleasant good GotamaThat impermanent unpleasant changing thing is it suitable to be considered that is mine that I be that is my selfNo good GotamaAggivessana a certain one clinging to unpleasantness over powered by it pressed down by it and reflecting its mine would think its my self Would he accurately understand unpleasāntness by himself or ward it off and abideGood Gotama how could it beNo good Gotama that would not happenAggivessana like a man wandering in search of heartwood would enter a forest with a daggerseeing a tall straight new plantain treehe would cut its roots and top and felling it would open up the sheavesand would not come even to sapwood so where is heartwoodIn the same manner Aggivessana with your own dispute you being cross questioned asked for reasons and we studying with you found you empty useless and gone wrongHave you said to these gatherings in Vesāli such a thing I do not see a recluse or brahmin a leader of a crowd a teacher of a crowd or even one who acknowledges he is perfect and rightfully enlightened drawn into a dispute by me would not shiver tremble and sweatEven a lifeless pillar drawn to a dispute by me would shiver and trembleso what of a human beingAs for you Aggivessana there is sweat trickling down your forehead and some drops of sweat have pierced your over shawl and has fallen on the groundon my body at the moment there is no sweatSaying that the Blessed One disclosed his golden hued body to that gatheringWhen this was said Saccaka the son of Nigantha became silent confused his form drooping face turned down unable to reply sat downThen Dummukha the son of the Licchavis saw Saccaka the son of Nigantha silent confused the form drooping face turned down unable to reply sitting He said to the Blessed One venerable sir a comparison comes to meThe Blessed One said say it DummukhaVenerable sir close to a village or hamlet theres a pondin it a crab livesThen a lot of boys and girls approach the pond descend it and pull out the crab on to dry landWhenever the crab puts out a limb a boy or a girl would cut it and destroy it with a stick or a stoneThus the crab with all his limbs destroyed is unable to descend to the pond as beforeIn the same manner the Blessed One has cut broken and destroyed all the distortions of views and the restlessness of Saccaka the son of Nigantha and it is not possible that he should approach the Blessed One with the intention of a disputeWhen this was said Saccaka the son of Nigantha said thus to Dummukha the son of the Licchavis Wait Dhummukha we have to discuss with good GotamaGood Gotama this view of mine is also the view of all other recluses and brahminsI think it is idle talkHow do the disciples of good Gotama do the work in the dispensation follow the given advice dispelling doubts become confident and abide not relying on a teacher in the dispensation of the TeacherHere Aggivessana my disciples see whatever matter in the past future or present internal or external coarse or fine unexalted or exalted far or near all that matter is not mine Im not that it is not my self This is seen with right wisdom as it really is Whatever feelings whatever perceptions whatever determinations whatever consciousness in the past future or present internal or external coarse or fine un exalted or exalted far or near all consciousness is not mine Im not that it is not my self This is seen with right wisdom as it really isAggivessana with this much my disciples have done the work in my dispensation followed the advice dispelling doubts have become confident not relying on a teacher abideGood Gotama how does the bhikkhu become perfect with desires destroyed the holy life lived having done what should be done the weight put down attained the highest good the desire to be destroyed and rightly knowing releasedHere Aggivessana whatever matter in the past future or present internal or external coarse or fine unexalted or exalted far or near all matter is not mine Im not that it is not my self This should be seen with right wisdom as it really is and the mind released without holdings Whatever feelings in the past future or present internal or external coarse or fine unexalted or exalted far or near all feelings are not mine Im not that its not my self This should be seen with right wisdom as it really is and the mind released without holdings Whatever perceptions in the past future or present internal or external coarse or fine unexalted or exalted far or near all perceptions are not mine Im not that its not my self This should be seen with right wisdom as it really is and the mind released without holdings Whatever determinations in the past future or present internal or external coarse or fine unexalted or exalted far or near all determinations are not mine Im not that its not my self This should be seen with right wisdom as it really is and the mind released without holdings Whatever consciousness in the past future or present internal or external coarse or fine unexalted or exalted far or near all consciousness is not mine Im not that its not my self This should be seen with right wisdom as it really is and the mind released without holdingsAggivessana when this much is done the bhikkhu is perfect with desires destroyed the holy life lived what should be done done the weight put down come to the highest good the desires to be destroyed and rightly knowing is releasedAggivessana the mind of the bhīkkhu so released is endowed with three nobilities The nobility of vision the nobility of method and the nobility of releaseAggivessana the bhikkhu so released honours reveres and esteems the Thus Gone One The Blessed One is enlightened preaches for enlightenment the Blessed One tamed preaches for taming the Blessed One appeased preaches for appeasement The Blessed One crossed over preaches for crossing over the Blessed One extinguished preaches for extinguishingWhen this was said Saccaka the son of Nigan tha said thus to the Blessed One We were bold and daring and thought should insult good Gotama with a disputeOne insulting a furious elephant would be safe yet not a man insulting good GotamaThere is safety to a man disturbing a burning flame but there is no safety to a man insulting good GotamaA man insulting a venomous snake would find safety yet one insulting good Gotama would not find safetyWe were bold and daring and thought to insult good Gotama with a disputeMay good Gotama accept tomorrows meal from me together with the Community of bhikkhusThe Blessed One accepted in silenceThen Saccaka the son of Nigan tha knowing that the Blessed One had accepted addressed the Licchavis Good Licchavis listen I have invited the Blessed One and the Community of bhikkhus for tomorrows mealBring what ever you think is suitableThen those Licchavis at the end of that night brought five hundred bowls filled with cooked riceSaccaka the son of Nigantha too caused to prepare plenty of nourishing eatables and drinks in his own monastery and informed the time to the Blessed One Good Gotama it is time the food is readyThen the Blessed One putting on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes approached the monastery of Saccaka the son of Nigan tha and sat on the prepared seat together with the Community of bhikkhusThen Saccaka the son of Nigan tha with his own hands offered plenty of nourishing eatables and drinks to the Community of bhikkhus headed by the Enlightened OneSaccaka the son of Nigan tha saw that the Blessed One had finished taking the meal and had put away the bowl then he took a low seat sat on a sideand said to the Blessed One May the excellent merits of this offering be to those giversAggivessana may merits accured from offerings made to you not free from greed hate and delusion be to the giversMay merits accured from making offerings to me free of greed hate and delusion be to youThus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Vesālī in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked RoofNow on that occasion when it was morning the Blessed One had finished dressing and had taken his bowl and outer robe desiring to go into Vesālī for almsThen as Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas son was walking and wandering for exercise he came to the Hall with the Peaked Roof in the Great WoodThe venerable nanda saw him coming in the distanceand said to the Blessed One Venerable sir here comes Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas son a debater and a clever speaker regarded by many as a saintHe wants to discredit the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaIt would be good if the Blessed One would sit down for a while out of compassionThe Blessed One sat down on the seat made readyThen Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas son went up to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideand said to the Blessed OneMaster Gotama there are some recluses and brahmins who abide pursuing development of body but not development of mindThey are touched by bodily painful feelingIn the past when one was touched by bodily painful feeling ones thighs would become rigid ones heart would burst hot blood would gush from ones mouth and one would go mad go out of ones mindSo then the mind was subservient to the body the body wielded mastery over itWhy is thatBecause the mind was not developedBut there are some recluses and brahmins who abide pursuing development of mind but not development of bodyThey are touched by mental painful feelingIn the past when one was touched by mental painful feeling ones thighs would become rigid ones heart would burst hot blood would gush from ones mouth and one would go mad go out of ones mindSo then the body was subservient to the mind the mind wielded mastery over itWhy is thatBecause the body was not developedMaster Gotama it has occurred to me Surely Master Gotamas disciples abide pursuing development of mind but not development of body But Aggivessana what have you learned about development of body Well there are for example Nanda Vaccha Kisa Sankicca Makkhali Gosāla They go naked rejecting conventions licking their hands not coming when asked not stopping when asked they do not accept food brought or food specially made or an invitation to a meal they receive nothing from a pot from a bowl across a threshold across a stick across a pestle from two eating together from a pregnant woman from a woman giving suck from a woman in the midst of men from where food is advertised to be distributed from where a dog is waiting from where flies are buzzing they accept no fish or meat they drink no liquor wine or fermented brewThey keep to one house to one morsel they keep to two houses to two morselsthey keep to seven houses to seven morselsThey live on one saucerful a day on two saucerfuls a dayon seven saucerfuls a dayThey take food once a day once every two daysonce every seven daysthus even up to once every fortnight they dwell pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervalsBut do they subsist on so little AggivessanaNo Master Gotamasometimes they consume excellent hard food eat excellent soft food taste excellent delicacies drink excellent drinksThereby they again regain their strength fortify themselves and become fat What they earlier abandoned Aggivessana they later gather together again That is how there is increase and decrease of this bodyBut what have you learned about development of mind When Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas son was asked by the Blessed One about development of mind he was unable to answerThen the Blessed One told him What you have just spoken of as development of body Aggivessana is not development of body according to the Dhamma in the Noble Ones DisciplineSince you do not know what development of body is how could you know what development of mind isNevertheless Aggivessana as to how one is undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mind and developed in body and developed in mindlisten and attend closely to what I shall sayYes sir Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas son repliedThe Blessed One said thisHow Aggivessana is one undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mindHere Aggivessana pleasant feeling arises in an untaught ordinary personTouched by that pleasant feeling he lusts after pleasure and continues to lust after pleasureThat pleasant feeling of his ceasesWith the cessation of the pleasant feeling painful feeling arisesTouched by that painful feeling he sorrows grieves and laments he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraughtWhen that pleasant feeling has arisen in him it invades his mind and remains because body is not developed And when that painful feeling has arisen in him it invades his mind and remains because mind is not developedAnyone in whom in this double manner arisen pleasant feeling invades his mind and remains because body is not developed and arisen painful feeling invades his mind and remains because mind is not developed is thus undeveloped in body because mind is not developed is thus undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mindAnd how Aggivessana is one developed in body and developed in mindHere Aggivessana pleasant feeling arises in a welltaught noble discipleTouched by that pleasant feeling he does not lust after pleasure or continue to lust after pleasureThat pleasant feeling of his ceasesWith the cessation of the pleasant feeling painful feeling arisesTouched by that painful feeling he does not sorrow grieve and lament he does not weep beating his breast and become distraughtWhen that pleasant feeling has arisen in him it does not invade his mind and remain because body is developed And when that painful feeling has arisen in him it does not invade his mind and remain because mind is developedAnyone in whom in this double manner arisen pleasant feeling does not invade his mind and remain because body is developed and arisen painful feeling does not invade his mind and remain because mind is developedis thus developed in body and developed in mindI have confidence in Master Gotama thusMaster Gotama is developed in body and developed in mind Surely Aggivessana your words are offensive and discourteous but still I will answer youSince I shaved off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness it has not been possible for arisen pleasant feeling to invade my mind and remain or for arisen painful feeling to invade my mind and remain Has there never arisen in Master Gotama a feeling so pleasant that it could invade his mind and remain Has there never arisen in Master Gotama a feeling so painful that it could invade his mind and remain Why not AggivessanaHere Aggivessana before my enlightenment while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisatta I thought Household life is crowded and dusty life gone forth is wide openIt is not easy while living in a home to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shellSuppose I shave off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessness Later while still young a blackhaired young man endowed with the blessing of youth in the prime of lifeAnd I sat down there thinking This will serve for strivingNow these three similes occurred to me spontaneously never heard beforeSuppose there were a wet sappy piece of wood lying in waterand a man came with an upper firestick thinking I shall light a fire I shall produce heatWhat do you think Aggivessana Could the man light a fire and produce heat by taking the upper firestick and rubbing it against the wet sappy piece of wood lying in the water No Master GotamaWhy notBecause it is a wet sappy piece of wood and it is lying in waterEventually the man would reap only weariness and disappointmentSo too Aggivessana as to those recluses and brahmins who still do not live bodily withdrawn from sensual pleasures and whose sensual desire affection infatuation thirst and fever for sensual pleasures has not been fully abandoned and suppressed internally even if those good recluses and brahmins feel painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion they are incapable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenmentand even if those good recluses and brahmins do not feel painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion they are incapable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenmentThis was the first simile that occurred to me spontaneously never heard beforeAgain Aggivessana a second simile occurred to me spontaneously never heard beforeSuppose there were a wet sappy piece of wood lying on dry land far from waterand a man came with an upper firestick thinking I shall light a fire I shall produce heatWhat do you think Aggivessana Could the man light a fire and produce heat by taking the upper firestick and rubbing it against the wet sappy piece of wood lying on dry land far from water No Master GotamaWhy notBecause it is a wet sappy piece of wood even though it is lying on dry land far from waterEventually the man would reap only weariness and disappointmentSo too Aggivessana as to those recluses and brahmins who live bodily withdrawn from sensual pleasures but whose sensual desire affection infatuation thirst and fever for sensual pleasures has not been fully abandoned and suppressed internally even if those good recluses and brahmins feel painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion they are incapable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenmentand even if those good recluses and brahmins do not feel painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion they are incapable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenmentThis was the second simile that occurred to me spontaneously never heard beforeAgain Aggivessana a third simile occurred to me spontaneously never heard beforeSuppose there were a dry sapless piece of wood lying on dry land far from waterand a man came with an upper firestick thinking I shall light a fire I shall produce heat What do you think AggivessanaCould the man light a fire and produce heat by rubbing it against the dry sapless piece of wood lying on dry land far from water Yes Master GotamaWhy soBecause it is a dry sapless piece of wood and it is lying on dry land far from water So too Aggivessana as to those recluses and brahmins who live bodily withdrawn from sensual pleasures and whose sensual desire affection infatuation thirst and fever for sensual pleasures has been fully abandoned and suppressed internally even if those good recluses and brahmins feel painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion they are capable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenmentand even if those good recluses and brahmins do not feel painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion they are capable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenmentThis was the third simile that occurred to me spontaneously never heard beforeThese are the three similes that occurred to me spontaneously never heard beforeI thought Suppose with my teeth clenched and my tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth I beat down constrain and crush mind with mind So with my teeth clenched and my tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth I beat down constrained and crushed mind with mindWhile I did so sweat ran from my armpitsJust as a strong man might seize a weaker man by the head or shoulders and beat him down constrain him and crush him so too with my teeth clenched and my tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth I beat down constrained and crushed mind with mind and sweat ran from my armpitsBut although tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was established my body was overwrought and uncalm because I was exhausted by the painful strivingBut such painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remainI thought Suppose I practise the breathingless meditation So I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my mouth and noseWhile I did so there was a loud sound of winds coming out from my earholesJust as there is a loud sound when a smiths bellows are blown so too while I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my nose and ears there was a loud sound of winds coming out from my earholesBut although tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was establishedmy body was overwrought and uncalm because I was exhausted by the painful strivingBut such painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remainI thought Suppose I practise further the breathingless meditation So I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my mouth nose and earsWhile I did so violent winds cut through my headJust as if a strong man were to crush my head with the tip of a sharp sword so too while I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my mouth nose and ears violent winds cut through my headBut although tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was establishedmy body was overwrought and uncalm because I was exhausted by the painful strivingBut such painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remainI thought Suppose I practise further the breathingless meditation So I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my mouth nose and earsWhile I did so there were violent pains in my headJust as if a strong man were tightening a tough leather strap around my head as a headband so too while I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my mouth nose and ears there were violent pains in my headBut although tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was establishedmy body was overwrought and uncalm because I was exhausted by the painful strivingBut such painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remainI thought Suppose I practise further the breathingless meditation So I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my mouth nose and earsWhile I did so violent winds carved up my bellyJust as if a skilled butcher or his apprentice were to carve up an oxs belly with a sharp butchers knife so too while I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my mouth nose and ears violent winds carved up my bellyBut although tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was establishedmy body was overwrought and uncalm because I was exhausted by the painful strivingBut such painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remainI thought Suppose I practise further the breathingless meditation So I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my mouth nose and earsWhile I did so there was a violent burning in my bodyJust as if two strong men were to seize a weaker man by both arms and roast him over a pit of hot coals so too while I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my mouth nose and ears there was a violent burning in my bodyBut although tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was establishedmy body was overwrought and uncalm because I was exhausted by the painful strivingBut such painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remainNow when deities saw me some said The recluse Gotama is dead Other deities said The recluse Gotama is not dead he is dying And other deities said The recluse Gotama is not dead nor dying he is an arahant for such is the way arahants abide I thought Suppose I practise entirely cutting off food Then deities came to me and said Good sir do not practise entirely cutting off foodIf you do so we shall infuse heavenly food into the pores of your skin and you will live on that I considered If I claim to be completely fasting while these deities infuse heavenly food into the pores of my skin and I live on that then I shall be lying So I dismissed those deities saying There is no need I thought Suppose I take very little food a handful each time whether of bean soup or lentil soup or vetch soup or pea soup So I took very little food a handful each time whether of bean soup or lentil soup or vetch soup or pea soupWhile I did so my body reached a state of extreme emaciationBecause of eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stemsBecause of eating so little my backside became like a camels hoofBecause of eating so little the projections on my spine stood forth like corded beadsBecause of eating so little my ribs jutted out as gaunt as the crazy rafters of an old roofless barnBecause of eating so little the gleam of my eyes sank far down in their sockets looking like the gleam of water that has sunk far down in a deep wellBecause of eating so little my scalp shrivelled and withered as a green bitter gourd shrivels and withers in the wind and sunBecause of eating so little my belly skin adhered to my backbone thus if I touched my belly skin I encountered my backbone and if I touched my backbone I encountered my belly skinBecause of eating so little if I defecated or urinated I fell over on my face thereBecause of eating so little if I tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my handsthe hair rotted at its roots fell from my body as I rubbedNow when people saw me some said The recluse Gotama is black Other people said The recluse Gotama is not black he is brown Other people said The recluse Gotama is neither black nor brown he is goldenskinned So much had the clear bright colour of my skin deteriorated through eating so littleI thought Whatever recluses or brahmins in the past have experienced painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion this is the utmost there is none beyond thisAnd whatever recluses and brahmins in the future will experience painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion this is the utmost there is none beyond thisAnd whatever recluses and brahmins at present experience painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion this is the utmost there is none beyond thisBut by this racking practice of austerities I have not attained any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesCould there be another path to enlightenment I considered I recall that when my father the Sakyan was occupied while I was sitting in the cool shade of a roseapple tree quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states I entered upon and abided in the first jhāna which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusionCould that be the path to enlightenment Then following on that memory came the realisation That is indeed the path to enlightenment I thought Why am I afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensual pleasures and unwholesome states I thought I am not afraid of that pleasure since it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures and unwholesome states I considered It is not easy to attain that pleasure with a body so excessively emaciated Suppose I ate some solid foodsome boiled rice and porridge And I ate some solid foodsome boiled rice and porridgeNow at that time five bhikkhus were waiting upon me thinking If our recluse Gotama achieves some higher state he will inform us But when I ate the boiled rice and porridge the five bhikkhus were disgusted and left me thinking The recluse Gotama now lives luxuriously he has given up his striving and reverted to luxury Now when I had eaten solid food and regained my strength then quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states I entered upon and abided in the first jhāna which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusionBut such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remainWith the stilling of applied and sustained thought I entered upon and abided in the second jhānaWith the fading away as well of raptureI entered upon and abided in the third jhānaWith the abandoning of pleasure and painI entered upon and abided in the fourth jhānaBut such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remainWhen my concentrated mind was thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability I directed it to knowledge of the recollection of past livesI recollected my manifold past lives that is one birth two birthsThus with their aspects and particulars I recollected my manifold past lives This was the first true knowledge attained by me in the first watch of the nightIgnorance was banished and true knowledge arose darkness was banished and light arose as happens in one who abides diligent ardent and resoluteBut such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remainWhen my concentrated mind was thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability I directed it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beingsThus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human I saw beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and I understood how beings pass on according to their actions This was the second true knowledge attained by me in the middle watch of the night Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose darkness was banished and light arose as happens in one who abides diligent ardent and resoluteBut such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remainWhen my concentrated mind was thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability I directed it to knowledge of the destruction of the taintsI directly knew as it actually is This is sufferingThis is the origin of sufferingThis is the cessation of sufferingThis is the way leading to the cessation of sufferingThese are the taintsThis is the origin of the taintsThis is the cessation of the taintsThis is the way leading to the cessation of the taintsWhen I knew and saw thus my mind was liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of being and from the taint of ignoranceWhen it was liberated there came the knowledge It is liberated I directly knew Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being This was the third true knowledge attained by me in the last watch of the night Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose darkness was banished and light arose as happens in one who abides diligent ardent and resoluteBut such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remainAggivessana I recall teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of many hundredsand even then each person thinks of me The recluse Gotama is teaching the Dhamma especially for me But it should not be so regarded the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma to others only to give them knowledgeWhen the talk is finished Aggivessana then I steady my mind internally quieten it bring it to singleness and concentrate it on that same sign of concentration as before in which I constantly abide This is a matter about which Master Gotama can be trusted as an accomplished and fully enlightened one should beBut does Master Gotama recall sleeping during the day I recall Aggivessana in the last month of the hot season on returning from my almsround after my meal I lay out my outer robe folded in four and lying down on my right side I fall asleep mindful and fully aware Some recluses and brahmins call that abiding in delusion Master Gotama It is not in such a way that one is deluded or undeluded AggivessanaAs to how one is deluded or undeluded listen and attend closely to what I shall sayYes sir Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas son repliedThe Blessed One said thisHim I call deluded Aggivessana who has not abandoned the taints that defile bring renewal of being give trouble ripen in suffering and lead to future birth ageing and deathfor it is with the nonabandoning of the taints that one is deludedHim I call undeluded who has abandoned the taints that defile bring renewal of being give trouble ripen in suffering and lead to future birth ageing and deathfor it is with the abandoning of the taints that one is undeludedThe Tathāgata Aggivessana has abandoned the taints that defile bring renewal of being give trouble ripen in suffering and lead to future birth ageing and death he has cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump done away with them so that they are no longer subject to future arisingJust as a palm tree whose crown is cut off is incapable of further growth so too the Tathāgata has abandoned the taints that defiledone away with them so that they are no longer subject to future arising When this was said Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas son said It is wonderful Master Gotama it is marvellous enlightenedhow when Master Gotama is spoken to offensively again and again assailed by discourteous courses of speech the colour of his skin brightens and the colour of his face clears as is to be expected of one who is accomplished and fullyI recall Master Gotama engaging Pūraṇa Kassapa in debateand then he prevaricated led the talk aside and showed anger hate and bitternessBut when Master Gotama is spoken to offensively again and again assaulted by discourteous courses of speech the colour of his skin brightens and the colour of his face clears as is to be expected of one who is accomplished and fully enlightenedI recall Master Gotama engaging Makkhali GosālaAjita KesakambalinPakudha KaccāyanaSañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta in debateand then he prevaricated led the talk aside and showed anger hate and bitternessBut when Master Gotama is spoken to offensively again and again assailed by discourteous courses of speech the colour of his skin brightens and the colour of his face clears as is to be expected of one who is accomplished and fully enlightenedAnd now Master Gotama we departWe are busy and have much to doNow is the time Aggivessana to do as you think fitThen Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas son having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones words got up from his seat and departedI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One saidOn one occasion recently I was staying in Ukkattha in the Subhaga forest at the root of a royal sala treeNow on that occasion an evil viewpoint had arisen to BakaBrahma This is constant This is permanent This is eternal This is total This is not subject to falling away  for this does not take birth does not age does not die does not fall away does not reappear And there is no other higher escapeSo I  having known with my awareness the train of thought in Baka Brahmas awareness  as a strong man would extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm vanished into the root of the royal sala tree in the Subhaga forest in Ukkattha and appeared in that brahma worldBaka Brahma saw me coming in the distance and on seeing me said Come good sir You are wellcome good sirIt has been long good sir since you arranged to come here for this good sir is constant This is permanent This is eternal This is total This is not subject to falling away  for here one does not take birth does not age does not die does not fall away does not reappearAnd there is no other higher escapeWhen this was said I told Baka Brahma How immersed in ignorance is Baka Brahma How immersed in ignorance is Baka Brahma  in that what is actually inconstant he calls constant What is actually impermanent he calls permanent What is actually noneternal he calls eternal What is actually partial he calls total What is actually subject to falling away he calls not subject to falling away Where one takes birth ages dies falls away and reappears he says For here one does not take birth does not age does not die does not fall away does not reappear And there being another higher escape he says There is no other higher escape Then Mara the Evil One taking possession of an attendant of the Brahma assembly said to me Monk Monk Dont attack him Dont attack him For this Brahma monk is the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall BeThere were monk before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the world who found fault with earth and were disgusted with earth who found fault with liquid and were disgusted with liquid who found fault with fire and were disgusted with fire who found fault with wind and were disgusted with wind who found fault with beings and were disgusted with beings who found fault with devas and were disgusted with devas who found fault with Pajapati and were disgusted with Pajapati who found fault with Brahma and were disgusted with Brahma They with the breakup of the body with the cutting off of life were established in a coarse bodyThere were monk before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the world who praised earth and were delighted with earth who praised liquid and were delighted with liquid who praised fire and were delighted with fire who praised wind and were delighted with wind who praised beings and were delighted with beings who praised devas and were delighted with devas who praised Pajapati and were delighted with Pajapati who praised Brahma and were delighted with Brahma They with the breakup of the body with the cutting off of life were established in a refined bodySo I tell you monk Please good sir do only as Brahma says Dont defy the word of BrahmaIf you defy the word of Brahma then  as a man when the goddess of fortune approaches chases her away with a stick or as a man falling into hell loses hold of the earth with his hands and feet  that will be what you have accomplishedPlease good sir do only as Brahma says Dont defy the word of BrahmaDont you see that Brahmas assembly has gatheredAnd so Mara the Evil One directed my attention to Brahmas assemblyWhen this was said I told Mara the Evil One I know you Evil One Dont assume He doesnt know meYou are Mara Evil OneAnd Brahma and Brahmas assembly and the attendants of Brahmas assembly have all fallen into your hands They have all fallen into your powerAnd you think This one too has come into my hands has come under my controlBut Evil One I have neither come into your hands nor have I come under your controlWhen this was said Baka Brahma told me But good sir what is actually constant I call constant What is actually permanent I call permanent What is actually eternal I call eternal What is actually total I call total What is actually not subject to falling away I call not subject to falling away Where one does not take birth age die fall away or reappear I say For this does not take birth does not age does not die does not fall away does not reappearAnd there being no other higher escape I say There is no other higher escapeThere were monk before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the world whose ascetic practice lasted as long as your entire life spanThey knew when there was another higher escape that there was another higher escape or when there was no other higher escape that there was no other higher escapeSo I tell you monk both that you will not find another higher escape and that to that extent you will reap your share of trouble  wearinessMonk if you relish earth you will lie close to me lie within my domain for me to banish and to do with as I likeIf you relish liquid  fire  wind  beings  devas  Pajapati  brahma you will lie close to me lie within my domain for me to banish and to do with as I likeI too know that brahma If I relish earth I will lie close to you lie within your domain for you to banish and to do with as you likeIf I relish liquid  fire  wind  beings  devas  Pajapati  brahma I will lie close to you lie within your domain for you to banish and to do with as you like Moreover I discern your sphere I discern your splendor Baka Brahma has this much great power Baka Brahma has this much great might Baka Brahma has this much great influence Well monk how do you discern my sphere how do you discern my splendor Baka Brahma has this much great power Baka Brahma has this much great might Baka Brahma has this much great influence As far as suns  moons revolve shining illuminating the directionsover a thousandfold world your control holds swayThere you know those above  below those with lust  those withoutthe state of what is as it is the state of what becomes otherwise the coming  going of beingsThat brahma is how I discern your sphere that is how I discern your splendor Baka Brahma has this much great power Baka Brahma has this much great might Baka Brahma has this much great influenceThere are brahma bodies other than yours that you dont know dont see but that I know I seeThere is brahma the body named Abhassara from which you fell away  reappeared hereFrom your having lived here so long your memory of that has become muddled That is why you dont know it dont see it but I know it I see itThus I am not your mere equal in terms of direct knowing so how could I be inferiorI am actually superior to youThere is brahma the body named Subhakinha  the body named Vehapphala  the body named Abhibhu  which you dont know dont see but that I know I seeThus I am not your mere equal in terms of direct knowing so how could I be your inferiorI am actually superior to youHaving directly known earth as earth and having directly known the extent of what has not been experienced through the earthness of earth I wasnt earth I wasnt in earth I wasnt coming from earth I wasnt Earth is mine I didnt affirm earthThus I am not your mere equal in terms of direct knowing so how could I be inferiorI am actually superior to youHaving directly known liquid as liquid  fire as fire  wind as wind  beings as beings  devas as devas  Pajapati as Pajapati  brahma as brahma  the radiant as radiant  the beautiful black as the beautiful black  the skyfruit as the skyfruit  the conqueror as the conqueror  Having directly known the all as the all and having directly known the extent of what has not been experienced through the allness of the all I wasnt the all I wasnt in the all I wasnt coming forth from the all I wasnt The all is mine I didnt affirm the allThus I am not your mere equal in terms of direct knowing so how could I be inferiorI am actually superior to youIf good sir you have directly known the extent of what has not been experienced through the allness of the all may it not turn out to be actually vain and void for youConsciousness without surface endless radiant all around has not been experienced through the earthness of earth  the liquidity of liquid  the fieriness of fire  the windiness of wind  the allness of the allWell then good sir I will disappear from youWell then brahma disappear from me if you canThen Baka Brahma thinking I will disappear from Gotama the contemplative I will disappear from Gotama the contemplative was not able to disappear from meWhen this was said I said to Baka Brahma Well then brahma I will disappear from youWell then good sir disappear from me if you canSo then monks I fabricated a fabrication of psychic power to the extent that Brahma the Brahma assembly and the attendants of the Brahma assembly heard my voice but did not see meHaving disappeared I recited this verseHaving seen danger right in becoming and becoming searching for nonbecomingI didnt affirm any kind of becoming or cling to any delightThen in Brahma the Brahma assembly and the attendants of the Brahma assembly there arose a sense of amazement  awe How amazing How awesome The great power the great might of Gotama the contemplative Never before have we seen or heard of any other contemplative or brahman of such great power such great might as that of this Gotama the contemplative who went forth from a Sakyan clanLiving in a generation that so delights in becoming so rejoices in becoming is so fond of becoming he has pulled out becoming by the rootThen Mara the Evil One taking possession of an attendant of the Brahma assembly said to me If good sir this is what you discern if this is what you have awakened to do not lead disciples or those gone forth Do not teach the Dhamma to disciples or those gone forth Do not yearn for disciples or those gone forthThere were good sir before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the world who claimed to be worthy  rightly selfawakenedThey led disciples  those gone forth They taught the Dhamma to disciples  those gone forth They yearned for disciples  those gone forth Having led disciples  those gone forth having taught the Dhamma to disciples  those gone forth having yearned for disciples  those gone forth they  on the breakup of the body with the cutting off of life  were established in a coarse bodyThere were good sir before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the world who claimed to be worthy  rightly selfawakenedThey did not lead disciples or those gone forth They did not teach the Dhamma to disciples or those gone forth They did not yearn for disciples or those gone forth Having not led disciples or those gone forth having not taught the Dhamma to disciples or those gone forth having not yearned for disciples or those gone forth they  on the breakup of the body with the cutting off of life  were established in a refined bodySo monk I tell you this Please good sir be effortless Abide committed to a pleasant abiding in the herenow  for it is skillful good sir that this not be taught Dont instruct othersWhen this was said I told Mara the Evil One I know you Evil One Dont assume He doesnt know meYou are Mara Evil OneAnd its not sympathetic to welfare that you speak thus to me Its sympathetic to what is not welfare that you speak thus to meYou think this Evil One Those to whom Gotama the contemplative will teach the Dhamma will defy my sovereigntyWithout being rightly selfawakened Evil One your contemplatives  brahmans claimed to be rightly selfawakenedI however being rightly selfawakened claim to be rightly selfawakenedFor when the Tathagata is teaching the Dhamma to his disciples he is Such When he is not teaching the Dhamma to his disciples he is SuchWhen leading his disciples he is Such When not leading his disciples he is SuchWhy is thatThe fermentations that defile that lead to further becoming that disturb that ripen in stress that tend to future birth aging  death Those the Tathagata has abandoned their root destroyed like an uprooted palmyra tree deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingJust as a palmyra tree with its crown cut off is incapable of growing again so too the fermentations that defile that lead to further becoming that disturb that ripen in stress that tend to future birth aging  death Those the Tathagata has abandoned their root destroyed like an uprooted palmyra tree deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingThus because of the silencing of Mara and because of the brahmas invitation this discourse is entitled The Brahma InvitationI have heard that on one occasion when the Blessed One was on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large Saṅgha of monks he arrived at the brahman village of the Kosalans called SālaThe brahman householders heard Master Gotama the contemplativethe son of the Sakyans having gone forth from the Sakyan clanon a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large Saṅgha of monkshas arrived at SālaAnd of that master Gotama this fine reputation has spread He is indeed a Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in clearknowing  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the cosmos unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed teacher of devas  human beings awakened blessedHe has made knownhaving realized it through direct knowledgethis world with its devas Māras  Brahmās this generation with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  common peopleHe has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end has expounded the holy life both in its particulars  in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pureIt is good to see such a worthy oneSo the brahman householders of Sāla went to the Blessed One On arrival some of them bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one sideSome of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one sideSome of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palmtopalm over their heartsSome of them sat to one side having announced their name  clanSome of them sat to one side in silenceAs they were sitting there the Blessed One asked them Householders is there any teacher agreeable to you in whom you have found grounded convictionNo lord there is no teacher agreeable to us in whom we have found grounded convictionAs you have not found an agreeable teacher you should adopt and practice this safebet teachingfor this safebet teachingwhen accepted and adoptedwill be to your longterm welfare  happinessAnd what is the safebet teaching There are some contemplatives  brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions There is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no contemplatives or brahmans who faring rightly and practicing rightly proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselvesB Some contemplatives  brahmans speaking in direct opposition to those

reborn beings no contemplatives or brahmans who faring rightly and practicing rightly proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselvesit can be expected that shunning these three skillful activitiesgood bodily conduct good verbal conduct good mental conductthey will adopt  practice these three unskillful activities bad bodily conduct bad verbal conduct bad mental conductWhy is thatBecause those venerable contemplatives  brahmans do not see in unskillful activities the drawbacks the degradation and the defilement nor in skillful activities the rewards of

previously had is abandoned while bad habituation is manifested And this wrong view wrong resolve wrong speech opposition to the arahants persuasion in what is not true Dhamma exaltation of self  disparagement of othersThese many evil unskillful activities come into play in dependence on wrong viewA With regard to this an observant person considers thus If there is no next world thenwith the breakup of the body after deaththis venerable person has made himself safe But if there is the next world then this venerable personon the breakup of the body after deathwill reappear in a plane of

hindrancesimperfections of awareness that weaken discernmentthen quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities he enters and remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationThen with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluationinternal assurance Then with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body He enters and remains in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding Then with the abandoning of pleasure  painas with the earlier disappearance of elation

death a Tathāgata does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthless  no Then does Master Gotama hold the view After death a Tathāgata both exists  does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthless  noThen does Master Gotama hold the view After death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthless  noHow is it Master Gotama when Master Gotama is asked if he holds the view the cosmos is eternalafter death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthless he says   no in each caseSeeing what drawback then is Master Gotama thus entirely dissociated from each of these ten positionsVaccha the position that the cosmos is eternal is a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of views It is accompanied by suffering distress despair  fever and it does not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation to calm direct knowledge selfawakening unbindingThe position that the cosmos is not eternal the cosmos is finite the cosmos is infinite the soul  the body are the same the soul is one thing and the body another after death a Tathāgata exists after death a Tathāgata does not exist after death a Tathāgata both exists  does not exist after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist does not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation to calm direct knowledge selfawakening unbindingDoes Master Gotama have any position at allA position Vaccha is something that a Tathāgata has done away withWhat a Tathāgata sees is this Such is form such its origination such its disappearance such is feeling such its origination such its disappearance such is perception such are fabrications such is consciousness such its origination such its disappearanceBecause of this I say a Tathāgatawith the ending fading away cessation renunciation  relinquishment of all suppositions all excogitations all Imaking  minemaking  obsessions with conceitis through lack of clingingsustenance releasedBut Master Gotama the monk whose mind is thus released Where does he reappearReappear Vaccha doesnt applyIn that case Master Gotama he does not reappearDoes not reappear Vaccha doesnt apply both does  does not reappeardoesnt applyneither does nor does not reappeardoesnt applyHow is it Master Gotama when Master Gotama is asked if the monk reappearsdoes not reappearboth does  does not reappearneither does nor does not reappear he says  doesnt apply in each caseAt this point Master Gotama I am befuddled at this point confusedThe modicum of clarity coming to me from your earlier conversation is now obscuredOf course youre befuddled Vaccha Of course youre confusedDeep Vaccha is this phenomenon hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wiseFor those with other views other practices other satisfactions other aims other teachers it is difficult to knowThat being the case I will counterquestion you on this matter Answer as you see fitWhat do you think Vaccha If a fire were burning in front of you would you know that This fire is burning in front of meyesAnd if someone were to ask you Vaccha This fire burning in front of you dependent on what is it burning Thus asked how would you replyI would reply This fire burning in front of me is burning dependent on grass  timber as its sustenanceIf the fire burning in front of you were to go out would you know that This fire burning in front of me has gone outyesAnd if someone were to ask you This fire that has gone out in front of you in which direction from here has it gone East West North Or south Thus asked how would you replyThat doesnt apply Master Gotama Any fire burning dependent on a sustenance of grass  timber being unnourishedfrom having consumed that sustenance and not being offered any otheris classified simply as out unboundIn the same way Vaccha any form by which one describing the Tathāgata would describe him That the Tathāgata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingFreed from the classification of form Vaccha the Tathāgata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the seaReappears doesnt apply Does not reappear doesnt apply Both does  does not reappear doesnt apply Neither reappears nor does not reappear doesnt applyAny feeling Any perception Any fabrication Any consciousness by which one describing the Tathāgata would describe him That the Tathāgata has

deep boundless hard to fathom like the seaReappears doesnt apply Does not reappear doesnt apply Both does  does not reappear doesnt apply Neither reappears nor does not reappear doesnt applyWhen this was said Vacchagotta the wanderer said to the Blessed One Master Gotama its as if there were a great Sal tree not far from a village or townFrom inconstancy its branches and leaves would wear away its bark would wear away its sapwood would wear away so that on a later occasiondivested of branches leaves bark  sapwoodit would stand as pure heartwood In the same way Master Gotamas words are divested of branches leaves bark  sapwood and stand as pure heartwoodMagnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotamathrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clear I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monks May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryAnd at that time in King Pasenadis realm there was a bandit named Angulimala brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beingsHe turned villages into nonvillages towns into nontowns settled countryside into unsettled countrysideHaving repeatedly killed human beings he wore a garland made of fingers Then the Blessed One early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe  bowl went into Savatthi for almsHaving wandered for alms in Savatthi and returning from his alms round after his meal he set his lodging in order Carrying his robes  bowl he went along the road to where Angulimala was stayingCowherds shepherds  farmers saw him going along the road to where Angulimala was stayingand on seeing him said to him Dont go along that road contemplativefor on that road is Angulimala brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beingsHe has turned villages into nonvillages towns into nontowns settled countryside into unsettled countrysideHaving repeatedly killed human beings he wears a garland made of fingersGroups of ten twenty thirty  forty men have gone along that roadand even they have fallen into Angulimalas handsWhen this was said the Blessed One kept going in silenceA second time A third time cowherds shepherds  farmers said to the Blessed One Dont go along that road contemplativeGroups of ten twenty thirty  forty men have gone along that roadand even they have fallen into Angulimalas handsWhen this was said the Blessed One kept going in silenceThen Angulimala saw the Blessed One coming from afarand on seeing him this thought occurred to him Isnt it amazing Isnt it astoundingGroups of ten twenty thirty  forty men have gone along this roadand even they have fallen into my handsand yet now this contemplative comes attacking as it were alone and without a companionWhy dont I kill himSo Angulimala taking up his sword  shield buckling on his bow  quiver followed right behind the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One willed a feat of psychic power such that Angulimala though running with all his might could not catch up with the Blessed One walking at normal paceThen the thought occurred to Angulimala Isnt it amazing Isnt it astoundingIn the past Ive chased  seized even a swiftrunning elephant a swiftrunning horse a swiftrunning chariot a swiftrunning deer But now even though Im running with all my might I cant catch up with this contemplative walking at normal paceSo he stopped and called out to the Blessed One Stop contemplative StopI have stopped Angulimala You stopThen the thought occurred to Angulimala These Sakyan contemplatives are speakers of the truth asserters of the truthsand yet this contemplative even while walking says I have stopped Angulimala You stopWhy dont I question him So Angulimala the bandit addressed this verse to the Blessed OneWhile walking contemplative you say I have stoppedBut when I have stopped you say I haventI ask you the meaning of thisHow have you stopped How havent I The Buddha I have stopped Angulimala once  for allhaving cast off violence toward all living beingsYou though are unrestrained toward beingsThats how Ive stopped and you haventAngulimala At long last a greatly revered great seer for my sakehas come to the great forestI will go about having abandoned evilHaving heard your verse in line with the DhammaSo saying the bandit hurled his sword  weaponsover a cliff into a chasm a pitThen the bandit paid homage to the feet of the One Wellgoneand right there requested the GoingforthThe Awakened One the compassionate great seerthe teacher of the world along with its devassaid to him then Come bhikkhuThat in itself was bhikkhuhood for himThen the Blessed One set out wandering toward Savatthi with Ven Angulimala as his attendant monkAfter wandering by stages he reached Savatthiand there he lived near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryNow at that time a large crowd of people loud  noisy had gathered at the gates to King Pasenadi Kosalas inner palace calling out There is a bandit in your realm sire named Angulimala brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beingsHe has turned villages into nonvillages towns into nontowns settled countryside into unsettled countrysideHaving repeatedly killed human beings he wears a garland made of fingersThe king must stamp him outThen King Pasenadi Kosala with a cavalry of roughly  horsemen drove out of Savatthiand entered the monasteryDriving as far as the ground was passable for chariots he got down from his chariot and went on foot to the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him What is it great king Has King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha provoked you or have the Licchavis of Vesali or some other hostile kingNo lord King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha hasnt provoked me nor have the Licchavis of Vesali nor has some other hostile kingThere is a bandit in my realm lord named Angulimala brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beingsHe has turned villages into nonvillages towns into nontowns settled countryside into unsettled countrysideHaving repeatedly killed human beings he wears a garland made of fingersI am going to stamp him outGreat king suppose you were to see Angulimala with his hair  beard shaved off wearing the ochre robe having gone forth from the home life into homelessness refraining from killing living beings refraining from taking what is not given refraining from telling lies living the holy life on one meal a day virtuous  of fine character what would you do to him We would bow down to him lord or rise up to greet him or offer him a seat or offer him robes almsfood lodgings or medicinal requisites for curing illness or we would arrange a lawful guard protection  defenseBut how could there be such virtue  restraint in an unvirtuous evil character Now at that time Ven Angulimala was sitting not far from the Blessed OneSo the Blessed One pointing with his right arm said to King Pasenadi Kosala That great king is AngulimalaThen King Pasenadi Kosala was frightened terrified his hair standing on endSo the Blessed One sensing the kings fear  hairraising awe said to him Dont be afraid great king Dont be afraid He poses no danger to youThen the kings fear his terror his hairstandingonend subsidedHe went over to Ven Angulimala and said Are you really Angulimala lord Yes great kingWhat is your fathers clan What is your mothers clanMy father is a Gagga great king and my mother a MantaniThen may Master Gagga Mantaniputta delight in staying hereI will be responsible for your robes almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisites for curing illnessNow it so happened that at that time Ven Angulimala was a wildernessdweller an almsgoer wearing one set of the triple robe made of castoff clothSo he said to King Pasenadi Kosala Enough great king My triple robe is completeSo King Pasenadi Kosala went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Its amazing lord Its astoundinghow the Blessed One has tamed the untamed pacified the unpeaceful and brought to Unbinding those who were not unboundFor what we could not tame even with blunt or bladed weapons the Blessed One has tamed without blunt or bladed weaponsNow lord we must go Many are our duties many our responsibilitiesThen do great king what you think it is now time to doThen King Pasenadi Kosala got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and keeping him to his right departedThen Ven Angulimala early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe  bowl went into Savatthi for almsAs he was going from house to house for alms he saw a woman suffering a breech birthOn seeing her the thought occurred to him How tormented are living beings How tormented are living beingsThen having wandered for alms in Savatthi and returning from his alms round after his meal he went to the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now lord early in the morning having put on my robes and carrying my outer robe  bowl I went into Savatthi for almsAs I was going from house to house for alms I saw a woman suffering a breech birthOn seeing her the thought occurred to me How tormented are living beings How tormented are living beingsIn that case Angulimala go to that woman and on arrival say to her Sister since I was born I do not recall intentionally killing a living being Through this truth may there be wellbeing for you wellbeing for your fetusBut lord wouldnt that be a lie for meFor I have intentionally killed many living beingsThen in that case Angulimala go to that woman and on arrival say to her Sister since I was born in the noble birth I do not recall intentionally killing a living being Through this truth may there be wellbeing for you wellbeing for your fetusResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One Angulimala went to that woman and on arrival said to her Sister since I was born in the noble birth I do not recall intentionally killing a living being Through this may there be wellbeing for you wellbeing for your fetusAnd there was wellbeing for the woman wellbeing for her fetusThen Ven Angulimala dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for the sake of this worldAnd thus Ven Angulimala became another one of the arahantsThen Ven Angulimala early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe  bowl went into Savatthi for almsNow at that time a clod thrown by one person hit Ven Angulimala on the body a stone thrown by another person hit him on the body and a potsherd thrown by still another person hit him on the bodySo Ven Angulimala  his head broken open and dripping with blood his bowl broken and his outer robe ripped to shreds  went to the Blessed OneThe Blessed One saw him coming from afarand on seeing him said to him Bear with it brahman Bear with itThe fruit of the kamma that would have burned you in hell for many years many hundreds of years many thousands of years you are now experiencing in the herenowThen Ven Angulimala having gone alone into seclusion experienced the bliss of release At that time he exclaimedWho once was heedless but later is notbrightens the world like the moon set free from a cloudHis evildone deed is replaced with skillfulnesshe brightens the world like the moon set free from a cloudWhatever young monk devotes himself to the Buddhas biddinghe brightens the world like the moon set free from a cloudMay even my enemies hear talk of the DhammaMay even my enemies devote themselves to the Buddhas biddingMay even my enemies associate with those peoplewho  peaceful good  get others to accept the DhammaMay even my enemies from those who advise endurance who praise nonoppositionhear the Dhamma time  again forbearance and may they follow itFor surely he wouldnt harm me or anyone elsehe would attain the foremost peace would protect the feeble  firmIrrigators guide the water Fletchers shape the arrow shaftCarpenters shape the wood The wise control themselvesSome tame with a blunt stick with hooks  with whipsBut without blunt or bladed weapons I was tamed by the one who is SuchDoer of No Harm is my name but I used to be a doer of harmToday I am true to my name for I harm no one at allA bandit I used to be renowned as AngulimalaSwept along by a great flood I went to the Buddha as refugeBloodyhanded I used to be renowned as AngulimalaSee my going for refuge Uprooted is craving the guide to becomingHaving done the type of kamma that would lead to many bad destinationstouched by the fruit of that kamma unindebted I eat my foodTheyre addicted to heedlessness  dullards fools while one who is wise cherishes heedfulness as his highest wealthDont give way to heedlessness or to intimacy with sensual delight for a heedful person absorbed in jhana attains an abundant blissThis has come well  not gone away it was not badly thought through for meFrom among wellanalyzed qualities I have obtained the bestThis has come well  not gone away it was not badly thought through for meThe three knowledges have been attained the Buddhas bidding doneTHUS HAVE I

were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthl in the Eastern Park in the Palace of Migaras Mother together with many

instructed by the elder bhikkhus had achieved successive stages of high distinctionOn that occasion  the Uposatha day of the fifteenth on the fullmoon night of the Pavarana ceremony  the Blessed One was seated in the open surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhusThen surveying the silent Sangha of bhikkhus he addressed them thus  Bhikkhus I am content with this progress My mind is content with this progressSo arouse still more energy to attain the unattained to achieve the unachieved to realise the unrealisedI shall wait here at Savatthl for the Komudi full moon of the fourth monthThe bhikkhus of the countryside heard The Blessed One will wait there at Savatthi for the Komudi full moon of the fourth monthAnd the bhikkhus of the countryside left in due course for SavatthI to see the Blessed

shall breathe out tranquillising the bodily formation  on that occasion a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the

eye disenchanted with forms disenchanted with consciousness at the eye disenchanted with contact at the eye disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with cravingHe grows disenchanted with the earThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted at his wordsAnd while this explanation was being given the hearts of  monks through no clinging were fully released from fermentationeffluentsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryAnd on that occasion Anathapindika the householder was diseased in pain severely illThen Anathapindika the householder said to one of his men Come my good man Go to the Blessed One and on arrival pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say Lord Anathapindika the householder is diseased in pain severely illHe pays homage with his head to the Blessed Ones feetThen go to Ven Sariputta and on arrival pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say Venerable sir Anathapindika the householder is diseased in pain severely illHe pays homage with his head to your feetThen say It would be good if Ven Sariputta would visit Anathapindikas home out of sympathy for himResponding As you say lord to Anathapindika the householder the man went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said Lord Anathapindika the householder is diseased in pain severely illHe pays homage with his head to the Blessed Ones feetThen he went to Ven Sariputta and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said Venerable sir Anathapindika the householder is diseased in pain severely illHe pays homage with his head to Ven Sariputtas feet Then he said It would be good if Ven Sariputta would visit Anathapindikas home out of sympathy for himVen Sariputta acquiesced through silenceThen Ven Sariputta having put on his robes and taking his bowl  outer robe went to the home of Anathapindika the householder with Ven Ananda as his attendant On arrival he sat down on a prepared seatand said to Anathapindika the householder I trust you are getting better householder I trust you are comfortableI trust that your pains are lessening and not increasing I trust that there are signs of their lessening and not of their increasingAnathapindika I am not getting better venerable sir I am not comfortableMy severe pains are increasing not lessening There are signs of their increasing and not of their lesseningExtreme forces slice through my head just as if a strong man were slicing my head open with a sharp swordExtreme pains have arisen in my head just as if a strong man were tightening a turban on my head with a tough leather strapExtreme forces carve up my stomach cavity just as if an expert butcher or his apprentice were to carve up the stomach cavity of an ox with a sharp butchers knifeThere is an extreme burning in my body just as if two strong men seizing a weaker man with their arms were to roast and broil him over a pit of hot embersI am not getting better venerable sir I am not comfortableMy severe pains are increasing not lessening There are signs of their increasing and not of their lesseningVen Sariputta Then householder you should train yourself in this way I wont cling to the eye my consciousness will not be dependent on the eyeThats how you should

said Anathapindika the householder wept and shed tearsVen Ananda said to him Are you sinking householder Are you foundering No venerable sir Im not sinking nor am I foundering Its just that for a long time I have attended to the Teacher and to the monks who inspire my heart but never before have I heard a talk on the Dhamma like thisThis sort of talk on the Dhamma householder is not given to lay people clad in white This sort of talk on the Dhamma is given to those gone forthIn that case Ven Sariputta please let this sort of talk on the Dhamma be given to lay people clad in whiteThere are clansmen with little dust in their eyes who are wasting away through not hearing this Dhamma There will be those who will understand itThen Ven Sariputta and Ven Ananda having given this instruction to Anathapindika the householder got up from their seats and leftThen not long after they left Anathapindika the householder died and reappeared in the Tusita heavenThen Anathapindika the devas son in the far extreme of the night his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jetas Grove went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to him and stood to one sideAs he was standing there he

down to the Blessed One sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Its amazing lord its astoundinghow deep this dependent coarising is and how deep its appearance and yet to me it seems as clear as clear can beThe Buddha Dont say that Ananda Dont say thatDeep is this dependent coarising and deep its appearanceIts because of not understanding and not penetrating this Dhamma that this generation is like a tangled skein a knotted ball of string like matted rushes and reeds and does not go beyond transmigration beyond the planes of deprivation woe and bad destinationsIf one

self formless and finite one delineates that My self is formless and finiteOr delineating a self formless and infinite one delineates that My self is formless and infiniteNow the one who when delineating a self delineates it as possessed of form and finiteeither delineates it as possessed of form and finite in the present or of such a nature that it will naturally become possessed of form and finite in the futureafter death or he believes that Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that wayThis being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self

one does not delineate that My self is possessed of form and infiniteOr not delineating a self formless and finite one does not delineate that My self is formless and finiteOr not delineating a self

is oblivious to feelingor Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious to feeling but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feelingNow one who says Feeling is my self should be addressed as follows There are these three feelings my friend  feelings of pleasure feelings of pain and feelings of neither pleasure nor painWhich of these three feelings do you assume to be the selfAt a moment when a feeling of pleasure is sensed no feeling of pain or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed Only a feeling of pleasure is sensed at that momentAt a moment when a feeling of pain is sensed no feeling of pleasure or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed Only a feeling of pain is sensed at that momentAt a moment when a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed no feeling of pleasure or of pain is sensed Only a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed at that momentNow a feeling of pleasure is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessationA feeling of pain is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessationA feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessationHaving sensed a feeling of pleasure as my selfthen with the cessation of ones very own feeling of pleasure my self has perishedHaving sensed a feeling of pain as my selfthen with the cessation of ones very own feeling of pain my self has perishedHaving sensed a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain as my selfthen with the cessation of ones very own feeling of neither pleasure nor pain my self has perishedThus he assumes assuming in the immediate present a self inconstant entangled in pleasure and pain subject to arising and passing away he who says Feeling is my selfThus in this manner Ananda one does not see fit to assume feeling to be the selfAs for the person who says Feeling is not the self My self is oblivious to feeling he should be addressed as follows My friend where nothing whatsoever is sensed at all would there be the thought I am No lordThus in this manner Ananda one does not see fit to assume that Feeling is not my self My self is oblivious to feelingAs for the person who says Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious to feeling but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feelinghe should be addressed as follows My friend should feelings altogether and every way stop without remainderthen with feeling completely not existing owing to the cessation of feeling would there be the thought I amNo lordThus in this manner Ananda one does not see fit to assume that Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious to feeling but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feelingNow Ananda in as far as a monk does not assume feeling to be the self nor the self as oblivious nor that My self feels in that my self is subject to feelingthen not assuming in this way he is not sustained by anything in the world Unsustained he is not agitated Unagitated he is totally unbound right within He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for this worldIf anyone were to say with regard to a monk whose mind is thus released that The Tathagata exists after death is his view that would be mistakenthat The Tathagata does not exist after deaththat The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after deaththat The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death is his view that would be mistakenWhyHaving directly known the extent of designation and the extent of the objects of designation the extent of expression and the extent of the objects of expression the extent of description and the extent of the objects of description the extent of discernment and the extent of the objects of discernment the extent to which the cycle revolves Having directly known that the monk is released To say that The monk released having directly known that does not see does not know is his opinion that would be mistakenAnanda there are these seven stations of consciousness and two spheresWhich sevenThere are beings with diversity of body and diversity of perception such as human beings some devas and some beings in the lower realmsThis is the first station of consciousnessThere are beings with diversity of body and singularity of perception such as the devas of the Brahma hosts generated by the first jhana and some beings in the four realms of deprivationThis is the second station of consciousnessThere are beings with singularity of body and diversity of perception such as the Radiant DevasThis is the third station of consciousnessThere are beings with singularity of body and singularity of perception such as the Beautifully Lustrous DevasThis is the fourth station of consciousnessThere are beings whowith the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving Infinite space arrive at the dimension of the infinitude of spaceThis is the fifth station of consciousnessThere are beings who with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space perceiving Infinite consciousness arrive at the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessThis is the sixth station of consciousnessThere are beings who with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness perceiving There is nothing arrive at the dimension of nothingnessThis is the seventh station of consciousnessThe dimension of nonpercipient beings and second the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception These are the two spheresNow as for the first station of consciousness  beings with diversity of body and diversity of perception such as human beings some devas and some beings in the lower realmsIf one discerns that station of consciousness discerns its origination discerns its passing away discerns its allure discerns its drawbacks discerns the escape from it would it be proper by means of that discernment to take delight there No lordAnanda when knowing  as they actually are  the origination passing away allure drawbacks of  and escape from  these seven stations of consciousness and two spheres a monk is released through lack of clinging he is said to be a monk released through discernmentAnanda there are these eight emancipationsWhich eightPossessed of form one sees forms This is the first emancipationNot percipient of form internally one sees forms externally This is the second emancipationOne is intent only on the beautiful This is the third emancipationWith the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving Infinite space one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space This is the fourth emancipationWith the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space perceiving Infinite consciousness one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness This is the fifth emancipationWith the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness perceiving There is nothing one enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness This is the sixth emancipationWith the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness one enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception This is the seventh emancipationWith the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception one enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling This is the eighth emancipationNow when a monk attains these eight emancipations in forward order in reverse order in forward and reverse order when he attains them and emerges from them wherever he wants however he wants and for as long as he wantswhen through the ending of the mental fermentations he enters and remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease and discernmentrelease having directly known it and realized it in the here and now he is said to be a monk released in both waysAnd as for another release in both ways higher or more sublime than this there is noneThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified Ven Ananda delighted in the Blessed Ones words It is monks for elementary inferior matters of moral practice that the worldling would praise the TathagataAnd what are these elementary inferior matters for which the worldling would praise him  Abandoning the taking of life the ascetic Gotama dwells refraining from taking life without stick or sword scrupulous compassionate trembling

maresfields and plotshe refrains from running errandsfrom buying and sellingfrom cheating with false weights and measuresfrom bribery and corruption deception and insincerityfrom wounding killing imprisoning highway robbery and taking food by force Thus the worldling would praise the TathagataIt is bhikkhus only to trifling and insignificant matters to the minor details of mere moral virtue that a worldling would refer when speaking in praise of the TathāgataAnd what are those trifling and insignificant matters those minor details of mere moral virtue to which he would referHaving abandoned the destruction of life the recluse Gotama abstains from the destruction of life He has laid aside the rod and the sword and dwells conscientious full of kindness compassionate for the welfare of all living beings  It is in this way bhikkhus that the worldling would speak when speaking in praise of the TathāgataOr he might say Having abandoned taking what is not given the recluse Gotama abstains from taking what is not given Accepting and expecting only what is given he dwells in honesty and rectitude of heart Or he might say Having abandoned unchaste living the recluse Gotama

monks other matters profound hard to see hard to understand peaceful excellent beyond mere thought subtle to be experienced by the wise which the Tathagata having realised them by his own superknowledge proclaims and about which those who would truthfully praise the Tathagata would rightly speakAnd what are these mattersThere are monks some ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the past having fixed views about the past and who put forward various speculative theories about the past in eighteen different waysOn what basis on what grounds do they do soThere are bhikkhus other dhammas deep difficult to see difficult to understand peaceful and sublime beyond the sphere of reasoning subtle comprehensible only to the wise which the Tathāgata having realized for himself with direct knowledge propounds to others and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speakAnd what are these dhammasThere are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the past who hold settled views about the past and who on eighteen grounds assert various conceptual theorems referring to the pastAnd owing to what with reference to what do these honourable recluses and brahmins frame their speculationsThere are some ascetics and Brahmins who are Eternalists who proclaim the eternity of the self and the world in four waysOn what groundsWrong view  Here monks a certain ascetic or Brahmin has by means of effort exertion application earnestness and right attention attained to such a state of mental concentration that he thereby recalls past existences one birth two births three four five ten births a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand births several hundred several thousand several hundred thousand births There my name was soandso my clan was soandso my caste was soandso my food was suchandsuch I experienced suchandsuch pleasant and painful conditions I lived for so long Having passed away from there I arose there There my name was so andso   And having passed away from there I arose hereThus he remembers various past lives their conditions and detailsAnd he says The self and the world are eternal barren like a mountainpeak set firmly as a post These beings rush round circulate pass away and rearise but this remains eternallyWhy soI have by means of effort exertion attained to such a state of mental concentration that I have thereby recalled various past existencesThat is how I know the self and the world are eternalThat is the first way in which some ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the eternity of the self and the worldWrong view  And what is the second wayHere monks a certain ascetic or Brahmin has by means of effort exertion attained to such a state of mental concentration that he thereby recalls one period of contraction and expansiontwo such periods three four five ten periods of contraction and expansion There my name was soandsoThat is the second way in which some ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the eternity of the self and the worldWrong view  And what is the third wayHere monks a certain ascetic or Brahmin has by means of effort attained to such a state of mental concentrationthat he recalls ten twenty thirty forty periods of contraction and expansion There my name was soandsoThat is the third way in which some ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the eternity of the self and the worldWrong view  And what is the fourth wayHere a certain ascetic or Brahmin is a logician a reasoner Hammering it out by reason following his own line of thought he argues The self and the world are eternal barren like a mountainpeak set firmly as a post These beings rush round circulate pass away and rearise but this remains for everThat is the fourth way in which some ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the eternity of the self and the worldThese are the four ways in which these ascetics and Brahmins are Eternalists and proclaim the eternity of the self and the world on four groundsAnd whatever ascetics or Brahmins are Eternalists and proclaim the eternity of the self and the world they do so on one or other of these four grounds There is no other wayThis monks the Tathagata understands These viewpoints thus grasped and adhered to will lead to suchandsuch destinations in another world This the Tathagata knows and more but he is not attached to that knowledge And being thus unattached he has experienced for himself perfect peaceand having truly understood the arising and passing away of feelings their attraction and peril and the deliverance from them the Tathagata is liberated without remainderThere are monks other matters profound hard to see hard to understand peaceful excellent beyond mere thought subtle to be experienced by the wise which the Tathagata having realised them by his own superknowledge proclaims and about which those who would truthfully praise the Tathagata would rightly speak And what are these mattersEnd of first recitationsectionThere are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are eternalists and who on four grounds proclaim the self and the world to be eternalAnd owing to what with reference to what do these honourable recluses and brahmins proclaim their viewsIn the first case bhikkhus some recluse or a brahmin by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated purified clarified unblemished devoid of corruptions he recollects his numerous past livesthat is one birth two three four or five births ten twenty thirty forty or fifty births a hundred a thousand or a hundred thousand births many hundreds of births many thousands of births many hundreds of thousands of births Then I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my span of life Passing away thence I rearose there There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my span of life Passing away thence I rearose here Thus he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their detailsHe speaks thus The self and the world are eternal barren steadfast as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar And though these beings roam and wander  pass away and rearise yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itselfWhat is the reasonBecause I by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection attain to such a degree of mental concentration that with my mind thus concentrated I recollect my numerous past lives in their modes and their detailsFor this reason I know this the self and the world are eternal barren steadfast as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar And though these beings roam and wander  pass away and rearise yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itselfThis bhikkhus is the first caseIn the second case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins eternalists who proclaim the self and the world to be eternalHerein bhikkhus a certain recluse or brahmin by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his numerous past livesthat is one aeon of worldcontraction and expansion throughout two three four five or ten aeons of worldcontraction and expansion Then I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my span of life Passing away thence I rearose there There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my span of life Passing away thence I rearose here Thus he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their detailsHe speaks thus The self and the world are eternal barren steadfast as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar And though these beings roam and wander  pass away and rearise yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itselfWhat is the reasonThis bhikkhus is the second reasonIn the third case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins eternalists who proclaim the self and the world to be eternalHerein bhikkhus some recluse or brahmin by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his numerous past lives that is ten aeons of worldcontraction and expansion throughout twenty thirty or forty aeons of worldcontraction and expansion Thus he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their detailsHe speaks thus The self and the world are eternal barren

reasonThis bhikkhus is the third caseIn the fourth case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins eternalists who proclaim the self and the world to be eternalHerein bhikkhus some recluse or brahmin is a rationalist an investigator He declares his viewhammered out by reason deduced from his investigations following his own flight of thoughtthus The self and the world are eternal barren steadfast as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar And though these beings roam and wander  pass away and rearise yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself This bhikkhus is the fourth caseIt is on these four grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are eternalists proclaim the self and the world to be eternalWhatever recluses and brahmins there may be who proclaim the self and the world to be eternal all of them do so on these four grounds or on a certain one of them Outside of these there is noneThis bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands And he understands These standpoints thus assumed and thus misapprehended lead to such a future destination to such a state in the world beyond  He understands as well what transcends this yet even that understanding he does not misapprehend And because he is free from misapprehension he has realized within himself the state of perfect peaceHaving understood as they really are the origin and the passing away of feelings their satisfaction their unsatisfactoriness and the escape from them the Tathāgata bhikkhus is emancipated through nonclingingThese are those dhammas bhikkhus that are deep difficult to see difficult to understand peaceful and sublime beyond the sphere of reasoning subtle comprehensible only to the wise which the Tathāgata having realized for himself with direct knowledge propounds to others and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speak There are monks some ascetics and Brahmins who are partly Eternalists and partly NonEternalists who proclaim the partial eternity and the partial noneternity of the self and the world in four waysOn what grounds There comes a time monks sooner or later after a long period when this world contractsAt a time of contraction beings are mostly reborn in the Abhassara Brahma worldAnd there they dwell mindmade feeding on delight self luminous moving through the air glorious  and they stay like that for a very long time Wrong view  But the time comes sooner or later after a long period when this world begins to expandIn this expanding world an empty palace of Brahma appearsAnd then one being from exhaustion of his lifespan or of his merits falls from the Abhassara world and arises in the empty BrahmapalaceAnd there he dwells mindmade feeding on delight selfluminous moving through the air glorious  and he stays like that for a very long time Then in this being who has been alone for so long there arises unrest discontent and worry and he thinks Oh if only some other beings would come hereAnd other beings from exhaustion of their lifespan or of their merits fall from the Abhassara world and arise in the Brahma palace as companions for this beingAnd there they dwell mindmade and they stay like that for a very long time And then monks that being who first arose there thinks I am Brahma the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing the AllPowerful the Lord the Maker and Creator Ruler Appointer and Orderer Father of All That Have Been and Shall BeThese beings were created by meHow soBecause I first had this thought Oh if only some other beings would come hereThat was my wish and then these beings came into this existenceBut those beings who arose subsequently think This friends is Brahma Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing the AllPowerful the Lord the Maker and Creator Ruler Appointer and Orderer Father of All That Have Been and Shall BeHow soWe have seen that he was here first and that we arose after him And this being that arose first is longerlived more beautiful and more powerful than they areAnd it may happen that some being falls from that realm and arises in this worldHaving arisen in this world he goes forth from the household life into homelessnessHaving gone forth he by means of effort exertion application earnestness and right attention attains to such a degree of mental concentration that he thereby recalls his last existence but recalls none before thatAnd he thinks That Brahma he made us and he is permanent stable eternal not subject to change the same for ever and everBut we who were created by that Brahma we are impermanent unstable shortlived fated to fall away and we have come to this worldThis is the first case where by some ascetics and Brahmins are partly Eternalists and partly NonEternalists Wrong view  And what is the second wayThere are monks certain devas called Corrupted by PleasureThey spend an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment play and enjoyment so that their mindfulness is dissipatedand by the dissipation of mindfulness those beings fall from that state And it can happen that a being having fallen from that state arises in this worldHaving arisen in this world he goes forth from the household life into homelessnessHaving gone forth he by means of effort exertion   recalls his last existence but recalls none before that He thinks Those reverend devas who are not corrupted by pleasure do not spend an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment play and enjoymentThus their mindfulness is not dissipatedand so they do not fall from that state They are permanent stable eternal not subject to change the same for ever and everBut we who are corrupted by pleasure spent an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment play and enjoymentThus we by the dissipation of mindfulnesshave fallen from that state we are impermanent unstable shortlived fated to fall away and we have come to this worldThis is the second caseWrong view  And what is the third wayThere are monks certain devas called Corrupted in Mind They spend an excessive amount of time regarding each other with envyBy this means their minds are corruptedOn account of their corrupted minds they become weary in body and mindAnd they fall from that placeAnd it can happen that a being having fallen from that state arises in this worldHerecalls his last existence but recalls none before thatHe thinks Those reverend devas who are not corrupted in mind do not spend an excessive amount of time regarding each other with envyThey do not become corrupted in mindor weary in body and mindand so they do not fall from that state They are permanent stable eternalBut we who are corrupted in mindare impermanent unstable shortlived fated to fall away and we have come to this worldThis is the third caseWrong view  And what is the fourth wayHere a certain ascetic or Brahmin is a logician a reasonerHammering it out by reason following his own line of thought he argues Whatever is called eye or ear or nose or tongue or body that is impermanent unstable noneternal liable to changeBut what is called thought or mind or consciousness that is a self that is permanent stable eternal not subject to change the same for ever and everThis is the fourth caseThese are the four ways in which these ascetics and Brahmins are partly Eternalists and partly NonEternalistsWhatever ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the partial eternity and the partial noneternity of the self and the world they do so on one or other of these four grounds There is no other wayThis monks the Tathagata understands These viewpoints thus grasped and adhered to will lead to such andsuch destinations in another worldThis the Tathagata knows and more but he is not attached to that knowledgeAnd being thus unattached he has experienced for himself perfect peace and having truly understood the arising and passing away of feelings their attraction and peril and the deliverance from them the Tathagata is liberated without remainderThese monks are those other matters profound hard to see hard to understand peaceful excellent beyond mere thought subtle to be experienced by the wise which the Tathagata having realised them by his own superknowledge proclaims and about which those who would truthfully praise the Tathagata would rightly speakThere are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are eternalists in regard to some things and noneternalists in regard to other things and who on four grounds proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternalAnd owing to what with reference to what do these honourable recluses and brahmins proclaim their viewsThere comes a time bhikkhus when after the lapse of a long period this world contracts While the world is contracting beings for the most part are reborn in the bhassara BrahmaworldThere they dwell mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the air abiding in glory And they continue thus for a long long period of timeBut sooner or later bhikkhus after the lapse of a long period there comes a time when this world begins to expand once againWhile the world is expanding an empty palace of Brahmā appearsThen a certain being due to the exhaustion of his lifespan or the exhaustion of his merit passes away from the bhassara plane and rearises in the empty palace of BrahmāThere he dwells mind made feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the air abiding in glory And he continues thus for a long long period of timeThen as a result of dwelling there all alone for so long a time there arises in him dissatisfaction and agitation  Oh that other beings might come to this placeJust at that moment due to the exhaustion of their lifespan or the exhaustion of their merit certain other beings pass away from the bhassara plane and rearise in the palace of Brahmā in companionship with himThere they dwell mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the air abiding in glory And they continue thus for a long long period of timeThereupon the being who rearose there first thinks to himself I am Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Vanquisher the Unvanquished the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord the Maker and Creator the Supreme Being the Ordainer the Almighty the Father of all that are and are to beAnd these beings have been created by meWhat is the reasonBecause first I made the wish Oh that other beings might come to this placeAnd after I made this resolution now these beings have comeAnd the beings who rearose there after him also think This must be Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Vanquisher the Unvanquished the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord the Maker and Creator the Supreme Being the Ordainer the Almighty the Father of all that are and are to beAnd we have been created by himWhat is the reasonBecause we see that he was here first and we appeared here after him Herein bhikkhus the being who rearose there first possesses longer life greater beauty and greater authority than the beings who rearose there after himNow bhikkhus this comes to pass that a certain being after passing away from that plane takes rebirth in this worldHaving come to this world he goes forth from home to homelessnessWhen he has gone forth by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection he attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life but none previous to thatHe speaks thus We were created by him by Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Vanquisher the Unvanquished the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord the Maker and Creator the Supreme Being the Ordainer the Almighty the Father of all that are and are to be He is permanent stable eternal not subject to change and he will remain the same just like eternity itselfBut we who have been created by him and have come to this world are impermanent unstable shortlived doomed to perish This bhikkhus is the first caseIn the second case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins eternalists in regard to some things and noneternalists in regard to other things proclaiming the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternalThere are bhikkhus certain gods called corrupted by play These gods spend an excessive time indulging in the delights of laughter and play As a consequence they become forgetful andwhen they become forgetful they pass away from that planeNow bhikkhus this comes to pass that a certain being after passing away from that plane takes rebirth in this worldHaving come to this world he goes forth from home to homelessnessWhen he has gone forth by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection he attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life but none previous to thatHe speaks thus Those honourable gods who are not corrupted by play do not spend an excessive time indulging in the delights of laughter and playAs a consequence they do not become forgetfuland because they do not become forgetful they do not pass away from that plane Those gods are permanent stable eternal not subject to change and they will remain the same just like eternity itselfBut we were gods corrupted by play We spent an excessive time indulging in the delights of laughter and playand as a consequence we became forgetfulWhen we became forgetful we passed away from that plane Coming to this world now we are impermanent unstable short lived doomed to perish This bhikkhus is the second caseIn the third case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins eternalists in regard to some things and noneternalists in regard to other things proclaiming the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternalThere are bhikkhus certain gods called corrupted by mind  These gods contemplate one another with excessive envyAs a consequence their minds becomes corrupted by anger towards one anotherWhen their minds are corrupted by anger their bodies and minds become exhaustedand consequently they pass away from that planeNow bhikkhus this comes to pass that a certain being after passing away from that plane takes rebirth in this worldHaving come to this world he goes forth from home to homelessnessWhen he has gone forth by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection he attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life but none previous to thatHe speaks thus Those honourable gods who are not corrupted by mind do not contemplate each other with excessive envyAs a result their minds do not become corrupted by anger towards one anothertheir bodies and minds do not become exhaustedand they do not pass away from that plane Those gods are permanent stable not subject to change and they will remain the same just like eternity itselfBut we were gods corrupted by mind We contemplated each other with excessive envyand as a result our minds became corrupted by anger towards one another When our minds were corrupted by anger our bodies and minds became exhausted and consequently we passed away from that planeComing to this world now we are impermanent unstable shortlived doomed to perish This bhikkhus is the third caseIn the fourth case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins eternalists in regard to some things and noneternalists in regard to other things proclaiming the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternalHerein bhikkhus recluse or a certain brahmin is a rationalist an investigatorHe declares his viewhammered out by reason deduced from his investigations following his own flight of thoughtthus That which is called the eye the ear the nose the tongue and the bodythat self is impermanent unstable noneternal subject to changeBut that which is called mind or mentality or consciousness that self is permanent stable eternal not subject to change and it will remain the same just like eternity itself This bhikkhus is the fourth caseIt is on these four grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are partialeternalists proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternalWhatever recluses and brahmins there may be who proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternal all of them do so on these four grounds or on a certain one of them Outside of these there is noneThis bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands And he understands These standpoints thus assumed and thus misapprehended lead to such a future destination to such a state in the world beyond He understands as well what transcends this yet even that understanding he does not misapprehendAnd because he is free from misapprehension he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace Having understood as they really are the origin and the passing away of feelings their satisfaction their unsatisfactoriness and the escape from them the Tathāgata bhikkhus is emancipated through nonclingingThese are those dhammas bhikkhus that are deep difficult to see difficult to understand peaceful and sublime beyond the sphere of reasoning subtle comprehensible only to the wise which the Tathāgata having realized for himself with direct knowledge propounds to others and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speakThere are monks some ascetics and Brahmins who are Finitists and Infinitists and who proclaim the finitude and infinitude of the world on four groundsWhat are theyWrong view  Here a certain ascetic or Brahmin has by means of effort attained to such a state of concentration that he dwells perceiving the world as finiteHe thinks This world is finite and bounded by a circleHow soBecause I have   attained to such a state of concentration that I dwell perceiving the world as finiteTherefore I know that this world is finite and bounded by a circleThis is the first caseWrong view  And what is the second wayHere a certain ascetic or Brahmin has attained to such a state of concentration that he dwells perceiving the world as infiniteHe thinks This world is infinite and unboundedThose ascetics and Brahmins who say it is finite and bounded are wrongHow soBecause I have attained to such a state of concentration that I dwell perceiving the world as infiniteTherefore I know that this world is infinite and unboundedThis is the second caseWrong view  And what is the third wayHere a certain ascetic or Brahmin has attained to such a state of consciousness that he dwells perceiving the world as finite up anddown and infinite acrossHe thinks The world is finite and infiniteThose ascetics and Brahmins who say it is finite are wrongand those who say it is infinite are wrongHow soBecause I have attained to such a state of concentration that I dwell perceiving the world as finite upanddown and infinite acrossTherefore I know that the world is both finite and infiniteThis is the third caseWrong view  And what is the fourth caseHere a certain ascetic or Brahmin is a logician a reasonerHammering it out by reason he argues This world is neither finite nor infiniteThose who say it is finite are wrongand so are those who say it is infiniteand those who say it is finite and infiniteThis world is neither finite nor infiniteThis is the fourth caseThese are the four ways in which these ascetics and Brahmins are

wise which the Tathagata having realised them by his own superknowledge proclaims and about which those who would truthfully praise the Tathagata would rightly speakThere are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are extensionists and who on four grounds proclaim the world to be finite or infiniteAnd owing to what with reference to what do these honourable recluses and brahmins proclaim their viewsIn the first case bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he abides perceiving the world as finiteHe speaks thus The world is finite and boundedWhat is the reasonBecause I attain to such concentration of mind that I abide perceiving the world as finiteFor that reason I know this the world is finite and bounded This bhikkhus is the first caseIn the second case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins extensionists proclaiming the world to be finite or infiniteHerein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he abides perceiving the world as infiniteHe speaks thus The world is infinite and boundlessThose recluses and brahmins who

infiniteFor this reason I know this the world is infinite and boundless This bhikkhus is the second caseIn the third case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins extensionists proclaiming the world to be finite or infiniteHerein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he abides perceiving the world as finite in the upward and downward directions but as infinite acrossHe speaks thus The world is both finite and infiniteThose recluses and brahmins who declare the world to be finite and bounded speak falselyand those recluses and brahmins who declare the world to be infinite and boundless also speak falselyThe world is both finite and infiniteFor what reasonBecause I attain to such concentration of mind that I abide perceiving the world as finite in the upward and downward directions but as infinite acrossFor this reason I know this the world is both finite and infinite This bhikkhus is the third caseIn the fourth case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins extensionists proclaiming the world to be finite or infiniteHerein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin is a rationalist an investigatorHe declares his viewhammered out by reason deduced from his investigations following his own flight of thoughtthus The world is neither finite nor infiniteThose recluses and brahmins who declare the world to be finite and boundedthose who declare it to be infinite and boundlessand those who declare it to be both finite and infiniteall these speak falselyThe world is neither finite nor infiniteThis bhikkhus is the fourth caseIt is on these four grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are extensionists proclaim the world to be finite of infiniteWhatever recluses or brahmins there may be who proclaim the world to be finite or infinite all of them do so on these four grounds or on a certain one of them Outside of these there is noneThis bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands and it is concerning these that those who would praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speakThere are monks some ascetics and Brahmins who are EelWrigglers When asked about this or that matter they resort to evasive statements and they wriggle like eels on four groundsWhat are theyWrong view  In this case there is an ascetic or Brahmin who does not in truth know whether a thing is good or badHe thinks I do not in truth know whether this is good or whether it is badNot knowing which is right I might declare That is good or That is bad and that might be a lieand that would distress meAnd if I were distressed that would be a hindrance to meThus fearing to lie abhorring to lie he does not declare a thing to be good or bad but when asked about this or that matter he resorts to evasive statements and wriggles like an eel I dont say this I dont say that I dont say it is otherwise I dont say it is not I dont not say it is notThis is the first caseWrong view  What is the second wayHere an ascetic or Brahmin does not in truth know whether a thing is good or badHe thinks I might declare That is good or That is bad and I might feel desire or lust or hatred or aversionIf I felt desire lust hatred or aversion that would be attachment on my partIf I felt attachment that would distress meand if I were distressed that would be a hindrance to meThus fearing attachment abhorring attachment he resorts to evasive statementsThis is the second caseWrong view  What is the third wayHere an ascetic or Brahmin does not in truth know whether a thing is good or badHe thinks I might declare That is good or That is badbut there are ascetics and Brahmins who are wise skilful practised debaters like archers who can split hairs who go around destroying others views with their wisdom and they might crossexamine me demanding my reasons and arguingAnd I might not be able to replyNot being able to reply would distress meand if I were distressed that would be a hindrance to meThus fearing debate abhorring debate he resorts to evasive statementsThis is the third caseWrong view  What is the fourth wayHere an ascetic or Brahmin is dull and stupidBecause of his dullness and stupidity when he is questioned he resorts to evasive statements and wriggles like an eel If you ask me whether there is another world  if I thought so I would say there is another world But I dont say so And I dont say otherwise And I dont say it is not and I dont not say it is notIs there no other world  Is there both another world and no other world  Is there neither another world nor no other world   Are there spontaneouslyborn beings   Are there not  Both  Neither  Does the Tathagata exist after death Does he not exist after death Does he both exist and not exist after death Does he neither exist nor not exist after death   If I thought so I would say so   I dont say it is notThis is the fourth caseThese are the four ways in which those ascetics and Brahmins who are EelWrigglers resort to evasive statements There is no other way   This monks the Tathagata understands These viewpoints thus grasped and adhered to will lead to suchandsuch destinations in another world  These monks are those other matters profound hard to see which the Tathagata having realised them by his own superknowledge proclaims and about which those who would truthfully praise the Tathagata would rightly speakThere are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are endless equivocators When questioned about this or that point on four grounds they resort to evasive statements and to endless equivocationAnd owing to what with reference to what do these honourable recluses and brahmins do soHerein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin does not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesomeHe thinks I do not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesomeIf without understanding I were to declare something to be wholesome or unwholesome my declaration might be falseIf my declaration should be false that would distress meand that distress would be an obstacle for me Therefore out of fear and loathing of making a false statement he does not declare anything to be wholesome or unwholesome But when he is questioned about this or that point he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation I do not take it thus nor do I take it in that way nor do I take it in some other way I do not say that it is not nor do I say that it is neither this nor that This bhikkhus is the first caseIn the second case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins endless equivocators resorting to evasive statements and to endless equivocationHerein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin does not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesomeHe thinks I do not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesomeIf without understanding I were to declare something to be wholesome or unwholesome desire and lust or hatred and aversion might arise in meShould desire and lust or hated and aversion arise in me that would be clinging on my partSuch clinging would distress meand that distress would be an obstacle for me Therefore out of fear and loathing of clinging he does not declare anything to be wholesome or unwholesome But when questioned about this or that point he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation I do not take it thus nor do I take it in that way nor do I take it in some other way I do not say that it is not nor do I say that it is neither this nor that This bhikkhus is the second caseIn the third case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins endless equivocators resorting to evasive statements and to endless equivocationHerein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin does not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesomeHe thinks I do not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesomeNow there are recluses and brahmins who are wise clever experienced in controversy who wander about demolishing the views of others with their wisdom If without understanding I were to declare something to be wholesome or unwholesome they might crossexamine me about my views press me for reasons and refute my statementsIf they should do so I might not be able to replyIf I could not reply that would distress meand that distress would be an obstacle for me Therefore out of fear and loathing of being crossexamined he does not declare anything to be wholesome or unwholesome But when questioned about this or that point he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation I do not take it thus nor do I take it in that way nor do I take it in some other way I do not say that it is not nor do I say that it is neither this nor that This bhikkhus is the third caseIn the fourth case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins endless equivocators resorting to evasive statements and to endless equivocationHerein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin is dull and stupidDue to his dullness and stupidity when he is questioned about this or that point he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation If you ask me whether there is a world beyondif I thought there is another world I would declare that there is But I do not take it thus nor do I take it in that way nor do I take it in some other way I do not say that it is not nor do I say that is neither this nor that Similarly when asked any of the following questions he resorts to the same evasive statements and to endless equivocation Is there no world beyond Is it that there both is and is not a world beyond Is it that there neither is nor is not a world beyond Are there beings spontaneously reborn Are there no beings spontaneously reborn Is it that there both are and are not beings spontaneously reborn Is it that there neither are nor are not beings spontaneously reborn Is there fruit and result of good and bad action Is there no fruit and result of good and bad action Is it that there both is and is not fruit and result of good and bad action Is it that there neither is nor is not fruit and result of good and bad action Does the Tathāgata exist after death Does the Tathāgata not exist after death Does the Tathāgata both exist and not exist after death Does the Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death This bhikkhus is the fourth caseIt is on these four grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are endless equivocators resort to evasive statements and to endless equivocation when questioned about this or that pointWhatever recluses or brahmins there may be who resort to evasive statements and to endless equivocation all of them do so on these four grounds or on a certain one of them Outside of these there is none This bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands  and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speakThere are monks some ascetics and Brahmins who are ChanceOriginationists and who proclaim the chance origin of the self and the world on two groundsWhat are theyWrong view  There are monks certain devas called UnconsciousAs soon as a perception arises in them those devas fall from that realmAnd it may happen that a being falls from that realm and arises in this worldHerecalls his last existence but none before thatHe thinks The self and the world have arisen by chanceHow soBefore this I did not exist Now from notbeing I have been brought to beingThis is the first caseWrong view  What is the second caseHere an ascetic or Brahmin is a logician a reasonerHe hammers out his own opinion and declares The self and the world have arisen by chanceThis is the second caseThese are the two ways in which those ascetics and Brahmins who are ChanceOriginists proclaim the chance origin of the self and the worldThere is no other way  This monks the Tathagata understands These monks are those other matters profound hard to see   which the Tathagata having realised them by his own superknowledge proclaims and about which those who would truthfully praise the Tathagata would rightly speakAnd these monks are the eighteen ways in which these ascetics and Brahmins are speculators about the pastThere is no other wayThis monks the Tathagata understandsThere are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are fortuitous originationists and who on two grounds proclaim the self and the world to originate fortuitouslyAnd owing to what with reference to what do these honourable recluses and brahmins proclaim their viewsThere are bhikkhus certain gods called nonpercipient beings When perception arises in them those gods pass away from that planeNow bhikkhus this comes to pass that a certain being after passing away from that plane takes rebirth in this worldHaving come to this world he goes forth from home to homelessnessWhen he has gone forth by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection he attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects the arising of perception but nothing previous to thatHe speaks thus The self and the world originate fortuitouslyWhat is the reasonBecause previously I did not exist but now I am Not having been I sprang into being This bhikkhus is the first caseIn the second case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins fortuitous originationists proclaiming the self and the world to originate fortuitouslyHerein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin is a rationalist an investigatorHe declares his viewhammered out by reason deduced from his investigations following his own flight of thoughtthus The self and the world originate fortuitously This bhikkhus is the second caseIt is on these two grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are fortuitous originationists proclaim the self and the world to originate fortuitouslyWhatever recluses or brahmins there may be who proclaim the self and the world to originate fortuitously all of them do so on these two grounds or on a certain one of them Outside of these there is none This bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands  and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speakIt is on these eighteen grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the past and hold settled views about the past assert various conceptual theorems referring to the pastWhatever recluses or brahmins are speculators about the past hold settled views about the past and assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past all of them do so on these eighteen grounds or on a certain one of them Outside of these there is noneThis bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands And he understands These standpoints thus assumed and thus misapprehended lead to such a future destination to such in the world beyond He understands as well what transcends this yet even that understanding he does not misapprehend And because he is free from misapprehension he has realized within himself the state of perfect peaceHaving understood as they really are the origin and the passing away of feelings their satisfaction their unsatisfactoriness and the escape from them the Tathāgata bhikkhus is emancipated through nonclingingThese are those dhammas bhikkhus that are deep difficult to see difficult to understand peaceful and sublime beyond the sphere of reasoning subtle comprehensible only to the wise which the Tathāgata having realized for himself with direct knowledge propounds to others and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speakThere are monks some ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the future having fixed views about the future and who put forward various speculative theories about the future in fortyfour different waysOn what basis on what grounds do they do soThere are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the future who hold settled views about the future and who on fortyfour grounds assert various conceptual theorems referring to the futureAnd owing to what with reference to what do these honourable recluses and brahmins frame their speculationsThere are monks some ascetics and Brahmins who proclaim a doctrine of Conscious PostMortem Survival and do so in sixteen different waysOn

Brahmins who are Annihilationists who proclaim the annihilation destruction and nonexistence of beings and they do so in seven waysOn what basisWrong view  Here a certain ascetic or Brahmin declares and holds the view Since this self is material composed of the four great elements the product of mother and father at the breakingup of the body it is annihilated and perishes and does not exist after death This is the way in which this self is annihilatedThat is how some proclaim the annihilation destruction and nonexistence of beingsWrong view  Another says to him Sir there is such a self as you say I dont deny it But that self is not wholly annihilatedFor there is another self divine material belonging to the sensesphere fed on real foodYou dont know it or see itbut I doIt is this self that at the breakingup of the body perishes Wrong view  Another says to him Sir there is such a self as you say I dont deny it But that self is not wholly annihilatedFor there is another self divine material mind made complete with all its parts not defective in any sense organ It is this self that at the breakingup of the body perishesWrong view  Another says to him Sir there is such a self as you sayThere is another self which by passing entirely beyond bodily sensations by the disappearance of all sense of resistance and by nonattraction to the perception of diversity seeing that space is infinite has realised the Sphere of Infinite SpaceIt is this self that at the breaking up of the body perishesWrong view  Another says to him There is another self which by passing entirely beyond the Sphere of Infinite Space seeing that consciousness is infinite has realised the Sphere of Infinite ConsciousnessIt is this self that at the breakingup of the body perishesWrong view  Another says to him There is another self which by passing entirely beyond the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness seeing that there is no thing has realised the Sphere of NoThingnessIt is this self that at the breakingup of the body perishesWrong view  Another says to him Sir there is such a self as you say I dont deny it But that self is not wholly annihilatedFor there is another self which by passing entirely beyond the Sphere of NoThingness and seeing This is peaceful this is sublime has realised the Sphere of Neither PerceptionNorNonPerceptionYou dont know it or see itbut I doIt is this self that at the breakingup of the body is annihilated and perishes and does not exist after death This is the way in which the self is completely annihilatedThat is how some proclaim the annihilation destruction and nonexistence of beingsThese are the seven ways in which these ascetics and Brahmins proclaim a doctrine of annihilation destruction and nonexistence of beingsThere is no other way  This monks the Tathagata understands   These monks are those other matters profound hard to see which the Tathagata having realised them by his own superknowledge proclaims and about which those who would truthfully praise the Tathagata would rightly speakThere are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are annihilationists and who on seven grounds proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent beingAnd owing to what with reference to what do these honourable recluses and brahmins proclaim their viewsHerein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin asserts the following doctrine and view The self good sir has material form it is composed of the four primary elements and originates from father and mother Since this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death at this point the self is completely annihilated In this way some proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilatedFor there is good sir another selfdivine having material form pertaining to the sense sphere feeding on edible nutrimentThat you neither know nor seebut I know it and see itSince this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death at this point the self is completely annihilated In this way others proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilatedFor there is good sir another selfdivine having material form mindmade complete in all its limbs and organs not destitute of any facultiesThat you neither know nor seebut I know it and see itSince this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death at this point the self is completely annihilated In this way others proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilatedFor there is good sir another self belonging to the base of infinite space the complete surmounting of perceptions of material form by the disappearance of perceptions of resistance by nonattention to perceptions of diversity Space is infinite That you neither know nor seebut I know it and see itSince this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death at this point the self is completely annihilated In this way others proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilatedFor there is good sir another self belonging to the base of infinite consciousness completely surmounting the base of infinite space  Consciousness is infiniteThat you neither know nor seeBut I know it and see itSince this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after deathat this point the self is completely annihilatedIn this way some proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilatedFor there is good sir another self belonging to the base of nothingness completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness  There is nothing That you neither know nor seeBut I know it and see itSince this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after deathat this point the self is completely annihilated In this way some proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilatedFor there is good sir another self belonging to the base of neither perception nor nonperception completely surmounting the base of nothingness  This is the peaceful this is the sublime That you neither know nor seeBut I know it and see itSince this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after deathat this point the self is completely annihilated In this way some proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent beingIt is on these seven grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are annihilationists proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent beingWhatever recluses or brahmins proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being all of them do so on these seven grounds or on a certain one of them Outside of these there is none This bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands  and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speakThere are monks some ascetics and Brahmins who are proclaimers of Nibbana Here and Now and who proclaim Nibbana here and now for an existent being in five waysOn what groundsWrong view  Here a certain ascetic or Brahmin declares and holds the view In as far as this self being furnished and endowed with the fivefold sensepleasures indulges in them then that is when the self realises the highest Nibbana here and nowSo some proclaim itWrong view  Another says to him Sir there is such a self as you say I dont deny it But that is not where the self realises the highest Nibbana here and nowWhy soBecause sir sensedesires are impermanent painful and subject to change and from their change and transformation there arise sorrow lamentation pain grief and distressBut when this self detached from sensedesires detached from unwholesome states enters and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by thinking and pondering and the delight and happiness born of detachment that is when the self realises the highest Nibbana here and nowWrong view  Another says to him Sir there is such a self as you say But that is not when the self attains NibbanaHow soBecause on account of thinking and pondering that state is considered grossBut when the self by the subsiding of thinking and pondering enters and abides in the second jhana with inner tranquillity and oneness of mind which is free from thinking and pondering and is bom of concentration and accompanied by delight and joy that is when the self realises the highest Nibbana here and nowWrong view  Another says to him Sir there is such a self as you say But that is not when the self attains NibbanaHow soBecause on account of the presence of delight there is mental exhilaration and that state is considered grossBut when the self with the waning of delight dwells in equanimity mindful and clearly aware experiencing in his own body that joy of which the Noble Ones say Happy dwells one who has equanimity and mindfulness and so enters and abides in the third jhana that is when the self realises the highest Nibbana here and nowWrong view  Another says to him Sir there is such a self as you say I dont deny it But that is not where the self experiences the highest Nibbana here and nowWhy soBecause the mind contains the idea of joy and that state is considered grossBut when with the abandonment of pleasure and pain with the disappearance of previous joy and grief one enters and abides in a state beyond pleasure and pain in the fourth jhana which is purified by equanimity and mindfulness that is where the self realises the highest Nibbana here and nowThat is how some proclaim the highest Nibbana here and now for an existent beingThese are the five ways in which these ascetics and Brahmins proclaim a doctrine of Nibbana here and nowThere is no other way  This monks the Tathagata understandsThese are the fortyfour ways in which those ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the future having fixed ideas about the future put forward various speculative views about the futureThere is no other way  This monks the Tathagata understands  These are the sixtytwo ways in which those ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the past the future or both put forward views about theseThere is no other wayThis monks the Tathagata understands These viewpoints thus grasped and adhered to will lead to suchandsuch destinations in another worldThis the Tathagata knows and more but he is not attached to that knowledge And being thus unattached he has experienced for himself perfect peaceand having truly understood the arising and passing away of feelings their attraction and peril and the deliverance from them the Tathagata is liberated without remainderThese monks are those other matters profound hard to see hard to understand peaceful excellent beyond mere thought subtle to be experienced by the wise which the Tathagata having realised them by his own superknowledge proclaims and about which those who would truthfully praise the Tathagata would rightly speakThere are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who maintain a doctrine of Nibbāna here and now and who on five grounds proclaim Nibbāna here and now for an existent beingAnd owing to what with reference to what do these honourable recluses and brahmins proclaim their viewsHerein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin asserts the following doctrine or view When this self good sir furnished and supplied with the five strands of sense pleasures revels in themat this point the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now In this way some proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and nowWhat is the reasonBecause good sir sense pleasures are impermanent suffering subject to change and through their change and transformation there arise sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairBut when the self quite secluded from sense pleasures secluded from unwholesome states enters and abides in the first jhāna which is accompanied by initial and sustained thought and contains the rapture and happiness born of seclusionat this point good sir the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now In this way others proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and nowWhat is the reasonBecause that jhāna contains initial and sustained thought therefore it is declared to be grossBut when with the subsiding of initial and sustained thought the self enters and abides in the second jhāna which is accompanied by internal confidence and unification of mind is free from initial and sustained thought and contains the rapture and happiness born of concentrationat this point good sir the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now In this way others proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and nowWhat is the reasonIt is declared to be gross because of the mental exhilaration connected with rapture that exists thereBut when with the fading away of rapture one abides in equanimity mindful and clearly comprehending and still experiencing happiness with the body enters and abides in the third jhāna so that the ariyans announce He abides happily in equanimity and mindfulnessat this point good sir the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now In this way some proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and nowWhat is the reasonIt is declared to be gross because a mental concern Happiness exists thereBut when with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the disappearance of previous joy and grief one enters and abides in the fourth jhāna which is without pleasure and pain and contains purification of mindfulness through equanimityat this point good sir the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now In this way some proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent beingIt is on these five grounds bhikkhus that these recluses and brahmins who maintain a doctrine of Nibbāna here and now proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent beingWhatever recluses or brahmins proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent being all of them do so on these five grounds or on a certain one of them Outside of these there is none This bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands  and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speakIt is on

These standpoints thus assumed and thus misapprehended lead to such a future destination to such a state in the world beyond He understands as well what transcends this yet even that understanding he does not misapprehend And because he is free from misapprehension he has realized within himself the state of perfect peaceHaving understood as they really are the origin and the passing away of feelings their satisfaction their unsatisfactoriness and the escape from them the Tathāgata bhikkhus is emancipated through nonclingingThese are those dhammas bhikkhus that are deep difficult to see difficult to understand peaceful and sublime beyond the sphere of reasoning subtle comprehensible only to the wise which the Tathāgata having realized for himself with direct knowledge propounds to others and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speakWrong views  Thus monks when those ascetics and Brahmins who are Eternalists

really are the arising and passing away of the six bases of contact their attraction and peril and the deliverance from them he knows that which goes beyond all these viewsWhatever ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the past or the future or both having fixed views on the matter and put forth speculative views about it these are all trapped in the net with its sixtytwo divisions and wherever they emerge and try to get out they are caught and held in this netJust as a skilled fisherman or his apprentice might cover a small piece of water with a finemeshed netthinking Whatever larger creatures there may be in this water they are all trapped in the netcaught and held in the net so it is with all these they are trapped and caught in this netMonks the body of the Tathagata stands with the link that bound it to becoming cutAs long as the body subsists devas and humans will see himBut at the breakingup of the body and the exhaustion of the lifespan devas and humans will see him no moreMonks just as when the stalk of a bunch of mangoes has been cut all the mangoes on it go with it just so the Tathagatas link with becoming has been cut As long as the body subsists devas and humans will see him But at the breakingup of the body and the exhaustion of the lifespan devas and humans will see him no moreAt these words theVenerable Ananda said to the Lord It is marvellous Lord it is wonderful What is the name of this exposition of Dhamma Ananda you may remember this exposition of Dhamma as the Net of Advantage the Net of Dhamma the Supreme Net the Net of Views or as the Incomparable Victory in BattleThus the Lord spokeand the monks rejoiced and were delighted at his wordsAnd as this exposition was being proclaimed the tenthousand worldsystem shookWhen bhikkhus a bhikkhu understands as they really are the origin and passing away of the six bases of contact their satisfaction unsatisfactoriness and the escape from them then he understands what transcends all these viewsWhatever recluses or brahmins bhikkhus are speculators about the past speculators about the future speculators about the past and the future together hold settled views about the past and the future and assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past and the futureall are trapped in this net with its sixtytwo divisions Whenever they emerge they emerge caught within this net trapped and contained within this very netJust as bhikkhus a skillful fisherman or a fishermans apprentice after spreading a finemeshed net over a small pool of watermight think Whatever sizeable creatures there are in this pool all are trapped within this net trapped and contained in this very netin the same way all those recluses and brahmins are trapped in this net with its sixtytwo divisions Whenever they emerge they emerge caught within this net trapped and contained within this very netThe body of the Tathāgata bhikkhus stands with the leash that bound it to existence cutAs long as his body stands gods and men shall see himBut with the breakup of the body and the exhaustion of the lifefaculty gods and men shall see him no moreJust as bhikkhus when the stalk of a bunch of mangoes has been cut all the mangoes connected to the stalk follow along with it in the same way the body of the Tathāgata stands with the leash that bound it to existence cut As long as his body stands gods and men shall see him But with the breakup of the body and the exhaustion of the lifefaculty gods and men shall see him no more When this was said the Venerable nanda said to the Exalted One It is wonderful venerable sir it is marvelous What is the title venerable sir of this exposition of the Dhamma nanda you may remember this exposition of the Dhamma as the Net of the Good as the Net of the Dhamma as the Supreme Net as the Net of Views You may remember it also as the Incomparable Victory in Battle Thus spoke the Exalted OneElated in mind the bhikkhus delighted in the word of the Exalted OneAnd while this exposition was being spoken the tenthousandfold world system shookTHUS HAVE I HEARD Once the Lord was staying at Raja gaha in Jivaka Komarabhaccas mangogrove together with a large company of some twelve hundred and fifty monksAnd at that time King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha having gone up to the roof of his palace was sitting there surrounded by his ministers on the fifteenthday fastday the fullmoon of the fourth month called KomudiAnd King Ajatasattu on that fastday gave vent to this solemn utterance Delightful friends is this moonlight night Charming is this moonlight night Auspicious is this moonlight nightCan we not today visit some ascetic or Brahmin to visit whom would bring peace to our heart Then one minister said to King Ajatasattu Sire there is Purana Kassapa who has many followers a teacher of many who is wellknown renowned the founder of a sect highly honoured by the multitude of long standing longsince gone forth aged and venerableMay Your Majesty visit this Purana KassapaHe may well bring peace to Your Majestys heartAt these words King Ajatasattu was silentAnother minister said Sire there is Makkhali Gosala who has many followersHe may well bring peace to your Majestys heartAt these words King Ajatasattu was silentAnother minister said Sire there is Ajita Kesakamball At these words King Ajatasattu was silentAnother minister said Sire there is Pakudha Kaccayana At these words King Ajatasattu was silentAnother minister said Sire there is Sanjaya BelatthaputtaAt these words King Ajatasattu was silentAnother minister said Sire there is the Nigantha Nataputta who has many followers a teacher of many who is wellknownaged and venerableMay Your Majesty visit the Nigantha NataputtaHe may well bring peace to Your Majestys heartAt these words King Ajatasattu was silentt Jthis time Jivaka Komarabhacca was sitting silently near King AjatasattuThe King said to him You friend Jivaka why are you silentSire there is this Blessed Lord the Arahant the fullyenlightened Buddha staying in my mangogrove with a large company of some twelve hundred and fifty monksAnd concerning the Blessed Gotama this fair report has been spread about This Blessed Lord is an Arahant a fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct the WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessedMay Your Majesty visit the Blessed LordHe may well bring peace to Your Majestys heartThen Jivaka have the ridingelephants made ready Very good Sire said Jivaka and he had five hundred sheelephants made ready and for the King the royal tusker Then he reported Sire the ridingelephants are ready Now is the time to do as Your Majesty wishesAnd King Ajatasattu having placed his wives each on one of the five hundred sheelephants mounted the royal tusker and proceeded in royal state accompanied by torchbearers from Rajagaha towards Jivakas mangogroveAnd when Kihg Ajatasattu came near the mangogrove he felt fear and terror and his hair stood on endAnd feeling this fear and the rising of the hairs the King said to Jivaka Friend Jivaka you are not deceiving meYou are not tricking meYou are not delivering me up to an enemyHow is it that from this great number of twelve hundred and fifty monks not a sneeze a cough or a shout is to be heard Have no fear Your MajestyI would not deceive you or hick you or deliver you up to an enemyApproach Sire approach There are the lights burning in the round pavilionSo King Ajatasattu having ridden on his elephant as far as the ground would permit alighted and continued on foot to the door of the round pavilion Then he said Jivaka where is the Lord That is the Lord Sire That is the Lord sitting against the middle column with his order of monks in front of him Then King Ajatasattu went up to the Lord and stood to one sideand standing there to one side the King observed how the order of monks continued in silence like a clear lake and he exclaimed If only Prince Udayabhadda were possessed of such calm as this order of monksDo your thoughts go to the one you love Your MajestyLord Prince Udayabhadda is very dear to meIf only he were possessed of the same calm as this order of monksThen King Ajatasattu having bowed down to the Lord and saluted the order of monks with joined hands sat down to one sideand said Lord I would ask something if the Lord would deign to answer meAsk Your Majesty anything you likeLord just as there are these various craftsmen such as elephantdrivers horsedrivers chariotfighters archers stan dardbearers adjutants army caterers champions and senior officers scouts heroes brave fighters cuirassiers slaves sons cooks barbers bathmen bakers garlandmakers bleachers weavers basketmakers potters calculators and accountants and whatever other skills there are they enjoy here and now the visible fruits of their skills they themselves are delighted and pleased with this as are their parents children and colleagues and friends they maintain and support ascetics and Brahmins thus assuring for themselves a heavenly happy reward tending towards paradiseCan you Lord point to such a reward visible here and now as a fruit of the homeless life Your Majesty do you admit that you have put this question to other ascetics and Brahmins I admit it Lord Would Your Majesty mind saying how they replied I do not mind telling the Lord or one like himWell then Your Majesty tell meOnce Lord I went to see Purana KassapaHaving exchanged courtesies I sat down to one sideand said Good Kassapa just as there are these various craftsmen they enjoy here and now the visible fruits of their skills  Can you Kassapa point to such a reward visible here and now as a fruit of the homeless life At this Lord Purana Kassapa said Your Majesty by the doer or instigator of a thing by one who cuts or causes to be cut by one who bums or causes to be burnt by one who causes grief and weariness by one who agitates or causes agitation who causes life to be taken or that which is not given to be taken commits burglary carries off booty commits robbery lies in ambush commits adultery and tells lies no evil is doneIf with a razorsharp wheel one were to make of this earth one single mass and heap of flesh there would be no evil as a result of that no evil would accrueIf one were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing slaying cutting or causing to be cut burning or causing to be burnt there would be no evil as a result of that no evil would accrueOr if one were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and causing to be given sacrificing and causing to be sacrificed there would be no merit as a result of that no merit would accrueIn giving selfcontrol abstinence and telling the truth there is no merit and no merit accrues Thus Lord Purana Kassapa on being asked about the present fruits of the homeless life explained nonaction to meJust as if on being asked about a mango he were to describe a breadfruittree or on being asked about a breadfruittree he were to describe a mfingo so Purana Kassapa on being asked about the present fruits of the homeless life explained nonaction to meAnd Lord I thought How should one like me think despitefully of any ascetic or Brahmin dwelling in my territoryso I neither applauded nor rejected Purana Kas sapas wordsbut though displeased not expressing my displeasure saying nothing rejecting and scorning speech I got up and leftOnce I visited Makkhali Gosala and asked him the same questionMakkahali Gosala said Your Majesty there is no cause or condition for the defilement of beings they are defiled without cause or conditionThere is no cause or condition for the purification of beings they are purified without cause or conditionThere is no selfpower or otherpower there is no power in humans no strength or force no vigour or exertionAll beings all living things all creatures all that lives is without control without power or strength they experience the fixed course of pleasure and pain through the six kinds of rebirthTbere are one million four hundred thousand principal sorts of birth and six thousand others and again six hundred There are five hundred kinds of kamma or five kinds and three kinds and halfkamma sixtytwo paths sixtytwo intermediary aeons six classes of humankind eight stages of human progress four thousand nine hundred occupations four thousand nine hundred wanderers four thousand nine hundred abodes of nagas two thousand sentient existences three thousand hells thirtysix places of dust seven classes of rebirth as conscious beings seven as unconscious beings and seven as beings freed from bonds seven grades of devas men goblins seven lakes seven great and seven small protuberances seven great and seven small abysses seven great and seven small dreams eight million four hundred thousand aeons during which fools and wise run on and circle round till they make an end of sufferingTherefore there is no such thing as saying By this discipline or practice or austerity or holy life I will bring my unripened kamma to fruition or I will gradually make this ripened kamma go awayNeither of these things is possible because pleasure and pain have been measured out with a measure limited by the round of birthanddeath and there is neither increase nor decrease neither excellence nor inferiorityJust as a ball of string when thrown runs till it is all unravelled so fools and wise run on and circle round till they make an end of suffering Thus Lord Makkhali Gosala on being asked about the fruits of the homeless life explained the purification of the round of birthanddeath to meSo I neither applauded nor rejected Makkhali Gosalas wordsbut got up and leftOnce I visited Ajita Kesakamball and asked him the same questionAjita Kesakamball said Your Majesty there is nothing given bestowed offered in sacrifice there is no fruit or result of good or bad deeds there is not this world or the next there is no mother or father there are no spontaneously arisen beings there are in the world no ascetics or Brahmins who have attained who have perfectly practised who proclaim this world and the next having realised them by their own superknowledgeThis human being is composed of the four great elements and when one dies the earth part reverts to earth the water part to water the fire part to fire the air part to air and the faculties pass away into spaceThey accompany the dead man with four bearers and the bier as fifththeir footsteps are heard as far as the cremationgroundThere the bones whiten the sacrifice ends in ashesIt is the idea of a fool to give this giftthe talk of those who preach a doctrine of survival is vain and falseFools and wise at the breakingup of the body are destroyed and perish they do not exist after deathThus Lord Ajita Kesakamball on being asked about the fruits of the homeless life explained the doctrine of annihilation to meI got up and leftOnce I visited Pakudha Kaccayana and asked him the same questionPakudha Kaccayana said Your Majesty these seven things are not made or of a kind to be made uncreated unproductive barren false stable as a columnThey do not shake do not change obstruct one another nor are they able to cause one another pleasure pain or bothWhat are the sevenThe earthbody the waterbody the firebody the air body pleasure and pain and the lifeprinciple These seven are not made  Thus there is neither slain nor slayer neither hearer nor proclaimer neither knower nor causer of knowingAnd whoever cuts off a mans head with a sharp sword does not deprive anyone of life he just inserts the blade in the intervening space between these seven bodies Thus Lord Pakudha Kaccayana on being asked about the fruits of the homeless life answered with something quite different I got up and leftI visited the Nigantha Nataputta and asked him the same questionThe Nigantha Nataputta said Your Majesty here a Nigantha is bound by a fourfold restraintWhat fourHe is curbed by all curbs enclosed by all curbs cleared by all curbs and claimed by all curbsAnd as far as a Nigantha is bound by this fourfold restraint thus the Nigantha is called selfperfected selfcontrolled selfestablishedThus Lord the Nigantha Nataputta on being asked about the fruits of the homeless life explained the fourfold restraint to me I got up and leftOnce I visited Sanjaya Belatthaputta and asked him the same questionSanjaya Belatthaputta said If you ask me Is there another world  if I thought so I would say soBut I dont think so I dont say it is so and I dont say otherwise I dont say it is not and I dont not say it is notIf you ask Isnt there another world   Both   Neither   Is there fruit and result of good and bad deeds  Isnt there    Both    Neither    Does the Tathagata exist after death  Does he not    Both    Neither    dont not say it is not Thus Lord Sanjaya Belatthaputta on being asked about the fruits of the homeless life replied by evasionJust as if on being asked about a mango he were to describe a breadfruit treeAnd I thought Of all these ascetics and Brahmins Sanjaya Belatthaputta is the most stupid and confused So I neither applauded nor rejected his words but go up and leftAnd so Lord I now ask the Blessed Lord Just as there are these various craftsmen   who enjoy here and now the visible fruits of their skills  assuring for themselves a heavenly happy reward Can you Lord point to such a reward visible here and now as a fruit of the homeless life I can Your MajestyI will just ask a few questions in returnand you Sire shall answer as you see fitWhat do you think Sire Suppose there were a man a slave a labourer getting up before you and going to bed after you willingly doing whatever has to be done wellmannered pleasantspoken working in your presenceAnd he might think It is strange it is wonderful the destiny and fruits of meritorious deedsThis King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha is a man and I too am a manThe King is addicted to and indulges in the fivefold sensepleasures just like a godwhereas I am a slave working in his presenceI ought to do something meritoriousSuppose I were to shave off my hair and beard don yellow robes and go forth from the household life into homelessnessAnd before long he does soAnd he having thus gone forth might dwell restrained in body speech and thought satisfied with the minimum of food and clothing content in solitudeAnd then if people were to announce to you Sire you remember that slave who worked in your presence and who shaved off his hair and beard and went forth into homelessnessHe is living restrained in body speech and thought  in solitude would you then say That man must come back and be a slave and work for me as before No indeed LordFor we should pay homage to him we should rise and invite him and press him to receive from us robes food lodging medicines for sickness and requisites and make arrangements for his proper protection What do you think Sire Is that one fruit of the homeless life visible here and nowCertainly LordThen that Sire is the first such fruit of the homeless lifeBut Lord can you show any other reward visible here and now as a fruit of the homeless life I can SireI will just ask a few questions in returnand you Sire shall answer as you see fitWhat do you think Sire Suppose there were a man a farmer a householder in your service the steward of an estateHe might think It is strange it is wonderful the destiny and fruits of meritorious deedsThis King Ajatasattu is a man and I too am a manThe King is addicted to and indulges in the fivefold senseplea sures just like a godwhereas I am a farmer the steward of an estateI ought to do something meritoriousSuppose I were to  go forth from the household life into homelessness
