There the naked ascetic Kassapa came to him exchanged courtesies with him
and stood to one side
what they sometimes applaud we sometimes do not applaud
and what they sometimes do not applaud we sometimes applaud
what we sometimes do not applaud they sometimes do not applaud
What we sometimes applaud they sometimes do not applaud
and what we sometimes do not applaud they sometimes applaud
the ascetic Gotama has completely freed himself but the other reverend teachers only in part
the ascetic Gotama has completely mastered them but the other reverend teachers only in part
In this case the wise give us the greatest share of praise
namely Right View Right Thought Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right Concentration
then indeed he is still far from being an ascetic or a Brahmin
then that monk is called an ascetic and a Brahmin
and if this were the measure and practice of the difficulty the great difficulty of understanding an ascetic or Brahmin it wouldnot be right to say that
because any householdercould understand it
then Kassapa that monk is called an ascetic and a Brahmin
And Kassapa there is nothing further or more perfect than this perfection of morality of the heart and of wisdom
which they praise in various ways
Then the Lord having stayed in Rājagaha for as long as he found suiting set out on tour for Kapilavatthu
Walking on tour in due course he arrived at Kapilavatthu
The Lord stayed there among the Sakyans in Kapilavatthu in the Banyan monastery
Then the Lord having dressed in the morning taking his bowl and robe approached the dwelling of Suddhodana the Sakyan having approached he sat down on the appointed seat
Then the lady Rāhulas mother spoke thus to the boy Rāhula This Rāhula is your father
go and ask him for your inheritance
Then the boy Rāhula approached the Lord having approached he stood in front of the Lord and said Pleasant is your shadow recluse
Then the Lord rising up from his seat departed
Then the boy Rāhula following close behind the Lord said Give me my inheritance recluse give me my inheritance recluse
Then the Lord addressed the venerable Sāriputta saying Well then do you Sāriputta let the boy Rāhula go forth
How do I Lord let the boy Rāhula go forth
Then the Lord on this occasion in this connection having given reasoned talk addressed the monks saying I allow monks the going forth for novices by the three goings for refuge
And thus monks should you let one go forth first having made him have his hair and beard cut off having got to present him with yellow robes having made him arrange his upper robe over one shoulder having made him honour the monks feet having made him sit down on his haunches having made him salute with joined palms he should be told Speak thus I go to the awakened one for refuge I go to dhamma for refuge I go to the Order for refuge And a second time I go  And a third time I go  to the Order for refuge
I allow monks the going forth for novices by these three goings for refuge
Then the venerable Sāriputta let the boy Rāhula go forth

Bhikkhus these four times rightly developed and coordinated gradually culminate in the destruction of the taints
Wh at four
The time for listening to the Dhamma the time for discussing the Dhamma the time for serenity and the time for insight These four times rightly developed and coordinated gradually culminate in the destruction of the taints
Just as when it is raining and the rain pours down in thick droplets on a mountain top the water flows down along the slope and fills the clefts gullies and creeks these becoming full fill up the pools these becoming full fill up the lakes these becoming full fill up the streams these becoming full fill up the rivers and these becoming full fill up the great ocean

Bhikkhus there are these eight causes and conditions that lead to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life when it has not been obtained and to its increase maturation and fulfillment by development after it has been obtained
What eight
Here a bhikkhu lives in dependence on the Teacher or on a certain fellow monk in the position of a teacher toward whom he has set up a keen sense of moral shame and moral dread affection and reverence
This is the first cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life when it has not been obtained and to its increase maturation and fulfillment by development after it has been obtained
As he is living in dependence on the Teacher or on a certain fellow monk in the position of a teacher toward whom he has set up a keen sense of moral shame and moral dread affection and reverence he approaches them from time to time and inquires How is this Bhante What is the meaning of this 
Those venerable ones then disclose to him what has not been disclosed clear up what is obscure and dispel his perplexity about numerous perplexing points
This is the second cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life
Having heard that Dhamma he resorts to two kinds of withdrawal withdrawal in body and withdrawal in mind
This is the third cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life
He is virtuous he dwells restrained by the Patimokkha possessed of good conduct and resort seeing clanger in minute faults Having Undertaken the training rules he trains in them
This is the fourth cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life
He has learned much remembers what he has learned and accumulates what he has learned
Those teachings that are good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life  such teachings as these he has learned much of retained in mind recited verbally mentally investigated and penetrated well by view
This is the fifth cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life
He has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities he is strong firm in exertion not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities
This is the sixth cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life
In the midst of the Sangha he does not engage in rambling and pointless talk
Either he himself speaks on the Dhamma or he requests someone else to do so or he adopts noble silence
This is the seventh cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life
He dwells contemplating arising and vanishing in the five aggregates subject to clinging Such is form such its origin such its passing away such is feeling  such is perception  such are volitional activities  such is consciousness such its origin such its passing away
This is the eighth cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life when it has not been obtained and to its increase maturation and fulfillment by development after it has been obtained
His fellow monks esteem him thus This venerable one lives in dependence on the Teacher or on a certain fellow monk in the position of a teacher toward whom he has set up a keen sense of moral shame and moral dread affection and reverence
This venerable one surely knows and sees
This quality leads to affection respect esteem accord and unity
As this venerable one is living in dependence on the Teacher or on a certain fellow monk in the position of a teacher  those venerable ones  dispel his perplexity about numerous perplexing points
This venerable one surely knows and sees
This quality too leads to affection respect esteem accord and unity

This venerable one surely knows and sees
This quality too leads to affection respect esteem accord and unity
In the midst of the Sahgha this venerable one does not engage in rambling and pointless talk  or he adopts noble silence
This venerable one surely knows and sees
This quality too leads to affection respect esteem  accord and unity
This venerable one dwells contemplating arising and vanishing in the five aggregates subject to clinging
This venerable one surely knows and sees
This quality too leads to affection respect esteem accord and unity
These bhikkhus are the eight causes and conditions that lead to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life when it has not been obtained and to its increase maturation and fulfillment by development after it has been obtained
At Savatthi
Bhikkhus there are these five aggregates subject to clinging
What five
The form aggregate subject to clinging the feeling aggregate subject to clinging the perception aggregate subject to clinging the volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging
So long as I did not directly know as they really are the five aggregates subject to clinging in four phases I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas Mara and Brahma in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins its devas and humans
But when I directly knew all this as it really is then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with  its devas and humans
And how bhikkhus are there four phases
I directly knew form its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation I directly knew feeling  perception  volitional formations  consciousness its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation
And what bhikkhus is form
The four great elements and the form derived from the four great elements
this is called form
With the arising of nutriment there is the arising of form With the cessation of nutriment there is the cessation of form
This Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of form that is right view  right concentration
Whatever ascetics and brahmins having thus directly known form its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation are practising for the purpose of revulsion towards form for its fading away and cessation they are practising well
Those who are practising well have gained a foothold in this Dhamma and Discipline
And whatever ascetics and brahmins having thus directly known form its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation through revulsion towards form through its fading away and cessation are liberated by nonclinging they are well liberated
Those who are well liberated are consummate ones
As to those consummate ones there is no round for describing them
And what bhikkhus is feeling
There are these six classes of feeling feeling born of eyecontact feeling born of earcontact feeling born of nosecontact feeling born of tonguecontact feeling born of bodycontact feeling born of mindcontact
This is called feeling
With the arising of contact there is the arising of feelingWith the cessation of contact there is the cessation of feeling
This Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of feeling that is right view  right concentration
Whatever ascetics and brahmins having thus directly known feeling its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation are practising for the purpose of revulsion towards feeling for its fading away and cessation they are practising well
Those who are practising well have gained a foothold in this Dhamma and Discipline
And whatever ascetics and brahmins having thus directly known feeling  and the way leading to its cessation  As to those consummate ones there is no round for describing them
And what bhikkhus is perception
There are these six classes of perception perception of forms perception of sounds perception of odours perception of tastes perception of tactile objects perception of mental phenomena
This is called perception
With the arising of contact there is the arising of perception With the cessation of contact there is the cessation of perception
This Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of perception that is right view  right concentration
And what bhikkhus are volitional formations
There are these six classes of volition volition regarding forms volition regarding sounds volition regarding odours volition regarding tastes volition regarding tactile objects volition regarding mental phenomena
These are called volitional formations
With the arising of contact there is the arising of volitional formations With the cessation of contact there is the cessation of volitional formations
This Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of volitional formations that is right view  right concentration
Whatever ascetics and brahmins



As to those consummate ones there is no round for describing them
And what bhikkhus is consciousness
There are these six classes of consciousness eyeconsciousness earconsciousness noseconsciousness tongueconsciousness bodyconsciousness mindconsciousness
This is called consciousness
With the arising of nameandform there is the arising of consciousness With the cessation of nameandform there is the cessation of consciousness
This Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of consciousness that is right view  right concentration
Whatever ascetics and brahmins having thus directly known consciousness its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation are practising for the purpose of revulsion towards consciousness for its fading away and cessation they are practising well
Those who are practising well have gained a foothold in this Dhamma and Discipline
And whatever ascetics and brahmins having thus directly known consciousness its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation through revulsion towards consciousness through its fading away and cessation are liberated by nonclinging they are well liberated
Those who are well liberated are consummate ones
As to those consummate ones there is no round for describing them
And a certain practiser of mortification called Nigrodha consulted me about the practice of austerity
And he was delighted with my explanation beyond all measure
I will even wait four years and at the end of that time let the monks give me the goingforth and the monastic ordination
Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is nothing further here
And the Venerable Kassapa became another of the Arahants
Again I see one who practises little austerityarising in a state of woe
Again I see one who practises little austerityarising after death in a good place a heavenly state
If a naked ascetic were to do all these things 
and if this were the measure and practice of the difficulty the great difficulty of being an ascetic or Brahmin it would not be right to say It is hard to be an ascetic it is hard to be a Brahmin
because any householder or householders son  even the slavegirl who draws water  could do this saying Well I will go naked
That is the perfection of morality He guards the sensedoors etc
Kassapa a practiser of selfmortification may do all these things
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthiin the Eastern Park in the Mansion of Migaras Mother together with a great Sangha of bhikkhus
Now on that occasion  the Uposatha day of the fifteenth a fullmoon night  the Blessed One was sitting out in the open surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus
Then a certain bhikkhu rose from his seat arranged his upper robe over one shoulder raised his joined hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and said to him Venerable sirI would ask the Blessed One about a certain point if the Blessed One would grant me the favour of answering my question
Well then bhikkhu sit down in your own seat and ask whatever you wish
Yes venerable sir that bhikkhu replied Then he sat down in his own seat and said to the Blessed One Arent these the five aggregates subject to clinging venerable sir that is the form aggregate subject to clinging the feeling aggregate subject to clinging the perception aggregate subject to clinging the volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging 
Those are the five aggregates subject to clinging bhikkhu that is the form aggregate subject to clinging the feeling aggregate subject to clinging the perception aggregate subject to clinging the volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging
Saying Good venerable sir that bhikkhu delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones statement Then he asked the Blessed One a further question
But venerable sir in what are these five aggregates subject to clinging rooted 
These five aggregates subject to clinging bhikkhu are rooted in desire Venerable sir is that clinging the same as these five aggregates subject to clinging or is the clinging something apart from the five aggregates subject to clinging 
Bhikkhus that clinging is neither the same as the five aggregates subject to clinging nor is the clinging something apart from the five aggregates subject to clinging But rather the desire and lust for them that is the clinging there
Saying Good venerable sir that bhikkhu  asked the Blessed One a further question
But venerable sir can there be diversity in the desire and lust for the five aggregates subject to clinging 
There can be bhikkhu the Blessed One said Here bhikkhu it occurs to someone May I have such form in the future May I have such feeling in the future May I have such perception in the future May I have such volitional formations in the future May I have such consciousness in the future 
Thus bhikkhu there can be diversity in the desire and lust for the five aggregates subject to clinging
Saying Good venerable sir that bhikkhu  asked the Blessed One a further question
In what way venerable sir does the designation aggregates apply to the aggregates 
Whatever kind of there is bhikkhu whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near  this is called the form aggregate
Whatever kind of feeling there is whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near this is called the feeling aggregate Whatever kind of perception there is whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near this is called the perception aggregate Whatever kind of volitional formations there are whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferioror or superior far or near this is called the volitional formations aggregate Whatever kind of consciousness there is whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near this is called the consciousness aggregate
It is in this way bhikkhu that the designation aggregates applies to the aggregates
Saying Good venerable sir that bhikkhu  asked the Blessed One a further question
What is the cause and condition venerable sir for the manifestation of the form aggregate What is the cause and condition for the manifestation of the feeling aggregate  for the manifestation of the perception aggregate  for the manifestation of the volitional formations aggregate  for the manifestation of the consciousness aggregate 
The four great elements bhikkhu are the cause and conditon for the manifestation of the form aggregate
Contact is the cause and condition for the manifestation of the feeling aggregate
Contact is the cause and condition for the manifestation of the perception aggregate
Contactis the cause and condition for the manifestation of the volitional formations aggregate
Nameandform is the cause and condition for the manifestation of the consciousness aggregate
Venerable sir how does identity view come to be 
Here bhikkhu the uninstructed worldling who is not a seer of the noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma who is not a seer of superior persons and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma regards form as self or self as possessing form or form as in self or self as in form He regards feeling as self  perception as self  volitional formations as self  consciousness as self or self as possessing consciousness or consciousnessas in self or self as in consciousness
That is how identity view comes to be
But venerable sir how does identity view not come to be 
Here bhikkhu the instructed noble disciple who is a seer of the noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma who is a seer of superior persons and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma does not regard form as self or self as possessing form or form as in self or self as in form He does not regard feeling as self  perception as self  volitional formations as self  consciousness as self or self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousness
That is how identity view does not come to be
What venerable sir is the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of form What is the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of feeling  in the case of perception  in the case of volitional formations  in the case of consciousness 
The pleasure and joy bhikkhu that arise in dependence on form this is the gratificationin form
That form is impermanent suffering and subject to change this is the danger in form
The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for form this is the escape from form
The pleasure and joy that arise in dependence on feeling  in dependence on perception  in dependence on volitional formations  in dependence on consciousness this is the gratification in consciousness
That consciousness is impermanent suffering and subject to change this is the danger in consciousness
The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for consciousness this is the escape from consciousness
Saying Good venerable sir that bhikkhu delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones statement Then he asked the Blessed One a further question
Venerable sir how should one know how should one see so that in regard to this body with consciousness and in regard to all external signs Imaking minemaking and the underlying tendency to conceit no longer occur within 
Any kind of form whatsoever bhikkhu whether past future or present internal or extemal gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near  one sees all form as it really is with correct wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
Any kind of feeling whatsoever  Any kind of perception whatsoever  Any kind of volitional formations whatsoever  Any kind of consciousness whatsoever whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near  one sees all consciousness as it really is with correct wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
When one knows and sees thus bhikkhu then in regard to this body with consciousness and in regard to all external signs Imaking minemaking and the underlying tendency to conceit no longer occur within
Now on that occasion the following reflection arose in the mind of a certain bhikkhu So it seems that form is nonself feeling is nonself perception is nonself volitional formations are nonself consciousness is nonself What self then will deeds done by what is nonself affect 
Then the Blessed One knowing with his own mind the reflection in the mind of that bhikkhu addressed the bhikkhus thus
It is possible bhikkhus that some senseless man here obtuse and ignorant with his mind dominated by craving might think that he can outstrip the Teachers Teaching thus So it seems that form is nonself  consciousnessis nonself
What self then will deeds done by what is nonself affect
 Now bhikkhus you have been trained by me through interrogation here and there inregard to diverse teachings
What do you think bhikkhu is form permanent or impermanent
  Impermanent venerable sir
  Is feeling permanent or impermanent  Is perception permanent or impermanentAre volitional formations permanent or impermanent  Is consciousness permanent or impermanent
  Impermanent venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness
  Suffering venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self
  No venerable sir
Therefore  Seeing thus  He understands  there is no more for this state of being 
These are the ten questions The bhikkhu came to ask
Two about the aggregates Whether the same can there be
Designation and the cause Two about identity
One each on gratification And this body with consciousness
At Savatthi
Bhikkhus form is impermanent
What is impermanent is suffering What is suffering is nonself What is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
When one sees this thus as it really is with correct wisdom the mind becomes dispassionate and is liberated from the taints by nonclinging
Feeling is impermanent  Perception is impermanent  Volitional formations are impermanent  Consciousness is impermanent
What is impermanent is suffering What is suffering is nonself What is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
When one sees this thus as it really is with correct wisdom the mind becomes dispassionate and is liberated from the taints by nonclinging
If bhikkhus a bhikkhus mind has become dispassionate towards the form element it is liberated from the taints by nonclinging If his mind has become dispassionate towards the feeling element  towards the perception element  towards the volitional formations element  towards the consciousness element it is liberated from the taints by nonclinging
Being unagitated he personally attains Nibbana
He understands Destroyed is birth the holy lifehas been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more for this state of being 
By being liberated it is steady
by being steady it is content
by being content he is not agitated
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Ayojjha on the bank of the river Ganges
There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus
A man with good sight would inspect it ponder it and carefully investigate it
For what substance could there be in a lump of foam
So too bhikkhus whatever kind of form there is whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near a bhikkhu inspects it ponders it and carefully investigates it
For what substance could there be in form
Supposebhikkhus that in the autumn when it is raining and big rain drops are falling a water bubble arises and bursts on the surface of the water
A man with good sight would inspect it ponder it and carefully investigate it
For what substance could there be in a water bubble
So too bhikkhus whatever kind of feeling there is whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near a bhikkhu inspects it ponders it and carefully investigates it
For what substance could there be in feeling
Supposebhikkhus that in the last month of the hot season at high noon a shimmering mirage appears
A man with good sight would inspect it ponder it and carefully investigate it and it would appear to him to be void hollow insubstantial
For what substance could there be in a mirage
So too bhikkhus whatever kind of perception there is whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near a bhikkhu inspects it ponders it and carefully investigates it and it would appear to him to be void hollow insubstantial For what substance could there be in perception
Suppose bhikkhus that a man needing heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood would take a sharp axe and enter a forest
As he unrolls the coil he would not find even softwoodlet alone heartwood
A man with good sight would inspect it pander it and carefully investigate it
For what substance could there be in the trunk of a plantain tree
So too bhikkhus whatever kind of volitional formations there are whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near a bhikkhu inspects them ponders them and carefully investigatesthem
As he investigates them they appear to him to be void hollow insubstantial
For what substance could there be in volitional formations
Suppose bhikkhus that a magician or a magicians apprentice would display a magical illusion at a crossroads
A man with good sight would inspect it ponder it and carefully investigate it
For what substance could there be in a magical illusion
So too bhikkhus whatever kind of consciousnessthere is whether past future or present internal or externalgrossor subtle inferior or superior far or near a bhikkhu inspects it ponders it and carefully investigatesit
For what substance could there be in consciousness
Seeing thus bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards form revulsion towards feeling revulsion towards perception revulsion towards volitional formations revulsion towards consciousness
Experiencing revulsion he becomes dispassionate Through dispassion hismind is liberated
When it is liberated there comes the knowledge Its liberated He understands Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more for this state of being 
This is what the Blessed One said
Having said this the Fortunate One the Teacher further said this
Bhikkhus suppose that this river Ganges was carrying along a great lump of foam
and it would appear to him to be void hollow insubstantial
and it would appear to him to be void hollow insubstantial
and it would appear to him to be void hollow insubstantial
and it would appear to him to be void hollow insubstantial
There he would see the trunk of a large plantain tree straight fresh without a fruitbud core
He would cut it down at the root cut off the crown and unroll the coil
and it would appear to him to be void hollow insubstantial
and it would appear to him to be void hollow insubstantial
and it would appear to him to be void hollow insubstantial
Form is like a lump of foam Feeling like a water bubble
However one may ponder it And carefully investigate it
With reference to this body The One of Broad Wisdom has taught
When vitality heat and consciousness Depart from this physical body
Such is this continuum This illusion beguiler of fools
A bhikkhu with energy aroused Should look upon the aggregates thus
He should discard all the fetters And make a refuge for himself
Perception is like a mirage Volitions like a plantain trunk
And consciousness like an illusion So explained the Kinsman of the Sun
It appears but hollow and void When one views it carefully
That with the abandoning of three things One sees this form discarded
Then it lies there cast away Food for others without volition
It is taught to be a murderer Here no substance can be found
Whether by day or at nightl Comprehending ever mindful
Let him fare as with head ablaze Yearning for the imperishable state
At Savatthi Bhikkhus without directly knowing and fully understanding the all without developing dispassion towards it and abandoning it one is incapable of destroying suffering
And what bhikkhus is that all without directly knowing and fully understanding which without developing dispassion towards which and abandoning which one is incapable of destroying suffering
Without directly knowing and fully understanding the eye without developing dispassion towards it and abandoning it one is incapable of destroying suffering
 and whatever feeling arises with eyecontact as condition  without developing dispassion towards it and abandoning it one is incapable of destroying suffering Without directly knowing and fully understanding the ear

Then the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One  and said to him Venerable sir it is said Empty is the world empty is the world
In what way venerable sir is it said Empty is the world 
It is Ananda because it is empty of self and of what belongs to self that it is said Empty is the world
And what is empty of self and of what belongs to self
The eye Ananda is empty of self and of what belongs to self
Forms are empty of self and of what belongs to self Eyeconsciousness is empty of self and of what belongs to self Eyecontact is empty of self and of what belongs to self  Whatever feeling arises with mindcontact as condition whether pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant that too is empty of self and of what belongs to self
It is Ananda because it is empty of self and of what belongs to self that it is said Empty is the world 
On one occasionthe Venerable Ananda and the Venerable Udayi were dwelling at Kosambi in Ghositas Park
Then in the evening the Venerable Udayi emerged from seclusion and approached the Venerable Ananda
He exchanged greetings with the Venerable Ananda and when they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk he sat down to one side and said to him
Friend Ananda in many ways the nature ofl this body has been declared disclosed and revealed by the Blessed One thus For such a reason this body is nonself Is it possible to explain the nature ofthis consciousness in a similar wayto teach proclaim establish disclose analyse and elucidate it thus For such a reason this consciousness is nonself 
Doesnt eyeconsciousness arise in dependence on the eye and forms
Yes friend
If the cause and condition for the arising of eyeconsciousness would cease completely and totally without remainder
No friend
In this way friend this has been declared disclosed and revealed by the Blessed One thus For such a reason this conisciousness is nonself
Doesnt earconsciousness arise in dependence on the ear and sounds 
Yes friend
If the cause and condition for the arising of mindconsciousness would cease completely and totally without remainder could mindconsciousnessbe discerned 
No friend
In this way too friend this has been declared disclosed and revealed by the Blessed One thus For such a reason this consciousness is nonself
There he would see the trunk of a large plantain tree straight fresh without a fruitbud core
He would cut it down at the root cut off the crown and unroll the coil
As he unrolls the coil he would not find even softwood let alone heartwood
So too a bhikkhu does not recognize either a self or anything belonging to a self in these six bases for contact
Since he does not recognize anything thus he does not cling to anything in the world
Not clinging he is not agitated
Being unagitated he personally attains NibbBna
He understands Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more for this state of being 
It is possible friend Udayi
could eyeconsciousness be discerned 
Doesnt mindconsciousness arise in dependence on the mind and mental phenomena 
Suppose friend a man needing heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood would take a sharp axe and enter a forest
At SavatthiBhikkhus I will teach you the diversity of elements
Yes venerable sir those bhikkhus replied
The Blessed One said this
And what bhikkhus is the diversityof elements
The eye element form element eyeconsciousness element the ear element sound element earconsciousness element the nose element odour element noseconsciousness element the tongue element taste element tongueconsciousness element the body element tactileobject element bodyconsciousness element the mind element mentalphenomena element mindconsciousness element This bhikkhus is called the diversity of elements
Listen to that and attend closely I will speak
The earth element the water element the heat element the air element
Those ascetics or brahmins bhikkhus who do not understand as they really are the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of these four elements these I do not consider to be ascetics among ascetics or brahmins among brahmins and these venerable ones do not by realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge in this very life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism or the goal of brahminhood
At Savatthi Bhikkhusthere are these four elements
What four
But bhikkhus those ascetics and brahmins who understand as they really are the gratificationthe danger and the escape in the case of these four elements these I consider to be ascetics among ascetics and brahmins among brahmins and these venerable ones by realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge in this very life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism and the goal of brahminhood
At Savatthi Bhikkhus there are these four elements
What four
The earth element the water element the heat element the air element
Those ascetics or brahmins bhikkhus who do not understand as they really are the origin and the passing away the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of these four elements these I do not consider to be ascetics among ascetics But bhkkhus those ascetics and brahmins who understand as they really are the origin and the passing away the gratification the danger and the escape  in the case of these four elements these I consider to be ascetics among ascetics and brahmins among brahmins and these venerable ones by realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge in this very life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism and the goal of brahminhood
At Savatthi Bhikkhus those ascetics or brahmins who do not understand the earth element its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation who do not understand the water element  the heat element  the air element its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation these I do not consider to be ascetics among ascetics 
But bhikkhus those ascetics and brahmins who understand these things these I consider to be ascetics among ascetics and brahmins among brahmins and these venerable ones by realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge in this very life enter and dwell inthe goal of asceticism and the goal of brahminhood
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anaithapbdikas Park
There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus 
Venerable sir  those bhikkhus replied
The Blessed One said this Bhikkhus I will teach you dependent origination Listen to that and attend closely I will speak
Yes venerable sir those bhikkhus replied
The Blessed One said this
And what bhikkhus is dependent origination
With ignorance as condition volitional formations come to be with volitional formations as condition consciousness with consciousness as condition nameandform with nameandform as condition the six sense bases with the six sense bases as condition contact with contact as condition feeling with feeling as condition craving with craving as condition clinging with clinging as condition existence with existence as condition birth with birth as condition aginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair come to be
Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering
This bhikkhus is called dependent origination
But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations with the cessation of volitional formations cessation of consciousness with the cessation of consciousness cessation of nameandform with the cessation of nameandform cessation of the six sense bases with the cessation of the six sense bases cessation of contact with the cessation of contact cessation of feeling with the cessation of feeling cessation of craving with the cessation of craving cessation of clinging with the cessation of clinging cessation of existence with the cessation of existence cessation of birth with the cessation of birth aginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair cease
Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering
This is what the Blessed One said
Elated those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed Ones statement
At Savatthi Bhikkhus I will teach you dependent origination and dependently arisen phenomena
Listen and attend closely I will speak
Yes venerable sir those bhikkhus replied
The Blessed One said this
whether there is are arising of Tathagatas or no arising of Tathagatas that element still persists the stableness of the Dhamma the fixed course of the Dhamma specific conditionality
And he says See With birth as condition bhikkhus aginganddeath
With existence as condition birth  With clinging as condition existence  With craving as condition clinging  With feelingas condition craving  With contact as condition feeling With the six sense bases as condition contact  With nameandform as condition the six sense bases  With consciousness as condition nameandform  With volitional formations as condition consciousness  With ignorance as condition volitional formations whether there is an arising of Tathagatas or no arising of Tathagatas that element still persists the stableness of the Dhamma the fixed course of the Dhamma specific conditionaIity
A Tathagata awakens to this and breaks through to it
Having done so he explains it teaches it proclaims it establishes it discloses it analyses it elucidates it
And he says See With ignorance as condition bhikkhus volitional formations
Thus bhikkhus the actuality in this the inerrancy the not otherwiseness specific conditionality this is called dependent origination
And what bhikkhus are the dependently arisen phenomena
Aginganddeath bhikkhus is impermanent conditioned dependently arisen subject to destruction vanishing fading away and cessation
Birth is impermanent conditioned dependently arisen subject to destruction vanishing fading away and cessation
Clinging is impermanent  Craving is impermanent  Feeling is impermanent  Contactis impermanent  The six sense bases are impermanent  Nameandform is impermanent  Consciousness is impermanent  Volitional formations are impermanent  Ignorance is impermanent conditioned dependently arisen subject to destruction vanishing fading away and cessation
When bhikkhus a noble disciple has clearly seen with correct wisdom as it really is this dependent origination and these dependently arisen phenomena it is impossible that he will back into the past thinking Did I exist in the past Did I not exist in the past What was I in the past How was I in the past Having been what what did I become in the past  Or that he will run forward into the future thinking Will I exist in the future Will I not exist in the future What will I be in the future How will I be in the future Having been what what will I become in the future  Or that he will now be inwardly confused about the present thus Do I exist Do I not exist What am I How am I This beingwhere has it come from and where will it go 
For what reason is this impossible
Because bhikkhus the noble disciple has clearly seen with correct wisdom as it really is this dependent origination and these dependently arisen phenomena
And what bhikkhus is dependent origination
With birth as condition aginganddeath comes to be
A Tathagata awakens to this and breaks through to it
Having done so he explains it teaches it proclaims it establishes it discloses it analyses it elucidates it
Existence is impermanent conditioned dependently arisen subject to destruction vanishing fading away and cessation
These bhikkhus are called the dependently arisen phenomena
At Savatthi Bhikkhus I will teach you fortyfour cases of knowledge Listen to that and attend closely I will speak
Yes venerable sir those bhikkhus replied
The Blessed One said this
Bhikkhus what are the fortyfour cases of knowledge
Knowledge of aginganddeath knowledge of its origin knowledge of its cessation knowledge of the way leading to its cessation Knowledge of birth  Knowledge of existence  Knowledge of clinging  Knowledge of craving  Knowledge of feeling  Knowledge of contact  Knowledge of the six sense bases  Knowledge of nameandform  Knowledge of consciousness  Knowledge of volitional formations knowledge of their origin knowledge of their cessation knowledge of the way leading to their cessation
These bhikkhus are the fortyfour cases of knowledge
And what bhikkhus is aginganddeath
Thus this aging and this death are together called aginganddeath
With the arising of birth there is the arising of aginganddeath With the cessation of birth there is the cessation of aginganddeath This Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of aginganddeath that is right view  right concentration
Whatever ascetics and brahmins in the future will directly know aginganddeath its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation all these will directly know it in the very same way that I do now
When bhikkhus a noble disciple has purified and cleansed these two kinds of knowledgeknowledge of the principle and knowledge of entailment 
And what bhikkhus is birth  What are the volitional formations
When bhikkhus a noble disciple thus understands volitional formations their origin their cessation and the way leading to their cessation this is his knowledge of the principle
By means of this principle that is seen understood immediately attained fathomed he applies the method to the past and to the future  This is his knowledge of entailment
When bhikkhus a noble disciple has purified and cleansed these two kinds of knowledge  knowledge of the principle and knowledge of entailment 
When bhkkhus a noble disciple thus understands aginganddeath its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation this is his knowledge of the principle
By means of this principle that is seen understood immediately attained fathomed he applies the method to the past and to the future thus
Whatever ascetics and brahmins in the past directly knew aginganddeath its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation all these directly knew it in the very same way that I do now
This is his knowledge of entailment
he is then called a noble disciple who is accomplished in view accomplished in vision who has arrived at this true Dhamma who sees this true Dhamma who possesses a trainees knowledge a trainees true knowledge who has entered the stream of the Dhamma a noble one with penetrative wisdom one who stands squarely before the door to the Deathless
This Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of volitional formations that is right view  right concentration
he is then called a noble disciple who is accomplished in view  one who stands squarely before the door to the Deathless
At Savatthi
Then the Venerable Kaccanagotta approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one side
In what way venerable sir is there right view
This world Kaccana for the most part depends upon a dualityupon the notion of existence and the notion of nonexistence
It is in this way Kaccana that there is right view
All exists Kaccana this is one extreme
All does not exist this is the second extreme
Without veering towards either of these extremes the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma by the middle With ignorance as condition volitional formations come to be with volitional formations as condition consciousness  Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering
But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations with the cessation of volitional formations cessation of consciousness Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering
and said to him Venerable sir it is said right view right view
But for one who sees the origin of the world as it really is with correct wisdom there is no notion of nonexistence in regard to the world
He has no perplexity or doubt that what arises is only suffering arising what ceases is only suffering ceasing His knowledge about this is independent of others
And for one who sees the cessation of the world as it really is with correct wisdom there is no notion of existence in regard to the world
This world Kaccana is for the most part shackled by engage ment clinging and adherence
But this one with right view does not become engaged and cling through that engagement and clinging mental standpoint adherence underlying tendency he does not take a stand about my self
At Savatthi
Bhikkhus what one intends and what one plans and whatever one has a tendency towards this becomes a basis for the maintenance of consciousness
When there is a basis there is a support for the establishing of consciousness
When consciousness is established and has come to growth there is the production of future renewed existence
When there is the production of future renewed existence future birth aginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair come to be
If bhikkhus one does not intend and one does not plan but one still has a tendency towards something this becomes a basis for the maintenance of consciousness
But bhikkhus when one does not intend and one does not plan and one does not have a tendency towards anything no basis exists for the maintenance of consciousness
When there is no basis there is no support for the establishing of consciousness
When consciousness is unestablished and does not come to growth there is no production of future renewed existence
When there is no production of future renewed existence future birth aginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair cease
Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering
Such is thes origin of this whole mass of suffering
When there is a basis there is a support for the establishing of consciousness
Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering
At Savatthi Bhikkhus I will teach you the origin and the passing away of the world
Listen to that and attend closely I will speak
Yes venerable sir the bhikkhus replied
The Blessed One said this
And what bhikkhus is the origin of the world
With contact as condition feeling comes to be with feeling as condition craving with craving as condition clinging with clinging as condition existence with existence as condition birth with birth as condition aginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair come to be
This bhikkhus is the origin of the world
In dependence on the ear and sounds  In dependenceon the nose and odours  In dependence on the tongue and tastes  In dependence on the body and tactile objects  In dependence on the mind and mental phenomena mindconsciousness arises
The meeting of the three is contact
With contact as condition feeling comes to be with feeling as condition craving with craving as condition clinging  existence  birth with birth as conditionaginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair come to be
This bhikkhus is the origin of the world
And what bhikkhus is the passing away of the world
In dependence on the eye and forms eyeconsciousness arises
The meeting of the three is contact
With contactas condition feeling comes to be with feeling as condition craving
But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving comes cessation of clinging with the cessation of clinging cessation of existence with the cessation of existence cessation of birth with the cessation of birth aginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair cease Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering
This bhikkhus is the passing away of the world
In dependence on the ear and sounds   In dependence on the mind and mental phenomena mindconsciousness arises
The meeting of the three is contact
With contact as condition feeling comes to be with feeling as conditioncraving
But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving comes cessation of clinging  cessation of existence  cessation of birth with the cessation of birth aginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair cease Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering
This bhikkhus is the passing away of the world
In dependence on the eye and forms eyeconsciousness arises
The meeting of the three is contact
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Vajjians at Kotiggama
There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus it is because of not understanding and not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that you and I have roamed and wandered through this long course of samsara
What four
It is bhikkhus because of not understanding and not penetrating the noble truth of suffering that you and I have roamed and wandered through this long course of samsara
It is because of not understanding and not penetrating the noble truth of the origin of suffering  the noble truth of the cessation of suffering  the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering that you and I have roamed and wandered through this long course of samsara
That noble truth of suffering bhkkhus has been understood and penetrated That noble truth of the origin of suffering has been understood and penetrated That noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been understood and penetrated That noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering has been understood and penetrated Craving for existence has been cut off the conduit to existence has been destroyed now there is no more renewed existence
This is what the Blessed One said
Having said this the Fortunate One the Teacher further said this
Because of not seeing as they are The Four Noble Truths
We have wandered through the long course In the various kinds of births
Now these truths have been seen The conduit to existence is severed
Cut off is the root of suffering Now there is no more renewed existence
Bhikkhus these four things are actual unerring not other wise
This is suffering this bhikkhus is actual unerring not otherwise  This is the origin of suffering this is actual unerring not otherwise  This is the cessation of suffering  this is actual unerring not otherwise  This is the way leading to the cesation of suffering  this is actual unerring not otherwise  These four things bhikkhus are actual unerring not otherwise
Therefore bhikkhu an exertion should be made to understand This is suffering  An exertion should be made to understand This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering
What four 
For one who knows what for one who sees what does the destruction of the taints come about 
The destruction of the taints comes about for one who knows and sees This is suffering for one who knows and sees This is the origin of suffering for one who knows and sees This is the cessation of suffering for one who knows and sees This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering 
It is for one who knows thus for one who sees thus that the destruction of the taints comes about 
Therefore bhikkhus an exertion should be made to understand This is suffering   An exertion should be made to understand This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering 
Bhikkhus I say that the destruction of the taints is for one who knows and sees not for one who does not know and does not see
At Savatthi
Bhikkhus whatever Arahants Perfectly Enlightened Ones in the past fully awakened to things as they really are all fully awakened to the Four Noble Truths as they really are
Whatever Arahants Perfectly Enlightened Ones in the future will fully awaken to things as they really are all will fully awaken to the Four Noble Truths as they really are
Whatever Arahants Perfectly Enlightened Ones at present have fully awakened to things as they really are all have fully awakened to the Four Noble Truths as they really are
What four
The noble truth of suffering the noble truth of the origin of suffering the noble truth of the cessation of suffering the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering
Whatever Arahants Perfectly Enlightened Ones fully awakened  will fully awaken  have fully awakened to things as they really are all have fully awakened to these Four Noble Truths as they really are
Therefore bhikkhus an exertion should be made to understand This is suffering  An exertion should be made to understand This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambi in a simsapa grove
Then the Blessed One took up a few simsaplf leaves in his hand and addressed the bhikkhus thus What do you think bhikkhus which is more numerous these few simsapa leaves that I have taken up in my hand or those in the simsapa grove overhead 
Venerable sir the simsapa leaves that the Blessed One has taken up in his hand are few but those in the simsapa grove overhead are numerous
Sotoo bhikkhus the things I have directly known but have not taught you are numerous while the things I have taught you are few
And why bhikkhus have I not taught those many things
Because they are unbeneficial irrelevant to the fundamentals of the holy life and do not lead to revulsion to dispassion to cessation to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana Therefore I have not taught them
And what bhikkhus have I taught
I have taught This is suffering I have taught This is the origin of suffering I have taught This is the cessation of suffering I have taught This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering
And why bhikkhus have I taught this
Because this is beneficial relevant to the fundamentals of the holy life and leads to revulsion to dispassion to cessation to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana Therefore I have taught this
Therefore bhikkhus an exertion should be made to understand This is suffering  An exertion should be made to understand This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering 
Bhikkhus if anyone should speak thus Without having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of suffering as it really is without having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of the origin of suffering as it really is without having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of the cessation of suffering as it really is without having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering as it really is I will completely make an end to suffering  this is impossible
Just as bhikkhus if someone should speak thus Having made a basket of acacia leaves or of pine needles or of myrobalan leavesI will bring water or a palm fruit this would be impossible so too if anyone should speak thus Without having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of sufferingas it really is  I will completely make an end to suffering this is impossible
But bhikkhus if anyone should speak thus Having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of suffering as it really is having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of the origin of suffering as it really is having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of the cessation of suffering as it really is having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering as it really is I will completely make an end to suffering  this is possible
Just as bhikkhus if someone should speak thus Having a basket of lotus leaves or of kino leaves or of maluva leaves I will bring water or a palm fruit  this would be possible so too if anyone should speak thus Having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of sufferingas it really is  I will completely make an end to suffering  this is possible
Therefore bhikkhus an exertion should be made to understand This is sufferingAn exertionshould be made to understand This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering 
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha on Mount Vulture Peak
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Come bhikkhus let us go to Patibhana Peak for the days abiding
Yes venerable sir those bhikkhus replied
Then the Blessed One together with a number of bhikkhus went to Patibhana Peak
A certain bhikkhu saw the steep precipice off
Patibhiina Peak and said to the Blessed One That precipice is indeed steep venerable sir that precipice is extremely frightful
But is there venerable sir any other precipice steeper and more frightful than that one 
There is bhikkhu
But what venerable sir is that precipice steeper and more frightful than that one 
Those ascetics and brahmnins bhikkhu who do not understand as it really is This is suffering who do not understand as it really is This is the origin of suffering who do not understand as it really is This is the cessationof suffering who do not understand as it really is This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering  they delight in volitional formations that lead to birth in volitional formations that lead to aging in volitional formations that lead to death in volitional formations that lead to sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair
Delighting in such volitional formationsthey generate volitional formations that lead to birth generate volitional formations that lead to aging generate volitional formations that lead to death generate volitional formations that lead to sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair
Having generated such volitional formations they tumble down the precipice of birth tumble down the precipice of aging tumble down the precipice of death tumble down the precipice of sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair
But bhikkhu those ascetics and brahmins who understand as it really is This is suffering  This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering  they do not delight in volitional formations that lead to birth nor in volitional formations that lead to aging nor in volitional formations that lead to death nor in volitional formations that lead to sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair
Not delighting in such volitional formations they do not generate volitional formations that lead to birth nor generate volitional formations that lead to aging nor generate volitional formations that lead to death nor generate volitional formations that lead to sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair
Not having generated such volitional formations they do not tumble down the precipice of birth nor tumble down the precipice of aging nor tumble down the precipice of death nor tumble down the precipice of sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair
They are freed from birth aging and death freed from sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair
Therefore bhikkhus an exertion should be made to understand This is suffering  An exertion should be made to understand This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering
They are not freed from birth aging and death not freed from sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair
not freed from suffering I say
freed from suffering I say
On one occasion the Venerable Sariputta was dwelling in Magadha at Nalakagama
Then the wanderer Jambukhadaka approached the Venerable Sariputta and exchanged greetings with him

he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Sariputta

What now is arahantship
The destruction of lust the destruction of hatred the destruction of delusion this friend is called arahantship
But friend is there a path is there a way for the realization of this arahantship
There is a path friend there is a way for the realization of this arahantship

It is friend this Noble Eightfold Path that is right view  right concentration
This is the path friend this is the way for the realization of this arahantship

Thus have I heard At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
and those monks were receptive and attentive concentrating their whole mind intent on listening to the Dhamma
Then on realizing its significance the Blessed One on that occasion uttered this inspired utterance
There is monks that base where there is neither earth nor water nor heat nor air neither the base of the infinity of space nor the base of the infinity of consciousness nor the base of nothingness nor the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception neither this world nor another world neither sun nor moon
Here monks I say there is no coming no going no standing still no passing away and no being reborn It is not established not moving without support
Just this is the end of suffering
Now on that occasion the Blessed One was instructing rousing inspiring and gladdening the monks with a Dhamma talk connected with Nibbana
Thus have I heard At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Now on that occasion the Blessed One was instructing  the monks with a Dhamma talk connected with Nibbana and those monks were receptive
 intent on listening to the Dhamma
Then on realizing its significance the Blessed One on that occasion uttered this inspired utterance
There is monks an unborn unbecome unmade unconditioned
If monks there were no unborn unbecome unmade unconditioned no escape would be discerned from what is born become made conditioned
But because there is an unborn unbecome unmade unconditioned therefore an escape is discerned from what is born become made conditioned
There are monks these two Nibbana elements
What are the two
The Nibbana element with residue remaining and the Nibbana element without residue remaining
And what monks is the Nibbana element with residue remaining
Here a monk is an arahant one whose taints are destroyed who has lived the holy life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached his own goal utterly destroyed the fetters of existence one completely liberated through final knowledge
However his five sense faculties remain unimpaired by which he still experiences what is agreeable and disagreeable still feels pleasure and pain
It is the destruction of lust hatred and delusion in him that is called the Nibbana element with residue remaining
And what monks is the Nibbana element without residue remaining
Here a monk is an arahant  one completely liberated through final knowledge
For him here in this very life all that is felt not being delighted in will become cool right here
That monks is called the Nibbana element without residue remaining
These monks are the two Nibbana elements
Bhikkhus these eight persons are worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation an unsurpassed field of merit for the world
What eight
The streamenterer the one practicing for realization of the fruit of streamentry the oncereturner the one practicing for realization of the fruit of oncereturning the nonreturner the one practicing for realization of the fruit of nonreturning the arahant the one practicing for realization of the fruit of arahantship
These eight persons bhikkhus are worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation an unsurpassed field of merit for the world
The four practicing the way and the four established in the fruit
this is the upright Sahgha composed in wisdom and virtuous behavior
For people intent on sacrifice for living beings seeking merit
making merit that ripens in the acquisitions what is given to the Sahgha bears great fruit
Bhikkhus there are these five faculties
What five
The faculty of faith  the faculty of wisdom
These are the five faculties One who has completed and fulfilled these five facultiesis an arahant If they are weaker than that one is practising for the realization of the fruit of arahantship if still weaker one is a nonreturner if still weaker one is practising for the realization of the fruit of  nonreturnine if still weaker one is a oncereturner if still weaker one is practising for the realization of the fruit of oncereturning if still weaker one is a streamenterer if still weaker one is practising for the realization of the fruit of streamentry
But bhikkhus I say that one in whom these five faculties are completely and totally absent is an outsider one who stand the faction of worldlings 
Then the Venerable Sariputta approached the Blessed One paid homage to him and sat down to one side
The Blessed One then said to him Sariputta this is said A factor for streamentry a factor for streamentry
What now Sariputta is a factor for streamentry 
Good good Sariputta
Association with superior persons Sariputta is a tactor for streamentry Hearing the true Dhamma is a factor for streamentry Careful attention is a factor for streamentry Practice in accordance with the Dhamma is a factor for streamentry
Sariputta this is said The stream the stream
What now Sariputta is the stream 
This Noble Eightfold Path venerable sir is the stream that is right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effortright mindfulness right concentration
Good good Sariputta
This Noble Eightfold Path is the stream that is right view  right concentration
Sriputta this is said A streamenterer a streamenterer
What now Sariputtais a streamenterer 
One who possesses this Noble Eightfold Path venerable sir is called a streamenterer this venerable one of such a name and clan
Good good Sariputta
One who possesses this Noble Eightfold Path is a streamenterer this venerable one of such a name and clan
Association with superior persons venerable sir is a factor for streamentry Hearing the true Dhamma is a factor for streamentry Careful attention is a factor for streamentry Practice in accordance with the Dhamma is a factor for streamentry
At Savatthi
There the Blessed One said this Bhikkhus although a wheelturning monarch having exercised supreme sovereign rulership over the four continents with the breakup of the body after death is reborn in a good destination in a heavenly world in the company of the devas of the Tavatimsa realm and there in the Nandana Grove accompanied by a retinue of celestial nymphs he enjoys himself supplied and endowed with the five cords of celestial sensual pleasure still as he does not possess four things he is not freed from hell the animal realm and the domain of ghosts not freed from the plane of misery the bad destinations the nether world
Although bhikkhus a noble disciple maintains himself by lumps of almsfood and wears ragrobesstill as he possesses four things he is freed from hell the animal realm and the domain of ghosts freed from the plane of misery the bad destinationsthe nether world
What are the four
Here bhikkhus the noble disciple possesses confirmed confidence in the Buddha thus The Blessed One is an arahant perfectly enlightened accomplished in true knowledge and conduct fortunate knower of the world unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed teacher of devas and humans the Enlightened One the Blessed One
He possesses confirmed confidencein the Dhamma thus The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One directly visible immediate inviting one to come and see applicable to be Personally experienced by the wise
Hepossesses confirmed confidence in the Sangha thus The sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practising the good way practising the straight way practising the true way practising the proper way that is the four pairs of persons the eight types of individualsthis Sarigha of the Blessed Ones disciples is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation the unsurpassed field of merit for the world
He possesses these four things
And bhikkhus between the obtaining of sovereignty over the four continents and the obtaining of the four things the obtaining of sovereignty over the four continents is not worth a sixteenth part of the obtaining of the four things
He possesses the virtues dear to the noble onesunbroken untorn unblemished unmottled freeing praised by the wise ungrasped leading to concentration
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrel Sanctuary
Now on that occasion the lay follower Dighavu was sick afflicted gravely ill
Then the lay follower Dighavu addressed his father the householder jotika thus Come householder approach the Blessed One pay homage to him in my name with your head at his feet and say Venerable sir the lay follower Dighavu is sick afflictedgravely ill
Then say It would be good venerable sir if the Blessed One would come to the residence of the lay follower Dighavu out of compassion 
Yes dear the householder Jotika replied and he approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one side and delivered his message
The Blessed One consented by silence
Then the Blessed One dressed and taking bowl and robe went to the residence of the lay follower Dighavu He then sat down in the appointed seat and said to the lay follower Dighavu
I hope you are bearing up Dighavu I hope you are getting better
I hope your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing and that their subsiding not their increase is to be discerned
Venerable sir I am not bearing up I am not getting better
Strong painful feelings are increasing in me not subsiding and their increase not their subsiding is to be discerned
Therefore Dighavu you should train yourself thus I will be one who possesses confirmed confidence in the Buddha thus The Blessed One is  teacher of devas and humans the Enlightened One the Blessed One
I will be one who possesses confirmed confidence in the Dhamma in the Sangha I will be one who possesses the virtues dear to the noble ones unbroken  leading to concentration
It is in such a way that You should train yourself
Venerable sir as to these four factors of streamentry that have been taught by the Blessed One these things exist in me and I live in conformity with those things
For venerable sir I possess confirmed confidence in the Buddha 
in the Dhamma  in the Sangha I possess the virtues dear to the noble ones unbroken  leading to concentration
Therefore Dighavu established upon these four factors streamentry you should develop further six things that partake of true knowledge
Venerable sir as to these six things that partake of true knowledge that have been taught by the Blessed One these things exist in me and I live in conformity with those things
For venerable sir I dwell contemplating impermanencein all formations perceiving suffering in what is impermanent perceiving nonself in what is suffering perceiving abandonment perceiving fading away perceiving cessation
However venerable sir the thought occurs to me After I am gone may this householder Jotika not fall into distress 
Dont be concerned about this dear Dighavu
Come now dear Dighgvu pay close attention to what the Blessed One is saying to you
Then the Blessed One having given this exhortation to the lay follower Dighavu rose from his seat and departed
Thennot long after the Blessed One had left the lay follower Dighavu died
Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one side
What is his destination what is his future bourn 
Bhikkhus the lay follower Dighavu was wise He practised in accordance with the Dhamma and did not trouble me on account of the Dhamma
Bhikkhus with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters the lay follower Dighavu has become one of spontaneous birth due to attain Nibbana there without returning from that world
he pays homage to the Blessed One with his head at the Blessed Ones feet
Here Dighavu dwell contemplating impermanence in all formations perceiving suffering in what is impermanent perceiving nonself in what is sufferingperceiving abandonment perceiving fading away perceiving cessation
It is in such a way that you should train yourself
and said to the Blessed One Venerable sir that lay follower named Dighavu to whom the Blessed One gave a brief exhortation has died
Bhikkhus those bhikkhus who are accomplished in virtue acomplished in concentration accomplishedin wisdom accomplished in liberation accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation even the sight of those bhikkhus is helpful I say even listening to them even approaching them even attending on them even recollecting them even going forth after them is helpful I say
For what reason
Because when one has heard the Dhamma from such bhikkhus one dwells withdrawn by way of two kinds of withdrawalwithdrawal of body and withdrawal of mind
Dwelling thus withdrawn one recollects that Dhamma and thinks it over
Dwelling thus mindfully he discriminates that Dhamma with wisdom examines it makes an investigation of it
Whenever bhikkhus a bhikkhu dwelling thus mindfully discriminates that Dhamma with wisdom examines it makes an investigation of it on that occasion the enlightenment factor of discrimination of states is aroused by the bhikkhu on that occasion the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of discrimination of states on that occasion the enlightenment factor of discrimination of states comes to fulfilment by development in the bhikkhu
While he discriminates that Dhamma with wisdom examines it makes an investigation of it his energy is aroused without slackening
Whenever bhikkhus a bhikkhus energy is aroused without slackening as he discriminates that Dhamma with wisdom examines it makes an investigation of it on that occasion the enlightenment factor of energy is aroused by the bhikkhu on that occasion the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of energy on that occasion the enlightenment factor of energy comes to fulfilment by development in the bhikkhu
When his energy is aroused there arises in him spiritual rapture
Whenever bhikkhus spiritual rapture arises in a bhikkhu whose energy is aroused on that occasion the enlightenment factor of rapture is aroused by the bhikkhu on that occasion the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of rapture on that occasion the enlightenment factor of rapture comes to fullfiment by development in the bhikkhu
For one whose mind is uplifted by rapture the body becomes tranquil and the mind becomes tranquil
Whenever bhikkhus the body becomes tranquil and the mind becomes tranquil in bhikkhu whose mind is uplifted by rapture on that occasion the enlightenment factor of tranquillity is aroused by the bhikkhu on that occasion the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of tranquillity on that occasion the enlightenment factor of tranquillity comes to fulfilment by development in the bhikkhu
For one whose body is tranquil and who is happy the mind becomes concentrated
Whenever bhikkhus a bhikkhu closely looks on with equanimity at the mind thus concentrated on that occasion the enlightenment factor of equanimity is aroused by the bhikkhu on that occasion the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of equanimity on that occasion the enlightenment factor of equanimity comes to fulfilment by development in the bhikkhu
Bhikkhus when these seven factors of enlightenment have been developed and cultivated in this way seven fruits and benefits may be expected
What are the seven fruits and benefits
One attains final knowledge early in this very life
If one does not attain final knowledge early in this very life or at the time of death then with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters one becomes an attainer of Nibbana in the interval
If one does not attain final knowledge early in this very life or become an attainer of Nibbana in the interval then with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters one becomes an attainer of Nibbana upon landing
If one does not attain final knowledge early in this very life or become an attainer of Nibbana upon landing then with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters one becomes an I attainer of Nibbana without exertion
If one does not attain final knowledge early in this very life or become an attainer of Nibbana without exertion then with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters one becomes an attainer of Nibbana with exertion
If one does not attain final knowledge early in this very life or become an attainer of Nibbana with exertion then with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters one becomes one bound upstream heading towards the Akanittha realm
When bhikkhus the seven factors of enlightenment have been developed and cultivated in this way these seven fruits and benefits may be expected
Whenever bhikkhus a bhikkhu dwelling thus withdrawn recollects that Dhamma and thinks it over on that occasion the enlightenment factor of mindfulness is aroused by the bhikkhu on that occasion the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness on that occasion the enlightenment factor of mindfulness comes to fulfilment by development in the bhikkhu
Whenever bhikkhus the mind becomes concentrated in a bhikkhu whose body is tranquil and who is happy on that occasion the enlightenment factor of concentration is aroused by the bhikkhu on that occasion the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of concentration on that occasion the enlightenment factor of concentration comes to fulfilment by development in the bhikkhu
He closely looks on with equanimity at the mind thus concentrated
If one does not attain final knowledge early in this very life then one attains final knowledge at the time of death
When it is said the Exalted One was dwelling at Rājagaha in Jīvaka Komārabhaccas Mango Grove the meaning should be understood thus he was living in Jīvaka Komārabhaccas Mango Grove which was near Rājagaha
He was brought to the palace and nurtured by the royal nursemaids
When they saw that the baby was still living they gave him the name Jīvaka
Thus as he was raised by the prince they gave him the name Komārabhacca
The story of Jīvaka is related at length in the Khandhakas
and explained in the Samantapāsādikā the commentary to the Vinaya
Once when the Exalted Ones body was afflicted by a disorder of the humors Jīvaka treated him with a purgative He then gave the Buddha a pair of Siveyyaka cloths   and at the conclusion of the thanksgiving talk for the cloths he was established in the fruit of streamentry Thereupon he thought I should go to wait upon the Buddha two or three times a day but the Bamboo Grove is too far away My park the Mango Grove is closer Let me build a dwelling there for the Exalted One
He set up night quarters dayquarters caves huts pavilions etc built a Fragrant Cottage suitable for the Exalted One and erected a coppercolored wall eighteen yards high surrounding the Mango Grove He treated the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha to an offering of a meal and robes and after pouring the giftwater presented the dwelling
King Ajātasattu of Magadha The astrologers predicted Even while he is as yet unborn  he will be the kings enemy  thus Ajātasattu unborn enemy
The king asked her Dear your body has become pallid What is the reason
 Do not ask great king
Dear if you dont express your thoughts to me to whom will you express them Urging her in various ways he convinced her to speak
Having heard he said Dear why do you regard this as terrible  He then sent for his physician had him make an incision in his arm with a golden knife collected the blood in a golden vessel mixed it with water and made her drink it
The astrologers hearing this declared This child in her womb will be the kings enemyHe will kill the king
She went again and again and did the same thing
The king inquired Why do you go to the park so often  Having learned the reason he said Dear we do not even know whether you have a son or a daughter in your womb If we do this to a child begotten by ourselves a great calamity will appear in our land of IndiaDo not do so Having thus dissuaded her he set a guard over her
When the child took birth she thought I will kill him
Some time later after the prince had attained to growth they showed him to the queen
When she saw him maternal affection arose within her and she could not have him killed
Eventually the king appointed his son viceroy
One time Devadatta while in seclusion thought to himself Sāriputta has an assembly of followers Mahāmoggallāna has an assembly of followers Mahākassapa has an assembly of followers Thus each of these maintains his own followingI too will gather a following
He considered It wont be possible to acquire an assembly without gainSo let me obtain gain Then as related in the Khandhakas by means of the miracle of supernormal power he won the confidence of Prince Ajātasattu The prince came to wait upon him morning and evening with five hundred chariots Aware of his great trust one day Devadatta approached the prince and said In the past O prince men lived long now they are shortlivedTherefore prince you should kill your father and become the king I will kill the Exalted One and become the Buddha Thus he enjoined the prince to kill his father
The prince thought Master Devadatta has great spiritual powerThere is nothing he does not know He fastened a dagger to his thigh and entered the inner palace in the middle of the day but being fearful apprehensive alarmed and anxious he muddled up the instructions he was given by Devadatta and the ministers arrested him and examined him
They disputed whether the prince should be killed along with Devadatta and all the bhikkhus in Devadattas assembly Deciding to do whatever the king commanded they reported the matter to the king
The king demoted those ministers who wanted to kill the prince and Devadatta and promoted those ministers who did not want to kill them He asked the prince Prince why do you want to kill me
I want your kingdom your majesty
When the prince reported to Devadatta that his wish had been granted
Then what should I do venerable sir 
Cut off the root Kill him
But isnt it true venerable sir that my father should not be killed by a weapon
He said Do not let anyone see him except my mother
The queen put rice in a golden vessel and entered bringing the vessel on her hip
Again the prince asked how he lived and having learned how he ordered Do not let her enter wearing shoes
Again the prince asked and having heard the report he ordered From now on prevent my mother from entering
From then on the king did not receive any food
His body became extremely radiant
The prince asked Father how do you continue to live Learning that he continued to live by walking back and forth and seeing that this body had become extremely radiant the prince thought Now I will prevent him from walking back and forth He ordered his barbers Cut open my fathers feet with a razor smear them with salt and oil and roast them over flameless coals of acacia wood
He asked Why have you come here They reported their instructions
He said You should do what your king commands They asked him to sit down bowed to him and said Your majesty we are doing what the king has ordered us to do Do not be angry at usThis isnt proper for a righteous king such as yourself Then with the left hand they grabbed his ankles with the right they took a razor cut open his feet smeared them with salt and oil and roasted them over flameless coals of acacia wood
 the king experienced severe pain
While recollecting the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha he withered up like a garland of flowers thrown upon the terrace of a cetiya and was reborn in the heavenly world of the Four Great Kings as a spirit named Janavasabha in the retinue of Vessavaṇa
That same day a son was born to Ajātasattu Two letters reached him simultaneously one telling him of the birth of his son the other of his fathers death
The ministers thinking First we will report to him the birth of his son handed him that letter
The moment love for his newborn son arose in the king shook his entire body and penetrated through to the marrow of his bones
At that moment he understood what it means to be a fatherRealizing When I was born my own father felt such love for me
They said How can we release him your majesty and handed him the other letter
As soon as he learned the news he went weeping to his mother and asked her Mother did my father feel love for me when I was born
 She said Foolish son what are you saying When you were a child you had a small boil on your finger
You kept on weeping and they couldnt quiet you down so they took you to your father who was sitting in the judgement hall
Your father put your finger in his mouth
He couldnt spit out the pus and blood so out of love for you he swallowed them
Devadatta then approached Ajātasattu and told the king to order some men to assassinate the Buddha He sent the men given to him  Then Devadatta ascended Vultures Peak himself and with a sling hurled a rock at the Buddha  He even had the elephant Nālāgiri let loose  but no matter what method he used he could not kill the Exalted One When his gains and honor had been lost he asked the Buddha to accept his five proposals  The Buddha did not agree and Devadatta thought to use those points to win over the people He created a schism in the Sangha but Sāriputta and Moggallāna went to his residence won back his followers for the Buddha and returned leading them away When he learned this he vomited hot blood For nine months Devadatta lay on the sickbed after which he was filled with remorse He asked Where is the Teacher now staying When they told him that the Buddha was staying at the Jetavana monastery he said Then take me by my bed and let me see the Teacher But because he had performed kamma which disqualified him from seeing the Exalted One while he was being carried right beside the lotus pond in the Jetavana monastery the earth split open and he fell in and landed in the Great Hell
This is a brief account
King Ajāsattu was sitting on the upper terrace of his palace Why was the king sitting there
For from the day he killed his father whenever he went to bed as soon as he closed his eyes he felt as if he had been struck by a hundred spears and woke up crying
Thus sleep became repugnant to him and he was sitting there in order to ward off sleep
What recluse or brahmin should we visit tonight By this entire statement the king gives a hint
To whom does he give it
To Jīvaka
For what purpose
In order to see the Exalted One
But couldnt he go to the Exalted One on his own
No he could not
Why
Because of his great crimes
For his own father whom he had killed was a noble disciple and a supporter of the Exalted One and he himself had supported Devadatta who had done much harm to the Exalted One Thus he had committed great crimes and because of these he could not go to the Exalted One on his own
But Jīvaka was a supporter of the Exalted One so he gave him a hint thinking I will see the Exalted One like his shadow
Yes he understood
Then why did he remain silent
In order to avoid being interrupted
For he thought In this assembly there are present many who are supporters of the six teachers Since the teachers on whom they attend are untrained they themselves are not properly trained
If I should begin to speak about the virtues of the Exalted One they would rise up interrupt me and speak about the virtues of their own teachers Thus I would not be able to complete my talk on the virtues of the Teacher
But as the king has already approached the teachers whom they support he will not be satisfied with their account of virtues knowing such talk to be substanceless Then he will question meWithout being interrupted I will explain the virtues of the Teacher and take the king along with me to meet him Thus though he understood  he remained silent in order to avoid being interrupted
The ministers thought Today the king extols the night in five ways Surely he wishes to approach some recluse or brahmin question him and hear his Dhamma He will show great honor to the whose Dhamma inspires his confidenceAnd it will be fortunate for the one whose recluse wins the support of the royal family
Having such aims in mind each of the ministers thought I will praise the recluse I support and go taking the king along with me Thus each one began to praise the recluse he personally supported
Pūraṇa Kassapa Pūraṇa was the name of this teacher
Kassapa his clan
He was given the name Pūraṇa  it is said because he was born into a family consisting of ninety nine slaves thus fulfilling the auspicious number 
He thought to himself Why should I stay here and he fled
Thieves stole his clothes Not knowing how to cover himself with leaves or grass he entered a village naked
People saw him and thought This recluse is an arahat with few wishesThere is no one like him They approached him bringing cakes rice etc
thus it is said Pūraṇa Kassapa the leader of an order etc
Though dissatisfied he remained silent and tolerated that talk as displeasing as it was to him for he realized If I scold that minister and order him to be grabbed by his neck and expelled the others will become afraid that the same fate will befall them and no one will say anything
Makkhali Gosāla Makkhali was his name
his second name Gosāla derives from the fact that he was born in the village of GosālaOthers however say that he was born in a cowshed
His master pursued him and grabbed the edge of his cloak
He discarded the cloak and fled without clothes
The rest is the same as in the story of Pūraṇa
Ajita Kesakambala Ajita was his name
and he wore a hair blanket 
A hairblanket is a blanket made out of human hair
As the Buddha says Bhikkhus whatever woven articles of clothing there are the hairblanket is considered the most repulsive of these
Pakudha Kaccāyana Pakudha was his name
Kaccāyana his clan
He refused to use cool water Even after moving his bowels he did not wash with cool water but only with warm water or oilIf he passed through a river or a puddle of water on the path he thought My moral discipline has been broken He then reestablished his moral discipline by building a mound of sand and continued on his way
He held the theory of bad luck 
Sañjaya Belatthaputta His name was Sañjaya
he was the son of Belattha thus Belatthaputta
Nigaṇtha NātaputtaHe is called Nigaṇtha because he proclaimed the doctrine We have no knots of defilements no ties of defilements we are free from the bonds of defilements
The name Jīvaka Komāra bhacca means a living person who has been raised by a prince
For as a baby he was found abandoned surrounded by crows
It is said that when he was still in his mothers womb the queen developed the compulsive urge to drink blood from the kings right armShe considered This compulsive urge that has arisen is terrible I should not report it to anyone Being unable to express it she became thin and pale
The queen heard this and thought They say that when the child comes out from my belly he will kill the king Wishing to have an abortion she went to the park and had her belly trampled upon but abortion did not take place
but guards took the child away from her
The king gave him his kingdom
Devadatta said Like a man who beats the kettledrums after caging a jackal you imagine you have finished your workWithin a few days your father considering the contempt you have shown him will himself become king
 Then kill him by cutting off his food
The prince had his father thrown into the torture chamber a smokehouse built for the purpose of inflicting punishment
The king ate the rice and continued to live
The prince asked him My father how do you continue to live Having learned how he ordered Do not let my mother enter bringing anything on her hip
From then on the queen entered putting the vessel in her topknot
Having learned about this he ordered Do not let her enter with her hair bound in a topknot
Then she put rice inside a pair of golden shoes sealed the shoes put them on and entered
In this way the king continued to live
From then on the queen bathed with scented water anointed her body with the four sweets curd honey ghee and molasses dressed and entered
The king continued to live by licking her body
The queen stood behind the door and cried out O my husband Bimbisāra You did not let me kill him in his infancy You yourself nurtured your own enemy This is the last time I will see you From now on I will never see you again If I have done anything wrong please forgive me my lord  Weeping and wailing she departed
but continued to live by walking back and forth in the happiness of the path and fruit 
When the king saw the barbers he thought Someone must have informed my son they have come to trim my beard
They went to him bowed down before him and stood up
he said Go men release my father
and the boil broke open right in his mouth
Such was your fathers love for you
Weeping and lamenting he disposed of his fathers body
a detailed account is related in the Khandhakas 
Thus the king was named Ajātasattu because the astrologers predicted Even while he is as yet unborn he will be the kings enemy
In order to ward off sleep
When asked what the trouble was he answered Nothing
The king uttered the following joyful exclamation As oil which cannot be contained in its barrel spills over and is called an oil slick as water which cannot be contained in a tank inundates the land and is called a flood so when the heart cannot contain a joyous statement the statement becomes excessively strong and unable to remain within it comes out as speech That is called a joyful exclamation 
Did Jīvaka understand that the king was giving him a hint
Because he was an auspicious slave no one ever told him This is well done or This is badly done This should be done or This has not been done
From then on even when he gained a cloak he did not wear it aware It is because I go about without clothes that I received this cloak He took his nakedness as his going forth  Various groups of fivehundred men went forth under him
King Ajātasattu remained silent As a man wishing to eat a sweet golden colored mango would become dissatisfied if a bitter kājara fruit were brought and placed in his hand so the king wishing to hear sweet Dhamma talk concerning such virtues as the jhānas and modes of direct knowledge and stamped with the three characteristics now became extremely dissatisfied with this talk about the virtues of Pūraṇa as he had previously seen this teacher and was dissatisfied with him even then Thus he remained silent
But since he remained silent another minister thinking I will praise the recluse I myself support started to speak
It is said that he was carrying a pot of oil across muddy ground when his master called out Do not stumble  dear
Due to carelessness he stumbled and fell Afraid of his master he started to flee
there is no article of clothing more repulsive than that
A hairblanket is cold in cold weather hot in hot weather ugly foulsmelling and uncomfortable to the touch 
He was the son of Nāta thus Nātaputta
On one occasion a number of elder bhikkhus were dwelling at Kosambi in Ghositas Park
Now on that occasion the Venerable Khemaka was living at Jujube Tree Park sick afflicted gravely ill
Then in the evening those elder bhikkhus emerged from seclusion and addressed the Venerable Dasaka thus Come friend Dasaka approach the bhikkhu Khemaka and say to him The elders say to you friend Khemaka We hope that you are bearing up friend we hope that you are getting better We hope that your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing and that their subsiding not their increase is to be discerned
Yes friends the Venerable Dasaka replied and he approached the Venerable Khemaka and delivered his message
The Venerable Khemaka answered I am not bearing up friend I am not getting better Strong painful feelings are increasing in me not subsiding and their increase not their subsiding is to be discerned
Then the Venerable Dasaka approached the elder bhikkhus and reported what the Venerable Khemaka had said
They told him Come friend Dasaka approach the bhikkhu Khemaka and say to himThe elders say to you friend Khemaka These five aggregates subject to clinging friend have been spoken of by the Blessed One that is the form aggregate subject to clinging the feeling aggregate subject to clinging the perception aggregate subject to clinging the volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging
Does the Venerable Khemaka regard anything as self or as belonging to self among these five aggregates subject to clinging 
Yes friends the Venerable Dasaka replied and he approached the Venerable Khemaka and delivered his message
The Venerable Khemaka replied These five aggregates subject to clinging have been spoken of by the Blessed One that is the form aggregate subject to clinging  the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging
Among these five aggregates subject to clinging I do not regard anything as self or as belonging to self
Then the Venerable Dasaka approached the elder bhikkhus and reported what the Venerable Khemaka had said
They replied Come friend Dasaka approach the bhikkhu Khemaka and say to him The elders say to you friend Khemaka These five aggregates subject to clinging friend have been spoken of by the Blessed One that is the form aggregate subject to clinging  the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging
If the Venerable Khemaka does not regard anything among these five aggregates subject to clinging as self or as belonging to self
then he is an arahant one whose taints are destroyed
Yes friends the Venerable Dasaka replied and he approached the Venerable Khemaka and delivered his message
The Venerable Khemaka replied These five aggregates subject to clinging have been spoken of by the Blessed One that is the form aggregate subject to clinging  the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging
I do not regard anything among these five aggregates subject to clinging as self or as belonging to self yet I am not an arahant one whose taints are destroyed Friends the notion I am has not yet vanished in me in relation to these five aggregates subject to clinging but I do not regard anything among them as This I am
Then the Venerable Dasaka approached the elder bhikkhus and reported what the Venerable Khemaka had said
They replied Come friend Dasaka approach the bhikkhu Khemaka and say to him The elders say to you friend Khemaka Friend Khemaka when you speak of this I amwhat is it that you speak of as I am
Yes friends the Venerable Dasaka replied and he approached the Venerable Khemaka and delivered his message
Enough friend Dasaka Why keep running back and forth
Then the Venerable Khemaka leaning on his staffapproached the elder bhikkhus exchanged greetings with them and sat down to one side
The elder bhikkhus then said to him
Friends I do not speak of form as I am nor do I speak of I am apart from form
I do not speak of feeling as I am  nor of perception as I am  nor of volitional formations as I am  nor of consciousness as I am nor do I speak of I am apart from consciousness
Friends although the notion I am has not yet vanished in me in relation to these five aggregates subject to clinging still I do not regard anything among them as Thus I am
Suppose friends there is the scent of a blue red or white lotus
Would one be speaking rightly if one would say The scent belongs to the petals or The scent belongs to the stalk nor The scent belongs to the pistils 
No friend
And how friends should one answer if one is to answer rightly 
Answering rightly friend one should answer The scent belongs to the flower 
So too friends I do not speak of form as I am nor do I speak of I am apart from form
I do not speak of feeling as I am  nor of perception as I am  nor of volitional formations as I am  nor of consciousness as I am nor do I speak of I am apart from consciousness
Friends although the notion I am has not yet vanished in me in relation to these five aggregates subject to clinging still I do not regardanything among them as This I am
Friends even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters still in relation to the five aggregates subject to clinging there lingers in him a residual conceit I am a desire I am an underlying tendency I am that has not yet been uprooted
Sometime later he dwells contemplating rise and fall in the five aggregates subject to clinging Such is form such its origin such its passing away such is feeling  such is perception  such are volitional formations  such is consciousness such its origin such its passing away
As he dwells thus contemplating rise and fall in the five aggregates subject to clinging the residual conceit I am the desire I am the underlying tendency I am that had not yet been uprootedthis comes to be uprooted
Suppose friends a cloth has become soiled and stained
and its owners give it to a laundryman
The laundryman would scour it evenly with cleaning salt lye or cowdung and rinse it in clean water
Even though that cloth would become pure and clean it would still retain a residual smell of cleaning salt lye or cowdung that had not yet vanished
So too friends even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters still in relation to the five aggregates subject to clinging there lingers in him a residual conceit I am a desire I am an underlying tendency I am that has not yet been uprooted
When this was said the elder bhikkhus said to the Venerable Khemaka We did not ask our questions in order to trouble the Venerable Khemaka but we thought that the Venerable Khemaka would be capable of explaining teaching proclaiming establishing disclosing analysing and elucidating the Blessed Ones teaching in detail
And the Venerable Khemaka has explained taught proclaimed established disclosed analysed and elucidated the Blessed Ones teaching in detail
This is what the Venerable Khemaka said
Elated the elder bhikkhus delighted in the Venerable Khemakas statement
Bring me my staff friend Ill go to the elder bhikkhus myself
Friend Khemakawhen you speak of this I am 
The owners would put it in a sweetscented basket
The laundryman would then give it back to the owners
and the residual smell of cleaning salt lye or cowdung that had not yet vanished would vanish
As he dwells thus contemplating rise and fall in the five aggregates subject to clinging the residual conceit I am the desire I am the underlying tendency I am that had not yet been uprootedthis comes to be uprooted
And while this discourse was being spoken the minds of sixty elder bhikkhus and of the Venerable Khemaka were liberated from the taints by nonclinging
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambi in Ghositas Park
There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus is there a method by means of which a bhikkhu who is a trainee standing on the plane of a trainee might understand I am a trainee while a bhikkhu who is one beyond training standing on the plane of one beyond training might understand I am one beyond training 
Venerable sir our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One
There is a method bhikkhus by means of which a bhikkhu who is a trainee  might understand I am a trainee while a bhikkhu who is one beyond training  might understand I am one beyond training
And what bhikkhus is the method by means of which a bhikkhu who is a trainee standing on the plane of a trainee understands I am a trainee Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu who is a trainee understands as it really is This is suffering he understands as it really is This is the origin of suffering he understands as it really is This is the cessation of suffering he understands as it really is This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering This is a method means of which a bhikkhu who is a traineestanding on the plane of a trainee understands I am a trainee
Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu who is a trainee considers thus Is there outside here another ascetic or brahmin who teaches a Dhamma so real true actual as the Blessed One does
 He understands thus There is no other ascetic or brahmin outside here who teaches a Dhamma so real true actual as the Blessed One does
This too is a method by means of which a bhikkhu who is a trainee standing on the plane of a trainee understandsI am a trainee
Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu who is a trainee understands the five spiritual facultiesthe faculty of faith the faculty of energythe facultyof mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of wisdom
And what bhikkhus is the method by means of which a bhikkhu who is one beyond training standing on the plane of one beyond training understands I am one beyond training
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu who is one beyond training understands the five spiritual facultiesthe faculty of faith  the faculty of wisdom
He dwells having contacted with the body their destination their culmination their fruit their final goal and having pierced it through with wisdom he sees
This is a method by means of which a bhikkhu who is one beyond training standing on the plane of one beyond training understands I am one beyond training
Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu who is one beyond training understands the six facultiesthe eye faculty the ear faculty the nose faculty the tongue faculty the body faculty the mind faculty
He understands These six faculties will cease completely and totally without remainder and no other six faculties will arise anywhere in any way
This too is a method by means of which a bhikkhu who is one beyond training standing on the plane of one beyond training understands I am one beyond training 
He does not yet dwell having contacted with the body their destination their culmination their fruit their final goal but having pierced it through with wisdom he sees
This too is a method by means of which a bhikkhu who is a trainee standing on the plane of a trainee understands I am a trainee
After hearing their statements the king thought to himself I do not wish to hear the statements of those who are speaking
I wish to hear the statement of that one who is keeping silent like a Supanna bird in the Naga land This isnt helpful to me
Then it occurred to him Jvaka is a supporter of the Exalted Buddha the peaceful one He himself is peaceful Therefore like a bhikkhu endowed with vows he sits silently He will not speak unless I speakThe foot of the elephant must be grabbed while the elephant is trampling  Thus he himself took the initiative in consulting him
and asked Friend Jivaka why do you keep silent
While each of these ministers praises the recluse he supports you do not even open your mouth
Dont you support some recluse as they do Are you poor Didnt my father give you royalties Or do you lack faith in anyone
 Then Jvaka thought The king wants me to speak about the virtues of the recluse I support This is not the time for me to remain silentI should not speak about the virtues of the Teacher in the way these ministers speak about the virtues of their reclusesby first bowing to the king and then sitting down So he rose up from his seat bowed down to the ground in the direction where the Exalted One was dwelling lifted his hands to his head in reverential salutation and said Great king do not think that I approach any recluse indiscriminately For when my Teacher took conception in the mothers womb when he emerged from the womb when he made his great renunciation when he achieved Enlightenment and when he set in motion the Wheel of the Dhamma the tenthousandfold worldsystem shook So too when he performed the Twin Miracle and when he descended from the heavenly worlds  I will speak about the virtues of the Teacher Listen with a one pointed mind great king  Having said this he then began to speak Your majesty he is the Exalted One a worthy one perfectly enlightened etc When Jvaka had finished explaining the meaning of each term he said Thus great king my Teacher is a worthy one he is perfectly enlightened  he is exalted
Speaking thus he in effect says Great king even when questioned by a hundred persons like yourself or by a thousand such or by a hundred thousand such the Teacher has the power and ability to grasp their intentions and to answer them You should approach him confidently great king and ask your question 
When the king heard this talk about the virtues of the Exalted One his entire body was immediately suffused with the five grades of rapture
Among the many different kinds of vehicles elephant vehicles are the best and since one is going to see the best person one should go in the best kind of vehicle Moreover horse vehicles and chariots etc are noisy and their sounds can be heard from the distance but elephant vehicles proceed step by step and thus one does not hear any sound
Thinking that one should approach the peaceful quiescent Exalted One in peaceful quiet vehicles the king ordered the elephant vehicles to be prepared
simply through his prudence
For he thought The king says he is going at this time and kings have many enemies
If some obstacle should arise along the way people will blame me for taking the king out at an improper time
And they will blame the Exalted One for giving Dhamma talk without regard for the time
Further when supported by women men do not become afraid Thus so that the king would go along happily surrounded by his women Jvaka arranged for five hundred female elephants to be prepared He had five hundred of the kings women mounted on these disguised as men carrying swords and spears in their hands surrounding the king He further thought This king does not have the supporting conditions for gaining the paths and fruits in this present existence The Buddhas explain the Dhamma when they have seen the supporting conditions 
So let me assemble a great multitude of people For then the Teacher having seen someone with the supporting conditions will teach the Dhamma and that will be beneficial to the multitude
He was suddenly gripped by fear etc Herein there are four kinds of fear fear as mental anxiety  fear as knowledge  fear as a fearful object  and fear as moral dread  Among these fear as mental anxiety is referred to in the passage In dependence on birth there arises fear fright etc
Fear as knowledge has come down in the passage Those  having heard the Tathgatas teaching of the Dhamma generally fall into fear a sense of urgency and terror 
Fear as a fearful object is referred to in the passage Is this the fear and dread that is coming  
In this they praise fear not valor
Among these here fear as mental anxiety is intended
By why did the king become afraid
Because of the quietness he suspected Jvaka and thus he became afraid
Jvaka it is said had already informed the king in the upper terrace of the palace Great king the Exalted One is fond of quietnessHe should be approached quietly
the instruments were merely taken along Also they did not speak aloud but went along giving signals with a snap of the fingers
In the Mango Grove not even the sound of sneezing was heard
Because of the quietness he became uneasy and the following suspicion arose in him regarding Jvaka
yet not even the sound of sneezing is heard here He must be lying Wishing to usurp the kingship for himself he has deceived me led me out of the city set up an army in front and is going to arrest me
For he has the strength of five elephants
O what harm has befallen me
 Having become so much afraid he could not conduct himself fearlessly
Jvaka thought This king does not know me he does not know that Jvaka does not take anothers lifeIf I do not reassure him he will perish Thus reassuring the king he said Do not be afraid great king etc
He points out the lights burning in the pavilion hall to show A group of thieves does not stay where lamps are burningYou should go where you see those lamps great king
Your majesty should visit the Exalted OnePerhaps if you visit him he might bring peace to your mind
At that very moment he became desirous to go to the Exalted OneThinking If I am to go to the Buddha at this time there is no one apart from Jvaka who can get the vehicles prepared quickly enough he said Then get the elephant vehicles prepared friend Jvaka
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dw elling at Rajagaha on Mount Vulture Peak
Jvaka undertook the preparations in the way described without being told to do so
Therefore I should arrange protection for the king so that no one will blame either myself or the Exalted One
So he sent out announcements here and there and had it proclaimed Today the king will go to see the Exalted One Let everyone protect the king according to his means
Then the wanderer Sutava approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk
At that time in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this Sutava a bhikkhu who is an arahant  one whose taints are destroyed who has lived the spiritual life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached his own goal utterly destroyed the fetters of existence one completely liberated through final knowledge  is incapable of transgression in five cases He is incapable of intentionally depriving a living being of life he is incapable of taking by way of theft what is not given he is incapable of engaging in sexual intercourse he is incapable of deliberately speaking falsehood he is incapable of storing things up in order to enjoy sensual pleasures as he did in the past when a layman
Bhante did I hear that correctly from the Blessed One grasp it correctly attend to it correctly remember it correctly 
Yes Sutava you heard that correctly grasped it correctly attended to it correctly remembered it correctly
In the past Sutava and also now I say thus A bhikkhu who is an arahant one whose taints are destroyed  one completely liberated through final knowledge  is incapable of transgression in nine cases He is incapable of intentionally depriving a living being of life he is incapable of taking by way of theft what is not given he is incapable of engaging in sexual intercourse he is incapable of deliberately speaking falsehood he is incapable of storing things up in order to enjoy sensual pleasures as he did in the past when a layman he is incapable of rejecting the Buddha he is incapable of rejecting the Dhamma he is incapable of rejecting the Sahgha he is incapable of rejecting the training
In the past Sutava and also now I say thus A bhikkhu who is an arahant  one whose taints are destroyed  one completely liberated through final knowledge  is incapable of transgression in these nine cases
But there were so many torcheshundreds and thousands beyond limit
he sat down to One side and said to the Blessed One
Bhante on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling right here in Rajagaha the Mountain Fort
Jvaka himself having arranged the kings retinue went along close to the king thinking If any danger arises I will be the first to give my own life for the sake of the king
Fear as moral dread is indicated in the passage 
for from fear the good do no evil 
Therefore the king prohibited the playing of musical instruments
and kings generally delight in sound
This Jvaka told me there are  bhikkhus in the Mango Grove
and he is going along close beside me and there is not even a single armed man near me
but revealed his own fearfulness to Jvaka
He says Go forward twice hurrying along because if he had said this once it would not be firm
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Venerable Sariputta and the Venerable Candikaputta were dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrel sanctuary
As soon as the king dismounted from the elephant and set foot on the ground the splendor of the Exalted One suffused his body
Immediately his entire body broke out into a sweat and his clothes oppressed him so that he felt as if they should be removed
He remembered his own crime and great fear arose in him
He could not go directly to the Exalted One but took Jvaka by the hand and walked around as if touring the monastery grounds saying You have built this well Jvaka you have built this well Thus praising the monastery he gradually approached the door of the pavilion hall
 Some say because he did not know
They say that in his youth he had seen the Exalted One when he came to him along with his father but afterwards as a result of associating with evil friends he killed his father sent assassins  set the elephant Dhanapla loose  and having thus become a great criminal he did not meet the Exalted One face to face Because of this they say he did not recognize him
But that is not the reason For the Exalted One sitting in the middle of the pavilion hall surrounded by the company of bhikkhus appeared like the full moon surrounded by the host of stars Marked with the most excellent bodily characteristics adorned with the special features of physical beauty he illuminated the entire monastery with his sixcolored rays Who would not have known him
The king asks this as a mannerism of sovereignty 
For this is the nature of those of royal family though knowing something they ask as if they do not know
But Jvaka having heard this question thought to himself This king standing in front of the Buddha asks Where is the Exalted One  This is as if someone standing on the earth were to ask Where is the earth  or as if someone looking up at the sky were to ask Where are the sun and moon  or as if someone standing at the foot of Mount Sineru were to ask Where is Sineru
I will show him the Exalted One Making a reverential salutation towards the Exalted One he said That is the Exalted One great king etc
As the king surveyed the company of bhikkhus wherever he looked the company sat in complete silence
Not even one bhikkhu was playing with his hands or feet or broke out into a cough Not even one bhikkhu looked up at the king and his royal assembly standing in front of the Exalted One or at the retinue of nautchgirls adorned with all their ornaments
All sat there looking only at the Exalted One
The king gaining confidence such peace again and again surveyed the company of bhikkhus sitting there with calm faculties like a clear lake free from mud He then uttered his joyful exclamation May my son the Prince Udyibhadda enjoy such peace as the company of bhikkhus now enjoys
The meaning is May he enjoy the bodily verbal and mental peace and the peaceful conduct which the company of bhikkhus enjoys
 He did not say this intending O may my son go forth and become peaceful like these bhikkhus
 Rather having gained confidence seeing the company of bhikkhus he remembered his son
For that is the nature of people in the world when they have gained something rare or seen something wonderful they remember their dear relatives and friends
Moreover he said this because he was apprehensive about his son and desired peace for him
For he thought My son will ask My father is young
Where is my grandfather
 Hearing Your father killed him he might think Then I shall kill my father and rule the kingdom
 Thus apprehensive about his son he spoke thus desiring this peace for him
his son eventually killed him
In that dynasty parricide took place in five generations
Ajātasattu killed bimbisāra udayi killed ajātasattu
But the citizens became angry and thinking These kings destroy their own lineage what do we need them for  they killed Ngadsa
Do your thoughts great king follow the call of your affection  Why does the Exalted One say this
It is said that before the king uttered his exclamation the Exalted One had thought The king having come stands here silent and speechless What is he thinking
 Having read his mind he reflected Being unable to converse with me he surveys the company of bhikkhus and remembers his son I will start a conversation with him
Thereupon the king thought O how wonderful are the virtues of the Buddha There is no one who has committed such crimes towards the Exalted One as I have I killed his chief supporter  I accepted the request of Devadatta and sent assassins to kill him I released the elephant Nlgiri against him with my support Devadatta hurled a stone at him The Buddha should not even open his mouth towards such a criminal as myself yet he freely addresses me O the Exalted One is wellestablished in the characteristic of a stable one in five modes
I should not abandon such a teacher and search for a teacher elsewhere Filled with joy addressing the Exalted One he said Venerable sir I love my son etc
I will answer everything This invitation is not shared in common even with paccekabuddhas chief disciples and great disciples
Elated that the Exalted One had invited him to ask with the invitation of an Omniscient One the king asked his question on the visible fruits of recluseship
This is the purport of the kings question similar to the visible fruits discerned for the various worldly crafts and enjoyed by those who live by these crafts
 Therefore speaking in terms of those who live by those crafts he refers to the various crafts
and the fruit of recluseship is the noble fruit
As it is said What bhikkhus is recluseship
It is this Noble Eightfold Path
And what are the fruits of recluseship
The fruits of streamentry of the oncereturner of the nonreturner and of arahatship 
The king however does not know about these
Thus in the text below he asks concerning the examples of the slave and the farmer
 Do you remember great king   The Exalted One did not answer the question directly but reflected These many royal ministers who have come here are disciples of other religious teachers If I were to speak explaining the negative and positive sides they would complain Our king has come here with great eagerness yet from the time he arrived the recluse Gotama speaks only of the quarrels and controversies of recluses Thus they would not listen carefully to the Dhamma But if the king were to speak they wont be able to complain since they must follow him
for in the world people follow those who are in power
 It is not troublesome for me venerable sir The intention of the kings statement is this
But the genuine wise men having heard ones statement praise what is wellspoken and when something is wrongly spoken contradicting the meaning and phrasing of the scriptures they correct it and reformulate it
Why does he ask Where is the Exalted One
There the Venerable Candikaputta addressed the bhikkhus Friends bhikkhus  Friend  those bhikkhus replied The Venerable Candikaputta said this Friends Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus When friends a bhikkhus mind is consolidated by mind it is fitting for him to declare I understand Destroyed is birth the spiritual life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming back to any state of being 
Then the Venerable Sariputta said to the Venerable Candikaputta Friend Candikaputta it is not in such a way that Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus
Rather Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus When friends a bhikkhus mind is well consolidated by mind it is fitting for him to declare I understand Destroyed is birth the spiritual life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming back to any state of being 
A second time 
A third time the Venerable Candikaputta addressed the bhikkhus Friends Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus When friends a bhikkhus mind is consolidated by mind it is fitting for him to declare I understand Destroyed is birth the spiritual life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming back to any state of being
Rather Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus When friends a bhikkhus mind is well consolidated by mind it is fitting for him to declare I understand  Destroyed is birth the spiritual life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming back to any state of being 
And how friend is the mind of a bhikkhu well consolidated by mind
His mind is well consolidated by mind when he knows My mind is without lust His mind is well consolidated by mind when he knows My mind is without hatred His mind is well consolidated by mind when he knows My mind is without delusion His mind is well consolidated by mind when he knows My mind is not subject to lust His mind is well consolidated by mind when he knows My mind is not subject to hatred His mind is well consolidated by mind when he knows My mind is not subject to delusion His mind is well consolidated by mind when he knows My mind is not subject to return to sensesphere existence His mind is well consolidated by mind when he knows My mind is not subject to return to formsphere existence His mind is well consolidated by mind when he knows My mind is not subject to return to formlesssphere existence
Even if powerful sounds cognizable by the ear come into range of the ear  Even if powerful odors cognizable by the nose com e into range of the nose Even if powerful tastes cognizable by the tongue come into range of the tongue Even if powerful tactile objects cognizable by the body come into range of the body Even if powerful phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range of the mind they do not obsess his mind his mind is not at all affected
It remains steady attained to im perturbability and he observes its vanishingSuppose friend there was a stone pillar eight meters long Four meters would be below ground and four meters above ground If a violent rainstorm should then arrive from the east it would not shake it or make it quake wobble and tremble if a violent rainstorm should then arrive from the west from the north from the south it would not shake it or make it quake wobble and tremble
For what reason
Because the stone pillar is deep in the ground and is securely planted
So too friend when a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of the eye
Even if powerful phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range of the mind they do not obsess his mind his mind is not at all affected It remains steady attained to imperturbability and he observes its vanishing
A third time the Venerable Sariputta said to the Venerable Candikaputta Friend Candikaputta it is not in such a way that Devadatta teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus
Yet though he said this
When friend a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of the eye they do not obsess his mind his mind is not at all affected
udayi was killed by his own son mahāmuṇḍika
mahāmuṇḍika was killed by his son Anuruddha
and Anuruddha was killed by his son nāgadāsa
It remains steady attained to imperturbability and he observes its vanishing
Therefore immediately after the king uttered his joyful exclamation the Exalted One spoke the above words
This is the meaning Great king as rain water falling upon the highlands flows down to the plain so as you survey the company of bhikkhus your affection goes towards your son
Knowing the kings eagerness to ask a question the Exalted One says Ask whatever you wish to great king
He invites him to ask extending to him the invitation of an Omniscient One  Ask whatever you wish to It is no trouble for me to answer
For they do not say Ask whatever you wish to but Having heard we will try to answer
Buddhas however say Ask whatever you wish to
inviting spirits kings gods recluses brahmins and wanderers with the invitation of an Omniscient One
 Is it possible to point out any visible fruit of recluseship
Fruit of recluseship  in the ultimate sense recluseship is the path
right view  right concentration
So then let me give the king the task  Turning that task over to the king he asks Do you remember great king ever asking other recluses and brahmins this question
It is difficult to speak in the presence of those who pretend to be wise for they find fault with every word and letter
And there is no genuine wise man equal to the Exalted One
Thus the king says It is not troublesome for me venerable sir when the Exalted One or anyone like him is present
Then the Venerable Sariputta approached the Blessed One paid homage to him and sat down to one side
The Blessed One then said to him  Sariputta when a bhikkhus taints have been destroyed how many powers does he possess by reason of which he can claim to have attained the destruction of the taints My taints have been destroyed  
Bhante when a bhikkhus taints have been destroyed  he possesses ten powers by reason of which he can claim to have attained the destruction of the taints My taints have been destroyed
What ten Here Bhante a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has clearly seen all conditioned phenomena as they really are with correct wisdom as impermanent
This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed on the basis of which he claim s to have attained the destruction of the taints My taints have been destroyed
Again  a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has clearly seen sensual pleasures as they really are with correct wisdom as similar to a charcoal pit
This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed
Again the mind of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed slants slopes and inclines to seclusion it is withdrawn delights in renunciation and is entirely finished with all things that are a basis for the taints
This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed
Again a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has developed and well developed the four establishments of mindfulness
 Again a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has developed and well developed the four right strivings the four bases for psychic potency the five spiritual faculties the five powers   the seven factors of enlightenment the noble eightfold path
This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed On the basis of which he claims to have attained the destruction of the taints My taints have been destroyed
This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed
Bhante when a bhikkhus taints have been destroyed he possesses these ten powers by reason of which he can claim to have attained the destruction of the taints My taints have been destroyed
At Savatthi
Bhikkhus form is impermanent
What is impermanent is suffering What is suffering is nonself
What is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
Feeling is impermanent Perception is impermanent Volitional formations are impermanent Consciousness is impermanent What is impermanent is suffering What is suffering is nonself What is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
Seeing thus bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards form revulsion towards feeling revulsion towards perception revulsion towards volitional formations revulsion towards consciousness
Experiencing revulsion he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassionhis mindis liberated
When it is liberated there comes the knowledge Its liberated He understands Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what had tobe done has been done there is no more for this state of being
To whatever extent bhikkhus there are abodes of beings even up to the pinnacle of existence these are the foremost in the world these are the best that is the arahants
This is what the Blessed One said
Having said this the Fortunate One the Teacher further said this
Happy indeed are the arahants No craving can be found in them
Cut off is the conceit I am Burst asunder is delusions net
They have reached the unstirred state Limpid are their minds
They are unsullied in the world  The holy ones without taints
Having fully understood the five aggregates Ranging in the seven good qualities
Those praiseworthy superior men Are the Buddhas bosom sons
Endowed with the seven gems Trained in the threefold training
Those great heroes wander about With fear and trembling abandoned
Endowed with the ten factors Those great nagas concentrated
Are the best beings in the world No craving can be found in them
The adepts knowledge has arisen in them This body is the last I bear
In regard to the core of the holy life They no longer depend on others
They do not waver in discrimination They are released from renewed existence
Having reached the stage of the tamed They are the victors in the world
Above across and below Delight is no more found in them
They boldly sound their lions roar The enlightened are supreme in the world
At Savatthi
Bhikkhus the Tathagata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One liberated by nonclinging through revulsion towards form through its fading away and cessation is called a Perfectly Enlightened One
The Tathagata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One liberated by nonclinging through revulsion towards feeling
A bhikkhu liberated by wisdom liberated by nonclinging through revulsion towards feeling
There in bhikkhus what is the distinction what is the disparity what is the difference between the Tathagatathe Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One and a bhikkhu liberated by wisdom 
Venerable sir our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One guided by the Blessed One take recourse in the Blessed One
It would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statement
Having heard it from him the bhikkhus will remember it
Then listen and attend closely bhkkhus I will speak
Yes venerable sir the bhikkhus replied
The Blessed One said this
The Tathagata bhikkhus the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One is the originator of the path unarisen before the producer of the path unproduced before the declarer of the path undeclared before He is the knower of the path the discoverer of the path the one skilled in the path And his disciples now dwell following that path and become possessed of it afterwards
This bhikkhus is the distinction the disparity the difference between the Tathagata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One and a bhikkhu liberated by wisdom
A bhikkhu liberated by wisdom liberated by nonclinging through revulsion towards form through its fading away and cessationis called one liberated by wisdom
 perception  volitional formations  consciousness through its fading away and cessation is called a Perfectly Enlightened One
 perceptian  volitional formations  consciousness through its fading away and cessation is called one liberated by wisdom
At Savatthi
Bhikkhus in the evening the lion the king of beasts comes out from his lair Having come out he stretches himself surveys the four quarters all around and roars his lions roar three times Then he sets out in search of game
Those who live in holes enter their holes those who live in the water enter the water those who live in the woods enter the woods and the birds fly up into the air Even those royal bull elephants bound by strong thongs in the villages towns and capital cities burst and break their bonds asunder frightened they urinate and defecate and flee here and there
So powerful bhikkhus is the lion the king of beasts among the animals so majestic and mighty
So too bhikkhus when the Tathagata arises in the world an arahant perfectly enlightened accomplished in true knowledge and conduct fortunate knower of the world unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed teacher of devas and humans the Enlightened One the Blessed One
he teaches the Dhamma thus Such is form such its origin such its passing away such is feeling  such is perception  such are volitional formations  such is consciousness such its origin such its passing away
Then bhikkhus when those devas who are longlived beautiful abounding in happiness dwelling for a long time in lofty palaces hear the Tathsgatas teaching of the Dhamma they are for the most part filled with fear a sense of urgency and terror saying It seems sir that we are impermanent though we thought ourselves permanent
This is what the Blessed One said Having said this the Fortunate One the Teacher further said this
When the lion the king of beasts roars whatever animals hear the sound are for the most part filled with fear a sense of urgency and terror
it seems sir that we are unstable though we thought ourselves stable
it seems sir that we are noneternal though we thought ourselves eternal
It seems sir that we are impermanent unstable noneternal included within identity
So powerful bhikkhus is the Tathagata over this world together with its devas so majestic and mighty
When the Buddha through direct knowledge Sets in motion the Wheel of Dhamma
The peerless Teacher in this world With its devas makesthis known
The cessation of identity And the origin of identi
Also the Noble Eightfold Path That leads to sufferings appeasement
Then those devas with long life spans Beautiful ablaze with glory
Are struck with fear filled with terror Like beasts who hear the lions roar
Weve not transcended identity It seems sir were impermanent
So they sayhaving heard the utterance Of the Arahant the released Stable One
Monks these three persons arise in the world for the welfare of the multitude for the happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the good welfare and happiness of devas and humans

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Nalanda in Pavarikas Mango Grove

Then the Venerable Sariputta approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one side
and said to him venerable sir I have such confidence in the Blessed One
Lofty indeed is this bellowing utterance of yours Sariputta you have roared a definitive categorical lions roarVenerable sirI have such confidence in the Blessed One
that I believe there has not been nor ever will be nor exists at present another ascetic or brahmin more knowledgeable than the Blessed One with respect to enlightenment
Have you now Sariputta encompassed with your mind the minds of all the Arahants the perfectly Enlightened Ones arisen in the past and known thus Those Blessed Ones were of such virtue or of such qualities or of such wisdom or of such dwellings or of such liberation
No venerable sir
Then Sariputta have you encompassed with your mind the minds of all the Arahants the Perfectly Enlightened Ones who will arise in the future and known thus Those Blessed Ones will be of such virtue or of such qualities or of such wisdom or of such dwellings or of such liberation
No venerable sir
Then Sariputta have you encompassed with your mind my own mindI being at present the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened Oneand known thus The Blessed One is of such virtue or of such qualities or of such wisdom or of such dwellings or of such liberation
No venerable sir
Sariputta when you do not have any knowledge encompassing the minds of the Arahants the Perfectly Enlightened Ones of the past the future and the present
why do you utter this lofty bellowing utterance and roar this definitive categorical lions roar Venerable sir
I have such confidence in the Blessed One that I believe there has not been nor ever will be nor exists at Present another ascetic or brahmin more knowledgeable than the Blessed One with respect to enlightenment
I do not have venerable sir any knowledge encompassing the minds of the Arahants the Perfectly Enlightened Ones of the Past the future and the present but still I have understood this by inference from the Dhamma
Suppose venerable sir a king had a frontier city with strong ramparts walls and arches and with a single gate
The gatekeeper posted there would be wise competent and intelligent one who keeps out strangers and admits acquaintances
While he is walking along the path that encircles the city he would not see a cleft or an opening in the walls even big enough for a cat to slip through
He might think Whatever large creatures enter or leave this city all enter and leave through this one gate
So too venerable sir I have understood this by inference from the Dhamma Whatever Arahants Perfectly Enlightened Ones arose in the past all those Blessed Ones had first abandoned the five hindrances corruptions of the mind and weakeners of wisdom and then with their minds well established in the four establishments of mindfulness they had developed correctly the seven factors of enlightenment and there by they had awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment
And venerable sir whatever Arahants Perfectly Enlightened Ones will arise in the future all those Blessed Ones will first abandon the five hindrances corruptions of the mind and weakeners of wisdom and then with their minds well established in the four establishments of mindfulness they will develop correctly the seven factors of enlightenment and thereby they will awaken to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment
And venerable sir the Blessed One who is at present the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One first abandoned the five hindrances corruptions of the mind and weakeners of wisdom and then with his mind well established in the four establishmentsof mindfulness he developed correctly the seven factors of enlightenment and thereby he has awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment
Good good Sariputta
Therefore Sariputta you should repeat this Dhamma exposition frequently to the bhikkhus and the bhikkhunis to the male lay followers and the female lay followers
Even though some foolish people may have perplexity or uncertainty regarding the Tathagata when they hear this Dhamma exposition their perplexity or uncertainty regarding the Tathagata will be abandoned
that I believe there has not been nor ever will be nor exists at present another ascetic or brahmin more knowledgeable than the Blessed One with respect to enlightenment
Bhikkhus so long as the sun and moon have not arisen in the world for just so long there is no manifestation of great light and radiance
but then blinding darkness prevails a dense mass of darkness
for just so long day and night are not discemed the month and fortnight are not discerned the seasons and the year are not discerned
But bhikkhus when a Tathagata arises in the world an Arahant a Perfectly Enlightened One then there is the manifestation of great light and radiance
What four
The noble truth of suffering the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering
Therefore bhikkhus an exertion should be made to understand This is suffering An exertion should be made to understand This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering
then no blinding darkness prevails no dense mass of darkness
then there is the explaining teaching proclaiming establishing disclosing analysing and elucidating of the Four Noble Truths
But bhikkhus when the sun and moon arise in the world then there is the manifestation of great light and radiance
then there is no blinding darkness no dense mass of darkness
then day and night are discerned the month and formight are discerned the seasons and year are discerned
So too bhikkhus so long as a Tathagata has not arisen in the world an Arahant a Perfectly Enlightened One for just so long there is no manifestation of great light and radiance
but then blinding darkness prevailsa dense mass of darkness
for just so long there is no explaining teaching proclaiming establish disclosing analysing or elucidating of the Four Noble Truths
Bhikkhus the Tathagata has fully awakened to the world
The Tathagata has fully awakened to the origin of the world 
The Tathagata has fully awakened to the cessation of the world
The Tathagata has fully awakened to the way leading to the cessation of the world
Bhikkhus as the Tathagata speaks so he does as he does so he speaks
Bhikkhus in this woirld with its devas Mara and Brahma among this population with its ascetics and brahmins its devas and humans the Tathagata is the vanquisher the unvanquished the universal seer the wielder of mastery
the Tathagata is detached from the world
the Tathagata has abandoned the origin of the world
the Tathagata has realized the cessation of the world
the Tathagata has developed the way leading to the cessation of the world
Bhikkhus in this world with its devas Mara and Brahma among this population with its ascetics and brahmins its devas and humans whatever is seen heard sensed cognized reached sought after examined by the mindall that the Tathagata has fully awakened to
therefore he is called the Tathagata
Bhikkhus whatever the Tathagata speaks utters or expounds in the interval between the night when he awakens to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment and the night when he attains final nibbana all that is just so and not otherwise
therefore he is called the Tathagata
Since he does as he speaks and speaks as he does
therefore he is called the Tathagata
therefore he is called the Tathagata
Having directly known all the world  all in the world just as it is
he is detached from all the world disengaged from all the world
He is the vanquisher of all the wise one who has untied all knots
He has reached the supreme peace nibbana inaccessible to fear
He is the Buddha his taints destroyed  untroubled all doubts cut off
having reached the destruction of all kamma he is liberated in the extinction of acquisitions
He is the Blessed One the Buddha he is the lion unsurpassed
in this world with its devas he set in motion the wheel of Brahma
Thus those devas and human beings who have gone for refuge to the Buddha
assemble and pay homage to him the great one free from diffidence
Tamed he is the best of tamers peaceful he is the seer among peacebringers
freed lie is the chief of liberators crossed over he is the best of guides across
Thus indeed they pay him homage the great one free from diffidence
In this world together with its devas there is no one who can rival you
Bhikkhus there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world
What four
Here some person attains nibbana through exertion in this very life
Still another person attains nibbana without exertion in this very life
And how bhikkhus does a person attain nibbana through exertion in this very life
Here a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the body perceiving the repulsiveness of food perceiving nondelight in the entire world contemplating impermanence in all conditioned phenomena
He dwells depending upon these five trainee powers the power of faith the power of moral shame the power of moral dread the power of energy and the power of wisdom
These five faculties arise in him prominently the faculties of faith energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom
Because these five faculties are prominent he attains nibbana through exertion in this very life
This is how a person attains nibbana through exertion in this very life
And how does a person attain nibbana through exertion with the breakup of the body
Here a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the body
He dwells depending upon these five trainee powers the powers of faith and wisdom
These five faculties arise in him feebly the faculties of faith and wisdom
Because these five faculties are feeble he attains nibbana through exertion with the breakup of the body
This is how a person attains nibbana through exertion with the breakup of the body
And how does a person attain nibbana without exertion in this very life
Here secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhana the fourth jhana
He dwells depending upon these five trainee powers the powers of faith and wisdom
These five faculties arise in him prominently the faculties of faith and wisdom
Because these five faculties are prominent he attains nibbana without exertion in this very life
This is how a person attains nibbana without exertion in this very life
And how does a person attain nibbana without exertion with the breakup of the body
Here secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhana the fourth jhana
He dwells depending upon these five trainee powers the powers of faith and wisdom
These five faculties arise in him feebly the faculties of faith and wisdom
Because these five faculties are feeble he attains nibbana without exertion with the breakup of the body
This is how a person attains nibbana without exertion with the breakup of the body
These bhikkhus are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world
Another person attains nibbana through exertion with the breakup of the body
And still another person attains nibbana without exertion with the breakup of the body
and he has the perception of death well established internally
and he has the perception of death well established internally
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Then the Blessed One took up a little bit of soil in his fingernail and addressed the bhkkhus thus Bhikkhus what do you think which is more the little bit of soil that I have taken up in my fingernail or this great earth 
Venerable sir the great earth is more
So too bhikkhus for a noble disciple a person accomplished in view who has made the breakthrough the suffering that has been destroyed and eliminated is more while that which remains is trifling
Of such great benefit bhikkhus is the breakthrough to the Dhamma of such great benefit is it to obtain the vision of the Dhamma
It does not amount to a hundredth part or a thousandth part or a hundred thousandth part of the great earth
The little bit of soil that the Blessed One has taken up in his fingernail is trifling
The latter does not amount to a hundredth part or a thousandth part or a hundred thousandth part of the former mass of suffering that has been destroyed and eliminated as there is a maximum of seven more lives
At Savatthi
Bhikkhus the eye is impermanent changing becoming otherwise The ear The nose The tongue The body The mind is impermanent changing becoming otherwise
One who places faith in these teachings and resolves on them thus is called a faithfollower one who has entered the fixed course of rightness entered the plane of superior persons transcended the plane of the worldlings He is incapable of doing any deed by reason of which he might be reborn in hell in theanimal realm or in the domain of ghosts he is incapable of passing away without having realized the fruit of streamentry
One for whom these teachings are accepted thus after being pondered to a sufficient degree with wisdom is called a Dhammafollower one who has entered the fixed course of rightness entered the plane of superior persons transcended the plane of the worldlings He is incapable of doing any deed by reason of which he might be reborn in hell in the animal realm or in the domain of ghosts he is incapable of passing away without having realized the fruit of streamentry
One who knows and sees these teachings thus is called a streamenterer no longer bound to the nether world fixed in destiny with enlightenment as his destination
Thus have I heard Once the Lord was staying in Magadha to the east of Rsjagaha by a Brahmin village called Ambasapda to the north of the village on Mount Vediya in the Indasala Cave
And at that time Sakka lord of the gods felt a strong desire to see the Lord
And Sakka thought Where is the Blessed Lord the fullyenlightened Buddha now staying
Then perceiving where the Lord was Sakka said to the ThirtyThree Gods Gentlemen the Blessed Lord is staying in Magadha in the Indasda Cave 
How would it be if we were to go and visit the Lord 
Very good Lord and may good fortune go with you replied the ThirtyThree Gods
Then Sakka said to Pancasikha of the gandhabbas The Blessed Lord is staying in Magadha in the Indasala Cave I propose to go to visit him
Very good Lord said Pancasikha and taking his yellow beluvawood he followed in attendance on Sakka
And just as swiftly as a strong man might stretch forth his flexed arm or flex it again Sakka surrounded by the ThirtyThree Gods and attended by Pancasikha vanished from the heaven of the ThirtyThree and appeared in Magadha on Mount Vediya
Then a tremendous light shone over Mount Vediya illuminating the village of Ambasapda  so great was the power of the gods
so that in the surrounding villages they were saying Look Mount Vediya is on fire today  its burning  its in flames What is the matter that Mount Vediya and Ambaspda are lit up like this and they were so terrified that their hair stood on end
Then Sakka said Pancasikha it is hard for the likes of us to get near the Tathagatas when they are enjoying the bliss of meditation and therefore withdrawn
But if you Pancasikha were first to attract the ear of the Blessed Lord then we might afterwards be able to approach and see the Blessed Lord the fullyenlightened Buddha 
Very good Lord said Paiicasikha and taking his yellow beluvawood lute he approached the Indasala Cave Thinking As far as this is neither too far nor too near to the Lord and he will hear my voice he stood to one side
Then to the strains of his lute he sang these verses extolling the Buddha the Dhamma the Arahants and love
Lady your father Timbaru greet Oh Sunshine fair I give him honour due
By whom was sired a maid as fair as you Who are the cause of all my hearts delight
Delightful as the breeze to one who sweats Or as a cooling draught to one who thirsts
Your radiant beauty is to me as dear As the Dhamma is to Arahants
Just as medicine to him whos ill Or nourishment to one whos starving still
Bring me gracious lady sweet release With water cool from my consuming flames
The elephant oppressed by summer heat Seeks out a lotuspool upon which float
Petals and pollen of that flower So into your bosom sweet Id plunge
As an elephant urged by the goad Pays no heed to pricks of lance and spear
So I unheeding know not what I do Intoxicated by your beauteous form
By you my heart is tightly bound in bonds All my thoughts are quite transformed and I
Can no longer find my former course Im like a fish thats caught on baited hook
Come embrace me maiden fair of tights Seize and hold me with your lovely eyes Take me in your arms its all I ask
My desire was slight at first O maid
Of waving tresses but it grew apace
As grow the gifts that Arahants receive
Whatever merit I have gained by gifts
When it ripens be your love most fair
To those Noble Ones may my reward
As the Sakyans Son in jhana raptIntent and mindful seeks the deathless goal
Thus intent I seek your love my Sun
Just as that Sage would be rejoiced if he Were to gain supreme enlightenment
So Id rejoice to be made one with you
If Sakka Lord of ThreeandThirty Gods Were perchance to grant a boon to me
Its you Id crave my love for yous so strong Your father maid so wise I venerate
Like a saltree fairly blossoming
For his offsprings sake so sweet and fair
When he heard this the Lord said Pancasikha the sound of your strings blends so well with your song and your song with the strings that neither prevails excessively over I the other
When did you compose these verses on the Buddha the Dhamma the Arahants and love
Lord it was when the Blessed Lord was staying on the bank of the River i Neranjara under the goatherds banyan tree prior to his enlightenment
At that time I fell in love with the lady Bhadda i bright as the sun the daughter of King Timbaru of the gandhabbas
But the lady was in love with somebody else It was Sikhaddi the son of Matali the charioteer whom she favoured
And when I found that I could not win the lady by any manner of means
I took my yellow beluvawood lute and went to the home of King Timbarii of the gandhabbas and there I sang these verses
And Lord having heard the verses the lady Bhadda Suriyavaccasa said to me Sir I have not personally seen that Blessed Lord though I heard of him when I went to the Sudhamma Hall of the ThirtyThree Gods to dance
And since sir you praise that Blessed Lord so highly let us meet today
And so Lord I met the lady
not then but later
Then Sakka thought Pancasikha and the Lord are in friendly conversation so he called to Pancasikha My dear Pancasikha salute the Blessed Lord from me
Very good Lord said Pancasikha and did so
Pancasikha may Sakka king of the gods his ministers and followers be happy for they all desire happiness devas humans asuras nagas gandhabbas and whatever other groups of beings there are 
After this greeting Sakka entered the Indasala Cave saluted the Lord and stood to one side
Then in the Indasala Cave the rough passages became smooth the narrow parts became wide and in the pitchdark cavern it became bright owing to the power of the devas
Then the Lord said to Sakka It is wonderful it is marvellous that the Venerable Kosiya with so much so many things to do should come here
Lord I have long wished to visit the Blessed Lord but I have always been so busy on behalf of the ThirtyThree that I was unable to come
Once the Blessed Lord was staying at Savatthi in the Salala hut
At that time the Blessed Lord was seated in some form of meditation and King Vessavanas wife Bhunjati was waiting on him venerating him with palms together
I said to her Lady please salute the Blessed Lord for me and say Sakka the king of the gods with his ministers and followers pays homage at the Lords feet
But she said Sir it is not the right time to see the Blessed Lord he is in retreat
Well then lady when the Blessed Lord rises from his meditation please tell him what I have said
Lord did the lady salute you on my behalf
She did salute me King of the Gods and I remember what she said
I also remember that it was the sound of Your Reverences chariotwheels that roused me from my meditation
Lord those gods who arose in the heaven of the ThirtyThree before I did have told me and assured me that whenever a Tathagata a fullyenlightened Arahant Buddha arises in the world the ranks of devas increase and those of the asuras decline in numbers
saying Lord Sakka king of the gods together with his ministers and followers pays homage at the feet of the Blessed Lord 
for that is the way the Tathagatas greet such mighty beings
and the ThirtyThree Gods
with Pancasikha did the same
and I went to Savatthi to see the Lord
and does the Lord remember what she said 
In fact I have witnessed this myself
There was Lord right here in Kapilavatthu a Sakyan girl called Gopika who had faith in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and who observed the precepts scrupulously
She rejected the status of a woman and developed the thought of becoming a man
Also there were three monks who having observed the holy life under the Blessed Lord had been reborn in the inferior condition of gandhabbas
They lived indulging in the pleasures of the five senses as our attendants and servants
At this Gopaka rebuked them saying What were you about sirs that you did not listen to the Blessed Lords teaching I was a woman who had faith in the Buddha I rejected the status of a woman and was reborn among the ThirtyThree Gods
But you after having observed the holy life under the Blessed Lord have been reborn in the inferior condition of gandhabbas
It is a sorry sight for us to see our fellows in the Dhamma reborn in the inferior condition of gandhabbas
And being thus rebuked two of those devas immediately developed mindfulness and so attained to the Realm of the Retinue of BrahmaBut one of them remained addicted to sensual pleasures
Then after her death at the breakingup of the body she went to a happy destination being reborn in a heavenstate among the ThirtyThree Gods
as one of our sons becoming known as Gopaka the devas son
and I am known as Gopaka the devas son
Disciple once of HimWhoSees
The name I bore then Gopika
In Buddha Dhamma firmly trusting
I served the Sangha cheerfully
For loyal service paid to him
a Sakkason Mighty
Then former monks I saw whod reached
We supplied their food and drink
Each for himself must understand That Dhamma
And so Im born a Sakkason Mighty
Have reappeared in humble state
That gandhabbaspirits you
and female I Am now reborn a male a god
Alas lets go and strive amain
They purified their hearts of lust
And like the elephant that bursts
Who sat enthroned in Council Hall
Outcome is occurrence
In every case he rejects the doing of evil and of merit
He explains Even though a person does something with the idea I am doing evil evil is not done There is no evil
Beings have the idea We are doing evil 
By both words  he rejects the real condition for defilement ie wrong bodily conduct etc and the real condition for purification ie right bodily conduct etc
is the kamma beings do on their own by reason of which they attain the state of a god the state of Mra the state of Brahm the enlightenment of a disciple the enlightenment of a paccekabuddha or the omniscience  This he rejects
Determination by others is the exhortation and instruction given by others in dependence upon which all people except for the Great Beings  attain ranging from good fortune in the human state up to arahatship He rejects this determination by others
Thus this fool strikes a blow at the Wheel of the Conqueror
No personal determination  he rejects the personal determination through which beings attain the aforementioned kinds of success
No power  he denies that beings can establish themselves upon their own power arouse their energy and attain success
The terms energy personal strength and personal fortitude are synonymous with personal determination
They are brought in separately in order to reject the claim This has occurred through our energy personal strength and personal fortitude
Selfdetermination 
On seeing which Vasava dismayed Outstripped and left them far behind
See how these of lesser rank
Gopaka said to Visava
All sentient beings  he includes camels oxen donkeys etc without exception
All living beings  he says this with reference to creatures having one or two faculties
All creatures  this refers to beings born from eggs or from the womb
Lord Indra in the world of men A Buddha
All souls  this refers to rice barley wheat etc
because they undergo growth he regards them as having souls
Are helpless powerless devoid of energy they have no selfcontrol power or energy
And these his pupils who had failed In mindfulness when claimed by death
Circumstance  going here and there among the six classes of men
Nature  the inner nature 
By this whole statement Makkhali Gosla shows Thus are transformed and achieve diversity due to destiny circumstance and nature
Whatever will be will be
whatever will not be will not be
The six classes of men  abiding in the six classes of men they experience pleasure and pain
He shows that there is no other plane of pleasure and pain
Though one of them is left behind
Five hundred kinds of kamma
These two on highest wisdom set
he explains a senseless view devised solely by mere reasoning
The same principle applies in the case of five kinds of kamma three kinds of kamma etc
But some say He speaks of five kinds of kamma by way of the five sense faculties
That truth may yet be realised
Full kamma and halfkamma here his theory is that bodily and verbal kamma are full kamma and mental kamma is halfkamma
and three kinds by way of bodily kamma
Sixtytwo pathways Not knowing the natural language correctly he speaks of sixtytwo pathways as dvahipaipad when it should be dvsahipaipad 
Sixtytwo subaeons  in a single great aeon there are sixtyfour subaeons
An end of doubts our homage due The Buddha Victor Lord we give
but since he does not know about two of these he says 
He declares that there are six classes of men the black the blue the red the yellow the white and the ultimate white 
The black class is made up of butchers hunters fishermen thieves executioners prison wardens and those in other cruel lines of work
The blue class is made up of bhikkhus For bhikkhus he says eat having thrown thorns into the four requisites 
His own canonical text says Bhikkhus have thorny behavior 
By those who dwell in these abodes To him whos crossed the flood and made An end of doubts
Even here they gained the truth and so
in hope that we may gain That truth
Or alternatively he says that some who have gone forth have thorny behavior
The red class is made up of the onerobed he Nigahas 
for these are purer than the former two
The yellow class is made up of the whiteclothed lay disciples of the naked ascetics
Thus he makes his own lay supporters superior even to the Nigahas
The white class comprises the male and female jvikas
for these he says are purer than the previous four
The ultimate white class is made up of Nanda Vaccha Kisa Sakiccha and Makkhali Gosla
Then the Lord thought Sakka has lived a pure life for a long time Whatever questions he may ask will be to the point and not frivolous
and he will be quick to understand my answers
for they are the purest of all
So the Blessed Lord replied to Sakka in this verse
Ask me Sakka all that you desire
Being thus invited Sakka ruler of the gods put his first question to the Lord
He declares that there are eight stages in the life of man the stage of feebleness the stage of play the stage of learning to walk the erect stage the stage of training the recluse stage the conqueror stage and the prostrate stage
The stage of feebleness  this lasts for seven days following the day of birth for after coming out from the womb beings are feeble and dull
The stage of play  those who have come from an evil destination often cry and howl those who come from a good destination remember it and laugh
The stage of learning to walk  this is the stage when the child takes hold of its parents hands or feet or a bed or chair and places its feet on the ground
whereby although they wish to live without hate harming hostility or malignity and in peace they yet live in hate harming one another hostile and malign
The erect stage  this is the stage when it is able to walk on its feet
The stage of training  this is the stage when one has been trained in a craft
The recluse stage  this is the time when one has renounced the household life and gone forth 
This was Sakkas first question to the Lord
and the Lord replied
The conqueror stage  this is the time when having served a teacher one knows
The prostrate stage  this is the stage of a bhikkhu a prostrate one a conqueror one who does not say anything a recluse without gains
Ruler of the Gods it is the bonds of jealousy and avarice that bind beings so that though they wish to live without hate they yet live in hate harming one nother hostile and malign
This was the Lords reply
and Sakka delighted exclaimed So it is Lord so it is WellFarer
Through the Lords answer I have overcome my doubt and got rid of uncertainty
Thirtysix realms of dust places where dust accumulates he says this referring to the backs of the hands bottom of the feet etc 
Seven spheres of percipient beings he says this referring to camels oxen donkeys goats cattle deer and buffaloes
Seven spheres of nonpercipient beings he says this referring to rice paddy barley wheat millet beans and kadrsaka
But sir what gives rise to jealousy and avarice what is their origin how are they born how do they arise Owing to the presence of what do they arise owing to the absence of what do they not arise
Then Sakka having expressed his appreciation asked another question
Seven kinds of jointed plants plants grown from joints he refers to sugarcane bamboo reeds etc
Seven kinds of gods there are many kinds of gods
but he says there are seven
Human beings too are of infinite kinds but he says there are seven
Seven kinds of demons  there are numerous kinds of demons but he says there are seven
Seven great lakes he says this mentioning the Kaamua Rathakra Anotatta Shappapta Chaddanta Mandki and Kuladaha
Jealousy and avarice Ruler of the Gods take rise from like and dislike this is their origin this is how they are born how they arise When these are present they arise when these are absent they do not arise
He describes the duration of a great aeon as the time it would take to drain a single great lake seven times by removing a single drop of water with the tip of a blade of kusagrass once every hundred years
But sir what gives rise to like and dislike Owing to the presence of what do they arise owing to the absence of what do they not arise
His theory asserts that when eightyfour hundred thousand of such great aeons have passed the foolish and the wise make an end to suffering
The wise man he says cannot purify himself before this
and the fool does not continue on beyond
They arise Ruler of the Gods from desire Owing to the presence of desire they arise owing to the absence of desire they do not arise
But sir what gives rise to desire
Desire Ruler of the Gods arises from thinking When the mind thinks about something desire arises when the mind thinks about nothing desire does not arise
But sir what gives rise to thinking
Thinking Ruler of the Gods arises from the tendency to proliferation When this tendency is present thinking arises when it is absent thinking does not arise
Well sir what practice has that monk undertaken who has reached the right way which is needful and leading to the cessation of the tendency to proliferation
By this moral discipline of the naked ascetics or by any other
Observance should be understood similarly
That the one who considers himself a wise man should ripen unripened kamma ie that he should purify himself beforehand
or eliminate ripened kamma whenever it comes up or that the one who considers himself a fool should continue on beyond the time stated to be the limits 
that cannot be
Sasras limits   can neither be shortened nor extended sasra is not shortened for the wise man nor extended for the fool
ie neither is able to do that
There is no present world no world beyond For one living in the world beyond this world does not exist and for one living in this world the world beyond does not exist He shows all are annihilated just where they are
No mother no father He says this intending that there are no fruits of right and wrong conduct towards parents
No beings who have taken rebirth  He says there are no beings who having passed away reappear 
The earth returns to and merges with the body of earth The internal earth element the external earth element
The same method with the other elements
His sense faculties pass over into space CY The six sense faculties including mind enter space
His meritorious offerings end in ashes CY The meaning is The gifts he gave such as presents gifts of honor etc all terminate in ashesThey do not go beyond yielding fruit
Fools give the wise take
An overview of the three doctrines Among these Pūraṇa with his statement By doing so there is no evil denies kamma because of his doctrine of the inefficacy of action
Ajita with his statement One is annihilated with the breakup of the body denies kammic results because he completely rejects a future rearising
Makkhali with his statement There is no cause etc denies both
By denying kamma one denies its result because there is no result when there is no kamma By denying the result one denies kamma because when there is no result kamma becomes inefficacious
Thus all these thinkers by denying both  in effect espouse acausalism  the inefficacy of action  and moral nihilism 
When people accept these theories and then recite and investigate them while sitting in their dayquarters or nightquarters wrong mindfulness becomes established taking as object  No evil is done or There is no cause or condition or The dead are annihilated The mind becomes onepointed The impulsions run their course  At the first impulsion these people are curable and so too at the second etc But at the seventh they cannot be cured even by the Buddhas they cannot be turned back
Someone might espouse one view among these three another two another three But whether one espouses one two or three views one adopts a wrong view with fixed consequences One has met an obstruction to the path to heaven and an obstruction to the path to liberation It is impossible for him to reach heaven immediately following this present existence much less to reach liberation
This being has become a stump in the round of existence a watchman of the earth Generally one like this does not emerge from existence
Therefore  Should keep far away from such harmful people As one would avoid a venomous snake
a person with discernment Desirous of his spiritual growth
The practice of giving is a doctrine of fools CY He shows Fools prescribe giving not the wise
 Unmade unfashioned Unfashioned means that they have not been constructed by anyone who commands them to be made
Uncreated without a creator Uncreated not created by supernormal power
They do not alter do not change Because they are steady standing firm like a pillar they do not alter ie do not undergo transmutation
and do not change ie do not abandon their original nature
The body of earth etc The body of earth is the earth itself or the assemblage of earth because earth is one part of the body
There is no killer etc Just as when one strikes a heap of beans with a sword the sword enters in between the beans so the sword enters the space the interstice between the seven bodies
Therein he shows I am taking his life that is only a mere idea
 A nigaha is restrained with regard to all water etc Restrained with regard to all water  he rejects the use of all cold water
It is said that he perceives sentient beings in cold water and thus does not use it
He is called a knotless one who is selfperfected etc Selfperfected  one whose mind has attained the peak
Selfcontrolled  one who has subdued his mind
Selfestablished  one whose mind is well established
In his doctrine there is something that accords with the Buddhas teaching but because his theory is not pure it is all counted as view
The doctrine of Sañjaya is explained by the method stated in the section on doctrines of endless equivocation in the commentary to the Brahmajla Sutta 
Then Sakka having expressed his appreciation asked I another question
Well sir what practice has that monk undertaken who has acquired the restraint required by the rules
Ruler of the Gods I declare that there are two kinds of bodily conduct the kind to be pursued and the kind to be avoided
The same applies to conduct of speech and
to the pursuit of goals
Why have I declared this in regard to bodily conduct
This is how I understood bodily conduct When I observed that by the performance of certain actions unwholesome factors increased and wholesome factors decreased then that form of bodily action was to be avoided
And when I observed that by the performance of such actions unwholesome factors decreased and wholesome ones increased then such bodily action was to be followed
That is why make this distinction
The same applies to conduct of speech and
the pursuit of goals
And this Ruler of the Gods is the practice that monk has undertaken who has acquired the restraint required by the rules
And Sakka expressed his delight at the Lords answer
Then Sakka asked another question
Well sir what practice has that monk undertaken who has acquired control of his sensefaculties
Ruler of the Gods I declare that things perceived by the eye are of two kinds the kind to be pursued and the kind to be avoided
The same applies to things perceived by the ear
the nose
the tongue
the body and
the mind
At this Sakka said
Lord I understand in full the true meaning of what the Blessed Lord has outlined in brief
Lord whatever object perceived by the eye if its pursuit leads to the increase of unwholesome factors and the decrease of wholesome ones that is not to be sought after
if its pursuit leads to the decrease of unwholesome factors and the increase of wholesome ones such an object is to be sought after
And the same applies to things perceived by the ear the nose the tongue the body and the mind
Thus I understand in full the true meaning of what the Blessed Lord has outlined in brief and thus through the Lords answer I have overcome my doubt and got rid of uncertainty
Then Sakka asked another question
Sir do all ascetics and Brahmins teach the same doctrine practise the same discipline want the same thing and pursue the same goal
No Ruler of the Gods they do not
But why sir do they not do so
The world Ruler of the Gods is made up of many and various elements
Such being the case beings adhere to one or other of these various things and whatever they adhere to they become powerfully addicted to and declare This alone is the truth everything else is false
Therefore they do not all teach the same doctrine practise the same discipline want the same thing pursue the same goal
Sir are all ascetics and Brahmins fully proficient freed from bonds perfect in the holy life have they perfectly reached the goal
No Ruler of the Gods
Why is that sir
Only those Ruler of the Gods who are liberated by the destruction of craving are fully proficient freed from the bonds perfect in the holy life and have perfectly reached the goal
And Sakka rejoiced at the answer as before
Then Sakka said
Passionsir is a disease a boil a dart It seduces a man drawing him into this or that state of becoming
so that he is reborn in high states or low
Whereas other ascetics and Brahmins of differing viewpoints gave me no chance to ask these questions
the Lord has instructed me at length and thus removed the dart of doubt and uncertainty from me
Ruler of the Gods do you admit to having asked the same question of other ascetics and Brahmins
Yes Lord
Then if you dont mind please tell me what they said
I do not mind telling the Blessed Lord or one like him
Then tell me Ruler of the Gods
Lord I went to those I considered to be ascetics and Brahmins because of their solitary life in the woods and I put these questions to them But instead of giving me a proper answer they asked me in return Who are you Venerable Sir
I replied that I was Sakka ruler of the gods
and they asked me what had brought me there
Then I taught them the Dhammna as far as I had heard it and practised it
But they were very pleased with even that much and they said We have seen Sakka the ruler of the gods and he has answered the questions we put to him
And they became my pupils instead of my becoming theirs
But I Lord am a disciple of the Blessed Lord a StreamWinner not subject to rebirth in states of woe firmly established and destined for full enlightenment
 Ruler of the Gods do you admit to having ever previously experienced rejoicing and happiness such as you experience now
Yes Lord
And what was that about
In the past Lord war had broken out between the gods and the asuras
and the gods had defeated the asuras
And after the battle as victor I thought Whatever is now the food of the gods and what is the food of the asuras henceforth we shall enjoy both
But Lord such happiness and satisfaction which was due to blows and wounds does not conduce to dispassion detachment cessation peace higher knowledge enlightenment Nibbana
But that happiness and satisfaction that is obtained by hearing the Dhamma from the Blessed Lord which is not due to blows and wounds does conduce to dispassion detachment cessation peace higher knowledge enlightenment Nibbana
And Ruler of the Gods what things do you call to mind when you admit to experiencing such satisfaction and happiness as this
Lord at such a time six things come to mind at which I rejoice
I who merely as a god exist have gained
The chance by kamma of another earthly life
That Lord is the first thing that occurs to me
Leaving this nonhuman realm of gods behind
Unerringly Ill seek the womb I wish to find
That Lord is the second thing
My problems solved Ill gladly live by Buddhas law
Controlled and mindful and with clear awareness filled
That Lord is the third thing
And should thereby enlightenment arise in me
As onewhoknows Ill dwell and there await my end
That Lord is the fourth thing
Then when I leave the human world again
Ill be Once more a god and one of highest rank
That Lord is the fifth thing
More glorious than devas are the Peerless
Among whom dwelling I shall make my final home
That Lord is the sixth thing that occurs to me
and these are the six things at which I rejoice
unfulfilled in doubt
I thought Hermits who live secluded and austere
What must I do to gain success and what Course but leads to failure 
Instead when they found out that I am king Of gods
And I it was who taught them what I knew Of Dhamma and at that rejoicing
But now  Ive seen the Buddha and my doubts Are all dispelled
to him whos drawn the dart Of craving to the Buddha peerless Lord
Just as Brahmas worshipped by the gods
Enlightened One and Teacher unsurpassed
Then Sakka ruler of the gods said to Pancasikha of the gandhabbas My dear Pancasikha you have been of great help to me for gaining the ear of the Blessed Lord
For it was through your gaining his ear that we were admitted to the presence of the Blessed Lord the Arahant the supremely enlightened Buddha
I will be a father to you you shall be king of the gandhabbas and I will give you Bhadda Suriyavaccasa whom you desired
And then Sakka ruler of the gods touched the earth with his hand and called out three times Homage to the Blessed One the Arahant the supremely enlightened Buddha Homage to the Blessed One the Arahant the supremely enlightened Buddha Homage to the Blessed One the Arahant the supremely enlightened Buddha
And while he had been speaking in this dialogue the pure and spotless DhammaEye arose within Sakka ruler of the gods and he knew Whatever things have an origin must come to cessation
And the same thing happened to eighty thousand devas as well Such were the questions which Sakka ruler of the gods was desirous to ask and which the Lord answered for him
Therefore this discourse is called Sakkas Questions
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Now a number of bhikkhus were sitting in the assembly hall where they had met together on returning from their almsround after their meal when this discussion arose among them It is wonderful friends it is marvellous how mighty and powerful is the Tathagata For he is able to know about the Buddhas of the past  who attained to final Nibbana cut the tangle of proliferation broke the cycle ended the round and surmounted all suffering  that for those Blessed Ones their birth was thus their names were thus their clans were thus their virtue was thus their state of concentration was thus their wisdom was thus their abiding in attainments was thus their deliverance was thus
When this was said the venerable Ananda told the bhikkhus Friends Tathagatas are wonderful and have wonderful qualities Tathagatas are marvellous and have marvellous qualities
However their discussion was interrupted
Then he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus for what discussion are you sitting together here now And what was your discussion that was interrupted 
Here venerable sir we were sitting in the assembly hall where we had met together on returning from our almsround after our meal when this discussion arose among us It is wonderful friends it is marvellous their deliverance was thus
Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda That being so Ananda explain more fully the Tathagatas wonderful and marvellous qualities
I heard and learned this venerable sir from the Blessed Ones own lips Mindful and fully aware Ananda the Bodhisatta appeared in the Tusita heaven
That mindful and fully aware the Bodhisatta appeared in the Tusita heaven  this I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
I heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips Mindful and fully aware the Bodhisatta remained in the Tusita heaven
I heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips For the whole of his lifespan the Bodhisatta remained in the Tusita heaven
I heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips Mindful and fully aware the Bodhisatta passed away from the Tusita heaven and descended into his mothers womb
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
I heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta passed away from the Tusita heaven and descended into his mothers womb
And the beings born there perceived each other by that light So other beings indeed have appeared here And this tenthousandfold world system shook and quaked and trembled and there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods appeared
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
I heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta had descended into his mothers womb four young deities came to guard him at the four quarters so that no humans or nonhumans or anyone at all could harm the Bodhisatta or his mother
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
I heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta had descended into his mothers womb she became intrinsically virtuous refraining from killing living beings from taking what is not given from misconduct in sensual pleasures from false speech and from wines liquors and intoxicants which are the basis of negligence
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
I heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta had descended into his mothers womb no sensual thought arose in her concerning men and she was inaccessible to any man having a lustful mind
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
I heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta had descended into his mothers womb she obtained the five cords of sensual pleasure
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
I heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta had descended into his mothers womb no kind of affliction arose in her she was blissful and free from bodily fatigue She saw the Bodhisatta within her womb with all his limbs lacking no faculty
Suppose a blue yellow red white or brown thread were strung through a fine beryl gem of purest water eightfaceted well cut
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
I heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips Seven days after the birth of the Bodhisatta his mother died and reappeared in the Tusita heaven
I heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips Other women give birth after carrying the child in the womb for nine or ten months but not so the Bodhisattas mother
The Bodhisattas mother gave birth after carrying him in her womb for exactly ten months
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
I heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips Other women give birth seated or lying down but not so the Bodhisattas mother
The Bodhisattas mother gave birth to him standing up
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
I heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta came forth from his mothers womb first gods received him then human beings
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
I heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta came forth from his mothers womb he did not touch the earth The four young gods received him and set him before his mother saying Rejoice O queen a son of great power has been born to you
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
I heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta came forth from his mothers womb he came forth unsullied unsmeared by water or humours or blood or any kind of impurity clean and unsullied
Suppose there were a gem placed on Kasi cloth then the gem would not smear the cloth or the cloth the gem
Why is that
Because of the purity of both
So too when the Bodhisatta came forthclean and unsullied
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
I heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta came forth from his mothers womb two jets of water appeared to pour from the sky one cool and one warm for bathing the Bodhisatta and his mother
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
I heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips As soon as the Bodhisatta was born he stood firmly with his feet on the ground then he took seven steps north and with a white parasol held over him he surveyed each quarter and uttered the words of the Leader of the Herd I am the highest in the world I am the best in the world I am the foremost in the world
This is my last birth now there is no renewal of being for me
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
I heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta came forth from his mothers womb then a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods appeared in the world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas in this generation with its recluses and brahmins with its princes and its people
And even in those abysmal world interspaces of vacancy gloom and utter darkness where the moon and the sun mighty and powerful as they are cannot make their light prevail  there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods appeared
And the beings born there perceived each other by that light So other beings indeed have appeared here
And this tenthousandfold world system shook and quaked and trembled and there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods appeared
That being so Ananda remember this too as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Tathagata
Venerable sir since for the Blessed One feelings are known as they arise as they are present as they disappear perceptions are known as they arise as they are present as they disappear thoughts are known as they arise as they are present as they disappear
That is what the venerable Ananda said
The Teacher approved
for the Blessed One rose from meditation when it was evening went to the assembly hall and sat down on a seat made ready
When this was said venerable sir the venerable Ananda said to us Friends Tathagatas are wonderful and have wonderful qualities Tathagatas are marvellous and have marvellous qualities
This was our discussion venerable sir that was interrupted when the Blessed One arrived
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
then a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods appeared in the world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas in this generation with its recluses and brahmins with its princes and its people
And even in those abysmal world interspaces of vacancy gloom and utter darkness where the moon and the sun mighty and powerful as they are cannot make their light prevail  there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods appeared
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
and furnished and endowed with them she enjoyed herself with them
and a man with good sight were to take it in his hand and review it thus This is a fine beryl gem of purest water eightfaceted well cut and through it is strung a blue yellow red white or brown thread
and a man with good sight were to take it in his hand and review it thus This is a fine beryl gem of purest water eightfaceted well cut and through it is strung a blue yellow red white or brown thread
so too when the Bodhisatta had descended into his mothers wombshe saw the Bodhisatta within her womb with all his limbs lacking no faculty
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
That when the Bodhisatta came forth from his mothers womb then a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods appearedthis too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
Here Ananda for fhe Tathagata feelings are known as they arise as they are present as they disappear perceptions are known as they arise as they are present as they disappear thoughts are known as they arise as they are present as they disappear
Remember this too Ananda as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Tathagata
 this too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the venerable Anandas words
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this Bhikkhus a bhikkhu who is an inquirer not knowing how to gauge anothers mind should make an investigation of the Tathagata in order to find out whether or not he is fully enlightened
Venerable sir our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One guided by the Blessed One have the Blessed One as their resort It would be good if the Blessed One would explain the meaning of these words Having heard it from the Blessed One the bhikkhus will remember it
Then listen bhikkhus and attend closely to what I shall say
Yes venerable sir the bhikkhus replied
The Blessed One said this
Bhikkhus a bhikkhu who is an inquirer not knowing how to gauge anothers mind should investigate the Tathagata with respect to two kinds of states states cognizable through the eye and through the ear thus Are there found in the Tathagata or not any defiled states cognizable through the eye or through the ear
When he investigates him he comes to know No defiled states cognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the Tathagata
When he comes to know this he investigates him further thus Are there found in the Tathagata or not any mixed states cognizable through the eye or through the ear 
When he investigates him he comes to know No mixed states cognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the Tathagata
When he comes to know this he investigates him further thus Are there found in the Tathagata or not cleansed states cognizable through the eye or through the ear
 When he investigates him he comes to know Cleansed states cognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the Tathagata
When he comes to know this he investigates him further thus Has this venerable one attained this wholesome state over a long time or did he attain it recently
 When he investigates him he comes to know This venerable one has attained this wholesome state over a long time he did not attain it only recently
When he comes to know this he investigates him further thus Has this venerable one acquired renown and attained fame so that the dangers connected with renown and fame are found in him
When he comes to know this he investigates him further thus Is this venerable one restrained without fear not restrained by fear and does he avoid indulging in sensual pleasures because he is without lust through the destruction of lust 
When he investigates him he comes to know This venerable one is restrained without fear not restrained by fear and he avoids indulging in sensual pleasure because he is without lust through the destruction of lust
Now bhikkhus if others should ask that bhikkhu thus What are the venerable ones reasons and what is his evidence whereby he says That venerable one is restrained without fear not restrained by fear and he avoids indulging in sensual pleasures because he is without lust through the destruction of lust
  answering rightly that bhikkhu would answer thus Whether that venerable one dwells in the Sangha or alone while some there are wellbehaved and some are illbehavedand some there teach a group while some here are seen concerned about material things and some are unsullied by material things still that venerable one does not despise anyone because of that
The Tathagata bhikkhus should be questioned further about that thus Are there found in the Tathagata or not any defiled states cognizable through the eye or through the ear
 The Tathagata would answer thus No defiled states cognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the Tathagata
If asked Are there found in the Tathagata or not any mixed states cognizable through the eye or through the ear
the Tathagata would answer thus No mixed states cognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the Tathagata
If asked Are there found in the Tathagata or not cleansed states cognizable through the eye or through the ear
the Tathagata would answer thus Cleansed states cognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the Tathagata They are my pathway and my domain yet I do not identify with them
Bhikkhus a disciple should approach the Teacher who speaks thus in order to hear the Dhamma
The Teacher teaches him the Dhamma with its higher and higher levels with its more and more sublime levels with its dark and bright counterparts
Now if others should ask that bhikkhu thus What are the venerable ones reasons and what is his evidence whereby he says The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha is practising the good way
 answering rightly that bhikkhu would answer thus Here friends I approached the Blessed One in order to hear the Dhamma
The Blessed One taught me the Dhamma with its higher and higher levels with its more and more sublime levels with its dark and bright counterparts
As the Blessed One taught the Dhamma to me in this way through direct knowledge of a certain teaching here in that Dhamma I came to a conclusion about the teachings I placed confidence in the Teacher thus The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha is practising the good way
Bhikkhus when anyones faith has been planted rooted and established in the Tathagata through these reasons terms and phrases his faith is said to be supported by reasons rooted in vision firm it is invincible by any recluse or brahmin or god or Mara or Brahma or by anyone in the world
That is how bhikkhus there is an investigation of the Tathagata in accordance with the Dhamma
That is what the Blessed One said
For bhikkhus as long as a bhikkhu has not acquired renown and attained fame the dangers connected with renown and fame are not found in him
but when he has acquired renown and attained fame those dangers are found in him
When he investigates him he comes to know This venerable one has acquired renown and attained fame but the dangers connected with renown and fame are not found in him
And I have heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own leeps I am restrained without fear not restrained by fear and I avoid indulging in sensual pleasures because I am without lust through the destruction of lust
As the Teacher teaches the Dhamma to a bhikkhu in this way through direct knowledge of a certain teaching here in that Dhamma the bhikkhu comes to a conclusion about the teachings He places confidence in the Teacher thus The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha is practising the good way
and that is how the Tathagata is well investigated in accordance with the Dhamma
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and eventually he arrived at a Kosalan brahmin village named Opasada 
There the Blessed One stayed in the Gods Grove the Salatree Grove to the north of Opasada 
Now on that occasion the brahmin Canki was ruling over Opasada a crown property abounding in living beings rich in grasslands woodlands waterways and grain a royal endowment a sacred grant given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala 
The brahmin householders of Opasada heard The recluse Gotama
Then the brahmin householders of Opasada set forth from Opasada in groups and bands and headed northwards to the Gods Grove the Salatree Grove 
Now on that occasion the brahmin Canki had retired to the upper storey of his palace for his midday rest 
Then he saw the brahmin householders of Opasada setting forth from Opasada in groups and bands and heading northwards to the Gods Grove the Salatree Grove 
When he saw them he asked his minister Good minister why are the brahmin householders of Opasada setting forth from Opasada in groups and bands are heading northwards to the Gods Grove the Salatree Grove  
Sir there is the recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan who has been wandering in the Kosalan country
Then good minister go to the brahmin householders of Opasada and tell them Sirs the brahmin Canki says this Please wait sirs  The brahmin Canki will also go to see the recluse Gotama 
Yes sir the minister replied and he went to the brahmin householders of Opasada and gave them the message 
Now on that occasion five hundred brahmins from various states were staying at Opasada for some business or other 
They heard The brahmin Canki it is said is going to see the recluse Gotama 
Then they went to the brahmin Canki and asked him Sir is it true that you are going to see the recluse Gotama 
So it is sirs  I am going to see the recluse Gotama 
Sir do not go to see the recluse Gotama 
It is not proper Master Canki for you to go to see the recluse Gotama rather it is proper for the recluse Gotama to come to see you 
For you sir are well born on both sides of pure maternal and paternal descent seven generations back unassailable and impeccable in respect of birth 
Since that is so Master Canki it is not proper for you to go to see the recluse Gotama rather it is proper for the recluse Gotama to come to see you 
You sir are rich with great wealth and great possessions  You sir are a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies liturgy phonology and etymology and the histories as a fifth skilled in philology and grammar you are fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man  You sir are handsome comely and graceful possessing supreme beauty of complexion with sublime beauty and sublime presence remarkable to behold  You sir are virtuous mature in virtue possessing mature virtue  You sir are a good speaker with a good delivery you speak words that are courteous distinct flawless and communicate the meaning  You sir teach the teachers of many and you teach the recitation of the hymns to three hundred brahmin students  You sir are honoured respected revered venerated and esteemed by King Pasenadi of Kosala  You sir are honoured respected revered venerated and esteemed by the brahmin Pokkharasati You sir rule over Opasada a crown property abounding in living beings  a sacred grant given to you by King Pasenadi of Kosala 
Since this is so Master Canki it is not proper for you to go to see the recluse Gotama rather it is proper for the recluse Gotama to come to see you 
When this was said the brahmin Canki told those brahmins Now sirs hear from me why it is proper for me to go to see Master Gotama and why it is not proper for Master Gotama to come to see me 
Sirs the recluse Gotama is well born on both sides of pure maternal and paternal descent seven generations back unassailable and impeccable in respect of birth 
Since this is so sirs it is not proper for Master Gotama to come to see me rather it is proper for me to go to see Master Gotama 
Sirs the recluse Gotama went forth abandoning much gold and bullion stored away in vaults and depositories  Sirs the recluse Gotama went forth from the home life into homelessness while still young a blackhaired young man endowed with the blessing of youth in the prime of life  Sirs the recluse Gotama shaved off his hair and beard put on the yellow robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness though his mother and father wished otherwise and wept with tearful faces  Sirs the recluse Gotama is handsome comely and graceful possessing supreme beauty of complexion with sublime beauty and sublime presence remarkable to behold  Sirs the recluse Gotama is virtuous with noble virtue with wholesome virtue possessing wholesome virtue  Sirs the recluse Gotama is a good speaker with a good delivery he speaks words that are courteous distinct flawless and communicate the meaning  Sirs the recluse Gotama is a teacher of the teachers of many  Sirs the recluse Gotama is free from sensual lust and without personal vanity  Sirs the recluse Gotama holds the doctrine of the moral efficacy of action the doctrine of the moral efficacy of deeds he does not seek any harm for the line of brahmins  Sirs the recluse Gotama went forth from an aristocratic family from one of the original noble families  Sirs the recluse Gotama went forth from a rich family from a family of great wealth and great possessions  Sirs people come from remote kingdoms and remote districts to question the recluse Gotama  Sirs many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama  Sirs a good report of the recluse Gotama has been spread to this effect That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessed  Sirs the recluse Gotama possesses the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man  Sirs King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha and his wife and children have gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama  Sirs King Pasenadi of Kosala and his wife and children have gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama  Sirs the brahmin Pokkharasati and his wife and children have gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama  Sirs the recluse Gotama has arrived at Opasada and is living at Opasada in the Gods Grove the Salatree Grove to the north of Opasada 
Now any recluses or brahmins that come to our town are our guests
Since the recluse Gotama has arrived at Opasada he is our guest and as our guest should be honoured respected revered and venerated by us 
Since this is so sirs it is not proper for Master Gotama to come to see me rather it is proper for me to go to see Master Gotama 
Sirs this much is the praise of Master Gotama that I have learned but the praise of Master Gotama is not limited to that for the praise of Master Gotama is immeasurable 
Then the brahmin Canki together with a large company of brahmins went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him 
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side 
Now on that occasion the Blessed One was seated finishing some amiable talk with some very senior brahmins 
At the time sitting in the assembly was a brahmin student named Kapathika  Young shavenheaded sixteen years old he was a master of the Three Yedas with their vocabularies liturgy phonology and etymology and the histories as a fifth skilled in philology and grammar he was fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man 
Then the Blessed One rebuked the brahmin student Kapathika thus Let not the venerable Bharadvaja break in and interrupt the talk of the very senior brahmins while they are conversing 
Let the venerable Bharadvaja wait until the talk is finished 
When this was said the brahmin Canki said to the Blessed One Let not Master Gotama rebuke the brahmin student Kapathika 
The brahmin student Kapathika is a clansman he is very learned he has a good delivery he is wise he is capable of taking part in this discussion with Master Gotama 
Then the Blessed One thought Surely since the brahmins honour him thus the brahmin student Kapathika must be accomplished in the scriptures of the Three Vedas 
Then the brahmin student Kapathika thought When the recluse Gotama catches my eye I shall ask him a question 
Then knowing with his own mind the thought in the brahmin student Kapathikas mind the Blessed One turned his eye towards him 
Then the brahmin student Kapathika thought The recluse Gotama has turned towards me 
Suppose I ask him a question 
Then he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama in regard to the ancient brahmanic hymns that have come down through oral transmission and in the scriptural collections the brahmins come to the definite conclusion Only this is true anything else is wrong 
What does Master Gotama say about this  
How then Bharadvaja among the brahmins is there even a single brahmin who says thus I know this I see this only this is true
  No Master Gotama 
How then Bharadvaja among the brahmins is there even a single teacher or a single teachers teacher back to the seventh generation of teachers who says thus I know this I see this only this is true
  No Master Gotama 
How then Bharadvaja the ancient brahmin seers the creators of the hymns the composers of the hymns whose ancient hymns that were formerly chanted uttered and compiled the brahmins nowadays still chant and repeat repeating what was spoken and reciting what was recited  that is Atthaka Vamaka Vamadeva Vessamitta Yamataggi Angirasa Bharadvaja Vasettha Kassapa and Bhagu  did even these ancient brahmin seers say thus We know this we see this only this is true
  No Master Gotama 
So Bharadvaja it seems that among the brahmins there is not even a single brahmin who says thus I know this I see this only this is true anything else is wrong 
And among the brahmins there is not even a single teacher or a single teachers teacher back to the seventh generation of teachers who says thus I know this I see this only this is true anything else is wrong 
And the ancient brahmin seers the creators of the hymns the composers of the hymnseven these ancient brahmin seers did not say thus We know this we see this only this is true anything else is wrong 
Suppose there were a file of blind men each in touch with the next the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not see  So too Bharadvaja in regard to their statement the brahmins seem to be like a file of blind men the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not see 
What do you think Bharadvaja that being so does not the faith of the brahmins turn out to be groundless  
The brahmins honour this not only out of faith Master Gotama  They also honour it as oral tradition 
Bharadvaja first you took your stand on faith now you speak of oral tradition 
There are five things Bharadvaja that may turn out in two different ways here and now
Faith approval oral tradition reasoned cogitation and reflective acceptance of a view These five things may turn out in two different ways here and now 
Now something may be fully accepted out of faith yet it may be empty hollow and false but something else may not be fully accepted out of faith yet it may be factual true and unmistaken 
Again something may be fully approved ofmay be well cogitatedmay be well reflected upon yet it may be empty hollow and false but something else may not be well reflected upon yet it may be factual true and unmistaken 
Under these conditions it is not proper for a wise man who preserves truth to come to the definite conclusion Only this is true anything else is wrong 
But Master Gotama in what way is there the preservation of truth  How does one preserve truth 
We ask Master Gotama about the preservation of truth 
If a person has faith Bharadvaja he preserves truth when he says My faith is thus but he does not yet come to the definite conclusion Only this is true anything else is wrong 
In this way Bharadvaja there is the preservation of truth in this way he preserves truth in this way we describe the preservation of truth  But as yet there is no discovery of truth If a person approves of something if he receives an oral tradition if he reaches a conclusion based on reasoned cogitation if he gams a reflective acceptance of a view he preserves truth when he says My reflective acceptance of a view is thus but he does not yet come to the definite conclusion Only this is true anything else is wrong 
In this way too Bharadvaja there is the preservation of truth in this way he preserves truth in this way we describe the preservation of truth  But as yet there is no discovery of truth 
In that way Master Gotama there is the preservation of truth in that way one preserves truth in that way we recognise the preservation of truth 
But in what way Master Gotama is there the discovery of truth  In what way does one discover truth 
We ask Master Gotama about the discovery of truth 
Here Bharadvaja a bhikkhu may be living in dependence on some village or town
And the Dhamma that this venerable one teaches is profound hard to see and hard to understand peaceful and sublime unattainable by mere reasoning subtle to be experienced by the wise 
This Dhamma cannot easily be taught by one affected by greed 
When he has investigated him and has seen that he is purified from states based on greed he next investigates him in regard to states based on hate

In this way Bharadvaja there is the discovery of truth in this way one discovers truth in this way we describe the discovery of truth  But as yet there is no final arrival at truth 
In that way Master Gotama there is the discovery of truth in that way one discovers truth in that way we recognise the discovery of truth 
But in what way Master Gotama is there the final arrival at truth  In what way does one finally arrive at truth 
We ask Master Gotama about the final arrival at truth 
The final arrival at truth Bharadvaja lies in the repetition development and cultivation of those same things 
In this way Bharadvaja there is the final arrival at truth in this way one finally arrives at truth in this way we describe the final arrivalat truth 
In that way Master Gotama there is the final arrival at truth in that way one finally arrives at truth in that way we recognise the final arrival at truth 
But what Master Gotama is most helpful for the final arrival at truth 
We ask Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for the final arrival at truth 
Striving is most helpful for the final arrival at truth Bharadvaja

We ask Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for zeal 
A reflective acceptance of the teachings is most helpful for zeal Bharadvaja 
If one does not gain a reflective acceptance of the teachings zeal will not spring up
That is why a reflective acceptance of the teachings is most helpful for zeal 
But what Master Gotama is most helpful for a reflective acceptance of the teachings 
We ask Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for a reflective acceptance of the teachings 
Examination of the meaning is most helpful for a reflective acceptance of the teachings Bharadvaja

Hearing the Dhamma is most helpful for memorising the teachings Bharadvaja 
If one does not hear the Dhamma one will not memorise the teachings

Formerly Master Gotama we used to think Who are these baldpated recluses these swarthy menial offspring of the Kinsmans feet that they would understand the Dhamma 
 But Master Gotama has indeed inspired in me love for recluses confidence in recluses reverence for recluses 
Magnificent Master Gotama  Magnificent Master Gotama  From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life 
Now it is good see such arahants 
They are going to see that Master Gotama 
Since Master Gotama possesses each one of these factors it is not proper for him to come to see me rather it is proper for me to go to see Master Gotama 
Therefore sirs let all of us go to see the recluse Gotama 
and guests should be honoured respected revered and venerated by us 
While the very senior brahmins were conversing with the Blessed One he often broke in and interrupted their talk 
anything else is wrong 
anything else is wrong 
anything else is wrong 
What five 
Then a householder or a householders son goes to him and investigates him in regard to three kinds of states in regard to states based on greed in regard to states based on hate and in regard to states based on delusion
Are there in this venerable one any states based on greed such that with his mind obsessed by those states while not knowing he might say I know or while not seeing he might say I see or he might urge others to act in a way that would lead to their harm and suffering for a long time 
 As he investigates him he comes to know There are no such states based on greed in this venerable one  The bodily behaviour and the verbal behaviour of this venerable one are not those of one affected by greed 
Are there in this venerable one any states based on hate such that with his mind obsessed by those stateshe might urge others to act in a way that would lead to their harm and suffering for a long time 
Are there in this venerable one any states based on delusion such that with his mind obsessed by those stateshe might urge others to act in a way that would lead to their harm and suffering for a long time 
That is why striving is most helpful for the final arrival at truth 
but because one scrutinises one strives 
but because one applies ones will one scrutinises 
but because one arouses zeal one applies ones will 
but because one gains a reflective acceptance of the teachings zeal springs up 
but because one examines their meaning one gains a reflective acceptance of the teachings 
but because one memorises a teaching one examines its meaning 
but because one hears the Dhamma one memorises the teachings 
but because one gives ear one hears the Dhamma 
but because one pays respect one gives ear 
but because one visits a teacher one pays respect to him 
but because faith in a teacher arises one visits him 
 So venerable sir I ask the Exalted One The meaning is Just as one cannot obtain oil by grinding sand so I did not obtain anything essential from the doctrines of the six sectarian religious teachers Thus I ask the Exalted One
 Let me then shave off my hair and beard He shows the thought behind the slaves eagerness to go forth to be as follows If I were to practice giving in my whole life I would not be able to give even a hundredth part of what the king gives in a single day Therefore I will go forth
Content with the simplest food and shelter Having abandoned improper ways of seeking  he is content through the highest effacement
Delighting in solitude He delights in the three kinds of solitude stated thus There is bodily solitude for those dwelling in physical solitude there is mental solitude for those delighting in renunciation for those who attain to the highest cleansing and there is ultimate solitude for those persons free from the acquisitions for those who have gone beyond formations  One person dwells alone in body having abandoned the company of a group One dwells alone by way of the eight meditative attainments having abandoned the company of the mental defilements And one dwells alone having attained Nibbna having entered the attainment of fruition or the attainment of cessation
 Listen great king and attend carefully Here the word listen is an injunction to ward off distraction in the earfaculty
The former is for preventing a distorted grasp of the phrasing the latter for preventing a distorted grasp of the meaning
When a Tathgata arises in the world of beings he does not arise in the world of the gods or in the Brahmaworld but only in the human world
He does not arise in other worldsystems within the human world but only in this one
and here too not everywhere
By the phrase  its Mras the gods of the sixth sensesphere heaven are included
By the phrase  its Brahms the Brahms such as those of Brahms retinue etc are included
The phrase with its recluses and brahmins includes both those recluses and brahmins who are hostile and opposed to the Buddhas dispensation and those who have truly stilled and expelled evil
The phrase this generation includes the world of sentient beings
Thus by the first three phrases here the world of beings along with the physical world is included
Another method By mentioning with its gods the gods of the immaterial world are included
Further by the phrase with its gods the Buddha speaks of his realization of the entire world delimiting it by the highest plane for among the five destinations the planes included in the destination of the gods are best among these the immaterial planes are very excellent due to their special qualities such as the removal of the suffering of the defilements their endowment with peaceful sublime and imperturbable dwellings and their extremely long lifespan
But some might think Mra is very powerfulhe is the ruler and master of the six sensesphere heavens What has the Buddha realized him too Dispelling their doubts he says  its Mras
Still others might think Brahm is very powerful With his ten fingers he radiates light over the ten thousandfold worldsystems
and he experiences the unsurpassed bliss of the jhnic attainments What has he realized him too Dispelling their doubts he says  its Brahms
Then some think There are many recluses and brahmins opposed to the dispensation What has he realized them too Dispelling their doubts he says With its recluses and brahmins
Thus here is the sequence of terms stated by way of state by way of the mental inclinations of others
But the Ancients say that the phrase with its gods indicates the rest of the world together with the gods
Thus with these three phrases he includes all beings found in the three planes of existence presenting them under three different aspects and with the next two phrasesthis generation with its recluses and brahmins its rulers and peoplehe again exhaustively treats the world
Thus with these five phrases the three realms of existence are exhaustively presented under different aspects
He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning etc Out of compassion for sentient beings the Exalted One even leaves the unsurpassed happiness of solitude and teaches the Dhamma
And whether he teaches much or little the Dhamma he teaches has the quality of being good in the beginning etc
An teaching has a beginning a middle and an end and the dispensation as a whole has a beginning a middle and an end
With regard to a teaching even in a verse of four lines the first line is the beginning the two lines following it the middle and the last line the end
In a sutta with a single sequence of meaning the introduction is the beginning the phrase Thus spoke the Exalted One is the end and what comes in between these is the middle
In a sutta with several sequences of meaning the first sequence is the beginning the final sequence is the end and what comes in betweenwhether one two or manyis the middle
With regard to the dispensation moral discipline concentration and insight are the beginning
For it is said What is the starting point of wholesome states
Wellpurified moral discipline and straight view 
And since it is said There is bhikkhus a middle way awakened to by the Tathgata  the noble path is the middle
And the end is the fruit and Nibbna
The fruit is called the end in the following passage This is the goal of the holy life this is its essence this is its end 
And Nibbna is called the end in this passage Friend Viskha the holy life plunges into Nibbna Nibbna is its final resort Nibbna is its end 
Here the beginning middle and end intended are those of the teaching
For when the Exalted One teaches the Dhamma he teaches it showing moral discipline in the beginning the path in the middle and Nibbna in the end
But the Exalted One teaches without regard for worldly ends with a heart made gentle by the development of loving kindness suffused with the welfare of others with a mind established in delivering others ie with a mind of compassionate intention fixed in the mode of lifting others up from all defilements and from the suffering of the round
Therefore he teaches a purified Dhamma
He reveals the holy life The word holy life is found with the following meanings giving service the moral discipline of the five precepts the four immeasurable states abstinence from sexual intercourse contentment with ones own marital partner energy the factors of the Uposatha observance the noble path and the entire dispensation
Here it is used to mean the dispensation
Thus the passage under consideration should be understood as follows He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning etc  fully complete and purified
Because they are humble and because they are predominant
Generally when those from noble families go forth they become conceited because of their birth
When those from brahmin families go forth they become conceited because of their knowledge of the mantras
When those from lowclass families go forth they are not able to establish themselves well because of their low birth
But householders boys who plough the earth with sweat flowing from their armpits and backs glistening with perspiration lack such conceit thus they are humble and free from pride
When they go forth they do not become proud and conceited rather to the best of their ability they learn the entire word of the Buddha do the work of insight and establish themselves in arahatship
And those who renounce and go forth from other families are not numerous whereas those from householder families are
Thus because they are humble and because they are predominant householders are mentioned first
The household life is crowded a path of dust Even if a couple husband and wife live in a house sixty cubits on an estate of a hundred yojanas household life is still crowded in the sense that it involves obstacles such as lust etc and impediments such as fields land etc
It is a path of dust that is a path for the arising of the dust of lust etc Going forth is like the open air It is like the open air in the sense of being unhindered
For even if one gone forth is living in a gabled cottage a jewel ornamented mansion or a celestial palace etc with closed doors and windows covered by a roof he is unhindered unattached unbound
Going forth is like the open air in that it gives opportunity for wholesome activity as much as one pleases
The perfectly complete perfectly purified holy life The holy life of the threefold training is perfectly complete because it is to be accomplished up to the last moment of consciousness making it unbroken even for a single day It is perfectly purified because it is to be accomplished up to the last moment of consciousness making it untainted by the taint of defilements even for a single day
 He comes to be endowed with wholesome bodily and verbal action his livelihood is purified When proper behavior and resort are mentioned wholesome bodily and verbal action are included However the moral discipline of purified livelihood does not arise in space or among the treetops but in the doors of body and speech Therefore in order to show the doors where it arises it is said He comes to be endowed with wholesome bodily and verbal action
And since he is endowed with that his livelihood is purified
the words attend carefully are an injunction to strengthen attention to ward off distraction in the mindfaculty
By the former he enjoins one to listen to the Dhamma by the latter to retain in mind the Dhamma that has been heard to examine it etc
By the former he shows This Dhamma possesses phrasing  therefore it should be heard
By the latter he shows It possesses meaning  therefore it should be carefully attended to
Or else the word carefully can be construed with both words thus Since this Dhamma is deep in doctrine and deep in teaching listen carefully Since it is deep in meaning and deep in penetration attend to it carefully
Herein great king a tathgata arises in the world There are three kinds of world the physical world the world of sentient beings and the world of formations
here the world of sentient beings is intended
Not only Tathgatas but paccekabuddhas chief disciples the eighty great elders the mothers and fathers of Buddhas worldruling monarchs and other prominent brahmins and householders arise only here
From the time the Tathgata was offered the meal of honey and milkrice by Sujt up to the time he reached the path of arahatship he is said to have been arising With the attainment of the fruit of arahatship he is said to have arisen
Or alternatively from the time of his great renunciation
This world with its gods etc Therein by the phrase with its gods the gods of the lower five sensesphere heavens are included
or from the time the Tusita heaven
or from the time at the feet of the Buddha Dpakara up to the time he reached the path of arahatship he is said to have been arising and with the attainment of the fruit of arahatship he is said to have arisen
Here the word arises signifies the state of having arisen explained in the first case
Thus the meaning is A Tathgata has arisen in the world
 but only in the middle region 
and the phrase with its rulers and people includes conventional gods and the rest of humanity
by the word generation with its two qualifying phrases the world of beings only is included
by mentioning  its Mras the gods of the six sensesphere heavenly worlds are included
by mentioning  its Brahms the gods of the finematerial Brahmaworld are included
by mentioning  with its recluses and brahmins etc the human world with its conventional gods and its four social orders or all the rest of the world of beings is included
Thus having revealed his realization of the most excellent states with the phrases with its rulers and its people he reveals his realization of the rest of the world of beings delimiting it by way of its most excellent members with the reference to conventional gods and the rest of humanity
 its Mras the rest of the world together with Mra
and  its Brahms the rest of the world together with Brahm
Having realized by his own direct knowledge By this phrase inferential knowledge etc are rejected
He teaches making it good lovely faultless in the beginning in the middle and in the end
Thus it is said He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end
Therefore other preachers of the Dhamma also explain the Dhamma in this way
Possessing meaning and phrasing  One whose teaching is concerned with explanations of food men women etc does not teach in a way possessing meaning
But the Exalted One having abandoned such kinds of teaching presents a teaching concerned with the four foundations of mindfulness etc
Therefore he teaches the Dhamma possessing meaning
One whose teaching lacks the complete variety of phrases or who confuses the various kinds of sounds is said to have a teaching that is without phrasing But the Exalted One teaches the Dhamma making it complete in phrasing without slurring together any of the distinct kinds of soundTherefore he teaches the Dhamma possessing phrasing
Fully complete and purified It is fully complete because there is nothing deficient in it and nothing excessive nothing to add or to remove
it is purified because it is without corruption
In the case of one who teaches his doctrine with the intention of obtaining honor and gain the teaching is impure
And teaching it thus he reveals the holy life the entire dispensation comprised in the threefold training 
 A householder or a householders son Why does he mention householders first
Further household life is crowded because it gives little opportunity for wholesome activity
and it is a path of dust because like an unchecked dustheap it is a place where dust collects ie the dust of the defilements
THUS HAVE I HEARDOn one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Sakyan country at Samagama
 Now on that occasion the Nigantha Nataputta had just died at Pava
How could you understand this Dhamma and Discipline
Your way is wrong My way is right
I am consistent You are inconsistent
What should have been said first you said last What should have been said last you said first
What you had so carefully thought up has been turned inside out
Your assertion has been shown up
You are refuted Go and learn better or disentangle yourself if you can
 It seemed as if there were nothing but slaughter among the Nigantha Nataputtas pupils
And his whiteclothed lay disciples were disgusted dismayed and disappointed with the Nigantha Nataputtas pupils as they were with his badly proclaimed and badly expounded Dhamma and Discipline which was unemancipating unconducive to peace expounded by one not fully enlightened and was now with its shrine broken leftwithout a refuge
Then the novice Cunda who had spent the Rains at Pava went to the venerable Ananda and after paying homage to him he sat down at one side and told him what was taking place
The venerable Ananda then said to the novice Cunda Friend Cunda this is news that should be told to the Blessed One
Come let us approach the Blessed One and tell him this
Yes venerable sir the novice Cunda replied
Then the venerable Ananda and the novice Cunda went together to the Blessed One
After paying homage to him they sat down at one side
On his death the Niganthas divided split into twoand is now with its shrine broken left without a refuge
I thought venerable sir Let no dispute arise in the Sangha when the Blessed One has gone For such a dispute would be for the harm and unhappiness of many for the loss harm and suffering of gods and humans
What do you think Ananda These things that I have taught you after directly knowing them  that is the four foundations of mindfulness the four right kinds of striving the four bases for spiritual power the five faculties the five powers the seven enlightenment factors the Noble Eightfold Path  do you see Ananda even two bhikkhus who make differing assertions about these things
No venerable sir I do not see even two bhikkhus who make differing assertions about these things
But venerable sir there are people who live deferential towards the Blessed One who might when he has gone create a dispute in the Sangha aboutlivelihood and about the Patimokkha
Such a dispute would be for the harm and unhappiness of many for the loss harm and suffering of gods and humans
But should a dispute arise in the Sangha about the path or the way such a dispute would be for the harm and unhappiness of many for the loss harm and suffering of gods and humans
Here Ananda a bhikkhu is angry and revengeful
Such a bhikkhu dwells disrespectful and undeferential towards the Teacher towards the Dhamma and towards the Sangha and he does not fulfil the training
A bhikkhu who dwells disrespectful and undeferential towards the Teacher towards the Dhamma and towards the Sangha and who does not fulfil the training creates a dispute in the Sangha which would be for the harm and unhappiness of many for the loss harm and suffering of gods and humans
Now if you see any such root of dispute either in yourselves or externally you should strive to abandon that same evil root of dispute
And if you do not see any such root of dispute either in yourselves or externally you should practise in such a way that that same evil root of dispute does not erupt in the future
Thus there is the abandoning of that evil root of dispute
Again a bhikkhu is contemptuous and domineering envious and avaricious deceitful and fraudulent has evil wishes and wrong view adheres to his own views holds on to them tenaciously and relinquishes them with difficulty
Such a bhikkhu dwells disrespectful and undeferential towards the Teacher towards the Dhamma and towards the Sangha and he does not fulfil the training
A bhikkhu who dwells disrespectful and undeferential towards the Teacher towards the Dhamma and towards the Sangha and who does not fulfil the training creates a dispute in the Sangha which would be for the harm and unhappiness of many for the loss harm and suffering of gods and humans
Now if you see any such root of dispute either in yourselves or externally you should strive to abandon that same evil root of dispute
And if you do not see any such root of dispute either in yourselves or externally you should practise in such a way that that same evil root of dispute does not erupt in the future
Thus there is the abandoning of that evil root of dispute thus there is the noneruption of that evil root of dispute in the future
These are the six roots of dispute
Ananda there are these four kinds of litigation
What four
Litigation because of a dispute litigation because of an accusation litigation because of an offence and litigation concerning proceedingsThese are the four kinds of litigation
And how is there removal of litigation by confrontation
Here bhikkhus are disputing It is Dhamma or It is not Dhamma or It is Discipline or It is not Discipline
Those bhikkhus should all meet together in concordThen having met together the guideline of the Dhamma should be drawn out
Once the guideline of the Dhamma has been drawn out that litigation should be settled in a way that accords with it
Such is the removal of litigation by confrontation
And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by removal of litigation by confrontation
And how is there the opinion of a majority
If those bhikkhus cannot settle that litigation in that dwelling place they should go to a dwelling place where there is a greater number of bhikkhus
There they should all meet together in concord
Then having met together the guideline of the Dhamma should be drawn out
Once the guideline of the Dhamma has been drawn out that litigation should be settled in a way that accords with it
Such is the opinion of a majority
And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by the opinion of a majority
And how is there removal of litigation on account of memory
Here one bhikkhu reproves another bhikkhu for such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat Does the venerable one remember having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat
He says I do not friends remember having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat
In his case removal of litigation on account of memory should be pronounced
Such is the removal of litigation on account of memory And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by removal of litigation on account of memory
And how is there removal of litigation on account of past insanity
Here one bhikkhu reproves another bhikkhu for such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat Does the venerable one remember having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat  He says I do not friends remember having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat
Despite the denial the former presses the latter further Surely the venerable one must know quite well if he remembers having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat He says I had gone mad friend I was out of my mind and when I was mad I said and did many things improper for a recluse I do not remember I was mad when I did that
In his case removal of litigation on account of past insanity should be pronounced
Such is the removal of litigation on account of past insanity
And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by removal of litigation on account of past insanity
And how is there the effecting of acknowledgement of an offence
Here a bhikkhu whether reproved or unreproved remembers an offence reveals it and discloses it
He should go to a senior bhikkhu and after arranging his robe on one shoulder he should pay homage at his feet Then sitting on his heels he should raise his hands palms together and say Venerable sir I have committed such and such an offence I confess it
The other says Do you see
  Yes I see
 Will you practise restraint in the future   I will practise restraint in the futureSuch is the effecting of acknowledgement of an offence And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by the effecting of acknowledgement of an offence
And how is there the pronouncement of bad character against someone
Here one bhikkhu reproves another for such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat Does the venerable one remember having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat
He says I do not friends remember having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat
Despite the denial the former presses the latter further Surely the venerable one must know quite well if he remembers having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat
 He says I do not friends remember having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat But friends I remember having committed such and such a minor offence
Despite the denial the former presses the latter further Surely the venerable one must know quite well if he remembers having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat
He says Friends when not asked I acknowledge having committed this minor offence
The other says Friend if you had not been asked you would not have acknowledged committing this minor offence so why when asked would you acknowledge having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat Surely the venerable one must know quite well if he remembers having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat
He says I remember friends having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat
I was hurried I was confused when I said that I did not remember having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat
Such is the pronouncement of bad character against someone And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by the pronouncement of bad character against someone
And how is there covering over with grass
Here when bhikkhus have taken to quarreling and brawling and are deep in disputes they may have said and done many things improper for a recluse
Those bhikkhus should all meet together in concord
When they have met together a wise bhikkhu among the bhikkhus who side together on the one part should rise from his seat and after arranging his robe on one shoulder he should raise his hands palms together and call for an enactment of the
Sangha thus Let the venerable Sangha hear me
When we took to quarreling and brawling and were deep in disputes we said and did many things improper for a recluse
If it is approved by the Sangha then for the good of these venerable ones and for my own good in the midst of the Sangha I shall confess by the method of covering over with grass any offences of these venerable ones and any offences of my own except for those which call for serious censure and those connected with the laity
Then a wise bhikkhu among the bhikkhus who side together on the other part should rise from his seat and after arranging his robe on one shoulder he should raise his hands palms together and call for an enactment of the Sangha thus
When we took to quarreling and brawling and were deep in disputes we said and did many things improper for a recluse
If it is approved by the Sangha then for the good of these venerable ones and for my own good in the midst of the Sangha I shall confess by the method of covering over with grass any offences of these venerable ones and any offences of my own except for those which call for serious censure and those connected with the laity
Such is the covering over with grass And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by the covering over with grass
Here a bhikkhu maintains bodily acts of lovingkindness both in public and in private towards his companions in the holy life
This is a memorable quality that creates love and respect and conduces to helpfulness to nondispute to concord and to unity
Again a bhikkhu maintains verbal acts of lovingkindness both in public and in private towards his companions in the holy life
This is a memorable quality that creates love and respect and conduces to unity
Again a bhikkhu maintains mental acts of lovingkindness both in public and in private towards his companions in the holy life
This is a memorable quality that creates love and respect and conduces to unity
Again a bhikkhu enjoys things in common with his virtuous companions in the holy life without making reservations he shares with them any gain of a kind that accords with the Dhamma and has been obtained in a way that accords with the Dhamma including even what is in his bowl
This is a memorable quality that creates love and respect and conduces to unity
Again a bhikkhu dwells both in public and in private possessing in common with his companions in the holy life those virtues that are unbroken untorn unblotched unmottled liberating commended by the wise not misapprehended arid conducive to concentration
This too is a memorable quality that creates love and respect and conduces to unity
Again a bhikkhu dwells both in public and in private possessing in common with his companions in the holy life that view that is noble and emancipating and leads the one who practises in accordance with it to the complete destruction of suffering
This too is a memorable quality that creates love and respect and conduces to helpfulness to nondispute to concord and to unity
These are the six memorable qualities that create love and respect and conduce to helpfulness to nondispute to concord and to unity
If Ananda you undertake and maintain these six memorable qualities do you see any course of speech trivial or gross that you could not endure
 No venerable sir
 Therefore Ananda undertake and maintain these six memorable qualities
That will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time
That is what the Blessed One said
On his death the Niganthas divided split into two and they had taken to quarrelling and brawling and were deep in disputes stabbing each other with verbal daggers You do not understand this Dhamma and Discipline I understand this Dhamma and Discipline
and the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One
This novice Cunda venerable sir says thus Venerable sir the Nigantha Nataputta has just died
A dispute about livelihood or about the Patimokkha would be trifling Ananda
 There are Ananda these six roots of disputes
What six
thus there is the noneruption of that evil root of dispute in the future
Ananda there are these seven kinds of settlement of litigation For the settlement and pacification of litigations whenever they arise removal of litigation by confrontation may be provided removal of litigation on account of memory may be provided removal of litigation on account of past insanity may be provided the effecting of acknowledgement of an offence the opinion of the majority the pronouncement of bad character against someone and covering over with grass
so when asked why shouldnt I acknowledge having committed such and such a grave offence one involving defeat or bordering on defeat
Let the venerable Sangha hear me
Ananda there are these six memorable qualities that create love and respect and conduce to helpfulness to nondispute to concord and to unity
What are the six
The venerable Ananda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthl in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Now at that time five hundred brahmins from diverse provinces were staying at Savatthl for some business or other
Now on that occasion a brahmin student named Assalayana was staying at Savatthl Young shavenheaded sixteen years old he was a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies liturgy phonology and etymology and the histories as a fifth skilled in philology and grammar he was fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man
Then the brahmins thought There is this young brahmin student named Assalayana staying at Savatthl Youngfully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man
He will be able to dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion
So the brahmins went to the brahmin student Assalayana and said to him Master Assalayana this recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castes
Let Master Assalayana come and dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion
When this was said the brahmin student Assalayana replied Sirs the recluse Gotama is one who speaks the Dhamma Now those who speak the Dhamma are difficult to dispute with
I am not able to dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion
A second time the brahmins said to him Master Assalayana this recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castes
Let Master Assalayana come and dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion
For the training of a wanderer has been completed by Master Assalayana
For the second time the brahmin student Assalayana replied Sirs the recluse Gotama is one who speaks the Dhamma Now those who speak the Dhamma are difficult to dispute with
I am not able to dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion
A third time the brahmins said to him Master Assalayana this recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castes
Let Master Assalayana come and dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion
For the training of a wanderer has been completed by Master Assalayana
Let not the Master Assalayana be defeated without having even fought the battle
When this was said the brahmin student Assalayana replied
Sirs the recluse Gotama is one who speaks the Dhamma Now those who speak the Dhamma are difficult to dispute with
I am not able to dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion
Still sirs at your bidding I will go
Then the brahmin student Assalayana went with a large number of brahmins to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
What does Master Gotama say about that
Now Assalayana the brahmin women are seen having their periods becoming pregnant giving birth and giving suck
And yet those who are born from the wombs of the brahmin women say thus Brahmins are the highest castebrahmins alone are the sons of Brahma the offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma
Although Master Gotama says this still the brahmins think thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma
What do you think Assalayana Have you heard that in Yona and Kamboja and in other outland countries there are only two castes masters and slaves and that masters become slaves and slaves masters 
So I have heard sir
Then on the strength of what argument or with the support of what authority do the brahmins in this case say thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma 
Although Master Gotama says this still the brahmins think thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma
What do you think Assalayana Suppose a noble were to kill living beings take what is not given misconduct himself in sensual pleasures speak falsely speak maliciously speak harshly gossip be covetous have a mind of ill will and hold wrong view On the dissolution of the body after death would only he be likely to reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell  and not a brahmin
Suppose a merchanta worker were to kill living beingsand hold wrong view On the dissolution of the body after death would only he be likely to reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell  and not a brahmin 
No Master Gotama
Whether it be a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a worker  those of all four castes who kill living beingsand hold wrong view on the dissolution of the body after death are likely to reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell
Then on the strength of what argument or with the support of what authority do the brahmins in this case say thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma 
Although Master Gotama says this still the brahmins think thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma
What do you think Assalayana Suppose a brahmin were to abstain from killing living beings from taking what is not given from misconduct in sensual pleasures from false speech from malicious speech from harsh speech and from gossip and were to be uncovetous to have a mind without ill will and to hold right view On the dissolution of the body after death would only he be likely to reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world  and not a noble or a merchant or a worker 
No Master Gotama
Whether it be a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a worker  those of all four castes who abstain from killing living beingsand hold right view on the dissolution of the body after death are likely to reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world
Then on the strength of what argument or with the support f what authority do the brahmins in this case say thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma 
Although Master Gotama says this still the brahmins think thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma
What do you think Assalayana Is only a brahmin capable of developing a mind of lovingkindness towards a certain region without hostility and without ill will and not a noble or a merchant or a worker 
No Master Gotama
Whether it be a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a worker  those of all four castes are capable of developing a mind of lovingkindness towards a certain region without hostility and without ill will
Then on the strength of what argument or with the support of what authority do the brahmins in this case say thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma 
Although Master Gotama says this still the brahmins think thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma
What do you think Assalayana Is only a brahmin capable of taking a loofah and bath powder going to the river and washing off dust and dirt and not a noble or a merchant or a worker 
No Master Gotama
Whether it be a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a worker  those of all four castes are capable of taking a loofah and bath powder going to the river and washing off dust and dirt
Then on the strength of what argument or with the support of what authority do the brahmins in this case say thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma 
Although Master Gotama says this still the brahmins think thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma
What do you think Assalayana Suppose a headanointed noble king were to assemble here a hundred men of different birth and say to them Come sirs let any here who have been born into a noble clan or a brahmin clan or a royal clan take an upper firestick of sala wood salala wood sandalwood or padumaka wood and light a fire and produce heat And also let any who have been born into an outcast clan a trapper clan a wicker workers clan a cartwrights clan or a scavengers clan take an upper firestick made from a dogs drinking trough from a pigs trough from a dustbin or from castoroil wood and light a fire and produce heat
What do you think Assalayana When a fire is lit and heat is produced by someone in the first group would that fire have a flame a colour and a radiance and would it be possible to use it for the purposes of fire while when a fire is lit and heat is produced by someone of the second group that fire would have no flame no colour and no radiance and it would not be possible to use it for the purposes of fire 
No Master Gotama
When a fire is lit and heat is produced by someone in the first group that fire would have a flame a colour and a radiance and it would be possible to use it for the purposes of fire And when a fire is lit and heat is produced by someone of the second group that fire too would have a flame a colour and a radiance and it would be possible to use it for the purposes of fire For all fire has a flame a colour and a radiance and it is possible to use all fire for the purposes of fire
Then on the strength of what argument or with the support of what authority do the brahmins in this case say thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma 
Although Master Gotama says this still the brahmins think thus Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma
What do you think Assalayana Suppose a noble youth were to cohabit with a brahmin girl and a son was born from their cohabitation Should a son born from a noble youth and a brahmin girl be called a noble after the father or a brahmin after the mother
He could be called both Master Gotama
What do you think Assalayana Suppose a brahmin youth here were to cohabit with a noble girl and a son were to be born from their cohabitation Should the son born from a brahmin youth and a noble girl be called a noble after the mother or a brahmin after the father 
He could be called both Master Gotama
What do you think Assalayana Suppose a mare were to be mated with a male donkey and a foal were to be born as the result
Should the foal be called a horse after the mother or a donkey after the father 
It is a mule Master Gotama since it does not belong to either kind
I see the difference in this last case but I see no difference in either of the former cases
What do you think Assalayana Suppose there were two brahmin students who were brothers born of the same mother one studious and acute and one neither studious nor acute
Which of them would brahmins feed first at a funeral feast or at a ceremonial milkrice offering or at a sacrificial feast or at a feast for guests 
On such occasions brahmins would feed first the one who was studious and acute Master Gotama for how could what is given to one who is neither studious nor acute bring great fruit 
What do you think Assalayana Suppose there were two brahmin students who were brothers born of the same mother one studious and acute but immoral and of bad character and one neither studious nor acute but virtuous and of good character
Which of them would brahmins feed first at a funeral feast or at a ceremonial milkrice offering or at a sacrificial feast or at a feast for guests
for how could what is given to one who is immoral and of bad character bring great fruit 
First Assalayana you took your stand on birth and after that you took your stand on scriptural learning and after that you have come to take your stand on the very ground that purification is for all four castes as I describe it
When this was said the brahmin student Assalayana sat silent and dismayed with shoulders drooping and head down glum and without response
Knowing this the Blessed One said to him  Once Assalayana when seven brahmin seers were dwelling in leaf huts in the forest this pernicious view arose in them Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma
Then while walking up and down the courtyard of the seven brahmin seers the seer Devala the Dark spoke thus Where have those worthy brahmin seers gone Where have those worthy brahmin seers gone
 Then the seven brahmin seers thought Who is walking up and down in the courtyard of the seven brahmin seers like a village lout speaking thus Where have those worthy brahmin seers gone Where have those worthy brahmin seers gone
 Let us curse him
 Then the seven brahmin seers cursed the seer Devala the Dark thus Be ashes vile one Be ashes vile one
 But the more the seven brahmin seers cursed him the more comely beautiful and handsome the seer Devala the Dark became
Then the seven brahmin seers thought Our asceticism is in vain our holy life is fruitless for formerly when we cursed anyone thus Be ashes vile one Be ashes vile one
 he always became ashes but the more we curse this one the more comely beautiful and handsome he becomes
Your asceticism is not in vain sirs your holy life is not fruitless
But sirs put away your hatred towards me
We have put away our hatred towards you sir
Who are you 
Have you heard of the seer Devala the Dark sirs
 Yes sir
 I am he sirs
Then the seven brahmin seers went to the seer Devala the Dark and paid homage to him
 That is so sir
But sirs do you know if the mother who bore you went only with a brahmin and never with a nonbrahmin
 No sir
But sirs do you know if your mothers mothers back to the seventh generation went only with brahmins and never with nonbrahmins
 No sir
But sirs do you know if the father who begot you went only with a brahmin woman and never with a nonbrahmin woman
 No sir
But sirs do you know if your fathers fathers back to the seventh generation went only with brahmin women and never with nonbrahmin women
 No sir
But sirs do you know how the conception of an embryo in a womb comes about
Sir we know how the conception of an embryo in a womb comes about Here there is a union of the mother and father and it is the mothers season and the being to be reborn is present
Thus the conception of an embryo in a womb comes about through the union of these three things
Then sirs do you know for sure whether that being to be reborn is a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a worker 
Sir we do not know for sure whether that being to be reborn is a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a worker
That being so sirs then what are you 
That being so sir we do not know what we are
Now Assalayana even those seven brahmin seers on being pressed and questioned and crossquestioned by the seer Devala the Dark on their own assertion about birth were unable to support it But how shall you on being pressed and questioned and crossquestioned by me now on your assertion about birth be able to support it You who rely on the teachers doctrines are not even fit to be their spoonholder Punna
When this was said the brahmin student Assalayana said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life
Then those brahmins thought This recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castes
Who is there able to dispute with him about this assertion 
and said to the Blessed One Master Gotama the brahmins say thus Brahmins are the highest caste those of any other caste are inferior brahmins are the fairest caste those of any other caste are dark only brahmins are purified not nonbrahmins brahmins alone are the sons of Brahma the offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma
On such occasions brahmins would feed first the one who was neither studious nor acute but virtuous and of good character Master Gotama
Now the seer Devala the Dark heard this
Then he arranged his hair and beard dressed in ochrecoloured garments put on stout sandals and taking a staff made of gold he appeared in the courtyard of the seven brahmin seers
Then he said to them Sirs I heard that while the seven brahmin seers were dwelling in leaf huts in the forest this pernicious view arose in them Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma
 sees no danger anywhere He does not see any danger anywhere from the dangers which might arise rooted in nonrestraint Why Because due to his restraint he does not face any danger rooted in nonrestraint
He experiences within himself a blameless happiness  He experiences within himself a blameless faultless wholesome bodily and mental happiness accompanied by such phenomena as nonremorse gladness rapture and tranquillity which are based on moral discipline as their proximate cause
 Having seen a form with the eye The word eye is found in the texts with the following meanings the Buddha eye as it is said he surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha 
 the eye of Dhamma the wisdom of the lower three paths as it is said There arose in him the dustfree stainless eye of Dhamma 
Everything else that needs to be said concerning the other terms has been said already in the Visuddhimagga 
 the universal eye the knowledge of omniscience as it is said Ascend the palace of Dhamma O greatly wise one O universal eye 
 the wisdom eye the knowledge of past lives and the knowl edge of the destruction of the cankers as it is said The eye arose knowledge arose 
 the divine eye 
 the eye as a sense organ as it is said In dependence on the eye and forms eyeconsciousness arises 
Here the word eye which conventionally signifies the eye as a sense organ is used to signify eyeconsciousness Therefore the meaning of the above statement is Having seen a form with eye consciousness
He experiences within himself an unblemished happiness  He experiences the purified happiness of the higher consciousness  which is unblemished unadulterated since it is devoid of the blemish of defilements
 Now as regards the virtue of restraint of faculties shown next to that in the way beginning on seeing a visible object with the eye herein he is a bhikkhu established in the virtue of Pātimokkha restraint
On seeing a visible object with the eye on seeing a visible object with the eyeconsciousness that is capable of seeing visible objects and has borrowed the name eye from its instrument
But the Ancients said The eye does not see a visible object because it has no mind The mind does not see because it has no eyes But when there is the impingement of door and object he sees by means of the consciousness that has eyesensitivity as its physical basis
Now such as this is called an accessory locution  like He shot him with his bow and so onSo the meaning here is this On seeing a visible object with eyeconsciousness
Apprehends neither the signs he does not apprehend the sign of woman or man or any sign that is a basis for defilement such as the sign of beauty etc he stops at what is merely seen
Nor the particulars he does not apprehend any aspect classed as hand foot smile laughter talk looking ahead looking aside etc which has acquired the name particular because of its particularizing defilements because of its making them manifest themselves He only apprehends what is really there Like the Elder Mahā Tissa who dwelt at Cetiyapabbata
It seems that as the elder was on his way from Cetiyapabbata to Anurādhapura for alms a certain daughterinlaw of a clan who had quarrelled with her husband and had set out early from Anurādhapura all dressed up and tricked out like a celestial nymph to go to her relatives home saw him on the road and being low minded she laughed a loud laugh
Wondering What is that the elder looked up and finding in the bones of her teeth the perception of foulness  he reached Arahantship
He saw the bones that were her teeth And kept in mind his first perception
And standing on that very spot The elder became an Arahant
But her husband who was going after her saw the elder and asked Venerable sir did you by any chance see a woman
 The elder told him
Whether it was a man or woman That went by I noticed not
But only that on this high road There goes a group of bones
As to the words through which etc the meaning is by reason of which because of which nonrestraint of the eye faculty if he if that person left the eye faculty unguarded remained with the eye door unclosed by the doorpanel of mindfulness these states of covetousness etc might invade might pursue might threaten him
He enters upon the way of its restraint he enters upon the way of closing that eye faculty by the doorpanel of mindfulness
It is the same one of whom it is said he guards the eye faculty undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty
Herein there is neither restraint nor nonrestraint in the actual eye faculty
On the contrary when a visible datum as object comes into the eyes focus then after the lifecontinuum has arisen twice and ceased the functional mindelement accomplishing the function of adverting arises and ceases
After that eye consciousness with the function of seeing
Herein there is neither restraint nor non restraint on the occasion of the lifecontinuum or on any of the occasions beginning with adverting
Why is that
Because when this happens the door is not guarded nor are the lifecontinuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series
Like what
Just as when a citys four gates are not secured although inside the city house doors storehouses rooms etc are secured yet all property inside the city is unguarded and unprotected
But when virtue etc has arisen in it then the door too is guarded and so also are the lifecontinuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series beginning with adverting
Like what
Just as when the city gates are secured although inside the city the houses etc are not secured yet all property inside the city is well guarded well protected
So also as regards the phrases on hearing a sound with the ear and so on
Hence it was said
since neither mindfulness nor forgetfulness arises in dependence on eyesensitivity
after that resultant mindelement with the function of receiving
after that resultant rootcauseless mindconsciousness element with the function of investigating
after that functional rootcauseless mindconsciousnesselement accomplishing the function of determining arises and ceases Next to that impulsion impels
But there is nonrestraint if unvirtuousness or forgetfulness or unknowing or impatience or idleness arises at the moment of impulsion
When this happens it is called nonrestraint in the eye faculty
since robbers coming in by the city gates can do as they please so too when unvirtuousness etc arise in impulsion in which there is no restraint then the door too is unguarded and so also are the lifecontinuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series beginning with adverting
since when the city gates are shut there is no ingress for robbers so too when virtue etc have arisen in impulsion the door too is guarded and so also are the lifecontinuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series beginning with adverting
Thus although it actually arises at the moment of impulsion it is nevertheless called restraint in the eye faculty
So it is this virtue which in brief has the characteristic of avoiding apprehension of signs entailing defilement with respect to visible objects etc that should be understood as virtue of restraint of faculties
On seeing a visible object with the eye if the eye were to see the visible object then belonging to other kinds of consciousness would see too but that is not so Why
Because the eye has no thought 
And then were consciousness itself to see a visible object it would see it even behind a wall because of being independent of sense resistance  but that is not so either because there is no seeing in all kinds of consciousness
And herein it is consciousness dependent on the eye that sees not just any kind
And that does not arise with respect to what is enclosed by walls etc where light is excluded
But where there is no exclusion of light as in the case of a crystal or a mass of cloud there it does arise even with respect to what is enclosed by them
So it is as a basis of consciousness that the eye sees
When there is the impingement of door and object what is intended is when a visible datum as object has come into the eyes focus
One sees one looks 
for when the consciousness that has eyesensitivity as its material support is disclosing by means of the special quality of its support a visible datum as object that is assisted by light  then it is said that a person possessed of that sees the visible datum
And here the illuminating is the revealing of the visible datum according to its individual essence in other words the apprehending of it experientially 
Here it is the sign of woman because it is the cause of perceiving as woman all such things as the shape that is grasped under the heading of the visible data invariably found in a female continuity the unclearcutness of the flesh of the breasts the beardlessness of the face the use of cloth to bind the hair the unclearcut stance walk and so on
The sign of man is in the opposite sense
The sign of beauty here is the aspect of woman that is the cause for the arising of lust
By the word etc the sign of resentment  etc are included
which should be understood as the undesired aspect that is the cause for the arising of hate
And here admittedly only covetousness and grief are specified in the text but the sign of equanimity needs to be included too since there is nonrestraint in the delusion that arises due to overlooking
And here the sign of equanimity should be understood as an object that is the basis for the kind of equanimity associated with unknowing through overlooking it
So the sign of beauty etc given in brief thus is actually the cause of greed hate and delusion
He stops at what is merely seen according to the Sutta method The seen shall be merely seen  As soon as the colour basis has been apprehended by the consciousnesses of the cognitive series with eyeconsciousness he stops he does not fancy any aspect of beauty etc beyond that
In one who fancies as beautiful etc the limbs of the opposite sex defilements arisen with respect to them successively become particularized which is why they are called particulars
But these are simply modes of interpreting the kinds of materiality derived from the primaries that are interpreted in such and such wise
for apart from that there is in the ultimate sense no such thing as a hand and so on
or since forgetfulness of unknowing is said below 
As the elder was going along only in keeping his meditation subject in mind since noise is a thorn to those in the early stage he looked up with the noise of the laughter What is that
Perception of foulness is perception of bones
for the elder was then making bones his meditation subject
The elder it seems as soon as he saw her teethbones while she was laughing got the counterpart sign with access jhāna because he had developed the preliminarywork well While he stood there he reached the first jhāna Then he made that the basis for insight which he augmented until he attained the paths one after the other and reached destruction of cankers
There is no unvirtuousness in other words bodily or verbal misconduct in the five doors consequently restraint of unvirtuousness happens through the mind door and the remaining restraint happens through the six doors
For the arising of forgetfulness and the other three would be in the five doors since they are unprofitable states opposed to mindfulness etc and there is no arising of unvirtuousness consisting in bodily and verbal transgression there because fivedoor impulsions do not give rise to intimation
And the five kinds of nonrestraint beginning with unvirtuousness are stated here as the opposite of the five kinds of restraint beginning with restraint as virtue
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Now on that occasion the venerable Moliya Phagguna was associating overmuch with bhikkhunis
So much was the venerable Moliya Phagguna associating with bhikkhunis He was associating so much with bhikkhunis that if any bhikkhu spoke dispraise of those bhikkhunis in his presence he would become angry and displeased and would rebuke him
Then a certain bhikkhu went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one side and told the Blessed One what was taking place
Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus Come bhikkhu tell the bhikkhu Moliya Phagguna in my name that the Teacher calls him
 Yes venerable sir he replied and he went to the venerable Moliya Phagguna and told him The Teacher calls you friend Phagguna  Yes friend he replied
The Blessed One asked him
Phagguna is it true that you are associating overmuch with bhikkhunis
Are you associating so much with bhikkhunis as it seems
 Yes venerable sir
 Phagguna are you not a clansman who has gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness
 Yes venerable sir
Phagguna it is not proper for you a clansman gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness to associate overmuch with bhikkhunls
Therefore if anyone speaks dispraise of those bhikkhunls in your presence you should abandon any desires and any thoughts based on the household life
And herein you should train thus My mind will be unaffected and I shall utter no evil words I shall abide compassionate for his welfare with a mind of lovingkindness without inner hate
That is how you should train Phagguna
If anyone gives those bhikkhums a blow with his hand with a clod with a stick or with a knife in your presence
And herein you should train thus My mind will be unaffected
If anyone should give you a blow with his hand with a clod with a stick or with a knife you should abandon any desires and any thoughts based on the household life
And herein you should train thus My mind will be unaffected and I shall utter no evil words I shall abide compassionate for his welfare with a mind of lovingkindness without inner hate
That is how you should train Phagguna
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus there was an occasion when the bhikkhus satisfied my mind
Here I addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus I eat at a single session
By so doing I am free from illness and affliction and I enjoy health strength and a comfortable abiding
Come bhikkhus eat at a single session
By so doing you will be free from illness and affliction and you will enjoy health strength and a comfortable abiding
So too I had no need to keep on instructing those bhikkhus I had only to arouse mindfulness in them
Therefore bhikkhus abandon what is unwholesome and devote yourselves to wholesome states
Suppose there were a big salatree grove near a village or town
and some man would appear desiring its good welfare and protection
for that is how you will come to growth increase and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline
Formerly bhikkhus in this same Savatthl there was a housewife named Vedehika
And a good report about Mistress Vedehika had spread thus Mistress Vedehika is kind Mistress Vedehika is gentle Mistress Vedehika is peaceful
Now Mistress Vedehika had a maid named Kali who was clever nimble and neat in her work
The maid Kali thought A good report about my lady has spread thus Mistress Vedehika is kind Mistress Vedehika is gentle Mistress Vedehika is peaceful
How is it now while she does not show anger is it nevertheless actually present in her or is it absent Or else is it just because my work is neat that my lady shows no anger though it is actually present in her
Suppose I test my lady
So the maid Kali got up late
The Mistress Vedehika said Hey Kali
 What is it madam
 What is the matter that you get up so late
 Nothing is the matter madam
 Nothing is the matter you wicked girl yet you get up so late and she was angry and displeased and she scowled
Then the maid Kali thought The fact is that while my lady does not show anger it is actually present in her not absent and it is just because my work is neat that my lady shows no anger though it is actually present in her not absent
Suppose I test my lady a little more
So the maid Kali got up later in the day
Then Mistress Vedehika said Hey Kali
 What is it madam
 What is the matter that you get up later in the day
 Nothing is the matter madam
 Nothing is the matter you wicked girl yet you get up later in the day  and she was angry and displeased and she spoke words of displeasure
Then the maid Kali thought The fact is that while my lady does not show anger it is actually present in her not absent
Suppose I test my lady a little more
So the maid Kali got up still later in the day
Then Mistress Vedehika said Hey Kali
 What is it madam
 What is the matter that you get up still later in the day
 Nothing is the matter madam
 Nothing is the matter you wicked girl yet you get up still later in the day and she was angry and displeased and she tooka rollingpin gave her a blow on the head and cut her head
Then the maid Kali with blood running from her cut head denounced her mistress to the neighbours See ladies the kind ladys work See ladies the gentle ladys work See ladies the peaceful ladys work
How can she become angry and displeased with her only maid for getting up late How can she take a rollingpin give her a blow on the head and cut her head
Then later on a bad report about Mistress Vedehika spread thus Mistress Vedehika is rough Mistress Vedehika is violent Mistress Vedehika is merciless
So too bhikkhus some bhikkhu is extremely kind extremely gentle extremely peaceful so long as disagreeable courses of speech do not touch him
But it is when disagreeable courses of speech touch him that it can be understood whether that bhikkhu is really kind gentle and peaceful
I do not call a bhikkhu easy to admonish who is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish only for the sake of getting robes almsfood a resting place and medicinal requisites
Why is that
Because that bhikkhu is not easy to admonish nor makes himself easy to admonish when he gets no robes almsfood resting place and medicinal requisites
But when a bhikkhu is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish because he honours respects and reveres the Dhamma him I call easy to admonish
Therefore bhikkhus you should train thus We shall be easy to admonish and make ourselves easy to admonish because we honour respect and revere the Dhamma
That is how you should train bhikkhus
Bhikkhus there are these five courses of speech that others may use when they address you their speech may be timely or untimely true or untrue gentle or harsh connected with good or with harm spoken with a mind of lovingkindness or with inner hate
When others address you their speech may be timely or untimely when others address you their speech may be true or untrue when others address you their speech may be gentle or harsh when others address you their speech may be connected with good or with harm when others address you their speech may be spoken with a mind of lovingkindness or with inner hate
Herein bhikkhus you should train thus Our minds will remain unaffected and we shall utter no evil words we shall abide compassionate for their welfare with a mind of lovingkindness without inner hate
We shall abide pervading that person with a mind imbued with lovingkindness and starting with him we shall abide pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with lovingkindness abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill will
That is how you should train bhikkhus
Bhikkhus suppose a man came with a hoe and a basket
and said I shall make this great earth to be without earth
He would dig here and there strew the soil here and there spit here and there and urinate here and there saying Be without earth be without earth
What do you think bhikkhus Could that man make this great earth to be without earth
 No venerable sir
Why is that
Because this great earth is deep and immense it cannot possibly be made to be without earth
Eventually the man would reap only weariness and disappointment
So too bhikkhus there are these five courses of speech 
That is how you should train bhikkhus
Bhikkhus suppose a man came with crimson turmeric indigo or carmine
and said I shall draw pictures and make pictures appear on empty space
What do you think bhikkhus Could that man draw pictures and make pictures appear on empty space
 No venerable sir
Why is that
Because empty space is formless and invisible he cannot possibly draw pictures there or make pictures appear there
Eventually the man would reap only weariness and disappointment
So too bhikkhus there are these five courses of speech Herein bhikkhus you should train thus Our minds will remain unaffectedand starting with him we shall abide pervading the allencompassing world with a mind similar to empty space abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill will
That is how you should train bhikkhus
Bhikkhus suppose a man came with a blazing grasstorch and said
What do you think bhikkhus Could that man heat up and burn away the river Ganges with that blazing grasstorch
 No venerable sir
Why is that
Because the river Ganges is deep and immense it cannot possibly be heated up and burned away with a blazing grasstorch
Eventually the man would reap only weariness and disappointment
So too bhikkhus there are these five courses of speechHerein bhikkhus you should train thus Our minds will remain unaffectedand starting with him we shall abide pervading the allencompassing world with a mind similar to the river Ganges abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill will
That is how you should train bhikkhus
Bhikkhus suppose there were a catskin bag that was rubbed wellrubbed thoroughly wellrubbed soft silky rid of rustling rid of crackling
What do you think bhikkhus Could that man make it rustle or crackle with the stick or the potsherd
 No venerable sir
Why is that
Because that catskin bag being rubbedrid of rustling rid of crackling
cannot possibly be made to rustle or crackle with the stick or the potsherd Eventually the man would reap only weariness and disappointment
So too bhikkhus there are these five courses of speech that others may use when they address you their speech may be timely or untimely true or untrue gentle or harsh connected with good or with harm spoken with a mind of lovingkindness or with inner hate
When others address you their speech may be timely or untimely when others address you their speech may be true or untrue when others address you their speech may be gentle or harsh when others address you their speech may be connected with good or with harm when others address you their speech may be spoken with a mind of lovingkindness or with inner hate
Herein bhikkhus you should train thus Our minds will remain unaffected and we shall utter no evil words we shall abide compassionate for their welfare with a mind of lovingkindness without inner hate
We shall abide pervading that person with a mind imbued with lovingkindness and starting with him we shall abide pervading the allencompassing world with a mind similar to a catskin bag abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill will
That is how you should train bhikkhus
Bhikkhus even if bandits were to sever you savagely limb by limb with a twohandled saw he who gave rise to a mind of hate towards them would not be carrying out my teaching
Herein bhikkhus you should train thus Our minds will remain unaffected and we shall utter no evil words we shall abide compassionate for their welfare with a mind of lovingkindness without inner hate
We shall abide pervading them with a mind imbued with lovingkindness and starting with them we shall abide pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with lovingkindness abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill will
That is how you should train bhikkhus
Bhikkhus if you keep this advice on the simile of the saw constantly in mind
 No venerable sir
 Therefore bhikkhus you should keep this advice on the simile of the saw constantly in mind
That will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time
That is what the Blessed One said
and if any bhikkhu spoke dispraise of the venerable Moliya Phagguna in those bhikkhunis presence they would become angry and displeased and would rebuke him
A bhikkhu endowed with this twelvefold contentment with requisites of any kind may make use of eight requisites
three robes and almsbowl a knife for cutting toothwood a needle a waistband and a waterstrainer
All these have the purpose of protecting ones body and sustaining ones belly
How
If when one travels about one wears the three robes one sustains and protects the body thus these are for protecting the body
If when drinking one first strains the water with a corner of a robe or uses a robe to accept fruits to be eaten one sustains and protects the belly thus these are for sustaining the belly
The almsbowl is for protecting the body if one uses it to draw water when bathing or making plaster for ones hut
it is for sustaining the belly when one uses it to receive food at meal time
The knife is for protecting the body if one uses it to cut toothwood or to smoothen the legs and surface of ones bed and chair or the poles of a tent
it is for sustaining the belly if one uses it to cut sugarcane or to open a coconut etc
The needle is for protecting the body when one uses it to sew robes
it is for sustaining the belly if at the time of eating one uses it to pick up a piece of fruit or cake
The waterstrainer is for protecting the body when one strains water with it at the time of bathing or making plaster for ones dwelling
it is for sustaining the belly when one uses it to strain drinking water or to accept sesame seeds rice grains or honey tree fruits while eating
This is the limit of requisites for one using eight requisites
But for one using nine requisites when he stays in a bedroom a bedspread situated there or a key is allowed
For one using ten requisites a sitting couch or a piece of leather is allowed
For one using eleven requisites a walking stick or an oil tube is allowed
For one using twelve requisites an umbrella or a pair of sandals is allowed
It should not be said that of these bhikkhus only the one who uses eight requisites is content and that the others are not content have many desires and are difficult to support
For they too are content have few desires are easy to support and light in their mode of living
However the Exalted One did not explain this discourse by way of those bhikkhus he explained it by way of the one who uses eight requisites
For this one wraps up his small knife and needle in his water strainer puts the strainer inside his almsbowl hangs the bowl over his shoulder clothes himself in his three robes and waistband and sets out happily wherever he wishes
There is nothing at all he has to turn back for and take
Thus showing such a bhikkhus light mode of living the Exalted One says A bhikkhu is content with robes to protect his body and almsfood to sustain his belly etc
He has no attachment or bondage to my monastery my cell my attendant
He is like an arrow released from the bow or like an elephant in rut which has left the herd Using whatever dwelling he likesa jungle thicket the foot of a tree a wooded slopehe stands alone and sits alone
in all postures he is alone without a companion
He sets out taking only along with him He goes taking all his minimal eight requisites carrying them on his body
At home in the four quarters of the world harboring no aversion in ones heart
content with anything one gets
bearing all hardships undismayed
one should walk alone like the rhinoceros 
 Thus he conducts himself in a manner similar to that of the rhinoceros as explained 
This in brief is the meaning Having learned that in such and such a region there is a tree with ripened fruits birds come from various directions and eat those fruits picking and tearing at them with their claws wings and beaks
It never occurs to them This is for todays meal that is for tomorrows meal
When the fruits are finished they do not set up a guard around that tree nor do they set up a feather claw mark or beak mark there
rather they lose their concern for that tree and each bird goes in whatever direction it wishes flying off with its wings as its only burden
In the same way the bhikkhu sets out wherever he wishes without attachment and without concern
Hence it is said He sets out taking only along with him
Just as a bird wherever it goes flies with its wings as its only burden The Buddha next demonstrates this point with the simile of the bird
and he went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him sat down at one side
that you are associating so much with bhikkhunis that if any bhikkhu speaks dispraise of those bhikkhunis in your presence you become angry and displeased and rebuke him
and if any bhikkhu speaks dispraise of you in those bhikkhunis presence they become angry and displeased and rebuke him
you should abandon any desires and any thoughts based on the household life
If anyone speaks dispraise in your presence you should abandon any desires and any thoughts based on the household life
And herein you should train thus My mind will be unaffected
And I had no need to keep on instructing those bhikkhus I had only to arouse mindfulness in them
Suppose there were a chariot on even ground at the crossroads harnessed to thoroughbreds waiting with goad lying ready
so that a skilled trainer a charioteer of horses to be tamed might mount it and taking the reins in his left hand and the goad in his right hand might drive out and back by any road whenever he likes
for that is how you will come to growth increase and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline
and it was choked with castoroil weeds
He would cut down and throw out the crooked saplings that robbed the sap
and he would clean up the interior of the grove and tend the straight wellformed saplings
so that the salatree grove later on would come to growth increase and fulfilment
So too bhikkhus abandon what is unwholesome and devote yourselves to wholesome states
 Endowed with this noble aggregate of moral discipline  he resorts to a secluded dwelling What does the Buddha show by this
He shows the achievement of the requisites for living in the forest
For one who lacks these four requisites  does not succeed in his forest life
He would fall under the same category as animals or forest wanderers
The deities residing in the forest would think What is the use of living in the forest for such an evil bhikkhu  They would make frightful sounds strike him on the head with their hands and make him flee
A bad reputation would also spread about concerning him Such and such a bhikkhu having entered the forest did this and that evil deed
Reviewing his own moral discipline he does not see any stain or blemish and he arouses rapture Exploring that rapture by way of its destruction and falling away he enters upon the plane of the noble ones
The deities residing in the forest are satisfied and speak praise of him
His fame spreads widely like a drop of oil put onto water
Therein secluded means empty that is quiet and noiseless
It is referring to this that it is said in the Vibhaga Secluded even if a dwelling is nearby if it is not crowded with householders and monks
A dwelling is a place where one lies down and sits it is a designation for bed and chair
Thus it is said Dwelling a bed is a dwelling a chair is a dwelling a cushion a pillow a dwelling place a building with a sloping roof a rectangular building with a gabled roof a flat roofed building a natural cave a multistoreyed mansion a circular house a rock cave a bamboo thicket the foot of a tree a pavilion these are also dwellings  Or any place to which bhikkhus return all this is a dwelling 
Moreover dwellings become fourfold as follows A dwelling place a building with a sloping roof a rectangular building with a gabled roof a flatroofed building a natural cavethese are called dwellingplace dwellings
A bed a chair a cushion a pillow these are called bedandchair dwellings
A rug a piece of leather a straw mat a mat of leavesthese are called spread dwellings
Or any place to which bhikkhus returnthis is called a living space dwelling
Its characteristics are explained in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of the Ascetic Practices 
The foot of a tree is the foot of any secluded tree having cool shade
A mountain is a rock mountain
For when one has bathed and drunk in a rock tank and sits down in the cool shade of a tree fanned by a cool breeze the various quarters all visible the mind becomes onepointed
A glen is a mountainous region divided by water
For there the sand is like silver foil the jungle thicket overhead is like a jewelstudded canopy and the water flows like a mass of jewels
Having entered such a glen drunk and cooled ones limbs heaped up sand and prepared a seat from ragrobes when one sits down and does the work of a recluse the mind becomes onepointed
A hillside cave is a large fissure between two mountains or in a single mountain similar to a tunnelThe characteristics of a cremation ground are explained in the Visuddhimagga 
A jungle grove is a place beyond the outskirts of a village a place not frequented by men where they do not sow and ploughThence it is said A jungle grove this is a designation for remote dwellings
One wishing to may make a tent and live here
A heap of straw a pile of straw
For having collected straw from a large heap of straw they build an abode similar to a hillside cave They also throw straw over bushes and brush etc sit beneath it and do the work of a recluse
He sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and sets up mindfulness before him  crosses his legs he binds them with the thighs completely locked
 holds his body erect he sets the upper part of his body erect aligning the eighteen vertebrae end to end
For when one sits in such a way the skin flesh and sinews do not bend forward
As those feelings do not arise the mind becomes one pointed and the meditation subject does not fall away but arrives at growth success and maturity
 sets up mindfulness before him he applies mindfulness towards his meditation subject
Thus it is said in the Vibhaga This mindfulness is set up set up well at the tip of the nose or at the sign of the mouth 
 Having abandoned covetousness for the world Here the five aggregates of clinging are the world  in the sense of decaying and disintegrating  Therefore the meaning here is having abandoned lust for the five aggregates of clinging having suppressed sensual desire
He dwells with a mind free from covetousness with a mind free from covetousness through its being abandoned by way of suppression not like eyeconsciousness which is naturally devoid of covetousness
He purifies his mind from covetousness he releases his mind from covetousness
Ill will the mind is made ill by this and abandons its original nature like spoiled gruel
Hatred one is defiled by undergoing deformation  or one defiles and destroys others
Both these words are designations for anger
Perceiving light he is endowed with a purified perception free from the hindrances capable of perceiving whether by day or by night a light previously seen
these two are mentioned because they are both helpful to the perception of light
He is unperplexed about wholesome states because in regard to blameless states
he does not doubt Are these wholesome How is it that these are wholesome
 This is a brief explanation
Whatever has to be said concerning these five hindrancesthe analysis of their word derivations characteristics etcall has been said in the Visuddhimagga
 When a bhikkhu sees that these five hindrances are unabandoned within himself he regards that as a debt as a sickness as confinement in prison as slavery as a desert road Here the Exalted One shows the unabandoned hindrance of sensual desire as similar to a debt and the remaining hindrances as similar to sickness etc
One who has taken a loan from others and squandered it cannot defend himself when they tell him to pay back his debt speak to him harshly bind him and beat him he must endure this all
Similarly if someone becomes excited by sensual desire towards someone else and takes that person as an object of a mind associated with craving then he must endure it all when that person the object of his sensual desire speaks to him harshly binds him and beats him his sensual desire is the reason he must endure it An example is the case of women being beaten by the houseowners their parentsinlaw their sensual desire being the reason they must endure it Thus sensual desire should be regarded as a debt
One who is afflicted with a bile disease if he is given such things as honey and sugar will not enjoy their taste because of his bile disease He will spit them out thinking they are bitter
Similarly if one with a mind of ill will is exhorted even slightly by his benevolent preceptor or teacher he will not accept the exhortation
He will reject it saying You oppress me too much  and depart either to wander about here and there or to return to lay life
Just as the man afflicted with a bile disease cannot enjoy the taste of honey and sugar so one afflicted with anger cannot enjoy the flavor of the Buddhas dispensation that is the happiness of jhna etc
On a festival day a man bound in prison cannot see either the beginning middle or end of the festival
If he is released the next day and he hears Oh there was a delightful festival yesterday Oh such dances and songs  he cannot give a reply
For what reason
Because he did not enjoy the festival himself
Similarly if a bhikkhu is overcome by dullness and drowsiness when a preaching of the Dhamma through variegated methods is taking place he cannot understand its beginning middle or end
When the preaching is over he hears others speaking praise of it Oh what a preaching of the Dhamma Such arguments and similes  but he cannot give a reply
For what reason
Because he was overcome by dullness and drowsiness and did not enjoy the Dhamma talk
Thus dullness and drowsiness should be regarded as confinement in prison
A slave even when playing at a festival may be told There is some urgent task for you to do Go there quickly
If you dont go Ill cut off your hands and feet your ears or your nose  Thus he goes quickly
and does not get to enjoy the beginning middle or end of the festival For what reason
Because he is subservient to others Similarly when one who is unskilled in the Vinaya has entered the forest for seclusion he may incur some minor disciplinary offence even perceiving unallowable meat as allowable Then he has to abandon his seclusion and approach a master of the Vinaya to purify his moral discipline Thus he does not get to enjoy the happiness of seclusion Why
Because he has been overcome by restlessness and worry
Thus restlessness and worry should be regarded as slavery
A man travelling along a desert road having seen the opportunity for thieves to plunder and kill people becomes anxious and frightened even by the sound of a twig or a bird thinking Thieves have come He goes forward a little stops because of his anxiety and fear and turns back thinking Who knows what will happen if one travels in such a desert The places in which he stops are more numerous than those in which he walks
He reaches a place of safety with trouble and difficulty or he may not reach it at all
Similarly if doubt about the eight cases has arisen in someone he will go on doubting Is the Teacher an Enlightened One or not  and will not be able to resolve and accept it in faith
Not being able to do so he does not reach the path or fruit
Thus just as the traveller on the desert road by doubting whether or not there are thieves repeatedly arouses wavering and vacillation lack of conviction and consternation and creates an obstacle to his reaching a place of safety so by doubting whether or not the Teacher is an Enlightened One one repeatedly arouses wavering and vacillation lack of conviction and consternation and creates an obstacle to ones reaching the plane of the noble ones Thus doubt should be regarded as a desert road
 But when he sees that these five hindrances have been abandoned within himself he regards that as freedom from debt as good health as release from prison as freedom from slavery as a place of safety Here the Exalted One shows the abandoning of the hindrance of sensual desire as similar to freedom from debt and the abandoning of the remaining hindrances as similar to good health etc
The similarity is as follows A man having taken a loan applies it to his business and achieves success He thinks This debt is a root impediment so he pays back the loan together with the interest and has the promissory note torn up
From then on no one sends him a messenger or a letter 
When he sees his creditors he may rise up from his seat or remain seated as he wishes Why
Because he is no more bound to them no more dependent on them
Similarly a bhikkhu thinks Sensual desire is a root impediment so he develops six things and abandons the hindrance of sensual desire
When he has thus abandoned sensual desire then just as a man free from debt experiences no fear or consternation when he sees his creditor
Even if he sees divine forms no defilement assails him
Therefore the Exalted One says that the abandonment of sensual desire is like freedom from debt
A man afflicted with a bile disease suppresses that disease with a preparation of medicines From then on he enjoys the taste of such things as honey and sugar
Similarly a bhikkhu thinks Ill will is a major cause of harm so he develops six things and abandons the hindrance of ill will
When he has thus abandoned ill will then just as the man who has recovered from the bile disease eats such things as honey and sugar and relishes their taste so the bhikkhu having respectfully received the training rules such as the promulgations concerning conduct etc trains himself in them and relishes them
Therefore the Exalted One says that the abandonment of ill will is like good health
A man is placed in prison on a festival day On a later festival day he thinks Previously due to my own heedlessness I was bound in prison and thence I did not enjoy the festival
Now I will be heedful Thus he becomes heedful so that his foes do not get the chance  Having enjoyed the festival he utters the joyful exclamation Oh what a festival Oh what a festival  Similarly a bhikkhu thinks Dullness and drowsiness are a major cause of harm so he develops six things and abandons the hindrance of dullness and drowsiness When he has thus abandoned dullness and drowsiness then just as the man freed from imprisonment enjoys the beginning middle and end of the festival even for a week so the bhikkhu enjoys the beginning middle and end of the festival of Dhamma and attains arahatship together with the analytical knowledges 
Therefore the Exalted One says that the abandonment of dullness and drowsiness is like release from prison
A slave with the help of a friend gives money to his master and frees himself from slavery From then on he can do whatever he wishes to
Similarly a bhikkhu thinks Restlessness and worry are a major cause of harm so he develops six things and abandons the hindrance of restlessness and worry
When he has thus abandoned restlessness and worry then just as a free man can do whatever he wishes to and no one can forcibly prevent him from doing so so the bhikkhu happily practices the way of renunciation and restlessness and worry cannot forcibly prevent him from doing so
Therefore the Exalted One says that the abandonment of restlessness and worry is like freedom from slavery
A strong man having taken his valuables in hand might travel through a desert fully armed accompanied by his retinue Thieves having seen him even from afar would flee
Having safely crossed the desert and arrived at a place of safety he would become joyful and exuberant
Similarly a bhikkhu thinks Doubt is a major cause of harm so he develops six things and abandons the hindrance of doubt
When he has thus abandoned doubt then just as the strong man fully armed accompanied by his retinue is fearless and taking no more account of thieves than of grass safely leaves the desert and arrives at a place of safety so the bhikkhu crosses the desert of misconduct and arrives at the supreme place of safetythe deathless the great Nibbna
Therefore the Exalted One says that the abandonment of doubt is like a place of safety
 When he sees that these five hindrances have been abandoned within himself gladness arises Gladness arises the quality of joy arises
When he is gladdened rapture arises for one who is joyous rapture arises shaking his entire body
When his mind is filled with rapture his body becomes tranquil for a person whose mind is associated with rapture his mental body becomes tranquil it becomes free from disturbance
He experiences happiness he experiences bodily and mental happiness
Herein bhikkhus you should train thus Our minds will remain unaffected
But one who has achieved these four requisites succeeds in his forest life
and starting with him we shall abide pervading the allencompassing world with a mind similar to the earth abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill will
then it is secluded 
I shall heat up and burn away the river Ganges with this blazing grasstorch
and a man came with a stick or a potsherd
and said There is this catskin bag that is rubbedrid of rustling rid of crackling I shall make it rustle and crackle
All these are included under the term dwelling
Here however the Buddha is showing the dwelling appropriate for a bhikkhu who is similar to a bird at home in all four quarters of the world then he says he resorts to a secluded dwelling
Therein a forest a forest is explained as everything beyond the pillar marking the boundary of a village
 in the case of bhikkhunis
but for the bhikkhu described here it is fitting for his forest dwelling to be at least five hundred bowlengths from the village
do you see any course of speech trivial or gross that you could not endure
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
some say it is a place where rivers rush and roar
The open air an uncovered place
and the painful feelings which might arise moment after moment because of their being bent forward do not arise
or he sets it up in the region of the mouth
he acts in such a way that he lets go of covetousness and does not grasp it again
Dullness is sickness of the mind
drowsiness is sickness of mental factors together they are called dullness and drowsiness
Mindful and clearly comprehending he is endowed with mindfulness and knowledge
The similarity is as follows
and his debt is the reason he must endure it
Thus ill will should be regarded as a sickness
so the bhikkhu experiences no attachment or bondage towards any external object
His mind becomes concentrated for one who enjoys this happiness of renunciation the mind becomes concentrated by way of access and by way of absorption
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at SavatthI in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
 Now on that occasion the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son was staying at the residence of a certain householder in Savatthi for some business or other
What recluse or brahmin may we go to today to pay our respects 
Venerable sir this Blessed One is living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
You may go to pay your respects to that Blessed One venerable sir
Then having assented to the householder the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side and asked the Blessed One
Master Gotama the brahmins say this The householder is accomplishing the true way the Dhamma that is wholesome The one gone forth into homelessness is not accomplishing the true way the Dhamma that is wholesome
What does Master Gotama say about this 
Here student I am one who speaks after making an analysis I do not speak onesidedly
I do not praise the wrong way of practice on the part either of a householder or one gone forth
for whether it be a householder or one gone forth one who has entered on the wrong way of practice by reason of his wrong way of practice is not accomplishing the true way the Dhamma that is wholesome
Master Gotama the brahmins say this Since the work of the household life involves a great deal of activity great functions great engagements and great undertakings it is of great fruit Since the work of those gone forth involves a small amount of activity small functions small engagements and small undertakings it is of small fruit
What does Master Gotama say about this 
Here too student I am one who speaks after making an analysis I do not speak onesidedly
There is work involving a great deal of activity great functions great engagements and great undertakings which when it fails is of small fruit There is work involving a great deal of activity great functions great engagements and great undertakings which when it succeeds is of great fruit There is work involving a small amount of activity small functions small engagements and small undertakings which when it fails is of small fruit There is work involving a small amount of activity small functions small engagements and small undertakings which when it succeeds is of great fruit
What student is that work involving a great deal of activitywhich when it fails is of small fruit
Agriculture is that work involving a great deal of activitywhich when it fails is of small fruit
And what student is that work involving a great deal of activitywhich when it succeeds is of great fruit
Agriculture again is that work involving a great deal of activitywhich when it succeeds is of great fruit
And what student is that work involving a small amount of activity which when it fails is of small fruit
Trade is that work involving a small amount of activitywhich when it fails is of small fruit
And what student is that work involving a small amount of activitywhich when it succeeds is of great fruit
Trade again is that work involving a small amount of activitywhich when it succeeds is of great fruit
Just as agriculture student is work that involves a great deal of activitybut is of small fruit when it fails so the work of the household life involves a great deal of activity great functions great engagements and great undertakings but is of small fruit when it fails
Just as agriculture is work that involves a great deal of activityand is of great fruit when it succeeds so the work of the household life involves a great deal of activity great functions great engagements and great undertakings and is of great fruit when it succeeds
Just as trade is work that involves a small amount of activityand is of small fruit when it fails so the work of those gone forth involves a small amount of activity small functions small engagements and small undertakings and is of small fruit when it fails
Just as trade is work that involves a small amount of activitybut is of great fruit when it succeeds so the work of those gone forth involves a small amount of activity small functions small engagements and small undertakings but is of great fruit when it succeeds
Master Gotama the brahmins prescribe five things for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome
If it is not troublesome for you student please state to this assembly the five things that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome
It is not troublesome for me Master Gotama when such venerable ones as yourself and others are sitting in the assembly
Then state them student
Master Gotama truth is the first thing that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome
Asceticism is the second thing
Celibacy is the third thing
What does Master Gotama say about this 
How then student among the brahmins is there even a single brahmin who says thus I declare the result of these five things having realised it myself with direct knowledge
 No Master Gotama
How then student among the brahmins is there even a single teacher or teachers teacher back to the seventh generation of teachers who says thus I declare the result of these five things having realised it myself with direct knowledge
  No Master Gotama
How then student the ancient brahmin seers the creators of the hymns the composers of the hymns whose ancient hymns that were formerly chanted uttered and compiled the brahmins nowadays still chant and repeat repeating what was spoken reciting what was recited  that is Atthaka Vamaka Vamadeva Vessamitta Yamataggi Angirasa Bharadvaja Vasettha Kassapa and Bhagu  did even these ancient brahmin seers say thus We declare the result of these five things having realised it ourselves with direct knowledge
 No Master Gotama
So student it seems that among the brahmins there is not even a single brahmin who says thus I declare the result of these five things having realised it myself with direct knowledge And among the brahmins there is not even a single teacher or a single teachers teacher back to the seventh generation of teachers who says thus I declare the result of these five things having realised it myself with direct knowledge And the ancient brahmin seers the creators of the hymns the composers of the hymnseven these ancient brahmin seers did not say thus We declare the result of these five things having realised it ourselves with direct knowledge
Suppose there were a file of blind men each in touch with the next the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not see
So too student in regard to their statement the brahmins seem to be like a file of blind men the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not see
When this was said the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son was angry and displeased with the simile of the file of blind men and he reviled disparaged and censured the Blessed One saying The recluse Gotama will be worsted Then he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama the brahmin Pokkharasati of the Upamanna clan lord of the Subhaga Grove says thus Some recluses and brahmins here claim superhuman states distinctions in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones
For how could a human being know or see or realise a superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones
That is impossible  How then student does the brahmin Pokkharasati understand the minds of all recluses and brahmins having encompassed them with his own mind 
Master Gotama the brahmin Pokkharasati does not even understand the mind of his slavewoman Punnika having encompassed it with his own mind so how could he understand thus the minds of all recluses and brahmins 
Student suppose there were a man born blind who could not see dark and light forms who could not see blue yellow red or pink forms who could not see what was even and uneven who could not see the stars or the sun and moon
He might say thus There are no dark and light forms and no one who sees dark and light forms there are no blue yellow red or pink forms and no one who sees blue yellow red or pink forms there is nothing even and uneven and no one who sees anything even and uneven there are no stars and no sun and moon and no one who sees stars and the sun and moon
I do not know these I do not see these therefore these do not exist
Speaking thus student would he be speaking rightly 
No Master Gotama
Saying I do not know these I do not see these therefore these do not exist he would not be speaking rightly
So too student the brahmin Pokkharasati is blind and visionless
That he could know or see or realise a superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones  this is impossible
What do you think student What is better for those welltodo brahmins of Kosala such as the brahmin Canki the brahmin Tarukkha the brahmin Pokkharasati the brahmin Janussoni or your father the brahmin Todeyya  that the statements they make accord with worldly convention or flaunt worldly convention
 That they accord with worldly convention Master Gotama
What is better for them that the statements they make be thoughtful or thoughtless
 Thoughtful Master Gotama
 What is better for them that they make their statements after reflecting or without reflecting
 After reflecting Master Gotama
 What is better for them that the statements they make be beneficial or unbeneficial
 Beneficial Master Gotama
What do you think student If that is so did the statement made by the brahmin Pokkharasati accord with worldly convention or flaunt worldly convention
 It flaunted worldly convention Master Gotama
 Was the statement made thoughtful or thoughtless
 Thoughtless Master Gotama
 Was the statement made after reflecting or without reflecting
 Without reflecting Master Gotama
 Was the statement made beneficial or unbeneficial
 Unbeneficial Master Gotama
Now there are these five hindrances student
What are the five
The hindrance of sensual desire the hindrance of ill will the hindrance of sloth and torpor the hindrance of restlessness and remorse and the hindrance of doubt These are the five hindrances
The brahmin Pokkharasati is obstructed hindered blocked and enveloped by these five hindrances
That he could know or see or realise a superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones  this is impossible
Now there are these five cords of sensual pleasure student
What are the five
Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust Sounds cognizable by the earOdours cognizable by the noseFlavours cognizable by the tongueTangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust These are the five cords of sensual pleasure
The brahmin Pokkharasati is tied to these five cords of sensual pleasure infatuated with them and utterly committed to them he enjoys them without seeing the danger in them or understanding the escape from them
That he could know or see or realise a superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones  this is impossible
What do you think student Which of these two fires would have a better flame colour and radiance  a fire that might burn in dependence on fuel such as grass and wood or a fire that might burn independent of fuel such as grass and wood 
If it were possible Master Gotama for a fire to burn independent of fuel such as grass and wood that fire would have a better flame colour and radiance
It is impossible student it cannot happen that a fire could burn independent of fuel such as grass or wood except through the exercise of supernormal power
Like the fire that burns dependent on fuel such as grass and wood I say is the rapture that is dependent on the five cords of sensual pleasure
Like the fire that burns independent of fuel such as grass and wood I say is the rapture that is apart from sensual pleasures apart from unwholesome states
And what student is the rapture that is apart from sensual pleasures apart from unwholesome states
Here quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
This is a rapture apart from sensual pleasures apart from unwholesome states
Again with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentration
This too is a rapture apart from sensual pleasures apart from unwholesome states
Of those five things student that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome which of the five do they prescribe as the most fruitful for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome 
Of those five things Master Gotama that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome they prescribe generosity as the most fruitful for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome
What do you think student Here a brahmin might be holding a great sacrifice and two other brahmins would go there thinking to take part in that great sacrifice
One brahmin among them would think Oh that only I might get the best seat the best water the best almsfood in the refectory that no other brahmin might get the best seat the best water the best almsfood in the refectory
And it is possible that the other brahmin not that brahmin gets the best seat the best water the best almsfood in the refectory
Thinking about this the first brahmin might become angry and displeased
What kind of result do the brahmins describe for this 
Master Gotama brahmins do not give gifts in such a way thinking Let the others become angry and displeased because of this
Rather brahmins give gifts motivated by compassion
That being so student isnt this the brahmins sixth basis for the performance of merit that is the motive of compassion 
That being so Master Gotama this is the brahmins sixth basis for the performance of merit that is the motive of compassion
Those five things student that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome  where do you often see those five things among householders or among those gone forth 
Those five things Master Gotama that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome I often see among those gone forth seldom among householders
For the householder has a great deal of activity great functions great engagements and great undertakings he does not constantly and invariably speak the truth practise asceticism observe celibacy engage in study or engage in generosity
Thus those five things that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome I often see among those gone forth seldom among householders
Those five things student that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome I call equipment of the mind that is for developing a mind that is without hostility and without ill will
Here student a bhikkhu is a speaker of truth
Thinking I am a speaker of truth he gains inspiration in the meaning gains inspiration in the Dhamma gains gladness connected with the Dhamma
It is that gladness connected with the wholesome that I call an equipment of the mind
Here student a bhikkhu is an asceticone who is celibateone who engages in studyone who engages in generosity
Thinking I am one who engages in generosity he gains inspiration in the meaning gains inspiration in the Dhamma gains gladness connected with the Dhamma
It is that gladness connected with the wholesome that I call an equipment of the mind
Thus those five things that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome I call equipment of the mind that is for developing a mind that is without hostility and without ill will
When this was said the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son said to the Blessed One Master Gotama I have heard that the recluse Gotama knows the path to the company of Brahma
What do you think student Is the village of Nalakara near here not far from here 
Yes sir the village of Nalakara is near here not far from here
What do you think student Suppose there was a man born and raised in the village of Nalakara and as soon as he had left Nalakara they asked him about the path to the village Would that man be slow or hesitant in answering 
No Master Gotama
Why is that
Because that man has been born and raised in Nalakara and is wellacquainted with all the paths to the village
Still a man born and raised in the village of Nalakara might be slow or hesitant in answering when asked about the path to the village but a Tathagata when asked about the Brahmaworld or the way leading to the Brahmaworld would never be slow or hesitant in answering I understand Brahma student and I understand the Brahmaworld and I understand the way leading to the Brahmaworld and I understand how one should practise to reappear in the Brahmaworld
Master Gotama I have heard that the recluse Gotama teaches the path to the company of Brahma
It would be good if Master Gotama would teach me the path to the company of Brahma
Then student listen and attend closely to what I shall say
Yes sir he replied
The Blessed One said this
What student is the path to the company of Brahma
Here a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with lovingkindness likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with lovingkindness abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill will
When the deliverance of mind by lovingkindness is developed in this way no limiting action remains there none persists there
Just as a vigorous trumpeter could make himself heard without difficulty in the four quarters so too when the deliverance of mind by lovingkindness is developed in this way no limiting action remains there none persists there
This is the path to the company of Brahma
Again a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassionwith a mind imbued with appreciative joywith a mind imbued with equanimity likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with equanimity abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill will
When the deliverance of mind by equanimity is developed in this way no limiting action remains there none persists there
Just as a vigorous trumpeter could make himself heard without difficulty in the four quarters so too when the deliverance of mind by equanimity is developed in this way no limiting action remains there none persists there
This too is the path to the company of Brahma
When this was said the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent Master Gotama Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overturned revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms
Let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life
And now Master Gotama we depart We are busy and have much to do
Now is the time student to do as you think fit
Then the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones words rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One keeping him on his right he departed
coming in the distance and asked him Now where is Master Bharadvaja coming from in the middle of the day 
Sir I am coming from the presence of the recluse Gotama
Sir who am I to know the recluse Gotamas lucidity of wisdom
One would surely have to be his equal to know the recluse Gotamas lucidity of wisdom
Master Bharadvaja praises the recluse Gotama with high praise indeed
Sir who am I to praise the recluse Gotama
The recluse Gotama is praised by the praised as best among gods and humans
Sir those five things that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome the recluse Gotama calls equipment of the mind that is for developing a mind that is without hostility and without ill will
When this was said the brahmin Janussoni got down from his allwhite chariot drawn by white mares and after arranging his upper robe on one shoulder he extended his hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and uttered this exclamation It is a gain for King Pasenadi of Kosala it is a great gain for King Pasenadi of Kosala that the Tathagata accomplished and fully enlightened lives in his realm
Then the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son asked the householder in whose residence he was staying Householder I have heard that Savatthi is not devoid of arahants
I praise the right way of practice on the part either of a householder or one gone forth
for whether it be a householder or one gone forth one who has entered on the right way of practice by reason of his right way of practice is accomplishing the true way the Dhamma that is wholesome
Study is the fourth thing
Generosity is the fifth thing that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome
These are the five things that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit for accomplishing the wholesome
But what they say turns out to be ridiculous it turns out to be mere words empty and hollow
There are dark and light forms and those who see dark and light formsthere are the stars and the sun and moon and those who see the stars and the sun and moon
But one gone forth has a small amount of activity small functions small engagements and small undertakings he constantly and invariably speaks the truth practises asceticism observes celibacy engages in study and engages in generosity
I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
Now on that occasion the brahmin Janussoni was driving out of Savatthi in the middle of the day in an allwhite chariot drawn by white mares
He saw the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son
What does Master Bharadvaja think of the recluse Gotamas lucidity of wisdom He is wise is he not 
 Thus have I heard Once the Venerable Ananda was staying at Savatthi in Jetas grove in Anathapindikas park shortly after the Lords final passing
 And Subha said to a certain young man Go my lad to where the ascetic Ananda is ask him in my name if he is in good health free from fatigue strong vigorous and dwelling in comfort
and say It would be good if the Reverend Ananda would out of compassion visit the dwelling of Subha the son of Todeyya
 Very good sir replied the young man Then he went to the Venerable Ananda exchanged courtesies with him
and sat down to one side
Then he delivered the message
 The Venerable Ananda replied It is not the right time young man
Today I have taken some medicine
Perhaps it will be possible to come tomorrow when the time and the occasion are suitable
And the young man rose returned to Subha and reported what had passed between him and the Venerable Ananda adding
My mission has been thus far accomplished that the Reverend Ananda will probably take the opportunity to come tomorrow
 And indeed as that night was ending the Venerable Ananda dressed in the early morning took his robe and bowl and accompanied by the Venerable Cetaka came to Subhas dwelling and sat down on the prepared seat 
Then Subha approached the Venerable Ananda exchanged courtesies with him
and sat down to one side
Then he said The Reverend Ananda was for a long time the Reverend Gotamas per sonal attendant dwelling in his presence and near him 
You Reverend Ananda would know what things the Reverend Gotama praised and with which he aroused exhorted and established people 
Which Reverend Ananda were those things
 Subha there were three divisions of things which the Lord praised and with which he aroused exhorted and established people
Which three 
The division of Ariyan morality the division of Ariyan concentration and the division of Ariyan wisdom
These were the three divisions of things which the Lord praised
Well Reverend Ananda what is the division of Ariyan morality which the Reverend Gotama praised 
Young sir a Tathagata arises in the world an Ara hant fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessed
He having realised it by his own superknowledge proclaims this world with its devas maras and Brahmas its princes and people
He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and displays the fullyperfected and purified holy life
Thus a monk is perfected in morality
That is the division of Ariyan morality which the Lord praised
It is wonderful Reverend Ananda it is marvellous
This division of Ariyan morality is perfectly fulfilled not left incomplete
And I do not see this division of Ariyan morality fulfilled thus anywhere among the ascetics and Brahmins of other schools
And if any of them were to have found this perfection in themselves they would have been so delighted that they would have said Weve done enough The goal of our asceticism has been reached Theres nothing more to be done
And yet the Reverend Ananda declares that there is more to be done 
 Reverend Ananda what is the division of Ariyan concentration which the Reverend Gotama praised 
And how is a monk guardian of the sensedoors
This comes to him through concentration
That is the division of Ariyan concentration which the Lord praised
It is wonderful Reverend Ananda it is marvellous
This division of Ariyan concentration is perfectly fulfilled not left incomplete
And I do not see this division of Ariyan concentration fulfilled thus anywhere among the ascetics and Brahmins of other schools
And if any of them were to have found this perfection in themselves they would have been so delighted that they would have said Weve done enough The goal of our asceticism has been reached Theres nothing more to be done
And yet the Reverend Ananda declares that there is more to be done 
Reverend Ananda what is the division of Ariyan wisdom which the Reverend Gotama praised 
And so with mind concentrated he attains various insights
That is the division of Ariyan wisdom which the Lord praised with which he aroused exhorted and established people
Beyond that there is nothing to be done
It is wonderful Reverend Ananda it is marvellous
This division of Ariyan wisdom is perfectly fulfilled not left incomplete
And I do not see this division of Ariyan wisdom fulfilled thus anywhere among the ascetics and Brahmins of other schools
And there is nothing further to be done
Excellent Reverend Ananda excellent
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oillamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there
Just so the Reverend Ananda has expounded the Dhamma in various ways
Reverend Ananda I go for refuge to the Lord Gotama the Dhamma and the Sangha
May the Reverend Ananda accept me as a layfollower who has taken refuge from this day forth as long as life shall last 
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering by stages in the Kosalan Country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and eventually he arrived at a Kosalan brahmin village named Sala
The brahmin householders of Sala heard The recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan has been wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and has come to Sala
Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessed
He declares this world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas this generation with its recluses and brahmins its princes and its people which he has himself realised with direct knowledge
He teaches the Dhamma good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing and he reveals a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure
Now it is good to see such arahants
Then the brahmin householders of Sala went to the Blessed One Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side some exchanged greetings with him and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished sat down at one side some extended their hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and sat down at one side some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed Ones presence and sat down at one side some kept silent and sat down at one side
When they were seated they said to the Blessed One Master Gotama what is the cause and condition why some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell
And what is the cause and condition why some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world 
Householders it is by reason of conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of unrighteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell
It is by reason of conduct in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of righteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world
We do not understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotamas utterance which he has spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaning
It would be good if Master Gotama would teach us the Dhamma so that we might understand the detailed meaning of his utterance
Then householders listen and attend closely to what I shall say
Yes venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this
Householders there are three kinds of bodily conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct There are four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct There are three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
And how householders are there three kinds of bodily conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
Here someone kills living beings he is murderous bloodyhanded given to blows and violence merciless to living beings
He takes what is not given
he has intercourse with women who are protected by their mother father mother and father brother sister or relatives who have a husband who are protected by law and even with those who are garlanded in token of betrothal
That is how there are three kinds of bodily conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
And how householders are there four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
when summoned to a court or to a meeting or to his relatives presence or to his guild or to the royal familys presence and questioned as a witness thus So good man tell what you know not knowing he says I know or knowing he says I do not know not seeing he says I see or seeing he says I do not see
He speaks maliciously
He speaks harshly
He is a gossip
That is how there are four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
And how householders are there three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
Here someone is covetous he covets the wealth and property of others thus Oh may what belongs to another be mine 
Or he has a mind of ill will and intentions of hate thus May these beings be slain and slaughtered may they be cut off perish or be annihilated
Or he has wrong view distorted vision thus There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed no fruit or result of good and bad actions no this world no other world no mother no father no beings who are reborn spontaneously no good and virtuous recluses and brahmins in the world who have themselves realised by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world
That is how there are three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
So householders it is by reason of such conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of such unrighteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell
Householders there are three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct There are four kinds of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct There are three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
And how householders are there three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
Here someone abandoning the killing of living beings abstains from killing living beings with rod and weapon laid aside gentle and kindly he abides compassionate to all living beings
Abandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not given
Abandoning misconduct in sensual pleasures he abstains from misconduct in sensual pleasures
That is how there are three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
And how householders are there four kinds of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
Here someone abandoning false speech abstains from false speech
Abandoning malicious speech he abstains from malicious speech
Abandoning harsh speech he abstains from harsh speech
he speaks such words as are gentle pleasing to the ear and loveable as go to the heart are courteous desired by many and agreeable to many
That is how there are four kinds of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
And how householders are there three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
Here someone is not covetous he does not covet the wealth and property of others thus Oh may what belongs to another be mine
 His mind is without ill will and he has intentions free from hate thus May these beings be free from enmity affliction and anxiety May they live happily
 He has right view undistorted vision thus There is what is given and what is offered and what is sacrificed there is fruit and result of good and bad actions there is this world and the other world there is mother and father there are beings who are reborn spontaneously there are good and virtuous recluses and brahmins in the world who have themselves realised by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world
That is how there are three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
So householders it is by reason of such conduct in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of such righteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world

 Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways
We go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
From today let Master Gotama accept us as lay followers who have gone to him for refuge for life
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthl in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
 Then the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
Master Gotama what is the cause and condition why human beings are seen to be inferior and superior
For people are seen to be shortlived and longlived sickly and healthy ugly and beautiful uninfluential and influential poor and wealthy lowborn and highborn stupid and wise
What is the cause and condition Master Gotama why human beings are seen to be inferior and superior 
Student beings are owners of their actions heirs of their actions they originate from their actions are bound to their actions have their actions as their refuge
It is action that distinguishes beings as inferior and superior
I do not understand in detail the meaning of Master Gotamas statement which he spoke in brief without expounding the meaning in detail
It would be good if Master Gotama would teach me the Dhamma so that I might understand in detail the meaning of Master Gotamas statement
Then student listen and attend closely to what I shall say
Yes sir the brahmin student Subha replied
The Blessed One said this
Here student some man or woman kills living beings and is murderous bloodyhanded given to blows and violence merciless to living beings
Because of performing and undertaking such action on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell
But if on the dissolution of the body after death he does not reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell but instead comes back to the human state then wherever he is reborn he is shortlived
This is the way student that leads to short life namely one kills living being and is murderous bloodyhanded given to blows and violence merciless to living beings
But here student some man or woman abandoning the killing of living beings abstains from killing living beings with rod and weapon laid aside gentle and kindly he abides compassionate to all living beings

But here student some man or woman is not envious one who does not envy resent and begrudge the gains honour respect reverence salutations and veneration received by others
But if instead he comes back to the human state then wherever he is reborn he is influential
Here student some man or woman does not give food drink clothing carriages garlands scents unguents beds dwelling and lamps to recluses or brahmins
This is the way student that leads to poverty namely one does not give foodand lamps to recluses or brahmins

When this was said the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama
Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overturned revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms
Let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
and asked the Blessed One
But if on the dissolution of the body after death he does not reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world but instead comes back to the human state then wherever he is reborn he is longlived
This is the way student that leads to long life namely abandoning the killing of living beings one abstains from killing living beings with rod and weapon laid aside gentle and kindly one abides compassionate to all living beings

I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the country of the Anguttarapans at a town of theirs named Apana
Then when it was morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Apana for alms
Having entered the grove he sat down at the root of a tree
Potaliya the householder while walking and wandering for exercise wearing full dress with parasol and sandals also went to the grove and having entered the grove he went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he stood at one side
The Blessed One said to him There are seats householder sit down if you like
When this was said the householder Potaliya thought The recluse Gotama addresses me as householder and angry and displeased he remained silent
A second time the Blessed One said to him There are seats householder sit down if you like And a second time the householder Potaliya thought The recluse Gotama addresses me as householder and angry and displeased he remained silent A third time the Blessed One said to him There are seats householder sit down if you like
When this was said the householder Potaliya thought The recluse Gotama addresses me as householder and angry and displeased he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama it is neither fitting nor proper that you address me as householder
Householder you have the aspects marks and signs of a householder
Nevertheless Master Gotama I have given up all my works and cut off all my affairs
In what way have you given up all your works householder and cut off all your affairs 
Master Gotama I have given all my wealth grain silver and gold to my children as their inheritance Without advising or admonishing them I live merely on food and clothing
Householder the cutting off of affairs as you describe it is one thing but in the Noble Ones Discipline the cutting off of affairs is different
What is the cutting off of affairs like in the Noble Ones Discipline venerable sir
It would be good venerable sir if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma showing what the cutting off of affairs is like in the Noble Ones Discipline
Then listen householder and attend closely to what I shall say
Yes venerable sir Potaliya the householder replied
The Blessed One said this  Householder there are these eight things in the Noble Ones Discipline that lead to the cutting off of affairs
What are the eight
With the support of the nonkilling of living beings the killing of living beings is to be abandoned With the support of taking only what is given the taking of what is not given is to be abandoned With the support of truthful speech false speech is to be abandoned With the support of unmalicious speech malicious speech is to be abandoned With the support of refraining from rapacious greed rapacious greed is to be abandoned With the support of refraining from spiteful scolding spiteful scolding is to be abandoned With the support of refraining from angry despair angry despair is to be abandoned With the support of nonarrogance arrogance is to be abandoned
These are the eight things stated in brief without being expounded in detail that lead to the cutting off of affairs in the Noble Ones Discipline
Venerable sir it would be good if out of compassion the Blessed One would expound to me in detail these eight things that lead to the cutting off of affairs in the Noble Ones Discipline which have been stated in brief by the Blessed One without being expounded in detail
Then listen householder and attend closely to what I shall say
Yes venerable sir Potaliya the householder replied
The Blessed One said this
With the support of the nonkilling of living beings the killing of living beings is to be abandoned So it was said And with reference to what was this said
Here a noble disciple considers thus I am practising the way to the abandoning and cutting off of those fetters because of which I might kill living beings
If I were to kill living beings I would blame myself for doing so the wise having investigated would censure me for doing so and on the dissolution of the body after death because of killing living beings an unhappy destination would be expected
And while taints vexation and fever might arise through the killing of living beings there are no taints vexation and fever in one who abstains from killing living beings
So it is with reference to this that it was said With the support of the nonkilling of living beings the killing of living beings is to be abandoned
With the support of taking only what is given the taking of what is not given is to be abandoned So it was said
With the support of truthful speech false speech is to be abandoned So it was said
With the support of unmalicious speech malicious speech is to be abandoned So it was said
With the support of refraining from rapacious greed rapacious greed is to be abandoned So it was said
With the support of refraining from spiteful scolding spiteful scolding is to be abandoned So it was said
With the support of refraining from angry despair angry despair is to be abandoned So it was said
With the support of nonarrogance arrogance is to be abandoned So it was said And with reference to what was this said
Here a noble disciple considers thus I am practising the way to the abandoning and cutting off of those fetters because of which I might be arrogant
If I were to be arrogant I would blame myself for this the wise having investigated would censure me for this and on the dissolution of the body after death because of being arrogant an unhappy destination would be expected
But this arrogance is itself a fetter and a hindrance
So it is with reference to this that it was said With the support of nonarrogance arrogance is to be abandoned
These eight things that lead to the cutting off of affairs in the Noble Ones Discipline have now been expounded in detail But the cutting off of affairs in the Noble Ones Discipline has not yet been achieved entirely and in all ways
Venerable sir how is the cutting off of affairs in the Noble Ones Discipline achieved entirely and in all ways
It would be good venerable sir if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma showing me how the cutting off of affairs in the Noble Ones Discipline is achieved entirely and in all ways
Then listen householder and attend closely to what I shall say
Yes venerable sir Potaliya the householder replied
The Blessed One said this
When he had wandered for alms in Apana and had returned from his almsround after his meal he went to a certain grove for the days abiding
That is how I have given up all my works and cut off all my affairs
But this killing of living beings is itself a fetter and a hindrance
And while taints vexation and fever might arise through arrogance there are no taints vexation and fever for one who is not arrogant
Then a skilled butcher or his apprentice would cut out a skeleton of meatless bones smeared with blood and toss it to the dog 
What do you think householder 
Would that dog get rid of his hunger and weakness by gnawing such a skeleton of meatless bones smeared with blood 
No venerable sir 
Why is that 
Because that skeleton consisted only of meatless bones smeared with blood 
Eventually that dog would reap weariness and disappointment 
So too householder a noble disciple considers thus Sensual pleasures have been compared to a skeleton by the Blessed One they provide much suffering and much despair while the danger in them is great 
Haying seen this thus as it actually is with proper wisdom he avoids the equanimity that is diversified based on diversity and develops the equanimity that is unified based on unity where clinging to the material things of the world utterly ceases without remainder 
Householder suppose a vulture a crow or a hawk seized a piece of meat and flew away and then vultures crows and hawks flew up and pecked and clawed it 
What do you think householder 
If that vulture crow or hawk does not quickly let go of that piece of meat wouldnt it incur death or deadly suffering because of that  
Yes venerable sir 
So too householder a noble disciple considers thus Sensual pleasures have been compared to a piece of meat by the Blessed One they provide much suffering and much despair while the danger in them is great 
Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper wisdomclinging to the material things of the world utterly ceases without remainder 
Householder suppose a man took a blazing grass torch and went against the wind 
What do you think householder  If that man does not quickly let go of that blazing grass torch wouldnt that blazing grass torch burn his hand or his arm or some other part of his body so that he might incur death or deadly suffering because of that  
Yes venerable sir 
So too householder a noble disciple considers thus Sensual pleasures have been compared to a grass torch by the Blessed One they provide much suffering and much despair while the danger in them is great 
Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper wisdomclinging to the material things of the world utterly ceases without remainder 
Householder suppose there were a charcoal pit deeper than a mans height full of glowing coals without flame or smoke 
Then a man came who wanted to live and not to die who wanted pleasure and recoiled from pain
What do you think householder  Would that man twist his body this way and that  
Why is that 
Because that man knows that if he falls into that charcoal pit he will incur death or deadly suffering because of that 
So too householder a noble disciple considers thus Sensual pleasures have been compared to a charcoal pit by the Blessed One they provide much suffering and much despair while the danger in them is great 
Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper wisdomclinging to the material things of the world utterly ceases without remainder 
Householder suppose a man dreamt about lovely parks lovely groves lovely meadows and lovely lakes
So too householder a noble disciple considers thus Sensual pleasures have been compared to a dream by the Blessed One they provide much suffering and much despair while the danger in them is great  Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper wisdomclinging to the material things of the world utterly ceases without remainder 
Householder suppose a man borrowed goods on loan  a fancy carriage and finejewelled earrings 
Then people seeing him would say Sirs that is a rich man  That is how the rich enjoy their wealth  
Then the owners whenever they saw him would take back their things 
What do you think householder  Would that be enough for that man to become dejected 
Yes venerable sir 
Why is that 
Because the owners took back their things 
So too householder a noble disciple considers thus Sensual pleasures have been compared to borrowed goods by the Blessed One they provide much suffering and much despair while the danger in them is great  Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper wisdomclinging to material things of the world utterly ceases without remainder 
Householder suppose there were a dense grove not far from some village or town
Then a man came needing fruit seeking fruit wandering in search of fruit
Thereupon he thought This tree is laden with fruit but none of its fruit has fallen to the ground 
I know how to climb a tree
so let me climb this tree eat as much fruit as I want and fill my bag 
And he did so 
Then a second man came needing fruit seeking fruit wandering in search of fruit and taking a sharp axe
Thereupon he thought This tree is laden with fruit but none of its fruit has fallen to the ground 
What do you think householder  If that first man who had climbed the tree doesnt come down quickly when the tree falls wouldnt he break his hand or his foot or some other part of his body so that he might incur death or deadly suffering because of that  
Yes venerable sir 
So too householder a noble disciple considers thus Sensual pleasures have been compared to a fruit tree by the Blessed One they provide much suffering and much despair while the danger in them is great 
Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper wisdom he avoids the equanimity that is diversified based on diversity and develops the equanimity that is unified based on unity where clinging to the material things of the world utterly ceases without remainder 
Having arrived at that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is due to equanimity this noble disciple recollects his manifold past lives that is one birth two birthsThus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives 
Having arrived at that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is due to equanimity with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human this noble disciple sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunateand he understands how beings pass on according to their actions 
Having arrived at that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is due to equanimity by realising for himself with direct knowledge this noble disciple here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints 
At this point householder the cutting off of affairs in the Noble Ones Discipline has been achieved entirely and in all ways 
What do you think householder  Do you see in yourself any cutting off of affairs like this cutting off of affairs in the Noble Ones Discipline when it is achieved entirely and in all ways  
Venerable sir who am I that I should possess any cutting off of affairs entirely and in all ways like that in the Noble Ones Discipline 
I am far indeed venerable sir from that cutting off of affairs in the Noble Ones Discipline when it has been achieved entirely and in all ways 
For venerable sir though the wanderers of other sects are not thoroughbreds we imagined that they are thoroughbreds though they are not thoroughbreds we fed them the food of thoroughbreds though they are not thoroughbreds we set them in the place of thoroughbreds  But though the bhikkhus are thoroughbreds we imagined that they are not thoroughbreds though they are thoroughbreds we fed them the food of those who are not thoroughbreds though they are thoroughbreds we set them in the place of those who are not thoroughbreds  But now venerable sir as the wanderers of other sects are not thoroughbreds we shall understand that they are not thoroughbreds as they are not thoroughbreds we shall feed them the food of those who are not thoroughbreds as they are not thoroughbreds we shall set them in the place of those who are not thoroughbreds 
But as the bhikkhus are thoroughbreds we shall understand that they are thoroughbreds as they are thoroughbreds we shall feed them the food of thoroughbreds as they are thoroughbreds we shall set them in the place of those who are thoroughbreds 
Venerable sir the Blessed One has inspired in me love for recluses confidence in recluses reverence for recluses 
Magnificent Master Gotama 
Magnificent Master Gotama  Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms
From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life
Yes venerable sir 
and preceded and surrounded by those borrowed goods he went to the marketplace 
and two strong men seized him by both arms and dragged him towards that charcoal pit 
and on waking he saw nothing of it 
within which there was a tree laden with fruit but none of its fruit had fallen to the ground 
I do not know how to climb a tree
And he did so 
I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus 
and he entered the grove and saw the tree laden with fruit 
he too entered the grove and saw that tree laden with fruit 
so let me cut this tree down at its root eat as much fruit as I want and fill my bag 
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Kuru country at a town of the Kurus named Kammasadhamma on a spread of grass in the fire chamber of a brahmin belonging to the Bharadvaja clan
Then when it was morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Kammasadhamma for alms
Having entered the grove he sat down at the root of a tree for the days abiding
Then the wanderer Magandiya while walking and wandering for exercise went to the fire chamber of the brahmin belonging to the Bharadvaja clan
Master Magandiya there is the recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan
Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessed
This bed has been prepared for that Master Gotama
when we see the bed of that destroyer of growth Master Gotama
Be careful what you say Magandiya be careful what you say
Many learned nobles learned brahmins learned householders and learned recluses have full confidence in Master Gotama and have been disciplined by him in the noble true way in the Dhamma that is wholesome
Master Bharadvaja even if we saw that Master Gotama face to face we would tell him to his face The recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth
Why is that
Because that is recorded in our scriptures
If Master Magandiya has no objection may I tell this to Master Gotama 
Let Master Bharadvaja be at ease Tell him just what I have said
Meanwhile with the divine ear which is purified and surpasses the human the Blessed One heard this conversation between the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan and the wanderer Magandiya
Then when it was evening the Blessed One rose from meditation went to the brahmins fire chamber and sat down on the spread of grass made ready
Then the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
The Blessed One asked him Bharadvaja did you have any conversation with the wanderer Magandiya about this spread of grass 
When this was said the brahmin awestruck and with his hair standing on end replied We wanted to tell Master Gotama about that very thing
But this discussion between the Blessed One and the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan was left unfinished
He exchanged greetings with the Blessed One and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
The Blessed One said to him
Magandiya the eye delights in forms takes delight in forms rejoices in forms
Was it with reference to this that you said The recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth 
It was with reference to this Master Gotama that I said The recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth
Why is that
Because that is recorded in our scriptures
Was it with reference to this that you said The recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth
It was with reference to this Master Gotama that I said The recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth
Why is that
Because that is recorded in our scriptures
What do you think Magandiya Here someone may have formerly enjoyed himself with forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust On a later occasion having understood as they actually are the origin the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of forms he might abandon craving for forms remove fever for forms and abide without thirst with a mind inwardly at peace
What would you say to him Magandiya
 Nothing Master Gotama
What do you think Magandiya Here someone may have formerly enjoyed himself with sounds cognizable by the earwith odours cognizable by the nosewith flavours cognizable by the tonguewith tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust On a later occasion having understood as they actually are the origin the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of tangibles he might abandon craving for tangibles remove fever for tangibles and abide without thirst with a mind inwardly at peace
What would you say to him Magandiya
 Nothing Master Gotama
Magandiya formerly when I lived the home life I enjoyed myself provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure with forms cognizable by the eyewith sounds cognizable by the earwith odours cognizable by the nosewith flavours cognizable by the tonguewith tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust
I had three palaces one for the rainy season one for the winter and one for the summer
On a later occasion having understood as they actually are the origin the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of sensual pleasures I abandoned craving for sensual pleasures I removed fever for sensual pleasures and I abide without thirst with a mind inwardly at peace
I see other beings who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures being devoured by craving for sensual pleasuresburning with fever for sensual pleasures indulging in sensual pleasures
Why is that
Suppose Magandiya a householder or a householders son was rich with great wealth and property and being provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure he might enjoy himself with forms cognizable by the eyewith sounds cognizable by the earwith odours cognizable by the nosewith flavours cognizable by the tonguewith tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust
Having conducted himself well in body speech and mind on the dissolution of the body after death he might reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world in the retinue of the gods of the Thirtythree
Suppose he saw a householder or a householders son enjoying himself provided and endowed with the five cords of human sensual pleasure
What do you think Magandiya Would that young god surrounded by the group of nymphs in the Nandana Grove enjoying himself provided and endowed with the five cords of divine sensual pleasure envy the householder or the householders son for the five cords of human sensual pleasure or would he return to human sensual pleasures 
No Master Gotama
Why not
Because heavenly sensual pleasures are more excellent and sublime than human sensualpleasures
So too Magandiya formerly when I lived the home life I enjoyed myself provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure with forms cognizable by the eyewith tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust
On a later occasion having understood as they actually are the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of sensual pleasures I abandoned craving for sensual pleasures I removed fever for sensual pleasures and I abide without thirst with a mind inwardly at peace
I see other beings who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures being devoured by craving for sensual pleasures burning with fever for sensual pleasures indulging in sensual pleasures and I do not envy them nor do I delight therein
Why is that
Because there is Magandiya a delight apart from sensual pleasures apart from unwholesome states which surpasses divine bliss Since I take delight in that I do not envy what is inferior nor do I delight therein
Suppose Magandiya there was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs being devoured by worms scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails cauterising his body over a burning charcoal pit
Then his friends and companions his kinsmen and relatives would bring a physician to treat him
The physician would make medicine for him
Then he might see another leper with sores and blisters on his limbs being devoured by worms scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails cauterising his body over a burning charcoal pit
What do you think Magandiya Would that man envy that leper for his burning charcoal pit or his use of medicine 
No Master Gotama
Why is that
Because when there is sickness medicine has to be made and when there is no sickness medicine does not have to be made
So too Magandiya formerly when I lived the home lifeas in Since I take delight in that I do not envy what is inferior nor do I delight therein
Suppose Magandiya there was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs being devoured by worms scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails cauterising his body over a burning charcoal pit
Then his friends and companions his kinsmen and relatives brought a physician to treat him
The physician would make medicine for him
Then two strong men would seize him by both arms and drag him towards a burning charcoal pit
What do you think Magandiya Would that man twist his body this way and that 
Yes Master Gotama
Why is that
Because that fire is indeed painful to touch hot and scorching
What do you think Magandiya Is it only now that that fire is painful to touch hot and scorching or previously too was that fire painful to touch hot and scorching 
Master Gotama that fire is now painful to touch hot and scorching and previously too that fire was painful to touch hot and scorching
For when that man was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs being devoured by worms scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails his faculties were impaired thus though the fire was actually painful to touch he mistakenly perceived it as pleasant
So too Magandiya in the past sensual pleasures were painful to touch hot and scorching in the future sensual pleasures will be painful to touch hot and scorching and now at present sensual pleasures are painful to touch hot and scorching
But these beings who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures who are devoured by craving for sensual pleasures who burn with fever for sensual pleasures have faculties that are impaired thus though sensual pleasures are actuallypainful to touch they acquire a mistaken perception of them as pleasant
Suppose Magandiya there was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs being devoured by worms scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails cauterising his body over a burning charcoal pit
the more he scratches the scabs and cauterises his body the fouler more evilsmelling and more infected the openings of his wounds would become yet he would find a certain measure of satisfaction and enjoyment in scratching the openings of his wounds
What do you think Magandiya Have you ever seen or heard of a king or a kings minister enjoying himself provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure who without abandoning craving for sensual pleasures without removing fever for sensual pleasures was able to abide free from thirst with a mind inwardly at peace or who is able or who will be able to so abide
 No Master Gotama
Good Magandiya
I too have never seen or heard of a king or a kings minister enjoying himself provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure who without abandoning craving for sensual pleasures without removing fever for sensual pleasures was able to abide free from thirst with a mind inwardly at peace or who is able or who will be able to so abide
On the contrary Magandiya those recluses or brahmins who abided or abide or will abide free from thirst with a mind inwardly at peace all do so after having understood as they actually are the origin the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of sensual pleasures and it is after abandoning craving for sensual pleasures and removing fever for sensual pleasures that they abided or abide or will abide free from thirst with a mind inwardly at peace
Then at that point the Blessed One uttered this exclamation
The greatest of all gains is health Nibbana is the greatest bliss
The eightfold path is the best of paths For it leads safely to the Deathless
When this was said the wanderer Magandiya said to the Blessed One It is wonderful Master Gotama it is marvellous
We too have heard this said by earlier wanderers in the tradition of the teachers and it agrees Master Gotama
But Magandiya when you heard that said by earlier wanderers in the tradition of the teachers what is that health what is that Nibbana 
When this was said the wanderer Magandiya rubbed his limbs with his hands and said This is that health Master Gotama this is that Nibbana
Magandiya suppose there was a man born blind who could not see dark and light forms who could not see blue yellow red or pink forms who could not see what was even and uneven who could not see the stars or the sun and moon
He might hear a man with good eyesight saying Good indeed sirs is a white cloth beautiful spotless and clean 
Then a man would cheat him with a dirty soiled garment thus Good man here is a white cloth for you beautiful spotless and clean
And he would accept it and put it on and being satisfied with it he would utter words of satisfaction thus Good indeed sirs is a white cloth beautiful spotless and clean
What do you think Magandiya When that man born blind accepted that dirty soiled garment put it on and being satisfied with it uttered words of satisfaction thus Good indeed sirs is a white cloth beautiful spotless and clean   did he do so knowing and seeing or out of faith in the man with good eyesight 
Venerable sir he would have done so unknowing and unseeing out of faith in the man with good eyesight
So too Magandiya the wanderers of other sects are blind and visionless They do not know health they do not see Nibbana yet they utter this stanza thus The greatest of all gains is health Nibbana is the greatest bliss
This stanza was uttered by the earlier Accomplished Ones Fully Enlightened Ones thus
The greatest of all gains is health Nibbana is the greatest bliss
The eightfold path is the best of paths For it leads safely to the Deathless
Now it has gradually become current among ordinary people
You do not have that noble vision Magandiya by means of which you might know health and see Nibbana
I have confidence in Master Gotama thus
Then his friends and companions his kinsmen and relatives would bring a physician to treat him
The physician would make a medicine for him
What do you think Magandiya would that doctor reap weariness and disappointment
  Yes Master Gotama
 So too Magandiya if I were to teach you the Dhamma thus This is that health this is that Nibbana you might not know health or see Nibbana
I have confidence in Master Gotama thus
He might hear a man with good eyesight saying Good indeed sirs is a white cloth beautiful spotless and clean
 and he would go in search of a white cloth
Then a man would cheat him with a dirty soiled garment thus Good man here is a white cloth for you beautiful spotless and clean
And he would accept it and put it on
Then his friends and companions his kinsmen and relatives would bring a physician to treat him
The physician would make medicine  emetics and purgatives ointments and counterointments and nasal treatment 
Together with the arising of his vision his desire and liking for that dirty soiled garment would be abandoned
So too Magandiya if I were to teach you the Dhamma thus This is that health this is that Nibbana
Together with the arising of your vision your desire and lust for the five aggregates affected by clinging might be abandoned Then perhaps you might think Indeed I have long been tricked cheated and defrauded by this mind
For when clinging I have been clinging just to material form I have been clinging just to feeling I have been clingingjust to perception I have been clinging just to formations I have been clinging just to consciousness
I have confidence in Master Gotama thus
Then Magandiya associate with true men
When you associate with true men you will hear the true Dhamma When you hear the true Dhamma you will practise in accordance with the true DhammaWhen you practise in accordance with the true Dhamma you will know and see for yourself thus These are diseases tumours and darts but here these diseases tumours and darts cease without remainder
When this was said the wanderer Magandiya said Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama
Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms
I would receive the going forth under Master Gotama I would receive the full admission
Magandiya one who formerly belonged to another sect and desires the going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline lives on probation for four months At the end of four months if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him they give him the going forth and the full admission to the bhikkhus state
But I recognise individual differences in this matter
Venerable sir if those who formerly belonged to another sect and desire the going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline live on probation for four months and if at the end of the four months the bhikkhus being satisfied with them give them the going forth and the full admission to the bhikkhus state then I will live on probation for four years At the end of the four years if the bhikkhus are satisfied with me let them give me the going forth and the full admission to the bhikkhus state
And soon not long after his full admission dwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and resolute the venerable Magandiya by realising for himself with direct knowledge here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness
When he had wandered for alms in Kammasadhamma and had returned from his almsround after his meal he went to a certain grove for the days abiding
There he saw a spread of grass prepared
for then the wanderer Magandiya while walking and wandering for exercise came to the brahmins fire chamber and went up to the Blessed One
that has been tamed by the Tathagata guarded protected and restrained and he teaches the Dhamma for its restraint
The ear delights in soundThe nose delights in odoursThe tongue delights in flavoursThe body delights in tangiblesThe mind delights in mindobjects takes delight in mindobjects rejoices in mindobjects
that has been tamed by the Tathagata guarded protected and restrained and he teaches the Dhamma for its restraint
and I do not envy them nor do I delight therein
Because there is Magandiya a delight apart from sensual pleasures apart from unwholesome states which surpasses divine bliss Since I take delight in that I do not envy what is inferior nor do I delight therein
And at that time the youth Subha Todeyyas son was staying at Savatthi on some business
 Quite secluded from sense pleasures  He enters and Dwells in the first Jhna This is said in order to show the higher distinctions when the mind is concentrated by access concentration and to show the divisions of concentration when the mind is concentrated by absorption concentration
He drenches steeps saturates and suffuses his body with this rapture and happiness born of seclusion He drenches he moistens he extends rapture and happiness everywhere
Steeps he applies all around
Saturates he fills as if filling a bellows with air
Suffuses he pervades all around
There is no part of his entire body in this bhikkhus body with all its parts in the place where the kammically acquired material continuity occurs there is not even the slightest place consisting of skin flesh and blood which is not suffused by the happiness of the first jhna
His body the material body composed of the four elements
and by means of that medicine the man would be cured of his leprosy and would become well and happy independent master of himself able to go where he likes
In the simile for the second jhna the material body is like the lake
and the happiness of the second jhna is like the water
So too Magandiya beings who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures who are devoured by craving for sensual pleasures who burn with fever for sensual pleasures still indulge in sensual pleasures the more such beings indulge in sensual pleasures the more their craving for sensual pleasures increases and the more they are burned by their fever for sensual pleasures yet they find a certain measure of satisfaction and enjoyment in dependence on the five cords of sensual pleasure
how well that has been expressed by Master Gotama The greatest of all gains is health Nibbana is the greatest bliss
for I am now healthy and happy and nothing afflicts me
In the simile for the fourth jhna the white cloth is mentioned for the purpose of showing suffusion by heat
For there is no suffusion by heat with a soiled cloth with a clean cloth that has just been washed the suffusion by heat is strong
For in this simile the material body is like the cloth and the happiness of the fourth jhna is like the suffusion by heat
Therefore just as when a man has bathed well and is sitting covered from the head down by a clean cloth the heat from his body suffuses the entire cloth
It is in this way that the meaning should be seen here
A stepbystep explanation of the four jhnas and of the method of developing them is given in the Visuddhimagga Thus they are not explained in detail here
It should not be thought that at this point only the one who gains the materialform jhnas has been shown but not the one who gains the immaterial jhnas
For there can be no achievement of the higher direct knowledges without achieving mastery in fourteen ways over the eight meditative attainments
and he would go in search of a white cloth
In the text only the materialform jhnas have come down
but the immaterial jhnas should be brought in and explained
And although this body Magandiya is a disease a tumour a dart a calamity and an affliction referring to this body you say This is that health Master Gotama this is that Nibbana
Master Gotama is capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I can come to know health and to see Nibbana
Magandiya suppose there was a man born blind who could not see dark and light formsor the sun and moon
yet by means of that medicine the mans vision would not arise or be purified
similarly there is no part of the bhikkhus material body that is not suffused by the happiness of the fourth jhna
so that there is no part of the cloth not suffused by heat
and that would be wearisome and troublesome for me
Master Gotama is capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I can come to know health and to see Nibbana
Magandiya suppose there was a man born blind who could not see dark and light formsor the sun and moon
and by means of that medicine the mans vision would arise and be purified
then he might burn with indignation and enmity towards that man and might think that he ought to be killed thus Indeed I have long been tricked cheated and defrauded by this man with this dirty soiled garment when he told me Good man here is a white cloth for you beautiful spotless and clean
you might know health and see Nibbana
 When his mind is thus concentrated  and attained to imperturbability He shows that the bhikkhu has achieved mastery over the eight meditative attainments in fourteen ways
The rest should be understood by the method explained in the Visuddhimagga 
He directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision Here knowledge and vision can mean path knowledge fruition knowledge the knowledge of omniscience reviewing knowledge or insight knowledge
In the passage What friend is the holy life lived under the Exalted One for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision  path knowledge is called knowledge and vision
In the passage Then the knowledge and vision arose in the Exalted One that lra Klma had died seven days ago  it is the knowledge of omniscience
In the passage And the knowledge and vision arose in me Unshakable is my liberation this is my last birth  it is reviewing knowledgeBut here when it is said He directs and inclines to knowledge and vision it is insight knowledge that is called knowledge and vision
This is my body  impermanent subject to rubbing and pressing to dissolution and dispersion It is impermanent in the sense of not being after having been
It is subject to rubbing because it is anointed with perfume etc in order to remove its bad smell
It is subject to pressing because it is massaged to dispel ailments of the limbs
It is subject to dissolution and dispersion because though maintained in such ways it is its very nature to break up and be scattered
Therein six terms signify origination
And this is my consciousness supported by it and bound up with it Consciousness is supported by and bound up with the body composed of the four primary elements
The application of the simile of the gem should be understood as follows
The gem is like the material body
The man with keen sight is like the bhikkhu who gains insight The time when the man takes the gem in his hand reviews it and clearly knows This is a gemthis is like the time when the bhikkhu is sitting having directed his mind to insight knowledge and the body composed of the four primary elements becomes clear to him The time when it becomes clear to the man This is a thread running through itthis is like the time when the bhikkhu is sitting having directed his mind to insight knowledge and it becomes clear to him that the pentad inclusive of contact or all states of consciousness and mental factors or insight knowledge alone take that as their object
This insight knowledge immediately precedes the path
It is also shown here in order to help one who has attained direct knowledge acquire the means for dispelling fearFor when one hears a fearful sound with the divine ear or recollects fearful aggregates with the recollection of past lives or sees a fearful form with the divine eye fear and terror arise if one has not explored as impermanent etc but they do not arise if one has explored as impermanent etc
In the passage This is another superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones a comfortable dwelling that has been achieved  knowledge and vision is fruition knowledge
He directs and inclines it he makes his mind slant slide and slope in order to produce insight knowledge
With my clinging as condition being comes to be with being as condition birth with birth as condition ageing and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair come to be Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering
Master Gotama is capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I might rise up from this seat cured of my blindness
also when children have limbs that have been misshapen during their stay in the womb during infancy they are made to lie between the thighs and are pulled and pushed in order that their limbs may acquire the proper shape
the last two terms together with impermanence signify passing away
With the cessation of my clinging comes cessation of being with the cessation of being cessation of birth with the cessation of birth ageing and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair cease Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering
and the thread running through it is like insight knowledge
He directly knew Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being
but even so it is shown here because there would be no intermediate place for it once the section on the direct knowledges has begun
And the venerable Magandiya became one of the arahants
Further it is shown here at the beginning because the happiness of insight is a separate visible fruit of recluseship leading to the acquisition of the happiness of the paths and fruits
 He creates another body having material form mindmade complete in all its parts not lacking any faculties Mindmade  produced by mind
Not lacking any faculties not deprived of any faculties by way of figure
For if the possessor of supernormal power is white then the form he creates will also be white
If his earlobes are unpierced the form will also have earlobes which are unpierced Thus it is similar to him in all respects
The three similes are stated to show the similarity 
For the reed inside the sheath is similar to its sheath
Though in the text it is said Suppose a man were to pull a snake out from its slough as if he were to pull it out with his hand we should understand that he extracts it mentally
For no one can pull a snake out from its slough A snake abandons its slough by itself alone through four means by abiding in the law of its species by supporting itself against a log or a tree by its strength that is the effort of dragging its body out from the skin and by feeling disgust towards the old skin as if it were devouring its body Thus the statement of the text should be understood to refer to the mental extraction of the snake
the bhikkhus body is similar to the sheath etc and the created form is similar to the reed etc
the sword is similar to its scabbard since they put a round sword into a round scabbard and a flat sword into a flat scabbard
the snakes slough is similar to the snake
and asked the brahmin For whom has this spread of grass been prepared in Master Bharadvajas fire chamber It seems like a recluses bed
Indeed Master Bharadvaja it is an ill sight we see
but Master Gotama has anticipated us
I lived in the rains palace for the four months of the rainy season enjoying myself with musicians who were all female and I did not go down to the lower palace
and there surrounded by a group of nymphs in the Nandana Grove he would enjoy himself provided and endowed with the five cords of divine sensual pleasure
and by means of that medicine the man would be cured of his leprosy and would become well and happy independent master of himself able to go where he likes
I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
Then the wanderer Magandiya received the going forth under the Blessed One and he received the full admission
But the method of creation here and the following five kinds of direct knowledgethe modes of supernormal power etchave been explained in full detail in the Visuddhimagga Thus they should be understood by the method stated there
here only the similes are additional
 The application of the similes here is as follows 
Therein the skilled potter etc is like the bhikkhu who gains the knowledge of the modes of supernormal power
the wellprepared clay etc is like the knowledge of the modes of supernormal power
and one who becomes anxious and frightened there cannot distinguish the sounds of kettledrum and tambours the Buddha does not mention a desert road but with the word highway shows a safe road
For when one is travelling leisurely on a safe road free from dangers having placed a cloth over ones head to ward off wind and the heat of the sun one can easily distinguish the aforesaid sounds
The time when the sounds being heard by the man become clear to him is like the time when the divine and human sounds both distant and near become clear to the meditator
In the simile for the knowledge of encompassing the minds of others
Therein the man who has gone to the three villages is like the one who gains the knowledge of recollecting past lives the three villages like three existences Just as the actions done that day in the three villages become clear to the man so do the actions done in the three existences become evident to the bhikkhu sitting with his mind directed to the knowledge of recollecting past lives
the upperterraced building in the central square is like the bhikkhus material body the man with keen sight standing in the building like the bhikkhu who has attained the divine eye Those entering a house are like those entering the mothers womb by way of relinking those leaving the house are like those leaving the womb those walking along the streets are like those beings who repeatedly wander in sasra those sitting in front in the open air in the central square are like the beings who have arisen here and there in the three realms of existence The time when these people become clear to the man standing on the upper terrace of the buildingthis is like the time when the beings arisen in the three realms of existence become clear to the bhikkhu sitting with his mind directed to the knowledge of the divine eye
and the making of whatever kind of vessel etc he might desire is like the bhikkhus transformations 
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Kuru country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and eventually he arrived at a Kuru town named Thullakotthita
in the simile for the divine ear element Since a desert road is fearful and dangerous
just as the mark on a young mans face would become evident to him when he examines his facial reflection so the sixteen states of mind of others become evident to the bhikkhu sitting with his mind directed to the knowledge of encompassing the minds of others
In the simile for the knowledge of recollecting past lives only the three villages gone to that same day are mentioned 
This statement is made for ease of teaching
but the immaterial realm does not come into the range of the divine eye
In the simile for the divine eye
The brahmin householders of Thullakotthita heard The recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan has been wandering in the Kuru country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and has come to Thullakotthita
Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessed
He declares this world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas this generation with its recluses and brahmins its princes and its people which he has himself realised with direct knowledge
He teaches the Dhamma good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing and he reveals a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure
Now it is good to see such arahants
Then the brahmin householders of Thullakotthita went to the Blessed One Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side some exchanged greetings with him and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished sat down at one side some extended their hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and sat down at one side some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed Ones presence and sat down at one side some kept silent and sat down at one side
When they were seated the Blessed One instructed urged roused and encouraged them with talk on the Dhamma
Now at that time a clansman named Ratthapala the son of the leading clan in that same Thullakotthita was sitting in the assembly
Then it occurred to him As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is not easy while living in a home to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell
Suppose I shave off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessness
Then the brahmin householders of Thullakotthita having been instructed urged roused and encouraged by the Blessed One with talk on the Dhamma delighted and rejoiced in his words They then rose from their seats and after paying homage to him they departed keeping him on their right
Soon after they had gone the clansman Ratthapala went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him
Venerable sir I wish to shave off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessness
I would receive the going forth under the Blessed One I would receive the full admission
Have you been permitted by your parents Ratthapala to go forth from the home life into homelessness 
No venerable sir I have not been permitted by my parents
Ratthapala Tathagatas do not give the going forth to anyone who does not have his parents permission
Venerable sir I shall see to it that my parents permit me to go forth from the home life into homelessness
Then the clansman Ratthapala rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One he departed keeping him on his right He went to his parents and told them Mother and father as I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is not easy while living in a home to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell
I wish to shave off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessness
Give me permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness
When he had said this his parents replied Dear Ratthapala you are our only son dear and beloved You have been raised in comfort brought up in comfort
you know nothing of suffering dear Ratthapala
For the second timeFor the third time the clansman Ratthapala said to his parents Mother and fathergive me permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness
For the third time his parents replied Dear Ratthapala
Then not receiving his parents permission to go forth the clansman Ratthapala lay down there on the bare floor saying Right here I shall either die or receive the going forth
Then the clansman Ratthapalas parents said to him Dear Ratthapala you are our only son dear and beloved You have been raised in comfort brought up in comfort
Get up dear Ratthapala eat drink and amuse yourself While eating drinking and amusing yourself you can be happy enjoying sensual pleasures and making merit
We do not permit you to go forth from the home life into homelessness
Even in the case of your death we would lose you unwillingly
When this was said the clansman Ratthapala was silent
For the second time
For the third time the clansman Ratthapala was silent
Then the clansman Ratthapalas friends went to him and said Friend Ratthapala you are your parents only son dear and beloved You have been raised in comfort brought up in comfort
you know nothing of suffering friend Ratthapala
Get up friend Ratthapala eat drink and amuse yourself While eating drinking and amusing yourself you can be happy enjoying sensual pleasures and making merit
Your parents do not permit you to go forth from the home life into homelessness
Even in case of your death they would lose you unwillingly
so how could they give you their permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness while you are still living
For the second timeFor the third time his friends said to him Friend Ratthapala
For the third time the clansman Ratthapala was silent
Then the clansman Ratthapalas friends went to his parents and said to them Mother and father the clansman Ratthapala is lying down there on the bare floor having said Right here I shall either die or get the going forth
But if you give him your permission you will see him after he has gone forth
And if he does not enjoy the going forth what else can he do then
but return here
Then dears we give the clansman Ratthapala permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness
But when he has gone forth he must visit his parents
Then the clansman Ratthapalas friends went to him and told him Get up friend Ratthapala Your parents permit you to go forth from the home life into homelessness
But when you have gone forth you must visit your parents
The clansman Ratthapala then got up and when he had regained his strength he went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one side
and told him Venerable sir I have my parents permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness
Let the Blessed One give me the going forth
Wandering by stages he eventually arrived at Savatthi
He directly knew Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being
And the venerable Ratthapala became one of the arahants
Then the venerable Ratthapala went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one side
and told him Venerable sir I wish to visit my parents if I have the Blessed Ones permission
Then the Blessed One penetrated mentally the thoughts in venerable Ratthapalas mind 
When he knew that the clansman Ratthapala was incapable of abandoning the training and returning to the low life he told him Now is the time Ratthapala to do as you think fit
Wandering by stages he eventually arrived at Thullakotthita
Then when it was morning he dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Thullakotthita for alms
Now on that occasion the venerable Ratthapalas father was sitting in the hall of the central door having his hair dressed
When he saw the venerable Ratthapala coming in the distance
Then at his own fathers house the venerable Ratthapala received neither alms nor a polite refusal instead he received only abuse
While she was doing so she recognised the characteristic features of his hands his feet and his voice
Then she went to his mother and said Please know my lady that my lords son Ratthapala has arrived
Gracious If what you say is true you are no longer a slave
 Then the venerable Ratthapalas mother went to his father and said Please know householder they say that the clansman Ratthapala has arrived
Just then the venerable Ratthapala was eating the old porridge by the wall of a certain shelter
His father went to him and said Ratthapala my dear surely there isand you will be eating old porridge
How could we have a house householder when we have gone forth from the home life into homelessness
We are homeless householder
We went to your house but we received neither alms nor a polite refusal there instead we received only abuse
Come dear Ratthapala let us go to the house
Enough householder my meal for today is finished
Then dear Ratthapala consent to accept tomorrows meal
The venerable Ratthapala consented in silence
Then knowing that the venerable Ratthapala had consented his father went back to his own house where he had gold coins and bullion made into a large heap and covered it with mats Then he told the venerable Ratthapalas former wives Come daughtersinlaw adorn yourselves with ornaments in the way Ratthapala found you most dear and loveable
When night had ended the venerable Ratthapalas father had good food of various kinds prepared in his own house and had the time announced to the venerable Ratthapala It is time dear Ratthapala the meal is ready
Then it being morning the venerable Ratthapala dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe he went to his own fathers house and sat down on the seat made ready
Then his father had the pile of gold coins and bullion uncovered and said Dear Ratthapala this is your maternal fortune your paternal fortune is another and your ancestral fortune is yet another
Dear Ratthapala you can enjoy the wealth and make merit
Come then dear abandon the training and return to the low life enjoy the wealth and make merit
Householder if you would follow my advice then have this pile of gold coins and bullion loaded on carts and carried away to be dumped midstream in the river Ganges
Why is that
Because householder on account of this there will arise for you sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
Then the venerable Ratthapalas former wives clasped his feet and said to him What are they like my lords son the nymphs for whose sake you lead the holy life 
We do not lead the holy life for the sake of nymphs sisters
Our lords son Ratthapala calls us sisters they cried and right there they fainted
Then the venerable Ratthapala told his father Householder if there is a meal to be given then give it Do not harass us
Eat then dear Ratthapala the meal is ready
Then with his own hands the venerable Ratthapalas father served and satisfied him with the various kinds of good food
When the venerable Ratthapala had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl he stood up and uttered these stanzas
Behold a puppet here pranked outA body built up out of sores
Sick an object for concernWhere no stability abides
Behold a figure here pranked outWith jewellery and earrings too
A skeleton wrapped up in skinMade attractive by its clothes
Its feet adorned with henna dye And powder smeared upon its face
It may beguile a fool but not A seeker of the further shore
Its hair is dressed in eightfold plaits And unguent smeared upon its eyes
It may beguile a fool but not A seeker of the further shore
A filthy body well adorned Like a newpainted unguent pot
It may beguile a fool but not A seeker of the further shore
The deerhunter set out the snare But the deer did not spring the trap
We ate the bait and now depart Leaving the hunters to lament
After the venerable Ratthapala had stood up and uttered these stanzas he went to King Koravyas Migacira garden and sat down at the root of a tree for the days abiding
Then King Koravya addressed his gamekeeper thus Good gamekeeper tidy up the Migacira Garden so that we may go to the pleasure garden to see a pleasing spot
 Yes sire he replied Now while he was tidying up the Migacira Garden the gamekeeper saw the venerable Ratthapala seated at the root of a tree for the days abiding
When he saw him he went to King Koravya and told him Sire the Migacira Garden has been tidied up
The clansman Ratthapala is there the son of the leading clan in this same Thullakotthita of whom you have always spoken highly he is seated at the root of a tree for the days abiding
Then good Migava enough of the pleasure garden for today
Now we shall go to pay respects to that Master Ratthapala
Then saying Give away all the food that has been prepared there King Koravya had a number of state carriages prepared and mounting one of them accompanied by the other carriages he drove out from Thullakotthita with the full pomp of royalty to see the venerable Ratthapala
He drove thus as far as the road was passable for carriages and then he dismounted from his carriage and went forward on foot with a following of the most eminent officials to where the venerable Ratthapala was
He exchanged greetings with the venerable Ratthapala and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished he stood at one side
and said Here is an elephant rug Let Master Ratthapala be seated on it
There is no need great king Sit down I am sitting on my own mat
King Koravya sat down on a seat made ready
and said
Master Ratthapala there are four kinds of loss Because they have undergone these four kinds of loss some people here shave off their hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessness
What are the four
They are loss through ageing loss through sickness loss of wealth and loss of relatives
And what is loss through ageing
Here Master Ratthapala someone is old aged burdened with years advanced in life come to the last stage
He considers thus I am old aged burdened with years advanced in life come to the last stage
It is no longer easy for me to acquire unacquired wealth or to augment wealth already acquired
Suppose I shave off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessness
Because he has undergone that loss through ageing he shaves off his hair and beard puts on the yellow robe and goes forth from the home life into homelessness
This is called loss through ageing
But Master Ratthapala is now still young a blackhaired young man endowed with the blessing of youth in the prime of life
Master Ratthapala has not undergone any loss through ageing
What has he known or seen or heard that he has gone forth from the home life into homelessness
And what is loss through sickness
Here Master Ratthapala someone is afflicted suffering and gravely ill
He considers thus I am afflicted suffering and gravely ill
It is no longer easy for me to acquire unacquired wealthinto homelessness
Because he has undergone that loss through sickness
This is called loss through sickness
But Master Ratthapala now is free from illness and affliction he possesses a good digestion that is neither too cool nor too warm but medium
Master Ratthapala has not undergone any loss through sickness
What has he known or seen or heard that he has gone forth from the home life into homelessness
And what is loss of wealth
Here Master Ratthapala someone is rich of great wealth of great possessions
Gradually his wealth dwindles away
He considers thus Formerly I was rich of great wealth of great possessions
Gradually my wealth has dwindled away
It is no longer easy for me to acquire unacquired wealth
Because he has undergone that loss of wealthhe goes forth from the home life into homelessness
This is called loss of wealth
But Master Ratthapala is the son of the leading clan in this same Thullakotthita
Master Ratthapala has not undergone any loss of wealth
What has he known or seen or heard that he has gone forth from the home life into homelessness
And what is loss of relatives
Here Master Ratthapala someone has many friends and companions kinsmen and relatives
Gradually those relatives of his dwindle away
He considers thus Formerly I had many friends and companions kinsmen and relatives
Gradually those relatives of mine have dwindled away
It is no longer easy for me to acquire unacquired wealth
Because he has undergone that loss of relativeshe goes forth from the home life into homelessness
This is called loss of relatives
But Master Ratthapala has many friends and companions kinsmen and relatives in this same Thullakotthita
Master Ratthapala has not undergone any loss of relatives
What has he known or seen or heard that he has gone forth from the home life into homelessness
Master Ratthapala these are the four kinds of loss Because they have undergone these four kinds of loss some people here shave off their hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessness
Master Ratthapala has not undergone any of these
What has he known or seen or heard that he has gone forth from the home life into homelessness 
Great king there are four summaries of the Dhamma that have been taught by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened Knowing and seeing and hearing them I went forth from the home life into homelessness
What are the four
Life in any world is unstable it is swept away this is the first summary of the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened Knowing and seeing and hearing this I went forth from the home life into homelessness
Life in any world has no shelter and no protector this is the second summary of the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One who knows and sees
Life in any world has nothing of its own one has to leave all and pass on this is the third summary of the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One who knows and sees
Life in any world is incomplete insatiate the slave of craving this is the fourth summary of the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One who knows and sees
Great king these are the four summaries of the Dhamma that have been taught by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened Knowing and seeing and hearing them I went forth from the home life into homelessness
Master Ratthapala said Life in any world is unstable it is swept away
How should the meaning of that statement be understood 
What do you think great king When you were twenty or twentyfive years old were you an expert rider of elephants an expert horseman an expert charioteer an expert archer an expert swordsman strong in thighs and arms sturdy capable in battle 
When I was twenty or twentyfive years old Master Ratthapala I was an expert rider of elephantsstrong in thighs and arms sturdy capable in battle
Sometimes I wonder if I had supernormal power then I do not see anyone who could equal me in strength
What do you think great king Are you now as strong in thighs and arms as sturdy and as capable in battle 
No Master Ratthapala
Now I am old aged burdened with years advanced in life come to the last stage my years have turned eighty
Sometimes I mean to put my foot here and I put my foot somewhere else
Great king it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened said Life in any world is unstable it is swept away and when I knew and saw and heard this I went forth from the home life into homelessness
It is wonderful Master Ratthapala it is marvellous
Master Ratthapala there exist in this court elephant troops and cavalry and chariot troops and infantry which will serve to subdue any threats to us
Now Master Ratthapala said Life in any world has no shelter and no protector
How should the meaning of that statement be understood 
What do you think great king Do you have any chronic ailment 
I have a chronic wind ailment Master Ratthapala
Sometimes my friends and companions kinsmen and relatives stand around me thinking Now King Koravya is about to die now King Koravya is about to die 
What do you think great king Can you command your friends and companions your kinsmen and relatives Come my good friends and companions my kinsmen and relatives All of you present share this painful feeling so that I may feel less pain Or do you have to feel that pain yourself alone 
I cannot command my friends and companions my kinsmen and relatives thus Master Ratthapala
I have to feel that pain alone
Great king it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened said Life in any world has no shelter and no protector and when I knew and saw and heard this I went forth from the home life into homelessness
It is wonderful Master Ratthapala it is marvellous
It is indeed so
Master Ratthapala there exist in this court abundant gold coins and bullion stored away in vaults and depositories
Now Master Ratthapala said Life in any world has nothing of its own one has to leave all and pass on
How should the meaning of that statement be understood 
What do you think great king You now enjoy yourself provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure but will you be able to have it of the life to come Let me likewise enjoy myself provided and endowed with these same five cords of sensual pleasure Or will others take over this property while you will have to pass on according to your actions 
I cannot have it thus of the life to come Master Ratthapala
On the contrary others will take over this property while I shall have to pass on according to my actions
Great king it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened said Life in any world has nothing of its own one has to leave all and pass on and when I knew and saw and heard this I went forth from the home life into homelessness
It is wonderful Master Ratthapala it is marvellous
It is indeed so
Now Master Ratthapala said Life in any world is incomplete insatiate the slave of craving
How should the meaning of that statement be understood 
What do you think great king Do you reign over the rich Kuru country 
Yes Master Ratthapala I do
What do you think great king Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man came to you from the east and said
There are plenty of elephant troops there plenty of cavalry chariot troops and infantry
With your present forces you can conquer it
Conquer it then great king What would you do 
We would conquer it and reign over it Master Ratthapala
What do you think great king Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man came to you from the westfrom the northfrom the south
Conquer it then great king What would you do 
Great king it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened said Life in any world is incomplete insatiate the slave of craving and when I knew and saw and heard this I went forth from the home life into homelessness
It is wonderful Master Ratthapala it is marvellous
It is indeed so 
That is what the venerable Ratthapala said
And having said that he said further
he sat down at one side and said to the Blessed One Venerable sir as I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is not easy while living in a home to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell
Even in case of your death we would lose you unwillingly
so how could we give you our permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness while you are still living 
how could we give you our permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness while you are still living
so how could we give you our permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness while you are still living
how could we give you our permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness while you are still living
 When his mind is thus concentrated  he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers When his mind is thus concentrated here the mind of the fourth jhna used as the basis for insight should be understood
To the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers for the purpose of producing the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers
And here the path the fruit Nibbna and dissolution are called the destruction of the cankers 
In the passage knowledge of destruction knowledge of nonarising  the path is called the destruction of the cankers
In the passage Through the destruction of the cankers one is a recluse  it is the fruit
In the passage He who seeks anothers faults Who is ever censorious
His cankers grow He is far From the destruction of the cankers
 it is Nibbna
And in the passage The destruction of the cankers their falling away breakup impermanence and disappearance  it is dissolution 
Here Nibbna is intended
Knowing and seeing thus  The Buddha explains the path which has reached its peak together with insight
His mind is liberated  from the canker of ignorance When it is liberated the knowledge arises It is liberated By the phrase his mind is liberated the Buddha shows the moment of the path
By the passage destroyed is birth etc he shows the plane of the reviewing knowledge
And how does he understand this
It is not a past birth that is destroyed for that was already destroyed previously
It is not a future one for there is no effort in regard to the future
And it is not the present one because that presently exists
Reply It is the birth which would have arisen if the path had not been fully developed consisting of one four or five aggregates in one four or fiveconstituent existence respectively By the fully developed state of the path that birth is destroyed because it has become impossible for it to arise in the future
Having reviewed the defilements abandoned by the development of the path he knows that in the absence of defilements even though action occurs it does not bring about relinking in the future
For the seven learners together with the good worldling are said to be living the holy life the one with cankers destroyed to have lived the holy lifeTherefore reviewing his own living of the holy life he understands The holy life has been lived
The meaning is that the defilements to be abandoned by each path have been abandoned and the root of suffering has been eradicated
For the good worldling etc are doing what has to be done the one with cankers destroyed has done what had to be done
Hence he understands Beyond this presently existing continuum of aggregates occurring in such a mode there is for me no further continuum of aggregates
At this point ten kinds of knowledge have been expounded insight knowledge the knowledge of the mindmade body the knowledge of the modes of supernormal power the knowledge of the divine ear the knowledge of encompassing the minds of others the knowledge of recollecting past lives the pairthe knowledge of the future and the knowledge of faring on in accordance with kammaaccomplished by means of the divine eye the knowledge of the divine eye  and the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers
The analysis of their objects should be known Therein insight knowledge has seven kinds of objects limited and exalted past future and present internal and external
The knowledge of the mindmade body takes as its object only the created form base thus its object is limited present and external
The knowledge of the destruction of the cankers has an object which is immeasurable external and not describable 
For the rest the division of their objects has been explained in the Visuddhimagga 
And great king there is no other fruit of recluseship higher or more sublime than this one The Exalted One concludes the teaching with its culmination in arahatship thus There is no fruit of recluseship better in any way than this one
the path of arahatship is also appropriate
He understands as it really is this is suffering He understands as it really is by penetration of its specific essential characteristic the entire truth of suffering thus There is this much suffering and none beyond this
He directs and inclines  he makes the insight consciousness slant slide and slope in that direction
And he understands as it really is by penetration of its specific essential characteristic the craving which produces that suffering thus This is the origin of suffering
He understands as it really is these are the cankers Having shown the truths in their specific identity the Buddha speaks the following passage about the cankers to show them again figuratively by way of the defilements
and the state by the attainment of which both suffering and its origin cease Nibbna their non occurrence thus This is the cessation of suffering and the noble path which brings about its attainment thus This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering
by the phrase when it is liberated the moment of the fruit
and by the phrase the knowledge arises It is liberated the moment of reviewing knowledge
He understands Destroyed is birth  there is nothing further beyond this Query What birth of his is destroyed
for when the one who has destroyed the cankers reviews with that knowledge he understands Destroyed is birth etc
Thus he understands Destroyed is birth
The holy life has been lived the holy life of the path has been fully lived
What had to be done has been done the sixteen tasks have been completed by way of the full understanding abandonment realization and development of the Four Noble Truths by the four paths
Therefore reviewing what had to be done by himself he understands What had to be done has been done
There is nothing further beyond this  he understands Now there is no task of developing the path to be done by me again for this state that is for the the sixteen tasks or for the destruction of the defilements
Or else this can be understood as beyond this
For the third time his parents said to himDear Ratthapala
These five aggregates stand fully understood cut off at the root like trees With the cessation of the last state of consciousness they will be extinguished like a fire without fuel and will go to the indescribable state
you know nothing of suffering dear Ratthapala
 Great king suppose in a mountain glen  The time when the oystershells etc become clear to the man with keen sight standing on the bank seeing themthis is like the time when the Four Noble Truths become clear to the bhikkhu sitting having directed his mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers
Having listened carefully to the beginning middle and end of the discourse applauding it here and there the king thought For a long time I have asked the ordinary recluses and brahmins these questions but as if threshing chaff I did not gain anything essential Oh the Exalted One is endowed with such excellent qualities He answers these questions of mine creating a great light as if he were lighting a thousand lamps for me
For a long time I have been deceived not knowing the spiritual power of the Buddhas excellent qualities  As he thus recollected the excellent qualities of the Buddha his body was suffused by the five kinds of rapture Revealing his own confidence he then declared himself a lay follower
To show this the passage that begins When the Exalted One had finished speaking is undertaken
Excellent venerable sir Excellent venerable sir  The word excellent is used here as an expression of appreciation
of fear anger praise haste excitement astonishment
Here it should be understood the repeated exclamation is stated by way of confidence and praise
Or else excellent means extremely lovely extremely desirable extremely pleasing extremely good
Here by one exclamation of excellent the king extols the teaching by the other his own confidence
This is the purport here Excellent venerable sir is the Exalted Ones teaching of the DhammaExcellent is my confidence dependent on the Exalted Ones teaching of the Dhamma
Thus the statement may be interpreted as follows The word of the Exalted One is excellent because it destroys faults excellent because it promotes the achievement of excellent qualities
Similarly because it generates faith and generates wisdom because it possesses meaning and is well phrased because it is clear in terminology and deep in meaning because it is pleasant to the ear and wins the heart because it does not extol himself and does not disparage others because it is cooled by compassion and cleansed by wisdom because it is delightful to listen to and can withstand examination because it is pleasant when heard and beneficial when investigated and so on
The king next extols the teaching with four similes
This is the interpretation of the purport
Just as if one were to reveal what was hidden so the Exalted One has revealed the dispensation which had been hidden by the jungle of wrong views from the time the dispensation of the Exalted Buddha Kassapa disappeared Just as if one were to point out the right path to one who was lost so when I was travelling along a false path a wrong path the Exalted One disclosed to me the path to heaven and to liberationAnd just as if one were to bring a lamp into a dark place so when I was submerged in the darkness of delusion and could not see the gemlike forms of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sagha the Exalted One brought me the lamp of the teaching which dispels the darkness of delusion concealing those forms Because the Dhamma has been revealed to me in these ways by the Exalted One the Exalted One has revealed the Dhamma in numerous ways
I go for refuge to the Exalted One to the Dhamma and to the Bhikkhu Sagha Having thus extolled the teaching expressing his confidence with a mind of confidence in the Triple Gem he says I go for refuge to the Exalted One etc
This last explanation is given because verbal roots which have the meaning going also have the meaning understanding 
For this has been said Bhikkhus to whatever extent there are things which are conditioned the Noble Eightfold Path is declared the best of them 
The Dhamma is not only the noble path and Nibbna
For this is said in the Story of the Heavenly Mansion of the Brahmin Youth Chatta
Here the fading of lust is the path
The Saṅgha consists of those who are united through unity of view and moral discipline In denotation it is the assembly of the eight noble individuals
For this is said in the Story of Chatta
The Bhikkhu Saṅgha is the Saṅgha of bhikkhus
laughter sorrow and confidence  An intelligent person repeats a phrase on occasions
how could they give you their permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness while you are still living
So give him your permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness
When this was said the clansman Ratthapala was silent
Now if you do not give him your permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness he will die there
Then the clansman Ratthapala received the going forth under the Blessed One and he received the full admission 
Before long dwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and resolute the venerable Ratthapala by realising for himself with direct knowledge here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness
Then the venerable Ratthapala rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One he departed keeping him on his right He then set his resting place in order and taking his bowl and outer robe set out to wander towards Thullakotthita
As he was wandering for alms from house to house in Thullakotthita he came to his own fathers house
There he lived in Thullakotthita in King Koravyas Migacira Garden
he said Our only son dear and beloved was made to go forth by these baldpated recluses
Just then a slavewoman belonging to one of his relatives was about to throw away some old porridge
Seeing this the venerable Ratthapala said to her Sister if that stuff is to be thrown away then pour it into my bowl here
Is there not your own house to go to 
he goes forth from the home life into homelessness
into homelessness
into homelessness
how well that has been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened Life in any world is unstable it is swept away
It is indeed so
how well that has been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened Life in any world has no shelter and no protector
how well that has been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened Life in any world has nothing of its own one has to leave all and pass on
Please know great king that I have come from the east and there I saw a large country powerful and rich very populous and crowded with people
Or else he extols the word of the Exalted One itself referring in each case to a double meaning
Just as if one were to turn upright what had been turned upside down so when I had turned away from the true Dhamma and had fallen into a false Dhamma the Exalted One helped me to emerge from that false Dhamma
there is plenty of ivory there and plenty of gold coins and bullion both unworked and worked and plenty of women for wives
We would conquer it too and reign over it Master Ratthapala
The meaning is The Exalted One is my refuge my supreme resort the destroyer of misery the provider of welfare
With this intention I go to the Exalted One I devote myself to him I follow him I attend upon him Or else I know and understand thus
how well that has been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened Life in any world is incomplete insatiate the slave of craving
Therefore it is said that I go can also mean I know I understand
The word Dhamma is derived from the verb supports  because it supports those who have achieved the path who have realized cessation who are practicing as instructed preventing them from falling into the four planes of misery In denotation the Dhamma is the noble path and Nibbna
but also the scriptural Dhamma together with the noble fruits
I see men wealthy in the world
The fading of lust the wishless and the sorrowless
The unconditioned state attractive Sweet potent well analyzed This Dhamma I approach for refuge
A king who has conquered the earth by force
Most other people too not just a king
His relatives lament and rend their hair
the wishless and the sorrowless is the fruit
Prodded with stakes he burns upon the pyre
the unconditioned state is Nibbāna
While his heirs take over his wealth
and the attractive sweet potent well analyzed is the aggregates of Dhamma analyzed into the three Pitakas 
Longevity is not acquired with wealth Nor can prosperity banish old age
The rich and poor alike shall feel Deaths touch
Better is wisdom here than any wealth
As one goes to the womb and the next world
Just as a robber caught in burglary
Sensual pleasures varied sweet delightful
As fruits fall from the tree so people too
In whom gifts given bring great fruit Those four purified pairs of men
Those eight persons seers of Dhamma This Saṅgha I approach for refuge
To this extent the king has declared his threefold going for refuge
Then not long after the venerable Ratthapala had received the full admission a halfmonth after he had received the full Ratthapala admission the Blessed One having stayed at Thullakotthita as long as he chose set out to wander towards Savatthi
and there he lived at Savatthl in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
who yet From ignorance give not their gathered wealth
Greedily they hoard away their riches
Longing still for further sensual pleasures
And rules over the land the ocean bounds
Is yet unsated with the seas near shore
And hungers for its further shore as well
Encounter death with craving unabated
With plans still incomplete they leave the corpse
Desires remain unsated in the world
Crying Ah me Alas Our love is dead
They bear away the body wrapped in shrouds
To place it on a pyre and burn it there
Clad in a shroud he leaves his wealth behind
And as he dies no relatives or friends
Can offer him shelter and refuge here
this being Must pass on according to his actions
And as he dies nothing can follow him
Not child nor wife nor wealth nor royal estate
Short is this life as all the sages say Eternity it knows not only change
The fool and sage as well shall feel it too
But while the fool lies stricken by his folly
No sage will ever tremble at the touch
Since by wisdom one gains the final goal
While failing to reach the goal from life to life
For people through ignorance do evil deeds
Renewing the successive round of births
Another of little wisdom trusting him
Goes also to the womb and the next world
Is made to suffer for his evil deed
So people after death in the next world
Are made to suffer for their evil deeds
In many different ways disturb the mind
Seeing the danger in these sensual ties
I chose to lead the homeless life O King
Both young and old fall when this body breaks
Seeing this too O King I have gone forth
Better is the recluses life assured
But something more remains to be done
But something more remains to be done
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One on a wandering tour among the Kurus with a large community of monks arrived at Thullakotthita a town of the Kurus
The brahmans  householders of Thullakotthita heard it said Gotama the contemplative  the son of the Sakyans having gone forth from the Sakyan clan  has arrived at Thullakotthita
And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread He is indeed a Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone a knower of the cosmos an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed teacher of human  divine beings awakened blessed
He has made known  having realized it through direct knowledge  this world with its devas maras  brahmas its generations with their contemplatives  brahmans their rulers  common people
He has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end has expounded the holy life both in its particulars  in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure
Its good to see such a worthy one
So the brahmans  householders of Thullakotthita went to the Blessed One On arrival some of them bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side Some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one side Some of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palmtopalm over their hearts Some of them sat to one side having announced their name  clan Some of them sat to one side in silence
As they were sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused and encouraged them with a talk on Dhamma
Now at that time a clansman named Ratthapala the son of the leading clan in that same Thullakotthita was sitting in that assembly
The thought occurred to him As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shell
What if I having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe were to go forth from the household life into homelessness 
Then the brahmans  householders of Thullakotthita having been instructed urged roused  encouraged by the Blessed Ones talk on Dhamma delighted  rejoiced in his words Rising from their seats bowing down to him they left keeping him on their right
Then Ratthapala not long after the brahmans  householders of Thullakotthita had left approached the Blessed One and on arrival
Lord I want  having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe  to go forth from the household life into homelessness
May I receive the goingforth in the Blessed Ones presence May I receive admission 
Do you have your parents permission Ratthapala to go forth from the household life into homelessness 
No lord I havent
Ratthapala Tathagatas do not give the goingforth to anyone who doesnt have his parents permission
Lord I will do what needs to be done so that my parents will give their permission for me to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Then Ratthapala rising from his seat bowing down to the Blessed One and keeping him on his right went to his parents and said Mom Dad as I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shell
I want  having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe  to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Please give me your permission to go forth from the household life into homelessness
When this was said Ratthapalas parents said to him Ratthapala dear you are our only son dear  appealing raised in comfort brought up in comfort You know nothing of suffering Eat drink  enjoy yourself While eating drinking  looking after yourself you may enjoy yourself by indulging in sensual pleasures  making merit
We dont give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Even with your death we would not want to be separated from you
A second time A third time Ratthapala said to his parents Mom Dad as I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shell
I want  having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe  to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Please give me your permission to go forth from the household life into homelessness
A third time Ratthapalas parents said to him Ratthapala dear you are our only son dear  appealing raised in comfort brought up in comfort You know nothing of suffering Eat drink  enjoy yourself While eating drinking  looking after yourself you may enjoy yourself by indulging in sensual pleasures  making merit
We dont give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Even with your death we would not want to be separated from you
so how could we  while youre alive  give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Then Ratthapala not getting his parents permission to go forth from the household life into homelessness lay down right there on the bare floor saying Here will be my death or my goingforth
And he went without food for one day two days three days four five six days He went without food for seven days
His parents said to him Ratthapala dear you are our only son dear  appealing raised in comfort brought up in comfort
You know nothing of suffering
Get up dear Eat drink  enjoy yourself While eating drinking  looking after yourself you may enjoy yourself by indulging in sensual pleasures  making merit
We dont give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Even with your death we would not want to be separated from you
so how could we  while youre alive  give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
When this was said Ratthapala remained silent
A second time
You know nothing of suffering
Get up dear Eat drink  enjoy yourself While eating drinking  looking after yourself you may enjoy yourself by indulging in sensual pleasures  making merit
We dont give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Even with your death we would not want to be separated from you
so how could we  while youre alive  give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
A third time Ratthapala remained silent
So Ratthapalas friends went to Ratthapala and on arrival said to him Friend Ratthapala you are your parents only son
Get up friend Ratthapala Eat drink  enjoy yourself
When this was said Ratthapala remained silent
A second time A third time his friends said to him Friend Ratthapala you are your parents only son
A third time Ratthapala remained silent
So Ratthapalas friends went to his parents and on arrival said to them Mom Dad Ratthapala is lying there on the bare floor having said Here will be my death or my goingforth
If you dont give him your permission to go forth from the household life into homelessness right there will be his death
But if you do give him your permission then even when he has gone forth you will see him
And if he does not enjoy going forth from the household life into homelessness where else will he go
Hell return right here
So please give him permission to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Then dears we give our permission for Ratthapala to go forth from the household life into homelessness
But when he has gone forth he must visit his parents
Then Ratthapalas friends went to him and said Get up Ratthapala Your parents give their permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
But when you have gone forth you must visit your parents
Then Ratthapala got up and on regaining strength went to the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One I have received my parents permission lord to go forth from the household life into homelessness
May the Blessed One give me the goingforth 
Then Ratthapala the clansman obtained the goingforth in the Blessed Ones presence he obtained admission
And not long after his admission one half month after his admission the Blessed Onehaving stayed at Thullakotthita as long as he liked  set out wandering to Savatthi
Wandering by stages he eventually arrived at Savatthi
There he lived at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monastery
As for Ven Ratthapala  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now
He knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for the sake of this world
And thus Ven Ratthapala became another one of the arahants
Then Ven Ratthapala went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord I want to visit my parents if you give me permission
Then the Blessed One encompassing Ven Ratthapalas awareness with his awareness considered  understood
Ven Ratthapala is incapable of leaving the training and reverting to the lower life So he said to him Now is the time Ratthapala for you to do as you see fit
Then Ven Ratthapala rising from his seat bowing down to the Blessed One and keeping him on his right departed Putting his lodgings in order and carrying his bowl  robes set out wandering toward Thullakotthita
Wandering by stages he eventually arrived at Thullakotthita
There he stayed in Thullakotthita in King Koravyas Migacira garden
Then early in the morning  putting on his under robe and carrying his bowl  robes  he went into Thullakotthita for alms
Now at that time Ven Ratthapalas father was in the middle doorporch having his hair combed
He saw Ven Ratthapala coming from afar and on seeing him
 So Ven Ratthapala  instead of receiving a gift or a polite refusal at his own fathers house  got nothing but abuse
Just then a slavewoman belonging to one of his relatives was about to throw away some dayold porridge
So Ven Ratthapala said to her Sister if that is to be thrown away pour it here into my bowl
While she was pouring the dayold porridge into this bowl she recognized his hands feet  voice
So she went to his mother and said May it please you to know my lady that masterson Ratthapala has arrived
Hey if what you say is true I give you your freedom 
Then Ven Ratthapalas mother went to his father and said May it please you to know householder that they say the clansman Ratthapala has arrived
Now at that time Ven Ratthapala was sitting by a wall eating the dayold porridge
His father went to him and said Ratthapala my dear isnt there  What Youre eating dayold porridge
Dont you have your own home to go to 
How could we have a home householder
We have gone forth from the household life into homelessness
We are homeless householder We went to your house but  instead of receiving a gift or a polite refusal  we got nothing but abuse
Come dear Ratthapala Lets go home
Enough householder My meal for today is finished
In that case dear Ratthapala acquiesce to the meal for tomorrow
So Ven Ratthapala acquiesced in silence
Understanding Ven Ratthapalas acquiesence his father went to his house and having the floor coated with fresh cow dung had a great heap of gold  silver made two great heaps made  one of gold one of silver  so large that a man standing on the near side could not see a man standing on the far side just as a man standing on the far side could not see a man standing on the near Hiding them behind screens he set out a seat between them surrounded by a curtain Addressing Ven Ratthapalas former wives he said to them Come daughtersinlaw Adorn yourself in the ornaments that our son Ratthapala used to find dear  appealing
Then as the night was ending Ven Ratthapalas father had exquisite staple  nonstaple foods prepared in his own house and had the time announced to Ven Ratthapala Its time dear Ratthapala The meal is ready
Then early in the morning  putting on his under robe and carrying his bowl  robes  Ven Ratthapala went to his fathers house and on arrival sat down on the seat made ready
Then his father revealing the heap of gold  silver said to him This my dear Ratthapala is your mothers inheritance The other is your fathers the other your grandfathers 
enough that you can enjoy wealth and make merit
Come my dear Ratthapala Leave the training and revert to the lower life Enjoy wealth and make merit 
Householder if youd do as I say you would have this heap of gold  silver loaded on carts and hauled away to be dumped midstream in the river Ganges
Why is that
This wealth will be the cause of your sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
Then clasping each of his feet Ven Ratthapalas former wives said to him What are they like dear masterson those nymphs for whose sake you lead the holy life 
Sisters we dont lead the holy life for the sake of nymphs
Sisters he calls us  And they fell down right there in a faint
Then Ven Ratthapala said to his father Householder if theres food to be given then give it Dont harass us
Eat then my dear Ratthapala The meal is ready
So with his own hands Ven Ratthapalas father served and satisfied him with exquisite staple and nonstaple foods
When he had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl Ven Ratthapala stood up and recited these verses
Look at the image beautified a heap of festering wounds shored up
ill but the object of many resolves where there is nothing lasting or sure
Look at the form beautified with earrings  gems
a skeleton wrapped in skin made attractive with clothes
Feet reddened with henna a face smeared with powder
enough to deceive a fool but not a seeker for the further shore
Hair plaited in eight pleats eyes smeared with unguent
enough to deceive a fool but not a seeker for the further shore
Like a newly painted unguent pot  a putrid body adorned
enough to deceive a fool but not a seeker for the further shore
The hunter set out the snares but the deer didnt go near the trap
Having eaten the bait we go leaving the hunters to weep
After reciting these verses while standing Ven Ratthapala went to King Koravyas Migacira On arrival he sat down in the shade of a tree for the days abiding
Then King Koravya said to his gamekeeper Clean up the Migacira pleasure garden I am going there to see the beautiful grounds
As you say your majesty the gamekeeper responded to the king As he was cleaning up Migacira he saw Ven Ratthapala sitting in the shade of a tree for the days abiding
On seeing him he went to the king and said Migacira has been cleaned up for you your majesty
And the clansman Ratthapala  the son of the leading clan in this Thullakotthita of whom you have often spoken highly  is there sitting in the shade of a tree for the days abiding
In that case my dear gamekeeper never mind about the pleasure garden for today
I am now going to pay my respects to that Master Ratthapala
Then saying Give away all the staple and nonstaple foods that have been prepared King Koravya had auspicious vehicles harnessed Mounting an auspicious vehicle he set out from Thullakotthita accompanied by other auspicious vehicles in full royal pomp to see Ven Ratthapala
Going as far by vehicle as the ground would permit he dismounted and went to Ven Ratthapala accompanied by many eminent members of his court
On arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with Ven Ratthapala After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he stood to one side
As he was standing there he said to Ven Ratthapala May Master Ratthapala sit here on the elephant rug
Never mind great king You sit there I am sitting on my own seat
So King Koravya sat down on the seat prepared
As he was sitting there he said to Ven Ratthapala
Which four
Loss through aging loss through illness loss of wealth  loss of relatives
What did he know or see or hear that Master Ratthapala went forth from the home life into homelessness 
Great king there are four Dhamma summaries stated by the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened Having known  seen  heard them I went forth from the home life into homelessness

Master Ratthapala you say The world is swept away It does not endure
Now how is the meaning of this statement to be understood 
What do you think great king When you were twenty or twentyfive years old  an expert elephant rider an expert horseman an expert charioteer an expert archer an expert swordsman  were you strong in arm  strong in thigh fit  seasoned in warfare 
Yes Master Ratthapala when I was twenty or twentyfive years old I was strong in arm  strong in thigh fit  seasoned in warfare
It was as if I had supernormal power I do not see anyone who was my equal in strength
And what do you think great king Are you even now as strong in arm  strong in thigh as fit  as seasoned in warfare 
Not at all Master Ratthapala
Im now a feeble old man aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life  years old
Sometimes thinking I will place my foot here I place it somewhere else
It was in reference to this great king that the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened said The world is swept away It does not endure Having known  seen  heard this I went forth from the home life into homelessness
Its amazing Master Ratthapala Its astounding
how well that has been said by the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened The world is swept away It does not endure
For the world really is swept away Master Ratthapala It does not endure
Now in this royal court there are elephant troops  cavalry  chariot troops  infantry that will serve to defend us from dangers
And yet you say The world is without shelter without protector
How is the meaning of this statement to be understood 
What do you think great king Do you have any recurring illness
Yes Master Ratthapala I have a recurring windillness Sometimes my friends  advisors relatives  bloodkinsmen stand around me saying This time King Koravya will die
This time King Koravya will die
And what do you think great king Can you say to your friends  advisors relatives  bloodkinsmen My friends  advisors relatives  bloodkinsmen are commanded all of you who are present share out this pain so that I may feel less pain Or do you have to feel that pain all alone

I have to feel that pain all alone

Its amazing Master Ratthapala Its astounding
how well that has been said by the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened The world is without shelter without protector
For the world really is without shelter Master Ratthapala It is without protector
Now in this royal court there is a great deal of gold  silver stashed away underground  in attic vaults
And yet you say The world is without ownership One has to pass on leaving everything behind
How is the meaning of this statement to be understood 
What do you think great king As you now enjoy yourself endowed  replete with the pleasures of the five senses can you say Even in the afterlife I will enjoy myself in the same way endowed  replete with the very same pleasures of the five senses Or will this wealth fall to others while you pass on in accordance with your kamma 
Oh no Master Ratthapala I cant say Even in the afterlife I will enjoy myself in the same way endowed  replete with the very same pleasures of the five senses
This wealth will fall to others while I pass on in accordance with my kamma
It was in reference to this great king that the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened said The world is without ownership One has to pass on leaving everything behind Having known  seen  heard this I went forth from the home life into homelessness
Its amazing Master RatthapalaIts astounding
how well that has been said by the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened The world is without ownership One has to pass on leaving everything behind
For the world really is without ownership Master Ratthapala One has to pass on leaving everything behind
Now Master Ratthapala you say The world is insufficient insatiable a slave to craving
How is the meaning of this statement to be understood 
What do you think great king Do you now rule over the prosperous country of Kuru 
That is so Master Ratthapala I rule over the prosperous country of Kuru
What do you think great king Suppose a trustworthy reliable man of yours were to come to you from the east On arrival he would say to you
May it please your majesty to know I have come from the east There I saw a great country powerful  prosperous populous  crowded with people
Plenty are the elephant troops there plenty the cavalry troops chariot troops  infantry troops
Plenty is the ivorywork there plenty the gold  silver both worked  unworked Plenty are the women for the taking
It is possible with the forces you now have to conquer it
Conquer it great king
 What would you do  Having conquered it Master Ratthapala I would rule over it
Now what do you think great king Suppose a trustworthy reliable man of yours were to come to you from the west the north the south the other side of the ocean
On arrival he would say to you May it please your majesty to know I have come from the other side of the ocean There I saw a great country powerful  prosperous populous  crowded with people
Plenty are the elephant troops there plenty the cavalry troops chariot troops  infantry troops
Plenty is the ivorywork there plenty the gold  silver both worked  unworked Plenty are the women for the taking
It is possible with the forces you now have to conquer it
Conquer it great king  What would you do 
Having conquered it Master Ratthapala I would rule over it too
It was in reference to this great king that the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened said The world is insufficient insatiable a slave to craving Having known  seen  heard this I went forth from the home life into homelessness
Its amazing Master RatthapalaIts astounding
how well that has been said by the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened The world is insufficient insatiable a slave to craving
For the world really is insufficient Master Ratthapala Its insatiable a slave to craving
That is what Ven Ratthapala said
Having said that he further said this
said to him As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shell
so how could we  while youre alive  give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness 
A third time Ratthapalas parents said to him Ratthapala dear you are our only son dear  appealing raised in comfort brought up in comfort
How could your parents  while youre alive  give their permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Get up friend Ratthapala Eat drink  enjoy yourself
How could your parents  while youre alive  give their permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness 
As he went for alms from house to house in Thullakotthita he came to his own fathers house
said It was by these shavenheaded contemplatives that our only son dear  appealing was made to go forth
There are cases where having suffered these four kinds of loss men shave off their hair  beard put on the ochre robe and go forth from the home life into homelessness
But Master Ratthapala has suffered none of these
I see in the world people with wealth
who from delusion dont make a gift of the treasure theyve gained
Greedy they stash it away
hoping for even more sensual pleasures
A king who by force has conquered the world
and rules over the earth to the edge of the sea
dissatisfied with the oceans near shore
longs for the oceans far shore as well
Kings  others  plenty of people 
go to death with craving unabated
Unsated they leave the body behind
having not had enough of the worlds sensual pleasures
Ones relatives weep  pull out their hair
Oh woe our loved one is dead they cry
Carrying him off wrapped in a piece of cloth
they place him on a pyre then set him on fire
So he burns poked with sticks
in just one piece of cloth leaving all his possessions behind
They are not shelters for one who has died 
not relatives friends or companions
His heirs take over his wealth
while the being goes on in line with his kamma
No wealth at all follows the dead one 
not children wives dominion or riches
Long life cant be gotten with wealth nor aging
warded off with treasure The wise say this life is next to nothing  impermanent subject to change
The rich  the poor touch the touch of Death
The foolish  wise are touched by it too
But while fools lie as if slain by their folly
the wise dont tremble when touched by the touch
Thus the discernment by which one attains to mastery is better than wealth 
for those who havent reached mastery
go from existence to existence
out of delusion doing bad deeds
One goes to a womb  to the next world
falling into the wandering on  one thing after another 
while those of weak discernment trusting in one
also go to a womb  to the next world
Just as an evil thief caught at the breakin
is destroyed by his own act
so evil people  after dying in the next world 
are destroyed by their own acts
Sensual pleasures  variegated enticing sweet 
in various ways disturb the mind
Seeing the drawbacks in sensual objects
thats why O king I went forth
Just like fruits people fall
 young  old  at the breakup of the body
Knowing this O king I went forth
The contemplative life is better for sure
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at SavatthI in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Then while the venerable Malunkyaputta was alone in meditation the following thought arose in his mind These speculative views have been undeclared by the Blessed One set aside and rejected by him namely the world is eternal and the world is not eternal the world is finite and the world is infinite the soul is the same as the body and the soul is one thing and the body another and after death a Tathagata exists and after death a Tathagata does not exist and after death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist and after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist
The Blessed One does not declare these to me and I do not approve of and accept the fact that he does not declare these to me
If he declares to me either the world is eternal or the world is not eternalor after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist then I will lead the holy life under him if he does not declare these to me then I will abandon the training and return to the low life
Then when it was evening the venerable Malunkyaputta rose from meditation and went to the Blessed One
After paying homage to him he sat down at one side and told him
Here venerable sir while I was alone in meditation the following thought arose in my mind These speculative views have been undeclared by the Blessed OneIf he does not declare these to me then I will abandon the training and return to the low life
How then Malunkyaputta did I ever say to you Come Malunkyaputta lead the holy life under me and I will declare to you the world is eternalor after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist
 No venerable sir
 Did you ever tell me I will lead the holy life under the Blessed One and the Blessed One will declare to me the world is eternalor after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist
  No venerable sir
 That being so misguided man who are you and what are you abandoning 
If anyone should say thus I will not lead the holy life under the Blessed One until the Blessed One declares to me the world is eternalor after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist that would still remain undeclared by the Tathagata and meanwhile that person would die
The man would say I will not let the surgeon pull out this arrow until I know whether the man who wounded me was a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a worker And he would say I will not let the surgeon pull out this arrow until I know the name and clan of the man who wounded me until I know whether the man who wounded me was tall or short or of middle height until I know whether the man who wounded me was dark or brown or goldenskinned until I know whether the man who wounded me lives in such a village or town or city until I know whether the bow that wounded me was a long bow or a crossbow until I know whether the bowstring that wounded me was fibre or reed or sinew or hemp or bark until I know whether the shaft that wounded me was wild or cultivated until I know with what kind of feathers the shaft that wounded me was fitted  whether those of a vulture or a crow or a hawk or a peacock or a stork until I know with what kind of sinew the shaft that wounded me was bound  whether that of an ox or a buffalo or a lion or a monkey until I know what kind of arrow it was that wounded me  whether it was hooftipped or curved or barbed or calftoothed or oleander All this would still not be known to that man and meanwhile he would die
So too Malunkyaputta if anyone should say thus I will not lead the holy life under the Blessed One until the Blessed One declares to me the world is eternalor after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exis that would still remain undeclared by the Tathagata and meanwhile that person would die
Malunkyaputta if there is the view the world is eternal the holy life cannot be lived and if there is the view the world is not eternal the holy life cannot be lived Whether there is the view the world is eternal or the view the world is not eternal there is birth there is ageing there is death there are sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair the destruction of which I prescribe here and now
Therefore Malunkyaputta remember what I have left undeclared as undeclared and remember what I have declared as declared
And what have I left undeclared
The world is eternal  I have left undeclared The world is not eternal  I have left undeclared The world is finite  I have left undeclared The world is infinite  I have left undeclared The soul is the same as the body  I have left undeclared The soul is one thing and the body another  I have left undeclared After death a Tathagata exists  I have left undeclared After death a Tathagata does not exist  I have left undeclared After death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist  I have left undeclared After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist  I have left undeclared
Why have I left that undeclared
Because it is unbeneficial it does not belong to the fundamentals of the holy life it does not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana
That is why I have left it undeclared
And what have I declared
This is suffering  I have declared This is the origin of suffering  I have declared This is the cessation of suffering  I have declared This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering  I have declared
Why have I declared that
Because it is beneficial it belongs to the fundamentals of the holy life it leads to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana
That is why I have declared it
Therefore Malunkyaputta remember what I have left undeclared as undeclared and remember what I have declared as declared
That is what the Blessed One said
so I shall go to the Blessed One and ask him the meaning of this
If the Blessed One knows the world is eternal let the Blessed One declare to me the world is eternal if the Blessed One knows the world is not eternal let the Blessed One declare to me the world is not eternal
If the Blessed One does not know either the world is eternal or the world is not eternal then it is straightforward for one who does not know and does not see to say I do not know I do not see
If the Blessed One knows the world is finitethe world is infinite
the soul is the same as the body the soul is one thing and the body another
If the Blessed One does not know either after death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist or after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist then it is straightforward for one who does not know and does not see to say I do not know I do not see
If the Blessed One knows after death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist let the Blessed One declare that to me if the Blessed One knows after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist let the Blessed One declare that to me
after death a Tathagata existsafter death a Tathagata does not exist
Suppose Malunkyaputta a man were wounded by an arrow thickly smeared with poison
and his friends and companions his kinsmen and relatives brought a surgeon to treat him
If there is the view the world is finitethe world is infinite the soul is the same as the bodythe soul is one thing and the body anotherafter death a Tathagata existsafter death a Tathagata does not exist the holy life cannot be lived
If there is the view after death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist the holy life cannot be lived and if there is the view after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist the holy life cannot be lived Whether there is the view after death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist or the view after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist there is birth there is ageing there is death there are sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair the destruction of which I prescribe here and now
The venerable Malunkyaputta was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
THUS HAVE I HEARDOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha on the mountain Vulture Peak it was soon after Devadatta had left
Bhikkhus here some clansman goes forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness considering I am a victim of birth ageing and death of sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair I am a victim of suffering a prey to suffering Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be known
When he has gone forth thus he acquires gain honour and renown
He is pleased with that gain honour and renown and his intention is fulfilled
On account of it he lauds himself and disparages others thus I have gain honour and renown but these other bhikkhus are unknown of no account
He becomes intoxicated with that gain honour and renown grows negligent falls into negligence and being negligent he lives in suffering
Suppose a man needing heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood Passing over its heartwood its sapwood its inner bark and its outer bark he would cut off its twigs and leaves and take them away thinking they were heartwood
Then a man with good sight seeing him might say This good man did not know the heartwood the sapwood the inner bark the outer bark or the twigs and leaves
Thus while needing heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood he came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood and passing over its heartwood its sapwood its inner bark and its outer bark he cut off its twigs and leaves and took them away thinking they were heartwood
Whatever it was this good man had to make with heartwood his purpose will not be served
So too bhikkhus here some clansman goes forth out of faithhe lives in suffering

He is not pleased with that gain honour and renown and his intention is not fulfilled
He does not on account of it laud himself and disparage others
He does not become intoxicated with that gain honour and renown he does not grow negligent and fall into negligence
Being diligent he achieves the attainment of virtue
He is pleased with that attainment of virtue and his intention is fulfilled
On account of it he lauds himself and disparages others thus I am virtuous of good character but these other bhikkhus are immoral of evil character
He becomes intoxicated with that attainment of virtue grows negligent falls into negligence and being negligent he lives in suffering
Suppose a man needing heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood Passing over its heartwood its sapwood and its inner bark he would cut off its outer bark and take it away thinking it was heartwood

Whatever it was this good man had to make with heartwood his purpose will not be served
So too bhikkhus here some clansman goes forth out of faith
This bhikkhu is called one who has taken the outer bark of the holy life and stopped short with that
When he has gone forth thus he acquires gain honour and renown
He is not pleased with that gain honour and renown and his intention is not fulfilled
Being diligent he achieves the attainment of virtue
He is pleased with that attainment of virtue but his intention is not fulfilled
Being diligent he achieves the attainment of concentration
He is pleased with that attainment of concentration and his intention is fulfilled
On account of it he lauds himself and disparages others thus I am concentrated my mind is unified but these other bhikkhus are unconcentrated with their minds astray
He becomes intoxicated with that attainment of concentration grows negligent falls into negligence and being negligent he lives in suffering
Suppose a man needing heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood Passing over its heartwood and its sapwood he would cut off its inner bark and take it away thinking it was heartwood

Here bhikkhus some clansman goes forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness considering I am a victim of birth ageing and death of sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair I am a victim of suffering a prey to suffering Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be known
When he has gone forth thus he acquires gain honour and renown

He is pleased with that attainment of virtue but his intention is not fulfilled
He is pleased with that attainment of concentration but his intention is not fulfilled
He does not on account of it laud himself and disparage others
On account of it he lauds himself and disparages others thus I live knowing and seeing
He becomes intoxicated with that knowledge and vision grows negligent falls into negligence and being negligent he lives in suffering
Suppose a man needing heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood Passing over its heartwood he would cut off its sapwood and take it away thinking it was heartwood
Then a man with good sight seeing him might say This good man did not know the heartwoodor the twigs and leaves

He does not on account of it laud himself and disparage others
He does not become intoxicated with that knowledge and vision he does not grow negligent and fall into negligence Being diligent he attains perpetual liberation
And it is impossible for that bhikkhu to fall away from that perpetual deliverance
Suppose a man needing heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood and cutting off only its heartwood he would take it away knowing it was heartwood
Then a man with good sight seeing him might say This good man knew the heartwood the sapwood the inner bark the outer bark and the twigs and leaves
Thus while needing heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood he came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood and cutting off only its heartwood he took it away knowing it was heartwood
Whatever it was this good man had to make with heartwoodhis purpose will be served
So too bhikkhus here some clansman goes forth out of faith
And it is impossible for that bhikkhu to fall away from that perpetual deliverance
So this holy life bhikkhus does not have gain honour and renown for its benefit or the attainment of virtue for its benefit or the attainment of concentration for its benefit or knowledge and vision for its benefit
But it is this unshakeable deliverance of mind that is the goal of this holy life its heartwood and its end
That is what the Blessed One said
There referring to Devadatta the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus
He realises the Four Noble Truths the path and the cessation of the corruptions
And he knows There is nothing further here
This bhikkhu is called one who has taken the twigs and leaves of the holy life and stopped short with that
Here bhikkhus some clansman goes forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness considering I am a victim of birth ageing and death of sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair I am a victim of suffering a prey to suffering Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be known
He does not on account of it laud himself and disparage others
He does not become intoxicated with that attainment of virtue he does not grow negligent and fall into negligence
This bhikkhu is called one who has taken the inner bark of the holy life and stopped short with that
he lives in suffering
Being diligent he achieves the attainment of virtue
He does not become intoxicated with that attainment of concentration he does not grow negligent and fall into negligenceBeing diligent he achieves knowledge and vision
He is pleased with that knowledge and vision and his intention is fulfilled
Whatever it was this good man had to make with heartwood his purpose will not be served
he lives in suffering
When he is diligent he achieves the attainment of virtue
He is pleased with that attainment of virtue but his intention is not fulfilled
When he is diligent he achieves the attainment of concentration
When he is diligent he achieves knowledge and vision
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
When he is diligent he attains perpetual liberation
he lives in suffering
Being diligent he achieves the attainment of concentration
but these other bhikkhus live unknowing and unseeing
That is known to him by wisdom
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthl in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Now on that occasion the brahmin Janussoni was driving out of Savatthi in the middle of the day in an allwhite chariot drawn by white mares
He saw the wanderer Pilotika coming in the distance
and asked him
Now where is Master Vacchayana coming from in the middle of the day
Sir I am coming from the presence of the recluse Gotama
What does Master Vacchayana think of the recluse Gotamas lucidity of wisdom
He is wise is he not
Sir who am I to know the recluse Gotamas lucidity of wisdom
One would surely have to be his equal to know the recluse Gotamas lucidity of wisdom
Master Vacchayana praises the recluse Gotama with high praise indeed
Sir who am I to praise the recluse Gotama
The recluse Gotama is praised by the praised as best among gods and humans
What reasons does Master Vacchayana see that he has such confidence in the recluse Gotama
Sir suppose a wise elephant woodsman were to enter an elephant wood
and were to see in the elephant wood a big elephants footprint long in extent and broad across
He would come to the conclusion Indeed this is a big bull elephant
Master Vacchaya So too when I saw four footprints of the recluse Gotama I came to the conclusion The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha is practising the good way
What are the four
Sir I have seen here certain learned nobles who were clever knowledgeable about the doctrines of others as sharp as hairsplitting marksmen they wander about as it were demolishing the views of others with their sharp wits
When they hear The recluse Gotama will visit such and such a village or town
they formulate a question thus We will go to the recluse Gotama and ask him this question
If he is asked like this he will answer like this and so we will refute his doctrine in this way
and if he is asked like that he will answer like that and so we will refute his doctrine in that way
They hear The recluse Gotama has come to visit such and such a village or town
They go to the recluse Gotama
and the recluse Gotama instructs urges rouses and encourages them with a talk on the Dhamma
After they have been instructed urged roused and encouraged by the recluse Gotama with a talk on the Dhamma they do not so much as ask him the question so how should they refute his doctrine
In actual fact they become his disciples
 When I saw this first footprint of the recluse Gotama I came to the conclusion The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha is practising the good way
Again I have seen certain learned brahmins who were clever Again I have seen certain learned householders who were clever Again I have seen certain learned recluses who were clever
They do not so much as ask him the question so how should they refute his doctrine
In actual fact they ask the recluse Gotama to allow them to go forth from the home life into homelessness
and he gives them the going forth
Not long after they have gone forth dwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and resolute by realising for themselves with direct knowledge they here and now enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness
They say thus We were very nearly lost we very nearly perished for formerly we claimed that we were recluses though we were not really recluses we claimed that we were brahmins through we were not really brahmins we claimed that we were arahants though we were not really arahants
But now we are recluses now we are brahmins now we are arahants
When I saw these four footprints of the recluse Gotama I came to the conclusion The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha is practising the good way
When this was said the brahmin Janussoni got down from his allwhite chariot drawn by white mares and arranging his upper robe on one shoulder he extended his hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and uttered this exclamation three times Honour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened Honour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened Honour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
Perhaps some time or other we might meet Master Gotama and have some conversation with him
Then the brahmin Janussoni went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
and related to the Blessed One his entire conversation with the wanderer Pilotika
Thereupon the Blessed One told him At this point brahmin the simile of the elephants footprint has not yet been completed in detail
As to how it is completed in detail listen and attend carefully to what I shall say 
Yes sir the brahmin Janussoni replied
The Blessed One said this
Brahmin suppose an elephant woodsman were to enter an elephant wood
and were to see in the elephant wood a big elephants footprint long in extent and broad across
A wise elephant woodsman would not yet come to the conclusion Indeed this is a big bull elephant
Why is that
In an elephant wood there are small sheelephants that leave a big footprint and this might be one of their footprints
He follows it
and sees in the elephant wood a big elephants footprint long in extent and broad across and some scrapings high up
A wise elephant woodsman would not yet come to the conclusion Indeed this is a big bull elephant
Why is that
In an elephant wood there are tall sheelephants that have prominent teeth and leave a big footprint and this might be one of their footprints
He follows it further
and sees in the elephant wood a big elephants footprint long in extent and broad across and some scrapings high up and marks made by tusks
A wise elephant woodsman would not yet come to the conclusion Indeed this is a big bull elephant
Why is that
In an elephant wood there are tall sheelephants that have tusks and leave a big footprint and this might be one of their footprints
He follows it further
and sees in the elephant wood a big elephants footprint long in extent and broad across and some scrapings high up and marks made by tusks and brokenoff branches
And he sees that bull elephant at the root of a tree or in the open walking about sitting or lying down
He comes to the conclusion This is that big bull elephant
So too brahmin here a Tathagata appears in the world accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessed
He declares this world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas this generation with its recluses and brahmins its princes and its people which he has himself realised with direct knowledge
He teaches the Dhamma good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing and he reveals a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure
A householder or householders son or one born in some other clan hears that Dhamma
On hearing the Dhamma he acquires faith in the Tathagata
Possessing that faith he considers thus Household life is crowded and dusty life gone forth is wide open
It is not easy while living in a home to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell
Suppose I shave off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessness
On a later occasion abandoning a small or a large fortune abandoning a small or a large circle of relatives he shaves off his hair and beard puts on the yellow robe and goes forth from the home life into homelessness
Having thus gone forth and possessing the bhikkhus training and way of life abandoning the killing of living beings he abstains from killing living beings with rod and weapon laid aside gentle and kindly he abides compassionate to all living beings
Abandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not given taking only what is given expecting only what is given
by not stealing he abides in purity
Abandoning incelibacy he observes celibacy living apart abstaining from the vulgar practice of sexual intercourse
Abandoning false speech he abstains from false speech he speaks truth adheres to truth is trustworthy and reliable one who is no deceiver of the world
Abandoning malicious speech he abstains from malicious speech he does not repeat elsewhere what he has heard here in order to divide those people from these nor does he repeat to these people what he has heard elsewhere in order to divide these people from those
thus he is one who reunites those who are divided a promoter of friendships who enjoys concord rejoices in concord delights in concord a speaker of words that promote concord
Abandoning harsh speech he abstains from harsh speech
he speaks such words as are gentle pleasing to the ear and loveable as go to the heart are courteous desired by many and agreeable to many
Abandoning gossip he abstains from gossip he speaks at the right time speaks what is fact speaks on what is good speaks on the Dhamma and the Discipline at the right time he speaks such words as are worth recording reasonable moderate and beneficial
He abstains from injuring seeds and plants He practises eating only in one part of the day abstaining from eating at night and outside the proper time He abstains from dancing singing music and theatrical shows He abstains from wearing garlands smartening himself with scent and embellishing himself with unguents He abstains from high and large couches He abstains from accepting gold and silver He abstains from accepting raw grain He abstains from accepting raw meat He abstains from accepting women and girls He abstains from accepting men and women slaves He abstains from accepting goats and sheep He abstains from accepting fowl and pigs He abstains from accepting elephants cattle horses and mares He abstains from accepting fields and land He abstains from going errands and running messages He abstains from buying and selling He abstains from false weights false metals and false Measures He abstains from cheating deceiving defrauding and trickery He abstains from wounding murdering binding brigandage plunder and violence
He becomes content with robes to protect his body and with almsfood to maintain his stomach
and wherever he goes he sets out taking only these with him
Just as a bird wherever it goes flies with its wings as its only burden so too the bhikkhu becomes content with robes to protect his body and with almsfood to maintain his stomach
and wherever he goes he sets out taking only these with him
Possessing this aggregate of noble virtue he experiences within himself a bliss that is blameless
On seeing a form with the eye he does not grasp at its signs and features
Since if he left the eye faculty unguarded evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him he practises the way of its restraint he guards the eye faculty he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty
On hearing a sound with the earOn smelling an odour with the noseOn tasting a flavour with the tongueOn touching a tangible with the bodyOn cognizing a mindobject with the mind he does not grasp at its signs and features
Since if he left the mind faculty unguarded evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him he practises the way of its restraint he guards the mind faculty he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty
Possessing this noble restraint of the faculties he experiences within himself a bliss that is unsullied
He becomes one who acts in full awareness when going forward and returning who acts in full awareness when looking ahead and looking away who acts in full awareness when flexing and extending his limbs who acts in full awareness when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl who acts in full awareness when eating drinking consuming food and tasting who acts in full awareness when defecating and urinating who acts in full awareness when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and keeping silent
Possessing this aggregate of noble virtue and this noble restraint of the faculties and possessing this noble mindfulness and full awareness he resorts to a secluded resting place the forest the root of a tree a mountain a ravine a hillside cave a charnel ground a jungle thicket an open space a heap of straw
On returning from his almsround after his meal he sits down folding his legs crosswise setting his body erect and establishing mindfulness before him
Abandoning covetousness for the world he abides with a mind free from covetousness he purifies his mind from covetousness
Abandoning ill will and hatred he abides with a mind free from ill will compassionate for the welfare of all living beings he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred
Abandoning sloth and torpor he abides free from sloth and torpor percipient of light mindful and fully aware he purifies his mind from sloth and torpor
Abandoning restlessness and remorse he abides unagitated with a mind inwardly peaceful he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse
Abandoning doubt he abides having gone beyond doubt unperplexed about wholesome states he purifies his mind from doubt
Having thus abandoned these five hindrances imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states he enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
This brahmin is called a footprint of the Tathagata something scraped by the Tathagata something marked by the Tathagata
but a noble disciple does not yet come to the conclusion The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha is practising the good way
Again with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentration
This too brahmin is called a footprint of the Tathagata but a noble disciple does not yet come to the conclusion The Blessed One is fully enlightened
Again with the fading away as well of rapture a bhikkhu abides in equanimity and mindful and fully aware still feeling pleasure with the body he enters upon and abides in the third jhana on account of which noble ones announce He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful
This too brahmin is called a footprint of the Tathagatabut a noble disciple does not yet come to the conclusion The Blessed One is fully enlightened
Again with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana which has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
This too brahmin is called a footprint of the Tathagata
but a noble disciple does not yet come to the conclusion The Blessed One is fully enlightened
When his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives
He recollects his manifold past lives that is one birth two births three births four births five births ten births twenty births thirty births forty births fifty births a hundred births a thousand births a hundred thousand births many aeons of worldcontraction many aeons of worldexpansion many aeons of worldcontraction and expansionThus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives
This too brahmin is called a footprint of the Tathagata
but a noble disciple does not yet come to the conclusion The Blessed One is fully enlightened
When his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings
With the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human he sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate He understands how beings pass on according to their actions thus Thus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human he sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and he understands how beings pass on according to their actions
This too brahmin is called a footprint of the Tathagata
but a noble disciple does not yet come to the conclusion The Blessed One is fully enlightened
When his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of the taints
He understands as it actually is This is suffering This is the origin of suffering This is the cessation of suffering This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering
These are the taints This is the origin of the taints This is the cessation of the taints This is the way leading to the cessation of the taints
This too brahmin is called a footprint of the Tathagata something scraped by the Tathagata something marked by the Tathagata
but a noble disciple still has not yet come to the conclusion The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha is practising the good way Rather he is in the process of coming to this conclusion
When he knows and sees thus his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of being and from the taint of ignorance
When it is liberated there comes the knowledgeIt is liberated
He understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being
This too brahmin is called a footprint of the Tathagata something scraped by the Tathagata something marked by the Tathagata
It is at this point that a noble disciple has come to the conclusion The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha is practising the good way
And it is at this point brahmin that the simile of the elephants footprint has been completed in detail
When this was said the brahmin Janussoni said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama
Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms
I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Angan country at a town of the Angans named Assapura
There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this
Recluses recluses bhikkhus that is how people perceive you
And when you are asked What are you  you claim that you are recluses Since that is what you are designated and what you claim to be  We will undertake and practise those things that make one a recluse that make one a brahmin so that our designations may be true and our claims genuine

On hearing a sound with the earOn smelling an odour with the noseOn tasting a flavour with the tongueOn touching a tangible with the bodyOn cognizing a mindobject with the mind we will not grasp at its signs and features

Bhikkhus I inform you I declare to you You who seek the recluses status do not fall short of the goal of recluseship while there is more to be done
  What more is to be done
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu resorts to a secluded resting place the forest the root of a tree a mountain a ravine a hillside cave a charnel ground a jungle thicket an open space a heap of straw
On returning from his almsround after his meal he sits down folding his legs crosswise setting his body erect and establishing mindfulness before him
Abandoning covetousness for the world he abides with a mind free from covetousness he purifies his mind from covetousness Abandoning ill will and hatred he abides with a mind free from ill will compassionate for the welfare of all living beings he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred Abandoning sloth and torpor he abides free from sloth and torpor percipient of light mindful and fully aware he purifies his mind from sloth and torpor Abandoning restlessness and remorse he abides unagitated with a mind inwardly peaceful he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse Abandoning doubt he abides having gone beyond doubt unperplexed about wholesome states he purifies his mind from doubt
Bhikkhus suppose a man were to take a loan and undertake business
Or suppose a man were afflicted suffering and gravely ill and his food would not agree with him and his body had no strength
Or suppose a man were imprisoned in a prisonhouse
Or suppose a man were a slave not selfdependent but dependent on others unable to go where he wants
Or suppose a man with wealth and property were to enter aroad across a desert
So too bhikkhus when these five hindrances are unabandoned in himself a bhikkhu sees them respectively as a debt a disease a prisonhouse slavery and a road across a desert
  Having abandoned these five hindrances imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states he enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
He makes the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
Just as a skilled bath man or a bath mans apprentice heaps bath powder in a metal basin and sprinkling it gradually with water kneads it until the moisture wets his ball of bath powder
Again bhikkhus with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentration
He makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of concentration
Just as though there were a lake whose waters welled up from below
Again bhikkhus with the fading away as well of rapture a bhikkhu abides in equanimity and mindful and fully aware still feeling pleasure with the body he enters upon and abides in the third jhana on account of which noble ones announce He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful
He makes the pleasure divested of rapture drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pleasure divested of rapture
Just as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses some lotuses that are born and grow in the water thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it and cool water drenches steeps fills and pervades them to their tips and their roots so that there is no part of all those lotuses unpervaded by cool water
Again bhikkhus with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana which has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
He sits pervading this body with a pure bright jhnana so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pure bright mind
Just as though a man were sitting covered from the head down with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his whole body unpervaded by the white cloth
  When his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives
He recollects his manifold past lives that is one birth two birthsThus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives
Just as a man might go from his own village to another village and then back again to his own village
So too a bhikkhu recollects his manifold past lives Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives
When his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings
Thus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human he sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and he understands how beings pass on according to their actions
When his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of the taints
He understands as it actually is This is suffering This is the origin of suffering This is the cessation of suffering This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering
When he knows and sees thus his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of being and from the taint of ignorance
When it is liberated there comes the knowledge It is liberated He understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being
Just as if there were a lake in a mountain recess clear limpid and undisturbed
So too a bhikkhu understands as it actually is This is suffering He understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being
 Bhikkhus a bhikkhu such as this is called a recluse a brahmin one who has been washed one who has attained to knowledge a holy scholar a noble one an arahant
And how is a bhikkhu a recluse
He has quieted down evil unwholesome states that defile bring renewal of being give trouble ripen in suffering and lead to future birth ageing and death
That is how a bhikkhu is a recluse
And how is a bhikkhu a brahmin
He has expelled evil unwholesome states that defile and lead to future birth ageing and death
That is how a bhikkhu is a brahmin
And how is a bhikkhu one who has been washed
He has washed off evil unwholesome states that defile and lead to future birth ageing and death
That is how a bhikkhu is one who has been washed
And how is a bhikkhu one who has attained to knowledge
He has known evil unwholesome states that defile and lead to future birth ageing and death
That is how a bhikkhu is one who has attained to knowledge
And how is a bhikkhu a holy scholar
The evil unwholesome states that defileand lead to future birth ageing and death have streamed away from him
That is how abhikkhu is a holy scholar
And how is a bhikkhu a noble one
Evil unwholesome states that defile and lead to future birth ageing and death are far away from him
That is how a bhikkhu is a noble one
And how is a bhikkhu an arahant
Evil unwholesome states that defile bring renewal of being give trouble ripen in suffering and lead to future birth ageing and death are far away from him
That is how a bhikkhu is an arahant
That is what the Blessed One said
and so that the services of those whose robes almsfood resting place and medicinal requisites we use shall bring them great fruit and benefit and so that our going forth shall not be in vain but fruitful and fertile
We will guard the doors of our sense faculties On seeing a form with the eye we will not grasp at its signs and features
and his business were to succeed
so that he could repay all the money of the old loan and there would remain enough extra to maintain a wife
then on considering this he would be glad and full of joy
but later he would recover from the affliction and his food would agree with him and his body would regain strength
then on considering this he would be glad and full of joy
but later he would be released from prison safe and secure with no loss to his property
then on considering this he would be glad and full of joy
but later on he would be released from slavery selfdependent independent of others a freed man able to go where he wants
then on considering this he would be glad and full of joy
but later on he would cross over the desert safe and secure with no loss to his property
then on considering this he would be glad and full of joy
But when these five hindrances have been abandoned in himself he sees that as freedom from debt healthiness release from prison freedom from slavery and a land of safety
so too a bhikkhu makes the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
soaks it and pervades it inside and out yet the ball itself does not ooze
then the cool fount of water welling up in the lake would make the cool water drench steep fill and pervade the lake so that there would be no part of the whole lake unpervaded by cool water and would not be replenished from time to time by showers of rain
so too a bhikkhu makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of concentration
so too a bhikkhu makes the pleasure divested of rapture drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pleasure divested of rapture
go too a bhikkhu sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pure bright mind
he might think I went from my own village to that village and there I stood in such a way sat in such a way spoke in such a way kept silent in such a way and from that village I went to that other village and there I stood in such a way sat in such a way spoke in such a way kept silent in such a way and from that village I came back again to my own village
Just as though there were two houses with doors and a man with good sight standing there between them saw people entering the houses and coming out and passing to and fro
so too with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human a bhikkhu sees beings passing away and reappearing and he understands how beings pass on according to their actions
These are the taints This is the origin of the taints This is the cessation of the taints This is the way leading to the cessation of the taints
so that a man with good sight standing on the bank could see shells gravel and pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting
he might think There is this lake clear limpid and undisturbed
and there are these shells gravel and pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
and we will not laud ourselves and disparage others on account of that purified bodily conduct  bhikkhus you should train thus
and we will not laud ourselves and disparage others on account of that purified verbal conduct  bhikkhus you should train thus
and we will not laud ourselves and disparage others on account of that purified mental conduct  bhikkhus you should train thus
and we will not laud ourselves and disparage others on account of that purified livelihood  Bhikkhus you should train thus
Since if we left the mind faculty unguarded evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade us we will practise the way of its restraint we will guard the mind faculty we will undertake the restraint of the mind faculty  Bhikkhus you should train thus
Now bhikkhus you may think thus We are possessed of shame and fear of wrongdoing our bodily conduct verbal conduct mental conduct and livelihood have been purified we guard the doors of our sense faculties we are moderate in eating and we are devoted to wakefulness That much is enough and you may rest content with that much
and it had no inflow from east west north or south and would not be replenished from time to time by showers of rain
When he feels a feeling terminating with the body he understands I feel a feeling terminating with the body When he feels a feeling terminating with life he understands I feel a feeling terminating with life He understands On the dissolution of the body with the ending of life all that is felt not being delighted in will become cool right here
It is not inconvenient for me venerable sir
 Now there was a clansman named Pukkusati who had gone forth from the home life into homelessness out of faith in the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One went to the venerable Pukkusati and said to him If it is not inconvenient for you bhikkhu I will stay one night in the workshop
The potters workshop is large enough friend
Then the Blessed One spent most of the night seated in meditation
Then the Blessed One thought This clansman conducts himself in a way that inspires confidence
Suppose I were to question him
So he asked the venerable Pukkusati  Under whom have you gone forth bhikkhu
Who is your teacher
Whose Dhamma do you profess 
Friend there is the recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan
Now a good report of that Blessed Gotama has been spread to this effect That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessed
I have gone forth under that Blessed One
But bhikkhu where is that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened now living 
There is friend a city in the northern country named Savatthi
The Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened is now living there
But bhikkhu have you ever seen that Blessed One before Would you recognise him if you saw him 
No friend I have never seen that Blessed One before nor would I recognise him if I saw him
Then the Blessed One thought This clansman has gone forth from the home life into homelessness under me
Suppose I were to teach him the Dhamma
So the Blessed One addressed the venerable Pukkusati thus Bhikkhu I will teach you the Dhamma
Listen and attend closely to what I shall say
 Yes friend the venerable Pukkusati replied
 Bhikkhu this person consists of six elements six bases of contact and eighteen kinds of mental exploration and he has four foundations The tides of conceiving do not sweep over one who stands upon these foundations and when the tides of conceiving no longer sweep over him he is called a sage at peace
One should not neglect wisdom should preserve truth should cultivate relinquishment and should train for peace This is the summary of the exposition of the six elements
Bhikkhu this person consists of six elements So it was said
And with reference to what was this said There are the earth element the water element the fire element the air element the space element and the consciousness element
So it was with reference to this that it was said Bhikkhu this person consists of six elements
Bhikkhu this person consists of six bases of contact So it was said
And with reference to what was this said
There are the base of eyecontact the base of earcontact the base of nosecontact the base of tonguecontact the base of bodycontact and the base of mindcontact
So it was with reference to this that it was said Bhikkhu this person consists of six bases of contact
Bhikkhu this person consists of eighteen kinds of mental exploration So it was said
And with reference to what was this said
On seeing a form with the eye one explores a form productive of joy one explores a form productive of grief one explores a form productive of equanimity On hearing a sound with the ear On smelling an odour with the nose On tasting a flavour with the tongue On touching a tangible with the body On cognizing a mindobject with the mind one explores a mindobject productive of joy one explores a mindobject productive of grief one explores a mindobject productive of equanimity
So it was with reference to this that it was said Bhikkhu this person consists of eighteen kinds of mental exploration
Bhikkhu this person has four foundations So it was said
And with reference to what was this said
So it was with reference to this that it was said Bhikkhu this person has four foundations
One should not neglect wisdom should preserve truth should cultivate relinquishment and should train for peace So it was said
And with reference to what was this said
How bhikkhu does one not neglect wisdom
There are these six elements the earth element the water element the fire element the air element the space element and the consciousness element
What bhikkhu is the earth element
The earth element may be either internal or external
What is the internal earth element
Whatever internally belonging to oneself is solid solidified and clungto that is headhairs bodyhairs nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bonemarrow kidneys heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs large intestines small intestines contents of the stomach feces or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is solid solidified and clungto this is called the internal earth element
Now both the internal earth element and the external earth element are simply earth element
And that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom one becomes disenchanted with the earth element and makes the mind dispassionate towards the earth element
What bhikkhu is the water element
The water element may be either internal or external
What is the internal water element
Whatever internally belonging to oneself is water watery and clungto that is bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease spittle snot oilofthejoints urine or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is water watery and clungto this is called the internal water element
Now both the internal water element and the external water element are simply water element
And that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom one becomes disenchanted with the water element and makes the mind dispassionate towards the water element
What bhikkhu is the fire element
The fire element may be either internal or external
What is the internal fire element
Whatever internally belonging to oneself is fire fiery and clungto that is that by which one is warmed ages and is consumed and that by which what is eaten drunk consumed and tasted gets completely digested or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is fire fiery and clungto this is called the internal fire element
Now both the internal fire element and the external fire element are simply fire element
And that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom one becomes disenchanted with the fire element and makes the mind dispassionate towards the fire element
What bhikkhu is the air element
The air element may be either internal or external
What is the internal air element
Whatever internally belonging to oneself is air airy and clung to that is upgoing winds downgoing winds winds in the belly winds in the bowels winds that course through the limbs inbreath and outbreath or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is air airy and clungto this is called the internal air element
Now both the internal air element and the external air element are simply air element
And that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom one becomes disenchanted with the air element and makes the mind dispassionate towards the air element
What bhikkhu is the space element
The space element may be either internal or external
What is the internal space element
Whatever internally belonging to oneself is space spatial and clungto that is the holes of the ears the nostrils the door of the mouth and that aperture whereby what is eaten drunk consumed and tasted gets swallowed and where it collects and whereby it is excreted from below or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is space spatial and clungto this is called the internal space element
Now both the internal space element and the external space element are simply space element
And that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom one becomes disenchanted with the space element and makes the mind dispassionate towards the space element
What does one cognize with that consciousness
One cognizes This is pleasant one cognizes This is painful one cognizes This is neitherpainfulnorpleasant
When one feels a pleasant feeling one understands I feel a pleasant feeling
In dependence on a contact to be felt as painful there arises a painful feeling
When one feels a painful feeling one understands I feel a painful feeling
One understands With the cessation of that same contact to be felt as painful its corresponding feeling  the painful feeling that arose in dependence on that contact to be felt as painful  ceases and subsides
In dependence on a contact to be felt as neitherpainfulnorpleasant there arises a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
When one feels a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling one understands I feel a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
One understands With the cessation of that same contact to be felt as neitherpainfulnorpleasant its corresponding feeling  the neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling that arose in dependence on that contact to be felt as neitherpainfulnorpleasant  ceases and subsides
Bhikkhu just as from the contact and friction of two firesticks heat is generated and fire is produced and with the separation and disjunction of these two firesticks the corresponding heat ceases and subsides so too in dependence on a contact to be felt as pleasant
If I were to direct this equanimity so purified and bright to the base of infinite consciousness
to the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception and to develop my mind accordingly
then this equanimity of mine supported by that base clinging to it would remain for a very long time
He understands thus If I were to direct this equanimity so purified and bright to the base of infinite space and to develop my mind accordingly this would be conditioned
He understands thus Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being
If he feels a pleasant feeling he understands It is impermanent there is no holding to it there is no delight in it
If he feels a pleasant feeling he feels it detached if he feels a painful feeling he feels it detached if he feels a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling he feels it detached
Bhikkhu just as an oillamp burns in dependence on oil and a wick and when the oil and wick are used up if it does not get any more fuel it is extinguished from lack of fuel so too when he feels a feeling terminating with the body He understands On the dissolution of the body with the ending of life all that is felt not being delighted in will become cool right here
His deliverance being founded upon truth is unshakeable
For that is false bhikkhu which has a deceptive nature and that is true which has an undeceptive nature  Nibbana
Therefore a bhikkhu possessing this truth possesses the supreme foundation of truth
For this bhikkhu is the supreme noble truth namely Nibbana which has an undeceptive nature
Formerly when he was ignorant he acquired and developed attachments
now he has abandoned them cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump done away with them so that they are no longer subject to future arising
Therefore a bhikkhu possessing this relinquishment possesses the supreme foundation of relinquishment
For this bhikkhu is the supreme noble relinquishment namely the relinquishing of all attachments
Formerly when he was ignorant he experienced covetousness desire and lust
now he has abandoned them cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump done away with them so that they are no longer subject to future arising
Formerly when he was ignorant he experienced anger ill will and hate
now he has abandoned them cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump done away with them so that they are no longer subject to future arising
Formerly when he was ignorant he experienced ignorance and delusion
now he has abandoned them cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump done away with them so that they are no longer subject to future arising
The tides of conceiving do not sweep over one who stands upon these foundations and when the tides of conceiving no longer sweep over him he is called a sage at peace So it was said
And with reference to what was this said
Bhikkhu I am is a conceiving I am this is a conceiving I shall be is a conceiving I shall not be is a conceiving I shall be possessed of form is a conceiving I shall be formless is a conceiving I shall be percipient is a conceiving I shall be nonpercipient is a conceiving I shall be neitherpercipientnornonpercipient is a conceiving
Conceiving is a disease conceiving is a tumour conceiving is a dart
By overcoming all conceivings bhikkhu one is called a sage at peace
And the sage at peace is not born does not age does not die he is not shaken and is not agitated
For there is nothing present in him by which he might be born Not being born how could he age Not ageing how could he die Not dying how could he be shaken Not being shaken why should he be agitated
So it was with reference to this that it was said The tides of conceiving do not sweep over one who stands upon these foundations and when the tides of conceiving no longer sweep over him he is called a sage at peace
Bhikkhu bear in mind this brief exposition of the six elements
Thereupon the venerable Pukkusati thought Indeed the Teacher has come to me The Sublime One has come to me The Fully Enlightened One has come to me  Then he rose from his seat arranged his upper robe over one shoulder and prostrating himself with his head at the Blessed Ones feet he said Venerable sir a transgression overcame me in that like a fool confused and blundering I presumed to address the Blessed One as friend
Venerable sir may the Blessed One forgive my transgression seen as such for the sake of restraint in the future
Surely bhikkhu a transgression overcame you in that like a fool confused and blundering you presumed to address me as friend
But since you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma we forgive you
For it is growth in the Noble Ones Discipline when one sees ones transgression as such makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma and undertakes restraint in the future
Venerable sir I would receive the full admission under the Blessed One
But are your bowl and robes complete bhikkhu 
Venerable sir my bowl and robes are not complete
Bhikkhu Tathagatas do not give the full admission to anyone whose bowl and robes are not complete
Then the venerable Pukkusati having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones words rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One keeping him on his right he departed in order to search for a bowl and robes
Then while the venerable Pukkusati was searching for a bowl and robes a stray cow killed him
Then a number of bhikkhus went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him they sat down at one side
What is his future course 
Bhikkhus the clansman Pukkusati was wise He practised in accordance with the Dhamma and did not trouble me in the interpretation of the Dhamma
With the destruction of the five lower fetters the clansman Pukkusati has reappeared spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and will attain final Nibbana there without ever returning from that world
That is what the Blessed One said
but there is a homeless one already staying there
If he agrees then stay as long as you like venerable sir
and on that occasion he was already staying in the potters workshop
Then the Blessed One entered the potters workshop prepared a spread of grass at one end and sat down folding his legs crosswise setting his body erect and establishing mindfulness in front of him
Let the venerable one stay as long as he likes
and the venerable Pukkusati also spent most of the night seated in meditation
that Blessed One is my teacher
I profess the Dhamma of that Blessed One
The Blessed One said this
There are the foundation of wisdom the foundation of truth the foundation of relinquishment and the foundation of peace
Then there remains only consciousness purified and bright
In dependence on a contact to be felt as pleasant there arises a pleasant feeling
One understands With the cessation of that same contact to be felt as pleasant its corresponding feeling  the pleasant feeling that arose in dependence on that contact to be felt as pleasant  ceases and subsides
Suppose bhikkhu a skilled goldsmith or his apprentice were to prepare a furnace heat up the crucible take some gold with tongs and put it into the crucible From time to time he would blow on it from time to time he would sprinkle water over it and from time to time he would just look on That gold would become refined well refined completely refined faultless rid of dross malleable wieldy and radiant Then whatever kind of ornament he wished to make from it whether a golden chain or earrings or a necklace or a golden garland it would serve his purpose So too bhikkhu then there remains only equanimity purified and bright malleable wieldy and radiant
Then there remains only equanimity purified and bright malleable wieldy and radiant
to be felt as painful
to be felt as neitherpainfulnorpleasant there arises a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
One understands With the cessation of that same contact to be felt as neitherpainfulnorpleasant its corresponding feeling
He understands thus If I were to direct this equanimity so purified and bright to the base of infinite space and to develop my mind accordingly
then this equanimity of mine supported by that base clinging to it would remain for a very long time
If I were to direct this equanimity so purified and bright to the base of infinite consciousness
to the base of nothingness
to the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception and to develop my mind accordingly this would be conditioned
He does not form any condition or generate any volition tending towards either being or nonbeing
Since he does not form any condition or generate any volition tending towards eitherbeing or nonbeing he does not cling to anything in this world When he does not cling he is not agitated When he does not cling he is not agitated When he is not agitated he personally attains Nibbana
to the base of nothingness
If he feels a painful feeling he understands It is impermanent there is no holding to it there is no delight in it
Therefore a bhikkhu possessing this wisdom possesses the supreme foundation of wisdom
For this bhikkhu is the supreme noble wisdom namely the knowledge of the destruction of all suffering
So it was with reference to this that it was said One should not neglect wisdom should preserve truth should cultivate relinquishment and should train for peace
For this bhikkhu is the supreme noble peace namely the pacification of lust hate and delusion
Therefore a bhikkhu possessing this peace possesses the supreme foundation of peace
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
and told him Venerable sir the clansman Pukkusati who was given brief instruction by the Blessed One has died What is his destination
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Magadhan country and eventually arrived at Rajagaha There he went to the potter Bhaggava and said to him  If it is not inconvenient for you Bhaggava I will stay one night in your workshop
ceases and subsides
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Now on that occasion a pernicious view had arisen in a bhikkhu named Arittha formerly of the vulture killers thus As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are not able to obstruct one who engages in them
Several bhikkhus having heard about this went to the bhikkhu Arittha and asked him
Exactly so friends As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are not able to obstruct one who engages in them
Then these bhikkhus desiring to detach him from that pernicious view pressed and questioned and crossquestioned him thus Friend Arittha do not say so Do not misrepresent the Blessed One it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One The Blessed One would not speak thus
For in many discourses the Blessed One has stated how obstructive filings are obstructions and how they are able to obstruct one who engages in them
The Blessed One has stated how sensual pleasures provide little gratification much suffering and much despair and how great is the danger in them
With the simile of the skeleton with the simile of the piece of meat with the simile of the grass torch with the simile of the pit of coals with the simile of the dream with the simile of the borrowed goods with the simile of the tree laden with fruit with the simile of the slaughterhouse with the simile of the sword stake with the simile of the snakes head the Blessed One has stated how sensual pleasures provide little gratification much suffering and much despair and how great is the danger in them
Yet although pressed and questioned and crossquestioned by them in this way the bhikkhu Arittha formerly of the vulture killers still obstinately adhered to that pernicious view and continued to insist upon it
Since the bhikkhus were unable to detach him from that pernicious view they went to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus Come bhikkhu tell the bhikkhu Arittha formerly of the vulture killers in my name that the Teacher calls him
 Yes venerable sir he replied and he went to the bhikkhu Arittha and told him The Teacher calls you friend Arittha
Yes friend he replied and he went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him sat down at one side
The Blessed One then asked him Arittha is it true that the following pernicious view has arisen in you As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are not able to obstruct one who engages in them 
Exactly so venerable sir As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are not able to obstruct one who engages in them
Misguided man to whom have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma in that way
Misguided man in many discourses have I not stated how obstructive things are obstructions
I have stated how sensual pleasures provide little gratification much suffering and much despair and how great is the danger in them
With the simile of the skeleton with the simile of the piece of meat with the simile of the grass torch with the simile of the pit of coals with the simile of the dream with the simile of the borrowed goods with the simile of the tree laden with fruit with the simile of the slaughterhouse with the simile of the sword stake with the simile of the snakes head I have stated how sensual pleasures provide little gratification much suffering and much despair and how great is the danger in them
But you misguided man have misrepresented us by your wrong grasp and injured yourself and stored up much demerit
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus what do you think Has this bhikkhu Arittha formerly of the vulture killers kindled even a spark of wisdom in this Dhamma and Discipline 
How could he venerable sir No venerable sir
When this was said the bhikkhu Arittha formerly of the vulture killers sat silent dismayed with shoulders drooping and head down glum and without response
Then knowing this the Blessed One told him Misguided man you will be recognised by your own pernicious view
I shall question the bhikkhus on this matter
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus do you understand the Dhamma taught by me as this bhikkhu Arittha formerly of the vulture killers does when he misrepresents us by his wrong grasp and injures himself and stores up much demerit 
No venerable sir
For in many discourses the Blessed One has stated how obstructive things are obstructions and how they are able to obstruct one who engages in them
The Blessed One has stated how sensual pleasures provide little gratification much suffering and much despair and how great is the danger in them
With the simile of the skeletonwith the simile of the snakes head the blessed One has stated how great is the danger in them
Good bhikkhus It is good that you understand the Dhamma taught by me thus
For in many discourses I have stated how obstructive things are obstructions and how they are able to obstruct one who engages in them
I have stated how sensual pleasures provide little gratification much suffering and much despair and how great is the danger in them
With the simile of the skeleton with the simile of the snakes head I have stated how great is the danger in them
But this bhikkhu Arittha formerly of the vulture killers misrepresents us by his wrong grasp and injures himself and stores up much demerit
  Here bhikkhus some misguided men learn the Dhamma  discourses stanzas expositions verses exclamations sayings birth stories marvels and answers to questions 
Not examining the meaning of those teachings with wisdom they do not gain a reflective acceptance of them
Instead they learn the Dhamma only for the sake of criticising others and for winning in debates
Suppose a man needing a snake seeking a snake wandering in search of a snake
and because of that he would come to death or deadly suffering
Why is that
Because of his wrong grasp of the snake
So too here some misguided men learn the Dhamma
Here bhikkhus some clansmen learn the Dhamma  discoursesanswers to questions  and having learned the Dhamma they examine the meaning of those teachings with wisdom
Examining the meaning of those teachings with wisdom they gain a reflective acceptance of them
They do not learn the Dhamma for the sake of criticising others and for winning in debates
Suppose a man needing a snake seeking a snake wandering in search of a snake
Then although the snake might wrap its coils round his hand or his arm or his limbs still he would not come to death or deadly suffering because of that
Why is that
Because of his right grasp of the snake
So too here some clansmen learn the Dhamma
Therefore bhikkhus when you understand the meaning of my statements remember it accordingly
 Yes venerable sir the bhikkhus replied
The Blessed One said thisBhikkhus suppose a man in the course of a journey
saw a great expanse of water whose near shore was dangerous and fearful and whose further shore was safe and free from fear but there was no ferryboat or bridge going to the far shore
Then he thought There is this great expanse of water whose near shore is dangerous and fearful and whose further shore is safe and free from fear but there is no ferryboat or bridge going to the far shore
Suppose I collect grass twigs branches and leaves and bind them together into a raft and supported by the raft and making an effort with my hands and feet I got safely across to the far shore
And then the man collected grass twigs branches and leaves and bound them together into a raft and supported by the raft and making an effort with his hands and feet he got safely across to the far shore
Then when he had got across and had arrived at the far shore he might think thusThis raft has been very helpful to me since supported by it and making an effort with my hands and feet I got safely across to the far shore
Suppose I were to hoist it on my head or load it on my shoulder and then go wherever I want
Now bhikkhus what do you think By doing so would that man be doing what should be done with that raft 
No venerable sir
By doing what would that man be doing what should be done with that raft
Here bhikkhus when that man got across and had arrived at the far shore he might think thus This raft has been very helpful to me since supported by it and making an effort with my hands and feet I got safely across to the far shore
Suppose I were to haul it onto the dry land or set it adrift in the water and then go wherever I want
Now bhikkhus it is by so doing that that man would be doing what should be done with that raft
So I have shown you how the Dhamma is similar to a raft being for the purpose of crossing over not for the purpose of grasping
  Bhikkhus there are these six standpoints for views
What are the six
Here bhikkhus an untaught ordinary person who has no regard for noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma regards material form thus This is mine this I am this is my self He regards feeling thus This is mine this I am this is my self He regards perception thus This is mine this I am this is my self He regards formations thus This is mine this I am this is my self He regards what is seen heard sensed cognized encountered sought mentally pondered thus This is mine this I am this is my self And this standpoint for views namely This is self this the world after death I shall be permanent everlasting eternal not subject to change I shall endure as long as eternity  this too he regards thus This is mine this I am this is my self
Bhikkhus a welltaught noble disciple who has regard for noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma regards material form thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self He regards feeling thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self He regards perception thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self He regards formations thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self He regards what is seen heard sensed cognized encountered sought mentally pondered thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self And this standpoint for views namely This is self this the world after death I shall be permanent everlasting eternal not subject to change I shall endure as long as eternity  this too he regards thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
Since he regards them thus he is not agitated about what is nonexistent
  When this was said a certain bhikkhu asked the Blessed One Venerable sir can there be agitation about what is nonexistent externally 
There can be bhikkhu the Blessed One said
Here bhikkhu someone thinks thus Alas I had it Alas I have it no longer Alas may I have it Alas I do not get it
Then he sorrows grieves and laments he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught
That is how there is agitation about what is nonexistent externally
Venerable sir can there be no agitation about what is nonexistent externally 
There can be bhikkhu the Blessed One said
Here bhikkhu someone does not think thus Alas I had it Alas I have it no longer Alas may I have it Alas I do not get it
Then he does not sorrow grieve and lament he does not weep beating his breast and become distraught
That is how there is no agitation about what is nonexistent externally
Venerable sir can there be agitation about what is nonexistent internally
There can be bhikkhu the Blessed One said
Here bhikkhu someone has the view This is self this the world after death I shall be permanent everlasting eternal not subject to change I shall endure as long as eternity
He hears the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata teaching the Dhamma for the elimination of all standpoints decisions obsessions adherences and underlying tendencies for the stilling of all formations for the relinquishing of all attachments for the destruction of craving for dispassion for cessation for Nibbana
He thinks thus So I shall be annihilated So I shall perish So I shall be no more
Then he sorrows grieves and laments he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught
That is how there is agitation about what is nonexistent internally
Venerable sir can there be no agitation about what is nonexistent internally 
There can be bhikkhu the Blessed One said
Here bhikkhu someone does not have the view This is selfI shall endure as long as eternity
He hears the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata teaching the Dhamma for the elimination of all standpoints decisions obsessions adherences and underlying tendencies for the stilling of all formations for the relinquishing of all attachments for the destruction of craving for dispassion for cessation for Nibbana
He does not think thus So I shall be annihilated So I shall perish So I shall be no more
Then he does not sorrow grieve and lament he does not weep beating his breast and become distraught
That is how there is no agitation about what is nonexistent internally
 No venerable sir
 Good bhikkhus
I too do not see any possession that is permanent everlasting eternal not subject to change and that might endure as long as eternity
Bhikkhus you may well cling to that doctrine of self that Would not arouse sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair in one who clings to it
But do you see any such doctrine of self bhikkhus
 No venerable sir
 Good bhikkhus
I too do not see any doctrine of self that would not arouse sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair in one who clings to it
But do you see any such support of views bhikkhus
 No venerable sir
 Good bhikkhus
I too do not see any support of views that would not arouse sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair in one who takes it as a support
Bhikkhus there being a self would there be what belongs to my self 
 Yes venerable sir
 Or there being what belongs to a self would there be my self 
 Yes venerable sir
 Bhikkhus since a self and what belongs to a self are not apprehended as true and established then this standpoint for views namely This is self this the world after death I shall be permanent everlasting eternal not subject to change I shall endure as long as eternity  would it not be an utterly and completely foolish teaching 
What else could it be venerable sir It would be an utterly and completely foolish teaching
Bhikkhus what do you think Is material form permanent or impermanent 
 Impermanent venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness 
 Suffering venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self 
 No venerable sir
Bhikkhus what do you think Is feeling Is perception Are formations Is consciousness permanent or impermanent 
 Impermanent venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness 
 Suffering venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self 
 No venerable sir
Therefore bhikkhus any kind of material form whatever whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near all material form should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
Any kind of feeling whatever Any kind of perception whatever Any kind of formations whatever Any kind of consciousness whatever whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near all consciousness should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
Seeing thus bhikkhus a welltaught noble disciple becomes disenchanted with material form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with formations disenchanted with consciousness  Being disenchanted he becomes dispassionateThrough dispassion his mind is liberated When it is liberated there comes the knowledge It is liberated
He understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being
  Bhikkhus this bhikkhu is called one whose shaft has been lifted whose trench has been filled in whose pillar has been uprooted one who has no bar a noble one whose banner is lowered whose burden is lowered who is unfettered
And how is the bhikkhu one whose shaft has been lifted
Here the bhikkhu has abandoned ignorance has cut it off at the root made it like a palm stump done away with it so that it is no longer subject to future arising
That is how the bhikkhu is one whose shaft has been lifted
And how is the bhikkhu one whose trench has been filled in
Here the bhikkhu has abandoned the round of births that brings renewed being has cut it off at the root so that it is no longer subject to future arising
That is how the bhikkhu is one whose trench has been filled in
And how is the bhikkhu one whose pillar has been uprooted
Here the bhikkhu has abandoned craving has cut it off at the root so that it is no longer subject to future arising
That is how the bhikkhu is one whose pillar has been uprooted
And how is the bhikkhu one who has no bar
Here the bhikkhu has abandoned the five lower fetters has cut them off at the root so that they are no longer subject to future arising
That is how the bhikkhu is one who has no bar
And how is the bhikkhu a noble one whose banner is lowered whose burden is lowered who is unfettered
Here a bhikkhu has abandoned the conceit I am has cut it off at the root so that it is no longer subject to future arising
That is how the bhikkhu is a noble one whose banner is lowered whose burden is lowered who is unfettered
Bhikkhus when the gods with Indra with Brahma and with Pajapati seek a bhikkhu who is thus liberated in mind they do not find anything of which they could say The consciousness of one thus gone is supported by this
Why is that
  So saying bhikkhus so proclaiming I have been baselessly vainly falsely and wrongly misrepresented by some recluses and brahmins thus The recluse Gotama is one who leads astray he teaches the annihilation the destruction the extermination of an existing being
As I am not as I do not proclaim so have I been baselessly vainly falsely and wrongly misrepresented by some recluses and brahmins thus The recluse Gotama is one who leads astray he teaches the annihilation the destruction the extermination of an existing being
If others abuse revile scold and harass the Tathagata for that the Tathagata on that account feels no annoyance bitterness or dejection of the heart
And if others honour respect revere and venerate the Tathagata for that the Tathagata on that account feels no delight joy or elation of the heart
If others honour respect revere and venerate the Tathagata for that the Tathagata on that account thinks thus They perform such services as these for the sake of what had earlier come to be fully understood
Therefore bhikkhus if others abuse revile scold and harass you on that account you should not entertain any annoyance bitterness or dejection of the heart
And if others honour respect revere and venerate you on that account you should not entertain any delight joy or elation of the heart
If others honour respect revere and venerate you on that account you should think thus They perform such services as these for the sake of what had earlier come to be fully understood
  Therefore bhikkhus whatever is not yours abandon it when you have abandoned it that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time
What is it that is not yours
Material form is not yours Abandon it When you have abandoned it that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time
Feeling is not yours Abandon it When you have abandoned it that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time
Perception is not yours Abandon it When you have abandoned it that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time
Formations are not yours Abandon them When you have abandoned them that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time
Consciousness is not yours Abandon itWhen you have abandoned it that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time
Bhikkhus what do you think If people carried off the grass sticks branches and leaves in this Jeta Grove or burned them or did what they liked with them would you think
People are carrying us off or burning us or doing what they like with us 
 No venerable sir
Why not
Because that is neither our self nor what belongs to our self
 So too bhikkhus whatever is not yours abandon it when you have abandoned it that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time
What is it that is not yours
Material form is not yours
Feeling is not yours Perception is not yours Formations are not yours Consciousness is not yours Abandon it When you have abandoned it that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time
  Bhikkhus the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear open evident and free of patchwork
In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus which is clear open evident and free of patchwork there is no future round for manifestation in the case of those bhikkhus who are arahants with taints destroyed who have lived the holy life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached the true goal destroyedthe fetters of being and are completely liberated through final knowledge
Bhikkhus the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear free of patchwork
In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus which is clear free of patchwork those bhikkhus who have abandoned the five lower fetters are all due to reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that world
Bhikkhus the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear free of patchwork
In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus which is clear free of patchwork those bhikkhus who have abandoned the three lower fetters and attenuated lust hate and delusion are all oncereturners returning once to this world to make an end of suffering
Bhikkhus the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear free of patchwork
In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus which is clear free of patchwork those bhikkhus who have abandoned three fetters are all streamenterers no longer subject to perdition bound for deliverance and headed for enlightenment
Bhikkhus the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear free of patchwork
Bhikkhus the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear open evident and free of patchwork
In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus which is clear open evident and free of patchwork those bhikkhus who have sufficient faith in me sufficient love for me are all headed for heaven
That is what the Blessed One said
and after paying homage to him they sat down at one side and told him all that had occurred
adding Venerable sir since we could not detach the bhikkhu Arittha formerly of the vulture killers from this pernicious view we have reported this matter to the Blessed One
for this will lead to this misguided mans harm and suffering for a long time
 Bhikkhus that one can engage in sensual pleasures without sensual desires without perceptions of sensual desire without thoughts of sensual desire  that is impossible
but having learned the Dhamma they do not examine the meaning of those teachings with wisdom
and they do not experience the good for the sake of which they learned the Dhamma
Those teachings being wrongly grasped by them conduce to their harm and suffering for a long time
saw a large snake
and grasped its coils or its tail
It would turn back on him and bite his hand or his arm or one of his limbs
Those teachings being wrongly grasped by them conduce to their harm and suffering for a long time
and they experience the good for the sake of which they learned the Dhamma
Those teachings being rightly grasped by them conduce to their welfare and happiness for a long time
saw a large snake
and caught it rightly with a cleft stick
and having done so grasped it rightly by the neck
and when you do not understand the meaning of my statements then ask either me about it or those bhikkhus who are wise
   Bhikkhus I shall show you how the Dhamma is similar to a raft being for the purpose of crossing over not for the purpose of grasping
Listen and attend closely to what I shall say
Bhikkhus when you know the Dhamma to be similar to a raft you should abandon even good states how much more so bad states
Those teachings being rightly grasped by them conduce to their welfare and happiness for a long time
  Bhikkhus you may well acquire that possession that is permanent everlasting eternal
not subject to change and that might endure as long as eternity But do you see any such possession bhikkhus
Bhikkhus you may well take as a support that view that would not arouse sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair in one who takes it as a support
One thus gone I say is untraceable here and now
Bhikkhus both formerly and now what I teach is suffering and the cessation of suffering
In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus which is clear free of patchwork those bhikkhus who are Dhammafollowers or faithfollowers are all headed for enlightenment
The bhikkhus were satisfiedand delighted in the Blessed Ones words
Friend Arittha is it true that such a pernicious view has arisen in you 
and how they are able to obstruct one who engages in them
for this will lead to your harm and suffering for a long time
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary
Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
and said to the Blessed One  I have had conversations with Master Gotama for a long time
It would be good if Master Gotama would teach me in brief the wholesome and the unwholesome
I can teach you the wholesome and the unwholesome in brief Vaccha and I can teach you the wholesome and the unwholesome at length Still I will teach you the wholesome and the unwholesome in brief
Listen and attend closely to what I shall say
Yes sir he replied
The Blessed One said this
Vaccha greed is unwholesome nongreed is wholesome hate is unwholesome nonhate is wholesome delusion is unwholesome nondelusion is wholesome
In this way threethings are unwholesome and the other three things are wholesome
Killing living beings is unwholesome abstention from killing living beings is wholesome taking what is not given is unwholesome abstention from taking what is not given is wholesome misconduct in sensual pleasures is unwholesome abstention from misconduct in sensual pleasures is wholesome false speech is unwholesome abstention from false speech is wholesome malicious speech is unwholesome abstention from malicious speech is wholesome harsh speech is unwholesome abstention from harsh speech is wholesome gossip is unwholesome abstention from gossip is wholesome covetousness is unwholesome uncovetousness is wholesome ill will is unwholesome nonill will is wholesome wrong view is unwholesome right view is wholesome
In this way ten things are unwholesome and the other ten things are wholesome
When a bhikkhu has abandoned craving cut it off at the root made it like a palm stump done away with it so that it is no longer subject to future arising then that bhikkhu is an arahant with taints destroyed one who has lived the holy life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached the true goal destroyed the fetters of being and is completely liberated through final knowledge
is there any one bhikkhu Master Gotamas disciple who by realising for himself with direct knowledge here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints 
There are not only one hundred Vaccha or two or three or four or five hundred but far more bhikkhus my disciples who by realising for themselves with direct knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints
is there any one bhikkhuni Master Gotamas disciple who by realising for herself with direct knowledge here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints 
There are not only one hundredor five hundred but far more bhikkhunis my disciples who by realising for themselves with direct knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints
is there any one man lay follower Master Gotamas disciple clothed in white leading a life of celibacy who with the destruction of the five lower fetters will reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that world 
There are not only one hundredor five hundred but far more men lay followers my disciples clothed in white leading lives of celibacy who with the destruction of the five lower fetters will reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that world
is there any one man lay follower Master Gotamas disciple clothed in white enjoying sensual pleasures who carries out his instruction responds to his advice has gone beyond doubt become free from perplexity gained intrepidity and become independent of others in the Teachers Dispensation 
There are not only one hundredor five hundred but far more men lay followers my disciples clothed in white enjoying sensual pleasures who carry out my instruction respond to my advice have gone beyond doubt become free from perplexity gained intrepidity and become independent of others in the Teachers Dispensation
is there any one woman lay follower Master Gotamas disciple clothed in white leading a life of celibacy who with the destruction of the five lower fetters will reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that world 
There are not only one hundredor five hundred but far more women lay followers my disciples clothed in white leading lives of celibacy who with the destruction of the five lower fetters will reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that world

There are not only one hundredor five hundred but far more women lay followers my disciples clothed in white enjoying sensual pleasures who carry out my instruction respond to my advice have gone beyond doubt become free of perplexity gained intrepidity and become independent of others in the Teachers Dispensation
Master Gotama if only Master Gotama were accomplished in this Dhamma but no bhikkhus were accomplished then this holy life would be deficient in that respect but because Master Gotama and bhikkhus are accomplished in this Dhamma this holy life is thus complete in that respect
If only Master Gotama and bhikkhus were accomplished in this Dhamma but no bhikkhuils were accomplished then this holy life would be deficient in that respect but because Master Gotama bhikkhus and bhikkhunis are accomplished in this Dhamma this holy life is thus complete in that respect
If only Master Gotama bhikkhus and bhikkhunis were accomplished in this Dhamma but no men lay followers clothed in white leading lives of celibacy were accomplished then this holy life would be deficient in that respect but because Master Gotama bhikkhus and bhikkhunis and men lay followers clothed in white leading lives of celibacy are accomplished in this Dhamma this holy life is thus complete in that respect
If only Master Gotama bhikkhus and bhikkhunis and men lay followers clothed in white leading lives of celibacy were accomplished in this Dhamma but no men lay followers clothed in white enjoying sensual pleasures were accomplished then this holy life would be deficient in that respect but because Master Gotama bhikkhus and bhikkhunis and men lay followers clothed in white both those leading lives of celibacy and those enjoying sensual pleasures are accomplished in this Dhamma this holy life is thus complete in that respect
If only Master Gotama bhikkhus and bhikkhunis and men lay followers clothed in whitewere accomplished in this Dhamma but no women lay followers clothed in white leading lives of celibacy were accomplished then this holy life would be deficient in that respect but because Master Gotama bhikkhus and bhikkhunis men lay followers clothed in whiteand women lay followers clothed in white leading lives of celibacy are accomplished in this Dhamma this holy life is thus complete in that respect
If only Master Gotama bhikkhus and bhikkhunis men lay followers clothed in white
Just as the river Ganges inclines towards the sea slopes towards the sea flows towards the sea and merges with the sea so too Master Gotamas assembly with its homeless ones and its householders inclines towards Nibbana slopes towards Nibbana flows towards Nibbana and merges with Nibbana
Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
I would receive the going forth under Master Gotama I would receive the full admission
Vaccha one who formerly belonged to another sect and desires the going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline lives on probation for four months
At the end of four months if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him they give him the going forth and the full admission to the bhikkhus state But I recognise individual differences in this matter
Venerable sir if those who formerly belonged to another sect and desire the going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline live on probation for four months and if at the end of the four months the bhikkhus being satisfied with them give them the going forth and the full admission to the bhikkhus state then I will live on probation for four years
At the end of the four years if the bhikkhus are satisfied with me let them give me the going forth and the full admission to the bhikkhus state
Then the wanderer Vacchagotta received the going forth under the Blessed One and he received the full admission
Not long after his full admission a halfmonth after his full admission the venerable Vacchagotta went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one side
and told the Blessed One Venerable sir I have attained whatever can be attained by the knowledge of a disciple in higher training by the true knowledge of a disciple in higher training Let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma further
In that case Vaccha develop further two things serenity and insight
When these two things are developed further they will lead to the penetration of many elements
To the extent that you may wish May I wield the various kinds of supernormal power having been one may I become many having been many may I become one may I appear and vanish may I go unhindered through a wall through an enclosure through a mountain as though through space may I dive in and out of the earth as though it were water may I walk on water without sinking as though it were earth seated crosslegged may I travel in space like a bird with my hand may Itouch and stroke the moon and sun so powerful and mighty may I wield bodily mastery even as far as the Brahmaworld  you will attain the ability to witness any aspect therein there being a suitable basis
To the extent that you may wish May I with the divine ear element which is purified and surpasses the human hear both kinds of sounds the divine and the human those that are far as well as near  you will attain the ability to witness any aspect therein there being a suitable basis
To the extent that you may wish May I understand the minds of other beings of other persons having encompassed them with my own mind May I understand a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust may I understand a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate may I understand a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion may I understand a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted may I understand an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted may I understand a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed may I understand a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated may I understand a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated  you will attain the ability to witness any aspect therein there being a suitable basis
To the extent that you may wish May I recollect my manifold past lives that is one birth two birthsThus with their aspects and particulars may I recollect my manifold past lives  you will attain the ability to witness any aspect therein there being a suitable basis
To the extent that you may wish May I with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human see beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunateand may I understand how beings pass on according to their actions  you will attain the ability to witness any aspect therein there being a suitable basis
To the extent that you may wish May I by realising for myself with direct knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints  you will attain the ability to witness any aspect therein there being a suitable basis
Then the venerable Vacchagotta having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones words rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One keeping him on his right he departed
Before long dwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and resolute the venerable Vacchagotta by realising for himself with direct knowledge here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness
He directly knew Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being
And the venerable Vacchagotta became one of the arahants
Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were going to see the Blessed One
The venerable Vacchagotta saw them coming in the distance
Seeing them he went to them and asked them
We are going to see the Blessed One friend
In that case may the venerable ones pay homage in my name with their heads at the Blessed Ones feet saying Venerable sir the bhikkhu Vacchagotta pays homage with his head at the Blessed Ones feet Then say The Blessed One has been worshipped by me the Sublime One has been worshipped by me
Yes friend those bhikkhus replied
Then they went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him they sat down at one side
and told the Blessed One Venerable sir the venerable Vacchagotta pays homage with his head at the Blessed Ones feet and he says The Blessed One has been worshipped by me the Sublime One has been worshipped by me
And deities also told me this The bhikkhu Vacchagotta has attained the threefold true knowledge and has great supernormal power and might
That is what the Blessed One said
Apart from Master Gotama and the bhikkhus
Apart from Master Gotama and the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis
Apart from Master Gotama the bhikkhus and bhikkhunls and the men lay followers clothed in white leading lives of celibacy
Apart from Master Gotama the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis and the men lay followers clothed in white both those leading lives of celibacy and those enjoying sensual pleasures
Apart from Master Gotama the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis and the men lay followers clothed in white both those leading lives of celibacy and those enjoying sensual pleasures and the women lay followers clothed in white leading lives of celibacy
and women lay followers clothed in white leading lives of celibacy were accomplished in this Dhamma but no women lay followers clothed in white enjoying sensual pleasures were accomplished then this holy life would be deficient in that respect
but because Master Gotama bhikkhus and bhikkhunis men lay followers clothed in white both those leading lives of celibacy and those enjoying sensual pleasures and women lay followers clothed in white both those leading lives of celibacy and those enjoying sensual pleasures are accomplished in this Dhamma this holy life is thus complete in that respect
Where are the venerable ones going 
Bhikkhus having encompassed his mind with my own mind I already knew of the bhikkhu Vacchagotta The bhikkhu Vacchagotta has attained the threefold true knowledge and has great supernormal power and might
Those bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
Apart from Master Gotama
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Kasi country together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus  Bhikkhus I abstain from eating at night
By so doing I am free from illness and affliction and I enjoy health strength and a comfortable abiding
Come bhikkhus abstain from eating at night
By so doing you too will be free from illness and affliction and you will enjoy health strength and a comfortable abiding
Yes venerable sir they replied
Then as the Blessed One was wandering by stages in the Kasi country he eventually arrived at a Kasi town called Kitagiri
There he lived in this Kasi town Kitagiri
By so doing they are free from illness and affliction and they enjoy health strength and a comfortable abiding
Come friends abstain from eating at night
By so doing you too will be free from illness and affliction and you will enjoy health strength and a comfortable abiding
When this was said the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka told those bhikkhus Friends we eat in the evening in the morning and in the day outside the proper time
By so doing we are free from illness and affliction and we enjoy health strength and a comfortable abiding
Why should we abandon a benefit visible here and now to pursue a benefit to be achieved at a future time
We shall eat in the evening in the morning and in the day outside the proper time
Since the bhikkhus were unable to convince the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka they went to the Blessed One
After paying homage to him they sat down at one side and told him all that had occurred
Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus Come bhikkhu tell the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka in my name that the Teacher calls them
Yes venerable sir he replied and he went to the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka and told them The Teacher calls you friends
Yes friend they replied and they went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him sat down at one side
The Blessed One then said Bhikkhus is it true that when a number of bhikkhus went and told you Friends the Blessed One and the Sangha now abstain from eating at night
We shall eat in the evening in the morning and in the day outside the proper time
 Yes venerable sir
Bhikkhus have you known me to teach the Dhamma in such a way as this Whatever this person experiences whether pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase
 No venerable sir
 Yes venerable sir
And if it were unknown by me unseen unfound unrealised uncontacted by wisdom thus Here when someone feels a certain kind of pleasant feeling unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish would it be fitting for me not knowing that to say Abandon such a kind of pleasant feeling
 No venerable sir
But because it is known by me seen found realised contacted by wisdom thus Here when someone feels a certain kind of pleasant feeling unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish that I therefore say Abandon such a kind of pleasant feeling
If it were unknown by me unseen unfound unrealised uncontacted by wisdom thus Here when someone feels another kind of pleasant feeling unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase would it be fitting for me not knowing that to say Enter upon and abide in such a kind of pleasant feeling
 No venerable sir
But because it is known by me seen found realised contacted by wisdom thus Here when someone feels another kind of pleasant feeling unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase that I therefore say Enter upon and abide in such a kind of pleasant feeling
If it were unknown by me
If it were unknown by me
If it were unknown by me
If it were unknown by me
Bhikkhus I do not say of all bhikkhus that they still have work to do with diligence nor do I say of all bhikkhus that they have no more work to do with diligence
I do not say of those bhikkhus who are arahants with taints destroyed who have lived the holy life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached the true goal destroyed the fetters of being and are completely liberated through final knowledge that they still have work to do with diligence
Why is that
They have done their work with diligence
I say of such bhikkhus who are in higher training whose minds have not yet reached the goal and who are still aspiring to the supreme security from bondage that they still have work to do with diligence
Why is that
Because when those venerable ones make use of suitable resting places and associate with good friends and balance their spiritual faculties they may by realising for themselves with direct knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness
Seeing this fruit of diligence for these bhikkhus I say that they still have work to do with diligence
Bhikkhus there are seven kinds of persons to be found existing in the world
They are one liberatedinboth ways one liberatedbywisdom a bodywitness one attainedtoview one liberatedbyfaith a Dhammafollower and a faithfollower
What kind of person is one liberatedinbothways
Here some person contacts with the body and abides in those liberations that are peaceful and immaterial transcending forms and his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdomThis kind of person is called one liberatedinbothways
I do not say of such a bhikkhu that he still has work to do with diligence

Why is that
He has done his work with diligence
What kind of person is a bodywitness
Here some person contacts with the body and abides in those liberations that are peaceful and immaterial transcending forms and some of his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom
I say of such a bhikkhu that he still has work to do with diligence
Why is that
Because when that venerable one makes use of suitable resting places and associates with good friends and balances his spiritual faculties he may by realising for himself with direct knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness
Seeing this fruit of diligence for such a bhikkhu I say that he still has work to do with diligence
What kind of person is one attainedtoview
Here some person does not contact with the body and abide in those liberations that are peaceful and immaterial transcending forms but some of his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom and he has reviewed and examined with wisdom the teachings proclaimed by the Tathagata
I say of such a bhikkhu that he still has work to do with diligence
Why is that
Because when that venerable one into homelessness
Seeing this fruit of diligence for such a bhikkhu I say that he still has work to do with diligence
What kind of person is one liberatedbyfaith
This kind of person is called one liberatedbyfaith
I say of such a bhikkhu that he still has work to do with diligence
Why is that
Because when that venerable one  into homelessness
Seeing this fruit of diligence for such a bhikkhu I say that he still has work to do with diligence
What kind of person is a Dhammafollower
Here some person does not contact with the body and abide in those liberations that are peaceful and immaterial transcending forms and his taints are not yet destroyed by his seeing with wisdom but with wisdom he has sufficiently gained a reflective acceptance of those teachings proclaimed by the Tathagata Furthermore he has these qualities the faith faculty the energy faculty the mindfulness faculty the concentration faculty and the wisdom faculty
I say of such a bhikkhu that he still has work to do with diligence
Why is that
Because when that venerable one into homelessness
Seeing this fruit of diligence for such a bhikkhu I say that he still has work to do with diligence
What kind of person is a faithfollower
Here some person does not contact with the body and abide in those liberations that are peaceful and immaterial transcending forms and his taints are not yet destroyed by his seeing with wisdom yet he has sufficient faith in and love for the Tathagata Furthermore he has these qualities the faith faculty the energy faculty the mindfulness faculty the concentration faculty and the wisdom faculty
This kind of person is called a faithfollower
I say of such a bhikkhu that he still has work to do with diligence
Why is that
Because when that venerable one makes use of suitable resting places and associates with good friends and balances his spiritual faculties he may by realising for himself with direct knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness
Seeing this fruit of diligence for such a bhikkhu I say that he still has work to do with diligence
Bhikkhus there is a fourphrased statement and when it is recited a wise man would quickly understand it
I shall recite it to you bhikkhusTry to understand it
Venerable sir who are we that we should understand the Dhamma
Bhikkhus even with a teacher who is concerned with material things an heir to material things attached to material things such haggling by his disciples would not be proper If we get this we will do it if we dont get this we wont do it so what should be said when the teacher is the Tathagata who isutterly detached from material things
Bhikkhus for a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the Teachers Dispensation it is proper that he conduct himself thus The Blessed One is the Teacher I am a disciple the Blessed One knows I do not know
For a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the Teachers Dispensation the Teachers Dispensation is nourishing and refreshing
For a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the Teachers Dispensation it is proper that he conduct himself thus Willingly let only my skin sinews and bones remain and let the flesh and blood dry up on my body but my energy shall not be relaxed so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength manly energy and manly persistence
For a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the Teachers Dispensation one of two fruits may be expected either final knowledge here and now or if there is a trace of clinging left nonreturn
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
 Now on that occasion the bhikkhus named Assaji and Punabbasuka were residing at Kitagiri
Then a number of bhikkhus went and told them Friends the Blessed One and the Sangha of bhikkhus now abstain from eating at night
Come friends abstain from eating at night 
you told those bhikkhus Friends we eat in the evening
Why should we abandon a benefit visible here and now to pursue a benefit to be achieved at a future time
Bhikkhus have you not known me to teach the Dhamma in such a way as this Here when someone feels a certain kind of pleasant feeling unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish but when someone feels another kind of pleasant feeling unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase Here when someone feels a certain kind of painful feeling unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish but when someone feels another kind of painful feeling unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase Here when someone feels a certain kind of neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish but when someone feels another kind of neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase
 Good bhikkhus
But because it is known by me contacted by wisdom thus Here when someone feels a certain kind of painful feeling unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish that I therefore say Abandon such a kind of painful feeling
But because it is known by mecontacted by wisdom thus Here when someone feels another kind of painful feeling unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase that I therefore say Enter upon and abide in such a kind of painful feeling
But because it is known by mecontacted by wisdom thus Here when someone feels a certain kind of neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish that I therefore say Abandon such a kind of neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
But because it is known by me contacted by wisdom thus Here when someone feels another kind of neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase that I therefore say Enter upon and abide in such a kind of neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
they are no more capable of being negligent
What seven
he is no more capable of being negligent
This kind of person is called one liberatedbywisdom
he is no more capable of being negligent
This kind of person is called a bodywitness
Here some person does not contact with the body and abide in those liberations that are peaceful and immaterial transcending forms but some of his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom and his faith is planted rooted and established in the Tathagata
This kind of person is called a Dhammafollower
Bhikkhus I do not say that final knowledge is achieved all at once On the contrary final knowledge is achieved by gradual training by gradual practice by gradual progress
And how does there come to be gradual training gradual practice gradual progress
Here one who has faith in a teacher visits him when he visits him he pays respect to him when he pays respect to him he gives ear one who gives ear hears the Dhamma having heard the Dhamma he memorises it he examines the meaning of the teachings he has memorised when he examines their meaning he gains a reflective acceptance of those teachings when he has gained a reflective acceptance of those teachings zeal springs up in him when zeal has sprung up he applies his will having applied his will he scrutinises having scrutinised he strives resolutely striving he realises with the body the ultimate truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdom
There has not been that faith bhikkhus and there has not been that visiting and there has not been that paying of respect and there has not been that giving ear and there has not been that hearing of the Dhamma and there has not been that memorising of the Dhamma and there has not been that examination of the meaning and there has not been that reflective acceptance of the teachings and there has not been that zeal and there has not been that application of will and there has not been that scrutiny and there has not been that striving
Bhikkhus you have lost your way bhikkhus you have been practising the wrong way
How far you have strayed misguided men from this Dhamma and Discipline
adding Venerable sir since we were unable to convince the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka we have reported this matter to the Blessed One
This kind of person is called one attainedtoview
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthl in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this  Bhikkhus do you remember the five lower fetters as taught by me 
When this was said the venerable Malunkyaputta replied Venerable sir I remember the five lower fetters as taught by the Blessed One
But Malunkyaputta in what way do you remember the five lower fetters as taught by me 
Venerable sir I remember personality view as a lower fetter taught by the Blessed One I remember doubt as a lower fetter taught by the Blessed One I remember adherence to rules and observances as a lower fetter taught by the Blessed One I remember sensual desire as a lower fetter taught by the Blessed One I remember ill will as a lower fetter taught by the Blessed One
It is in this way venerable sir that I remember the five lower fetters as taught by the Blessed One
Malunkyaputta to whom do you remember my having taught these five lower fetters in that way
Would not the wanderers of other sects confute you with the simile of the infant
For a young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion personality so how could personality view arise in him
A young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion teachings so how could doubt about teachings arise in him
Yet the underlying tendency to doubt lies within him
A young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion rules so how could adherence to rules and observances arise in him
Yet the underlying tendency to adhere to rules and observances lies within him
A young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion sensual pleasures so how could sensual desire arise in him
Yet the underlying tendency to sensual lust lies within him
A young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion beings so how could ill will towards beings arise in him
Yet the underlying tendency to ill will lies within him
Would not the wanderers of other sects confute you with this simile of the infant 
Thereupon the venerable Ananda said It is the time Blessed One it is the time Sublime One for the Blessed One to teach the five lower fetters
Having heard it from the Blessed One the bhikkhus will remember it
Then listen Ananda and attend closely to what I shall say
Yes venerable sir the venerable Ananda replied
The Blessed One said this
Here Ananda an untaught ordinary person who has no regard for noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma abides with a mind obsessed and enslaved by personality view and he does not understand as it actually is the escape from the arisen personality view
He abides with a mind obsessed and enslaved by doubt
He does not abide with a mind obsessed and enslaved by doubt
There is a path Ananda a way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters that anyone without coming to that path to that way shall know or see or abandon the five lower fetters  this is not possible
Just as when there is a great tree standing possessed of heartwood it is not possible that anyone shall cut out its heartwood without cutting through its bark and sapwood so too there is a path this is not possible
There is a path Ananda a way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters that someone by coming to that path to that way shall know and see and abandon the five lower fetters  this is possible
Just as when there is a great tree standing possessed of heartwood it is possible that someone shall cut Out its heartwood by cutting through its bark and sapwood so too there is a path this is possible
Suppose Ananda the river Ganges were full of water right up to the brim so that crows could drink from it
So too when the Dhamma is being taught to someone for the cessation of personality if his mind does not enter into it and acquire confidence steadiness and decision then he can be regarded as like the feeble man
Suppose Ananda the river Ganges were full of water right up to the brim so that crows could drink from it
So too when the Dhamma is being taught to someone for the cessation of personality if his mind enters into it and acquires confidence steadiness and decision then he can be regarded as like the strong man
And what Ananda is the path the way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters
Here with seclusion from objects of attachment with the abandoning of unwholesome states with the complete tranquillization of bodily inertia quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
He turns his mind away from those states
Standing upon that he attains the destruction of the taints But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints then because of that desire for the Dhamma that delight in the Dhamma with the destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes one due to reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that world
This is the path the way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters
Again with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana Again with the fading away as well of rapture a bhikkhuenters upon and abides in the third jhana Again with the abandoning of pleasure and pain a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana which has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
Whatever exists therein of material form feeling perception formations and consciousness he sees those states as impermanent as not self He turns his mind away from those states and directs it towards the deathless element He turns his mind away from those states and directs it towards the deathless element He turns his mind away from those states and directs it towards the deathless element
This is the path the way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters
Again with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact with nonattention to perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite space
Whatever exists therein of feeling perception formations and consciousness he sees those states as impermanent as not self
This is the path the way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters
Again by completely surmounting the base of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousness
Whatever exists therein of feeling perception formations and consciousness he sees those states as impermanent as not self
This is the path the way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters
Again by completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of nothingness
Whatever exists therein of feeling perception formations and consciousness he sees those states as impermanent as suffering as a disease as a tumour as a barb as a calamity as an affliction as alien as disintegrating as void as not self He turns his mind away from those states and directs it towards the deathless element thus This is the peaceful this is the sublime that is the stilling of all formations the relinquishing of all attachments the destruction of craving dispassion cessation Nibbana Standing upon that he attains the destruction of the taints But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints then because of that desire for the Dhamma that delight in the Dhamma with the destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes one due to reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that world
This is the path the way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters
Venerable sir if this is the path the way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters then how is it that some bhikkhus here are said to gain deliverance of mind and some are said to gain deliverance by wisdom 
The difference here Ananda is in their faculties I say
That is what the Blessed One said
Yet the underlying tendency to personality view lies within him
 A welltaught noble disciple who has regard for noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma does not abide with a mind obsessed and enslaved by personality view he understands as it actually is the escape from the arisen personality view
and when that personality view has become habitual and is uneradicated in him it is a lower fetter
by adherence to rules and observances
by sensual lust
by ill will and he does not understand as it actually is the escape from arisen ill will
and when that ill will has become habitual and is uneradicated in him it is a lower fetter
and personality view together with the underlying tendency to it is abandoned in him
by adherence to rules and observances
by sensual lust
by ill will he understands as it actually is the escape from the arisen ill will
and ill will together with the underlying tendency to it is abandoned in him
and then a feeble man came thinking By swimming across the stream with my arms I shall get safely across to the further shore of this river Ganges yet he would not be able to get safely across
and then a strong man came thinking By swimming across the stream with my arms I shall get safely across to the further shore of this river Ganges and he would be able to get safely across
Whatever exists therein of material form feeling perception formations and consciousness he sees those states as impermanent as suffering as a disease as a tumour as a barb as a calamity as an affliction as alien as disintegrating as void as not self
and directs it towards the deathless element thus This is the peaceful this is the sublime that is the stilling of all formations the relinquishing of all attachments the destruction of craving dispassion cessation Nibbana
The venerable Ananda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Vesall in the grove outside the city to the west
 Now on that occasion Sunakkhatta son of the Licchavis had recently left this Dhamma and Discipline
The recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma merely hammered out by reasoning following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him
Then when it was morning the venerable Sariputta dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Vesall for alms
Then he heard Sunakkhatta son of the Licchavis making this statement before the Vesall assembly
The Blessed One said Sariputta the misguided man Sunakkhatta is angry
Thinking to discredit the Tathagata he actually praises him
Sariputta this misguided man Sunakkhatta will never infer of me according to Dhamma That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessed
And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma That Blessed One enjoys the various kinds of supernormal power having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one he appears and vanishes he goes unhindered through a wall through an enclosure through a mountain as though through space he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth seated crosslegged he travels in space like a bird with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty he wields bodily mastery even as far as the Brahmaworld
And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma With the divine ear element which is purified and surpasses the human that Blessed One hears both kinds of sounds the heavenly and the human those that are far as well as near
And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma That Blessed One encompasses with his own mind the minds of other beings other persons He understands a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust he understands a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate he understands a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion he understands a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted he understands an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted he understands a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed he understands a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated he understands a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated
What are the ten
And that is a Tathagatas power that the Tathagata has by virtue of which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma
Again the Tathagata understands as it actually is the results of actions undertaken past future and present with possibilities and with causes
That too is a Tathagatas power
Again the Tathagata understands as it actually is the ways leading to all destinations
That too is a Tathagatas power
Again the Tathagata understands as it actually is the world with its many and different elements
That too is a Tathagatas powerS
Again the Tathagata understands as it actually is how beings have different inclinations
That too is a Tathagatas power
Again the Tathagata understands as it actually is the disposition of the faculties of other beings other persons
That too is a Tathagatas power
Again the Tathagata understands as it actually is the defilement the cleansing and the emergence in regard to the jhanas liberations concentrations and attainments
That too is a Tathagatas power
Again the Tathagata recollects his manifold past lives that is one birth two birthg
That too is a Tathagatas power
That too is a Tathagatas power
Again by realising for himself with direct knowledge the Tathagata here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints
That too is a Tathagatas power that the Tathagata has by virtue of which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma
The Tathagata has these ten Tathagatas powers possessing which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma
Sariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesThe recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma merely hammered out by reasoning following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him  unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as surely as if he had been carried off and put there he will wind up in hell
Just as a bhikkhu possessed of virtue concentration and wisdom would here and now enjoy final knowledge so it will happen in this case 
Sariputta the Tathagata has these four kinds of intrepidity possessing which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma
What are the four
While you claim full enlightenment you are not fully enlightened in regard to certain things
And seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidity
While you claim to have destroyed the taints these taints are undestroyed by you
And seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidity
Those things called obstructions by you are not able to obstruct one who engages in them
And seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidity
When you teach the Dhamma to someone it does not lead him when he practises it to the complete destruction of suffering
And seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidity
A Tathagata has these four kinds of intrepidity possessing which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma
Sariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me
Sariputta there are these eight assemblies
What are the eight
An assembly of nobles an assembly of brahmins an assembly of householders an assembly of recluses an assembly of gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings an assembly of gods of the heaven of the Thirtythree an assembly of Maras retinue an assembly of Brahmas
Possessing these four kinds of intrepidity the Tathagata approaches and enters these eight assemblies
Sariputta there are these four kinds of generation
What are the four
Eggborn generation wombborn generation moistureborn generation and spontaneous generation
What is eggborn generation
There are these beings born by breaking out of the shell of an egg this is called eggborn generation
What is wombborn generation
There are these beings born by breaking out from the caul this is called wombborn generation
What is moistureborn generation
There are these beings born in a rotten fish in a rotten corpse in rotten dough in a cesspit or in a sewer this is called moistureborn generation
What is spontaneous generation
There are gods and denizens of hell and certain human beings and some beings in the lower worlds this is called spontaneous generation
These are the four kinds of generation
Sariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me
Sariputta there are these five destinations
What are the five
I understand hell and the path and way leading to hell And I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell
I understand the animal realm and the path and way leading to the animal realm And I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in the animal realm
I understand the realm of ghosts and the path and way leading to the realm of ghosts And I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in the realm of ghosts
I understand human beings and the path and way leading to the human world And I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear among human beings
I understand the gods and the path and way leading to the world of the gods And I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world
I understand Nibbana and the path and way leading to Nibbana And I also understand how one who has entered this path will by realising for himself with direct knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints
By encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell
And then later on with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human I see that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell and is experiencing extremely painful racking piercing feelings
Suppose there were a charcoal pit deeper than a ans height full of glowing coals without flame or smoke
Then a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that he will come to this same charcoal pit
So too by encompassing mind with mind
By encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in the animal realm
And then later on with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human I see that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in the animal realm and is experiencing extremely painful racking piercing feelings
Suppose there were a cesspit deeper than a mans height full of filth
Then a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behavesthat he will come to this same cesspit
So too by encompassing mind with mind
By encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in the realm of ghosts
And then later on I see that he has reappeared in the realm of ghosts and is experiencing much painful feeling
Suppose there were a tree growing on uneven ground with scanty foliage casting a dappled shadow
and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same tree
Then a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves that he will come to this same tree
So too by encompassing mind with mind
By encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear among human beings
And then later on I see that he has reappeared among human beings and is experiencing much pleasant feeling
Suppose there were a tree growing on even ground with thick foliage casting a deep shade and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather
weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same tree
Then a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves that he will come to this same tree
So too by encompassing mind with mind
By encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world
And then later on I see that he has reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world and is experiencing extremely pleasant feelings
Suppose there were a mansion and it had an upper chamber plastered within and without shut off secured by bars with shuttered windows
Then a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves that he will come to this same mansion
So too by encompassing mind with mind
By encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that by realising for himself with direct knowledge he here and now will enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints
And then later on I see that by realising for himself with direct knowledge he here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind anddeliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints and is experiencing extremely pleasant feelings
Suppose there were a pond with clean agreeable cool water transparent with smooth banks delightful
Then a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves that he will come to this same pond
So too by encompassing mind with mind
These are the five destinations
Sariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones The recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma merely hammered out by reasoning following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him  unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as surely as if he had been carried off and put there he will wind up in hell
Just as a bhikkhu possessed of virtue concentration and wisdom would here and now enjoy final knowledge so it will happen in this case I say that unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as surely as if he had been carried off and put there he will wind up in hell
Sariputta I recall having lived a holy life possessing four factorsI have practised asceticism  the extreme of asceticism I have practised coarseness  the extreme of coarseness I have practised scrupulousness  the extreme of scrupulousness I have practised seclusion  the extreme of seclusion
Such was my asceticism Sariputta that I went naked rejecting conventions licking my hands not coming when asked not stopping when asked I did not accept food brought or food specially made or an invitation to a meal
I kept to one house to one morsel I kept to two houses to two morsels I kept to seven houses to seven morsels I lived on one saucerful a day on two saucerfuls a day on seven saucerfuls a day I took food once a day once every two days once every seven days and so on up to once every fortnight I dwelt pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervals I was an eater of greens or millet or wild rice or hideparings or moss or ricebran or ricescum or sesamum flour or grass or cowdung
I lived on forest roots and fruits I fed on fallen fruits I clothed myself in hemp in hempmixed cloth in shrouds in refuse rags in tree bark in antelope hide in strips of antelope hide in kusagrass fabric in bark fabric in woodshavings fabric in headhair wool in animal wool in owls wings I was one who pulled out hair and beard pursuing the practice of pulling out hair and beard I was one who stood continuously rejecting seats I was one who squatted continuously devoted to maintaining the squatting position I was one who used a mattress of spikes I made a mattress of spikes my bed I dwelt pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times daily including the evening Thus in such a variety of ways I dwelt pursuing the practice of tormenting and mortifying the body
Such was my asceticism
Such was my coarseness Sariputta
It never occurred to me Oh let me rub this dust and dirt off with my hand or let another rub this dust and dirt off with his hand
Such was my coarseness
Such was my scrupulousness Sariputta that I was always mindful in stepping forwards and stepping backwards I was full of pity even for the beings in a drop of water thus Let me not hurt the tiny creatures in the crevices of the ground
Such was my scrupulousness
Such was my seclusion Sariputta that I would plunge into some forest and dwell there
And when I saw a cowherd or a shepherd or someone gathering grass or sticks or a woodsman I would flee from grove to grove from thicket to thicket from hollow to hollow from hillock to hillock
Why was that
So that they should not see me or I see them
Just as a forestbred deer on seeing human beings flees from grove to grove from thicket to thicket from hollow to hollow from hillock to hillock so too when I saw a cowherd or a shepherd
I would go on all fours to the cowpens when the cattle had gone out and the cowherd had left them and I would feed on the dung of the young suckling calves
As long as my own excrement and urine lasted I fed on my own excrement and urine
Such was my great distortion in feeding
I would plunge into some aweinspiring grove and dwell there  a grove so aweinspiring
And there came to me spontaneously this stanza never heard before
Chilled by night and scorched by day Alone in aweinspiring groves
Naked no fire to sit beside The sage yet pursues his quest
I would make my bed in a charnel ground with the bones of the dead for a pillow
And cowherd boys came up and spat on me urinated on me threw dirt at me and poked sticks into my ears
Yet I do not recall that I ever aroused an evil mind of hate against them
Such was my abiding in equanimity
Sariputta there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through food
They say Let us live on kolafruits
Now I recall having eaten a single kolafruit a day
Sariputta you may think that the kolafruit was bigger at that time
Through feeding on a single kolafruit a day my body reached a state of extreme emaciation
Because of eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems
Because of eating so little the projections on my spine stood forth like corded beads
Because of eating so little my ribs jutted out as gaunt as the crazy rafters of an old roofless barn
Because of eating so little the gleam of my eyes sank far down in their sockets looking like a gleam of water that has sunk far down in a deep well
Because of eating so little my scalp shrivelled and withered as a green bitter gourd shrivels and withers in the wind and sun
if I tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands
Sariputta there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through food
They say Let us live on beans Let us live on sesamum Let us live on rice
Now I recall having eaten a single rice grain a day
Sariputta you may think that the rice grain was bigger at that time
Through feeding on a single rice grain a day my body reached a state of extreme emaciation
Because of eating so little
Yet Sariputta by such conduct by such practice by such performance of austerities I did not attain any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones
Why was that
Because I did not attain that noble wisdom which when attained is noble and emancipating and leads the one who practises in accordance with it to the complete destruction of suffering
Sariputta there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through the round of rebirths
There are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through some particular kind of rebirth
But it is impossible to find a kind of rebirth that I have not been reborn in already in this long journey except for the gods of the Pure Abodes
There are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through some particular abode
But it is impossible to find a kind of abode that I have not already dwelt in except for the gods of the Pure Abodes
There are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through sacrifice
But it is impossible to find a kind of sacrifice that has not already been offered up by me in this long journey when I was either a headanointed noble king or a welltodo brahmin
There are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes through fireworship
But it is impossible to find a kind of fire that has not already been worshipped by me in this long journey when I was either a headanointed noble king or a welltodo brahmin
Sariputta there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this As long as this good man is still young a blackhaired young man endowed with the blessing of youth in the prime of life so long is he perfect in his lucid wisdom
But when this good man is old aged burdened with years advanced in life and come to the last stage being eighty ninety or a hundred years old then the lucidity of his wisdom is lost
But it should not be regarded so
I am now old agedburdened with years advanced in life and come to the last stage my years have turned eighty
Now suppose that I had four disciples with a hundred years lifespan perfect in mindfulness retentiveness memory and lucidity of wisdom
Just as a skilled archer trained practised and tested could easily shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palm tree suppose that they were even to that extent perfect in mindfulness retentiveness memory and lucidity of wisdom Suppose that they continuously asked me about the four foundations of mindfulness and that I answered them when asked and that they remembered each answer of mine and never asked a subsidiary question or paused except to eat drink consume food taste urinate defecate and rest in order to remove sleepiness and tiredness
Still the Tathagatas exposition of the Dhamma his explanations of factors of the Dhamma and his replies to questions would not yet come to an end
Sariputta even if you have to carry me about on a bed still there will be no change in the lucidity of the Tathagatas wisdom
Rightly speaking were it to be said of anyone A being not subject to delusion has appeared in the world for the welfare and happiness of many out of compassion for the world for the good welfare and happiness of gods and humans it is of me indeed that rightly speaking this should be said
Then he said to the Blessed One It is wonderful venerable sir it is marvellous
As I listened to this discourse on the Dhamma the hairs of my body stood up
Venerable sir what is the name of this discourse on the Dhamma 
As to that Nagasamala you may remember this discourse on the Dhamma as The Hairraising Discourse
That is what the Blessed One said
and when he teaches the Dhamma to anyone it leads him when he practises it to the complete destruction of suffering
When he had wandered for alms in Vesall and had returned from his almsround after his meal he went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one side
and told the Blessed One what Sunakkhatta was saying
and his words are spoken out of anger
for it is praise of the Tathagata to say of him When he teaches the Dhamma to anyone it leads him when he practises it to the complete destruction of suffering
 Sariputta the Tathagata has these ten Tathagatas powers possessing which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma
Here the Tathagata understands as it actually is the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible
Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives
Again with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human the Tathagata sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate 
I say that unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as surely as if he had been carried off and put there he will wind up in hell
and he understands how beings pass on according to their actions
he will wind up in hell
Sariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me
he will wind up in hell
And seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidity
yet I see no ground for thinking that fear or timidity might come upon me there
I recall having approached many hundred assemblies of nobles many hundred assemblies of brahmins many hundred assemblies of householders many hundred assemblies of recluses many hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings many hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Thirtythree many hundred assemblies of Maras retinue many hundred assemblies of Brahmas
And formerly I had sat with them there and talked with them and held conversations with them
he will wind up in hell
Hell the animal realm the realm of ghosts human beings and gods
and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same charcoal pit
and then later on he sees that he has fallen into that charcoal pit and is experiencing extremely painful racking piercing feelings
piercing feelings 
and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same cesspit
and then later on he sees that he has fallen into that cesspit and is experiencing extremely painful racking piercing feelings
piercing feelings
and then later on he sees that he is sitting or lying in the shade of that tree experiencing much painful feeling
much painful feeling
and then later on he sees that he is sitting or lying in the shade of that tree experiencing much pleasant feeling
much pleasant feeling
and in it there was a couch spread with rugs blankets and sheets with a deerskin coverlet with a canopy as well as crimson pillows for both head and feet
and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same mansion
and then later on he sees that he is sitting or lying in that upper chamber in that mansion experiencing extremely pleasant feelings
extremely pleasant feelings
and nearby a dense wood
and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only towards that same pond
and then later on he sees that he has plunged into the pond bathed drunk and relieved all his distress fatigue and fever and has come out again and is sitting or lying in the wood experiencing extremely pleasant feelings
extremely pleasant feelings
I received nothing from a pot from a bowl across a threshold across a stick across a pestle from two eating together from a pregnant woman from a woman giving suck from a woman lying with a man from where food was advertised to be distributed from where a dog was waiting from where flies were buzzing I accepted no fish or meat I drank no liquor wine or fermented brew
 it never occurred to me thus
Such was my seclusion
that normally it would make a mans hair stand up if he were not free from lust
When those cold wintry nights came during the eightdays interval of frost I would dwell by night in the open and by day in the grove In the last month of the hot season I would dwell by day in the open and by night in the grove
and they eat kolafruits they eat kolafruit powder they drink kolafruit water and they make many kinds of kolafruit concoctions
yet you should not regard it so
the kolafruit was then at most the same size as now
Because of eating so little my backside became like a camels hoof
and they eat rice they eat rice powder they drink rice water and they make many kinds of rice concoctions
yet you should not regard it so
the rice grain was then at most the same size as now
the hair rotted at its roots fell from my body as I rubbed
But it is impossible to find a realm in the round that I have not already passed through in this long journey except for the gods of the Pure Abodes
and had I passed through the round as a god in the Pure Abodes I would never have returned to this world
but meanwhile those four disciples of mine with their hundred years lifespan would have died at the end of those hundred years
Now on that occasion the venerable Nagasamala was standing behind the Blessed One fanning him
He was making this statement before the Vesall assembly The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones
 Here I see no ground on which any recluse or brahmin or god or Mara or Brahma or anyone else at all in the world could in accordance with the Dhamma accuse me thus
 I see no ground on which any recluse or anyone at all could accuse me thus
 I see no ground on which any recluse or anyone at all could accuse me thus
I see no ground on which any recluse or anyone at all could accuse me thus
that just as the bole of a tinduka tree accumulating over the years cakes and flakes off so too dust and dirt accumulating over the years caked off my body and flaked off
Because of eating so little my belly skin adhered to my backbone thus if I touched my belly skin I encountered my backbone and if I touched my backbone I encountered my belly skin
the hair rotted at its roots fell from my body as I rubbed Because of eating so little
The venerable Nagasamala was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
And what are the effluents to be abandoned by seeing
There is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill personwho has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for people of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhammadoesnt discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attention
This being so he doesnt attend to ideas fit for attention and attends to ideas unfit for attention
And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to
Whatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen effluent of sensuality arises in him and the arisen effluent of sensuality increases the unarisen effluent of becoming arises in him and the arisen effluent of becoming increases the unarisen effluent of ignorance arises in him and the arisen effluent of ignorance increases These are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to
And what are the ideas fit for attention that he doesnt attend to
Whatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen effluent of sensuality doesnt arise in him and the arisen effluent of sensuality is abandoned the unarisen effluent of becoming doesnt arise in him and the arisen effluent of becoming is abandoned the unarisen effluent of ignorance doesnt arise in him and the arisen effluent of ignorance is abandoned These are the ideas fit for attention that he doesnt attend to
Through his attending to ideas unfit for attention and through his not attending to ideas fit for attention both unarisen effluents arise in him and arisen effluents increase
This is how he attends inappropriately Was I in the past
Was I not in the past
What was I in the past
How was I in the past
Having been what what was I in the past
Shall I be in the future
Shall I not be in the future
What shall I be in the future
How shall I be in the future
Having been what what shall I be in the future
Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present Am I
Am I not
What am I
How am I
Where has this being come from
Where is it bound
As he attends inappropriately in this way one of six kinds of view arises in him
The view I have a self arises in him as true  established or the view I have no self  or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self  or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive notself  or the view It is precisely by means of notself that I perceive self arises in him as true  established or else he has a view like this This very self of minethe knower that is sensitive here  there to the ripening of good  bad actionsis the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will endure as long as eternity
This is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of views
Bound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging  death from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair He is not freed I tell you from suffering  stress
The wellinstructed disciple of the noble oneswho has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for people of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhammadiscerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attention
This being so he doesnt attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends to ideas fit for attention 
And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he doesnt attend to
Whatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen effluent of sensuality arises in him and the arisen effluent of sensuality increases the unarisen effluent of becoming arises in him and the arisen effluent of becoming increases the unarisen effluent of ignorance arises in him and the arisen effluent of ignorance increases These are the ideas unfit for attention that he doesnt attend to
And what are the ideas fit for attention that he does attend to
Whatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen effluent of sensuality doesnt arise in him and the arisen effluent of sensuality is abandoned the unarisen effluent of becoming doesnt arise in him and the arisen effluent of becoming is abandoned the unarisen effluent of ignorance doesnt arise in him and the arisen effluent of ignorance is abandoned These are the ideas fit for attention that he does attend to
Through his not attending to ideas unfit for attention and through his attending to ideas fit for attention unarisen effluents do not arise in him and arisen effluents are abandoned
He attends appropriately This is stress  This is the origination of stress  This is the cessation of stress  This is the way leading to the cessation of stress
As he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him selfidentification view doubt and grasping at habits  practices
These are called the effluents to be abandoned by seeing
And what are the effluents to be abandoned by restraining
There is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately dwells restrained with the restraint of the eyefaculty
The effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were to dwell unrestrained with the restraint of the eyefaculty do not arise for him when he dwells restrained with the restraint of the eyefaculty
Reflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the earfaculty   Reflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the nosefaculty   Reflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the tonguefaculty   Reflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the bodyfaculty   Reflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the intellectfaculty
The effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were to dwell unrestrained with the restraint of the intellectfaculty do not arise for him when he dwells restrained with the restraint of the intellectfaculty
These are called the effluents to be abandoned by restraining
And what are the effluents to be abandoned by using
There is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately uses the robe simply to counteract cold to counteract heat to counteract the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles simply for the purpose of covering the parts of the body that cause shame
Reflecting appropriately he uses alms food not playfully nor for intoxication nor for putting on bulk nor for beautification but simply for the survival  continuance of this body for ending its afflictions for the support of the holy life thinking Thus will I destroy old feelings and not create new feelings  I will maintain myself be blameless  live in comfort 
Reflecting appropriately he uses lodging simply to counteract cold to counteract heat to counteract the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles simply for protection from the inclemencies of weather and for the enjoyment of seclusion
Reflecting appropriately he uses medicinal requisites that are used for curing the sick simply to counteract any pains of illness that have arisen and for maximum freedom from disease
The effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to use these things do not arise for him when he uses them 
These are called the effluents to be abandoned by using
And what are the effluents to be abandoned by tolerating
There is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately endures He tolerates cold heat hunger  thirst
the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles illspoken unwelcome words  bodily feelings that when they arise are painful racking sharp piercing disagreeable displeasing  menacing to life
The effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to tolerate these things do not arise for him when he tolerates them
These are called the effluents to be abandoned by tolerating
And what are the effluents to be abandoned by avoiding
There is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately avoids a wild elephant a wild horse a wild bull a wild dog a snake a stump a bramble patch a chasm a cliff a cesspool an open sewer
Reflecting appropriately he avoids sitting in the sorts of unsuitable seats wandering to the sorts of unsuitable habitats and associating with the sorts of bad friends that would make his observant companions in the holy life suspect him of evil conduct
The effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to avoid these things do not arise for him when he avoids them
These are called the effluents to be abandoned by avoiding
And what are the effluents to be abandoned by destroying
There is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately doesnt tolerate an arisen thought of sensuality He abandons it destroys it dispels it  wipes it out of existence Reflecting appropriately he doesnt tolerate an arisen thought of ill will Reflecting appropriately he doesnt tolerate an arisen thought of harmfulness Reflecting appropriately he doesnt tolerate arisen evil unskillful qualities He abandons them destroys them dispels them  wipes them out of existence
The effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to destroy these things do not arise for him when he destroys them
These are called the effluents to be abandoned by destroying
And what are the effluents to be abandoned by developing
There is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting go He develops analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening persistence as a factor for awakening rapture as a factor for awakening calm as a factor for awakening concentration as a factor for awakening equanimity as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting go
The effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to develop these qualities do not arise for him when he develops them
These are called the effluents to be abandoned by developing
When a monks effluents that should be abandoned by seeing have been abandoned by seeing his effluents that should be abandoned by restraining have been abandoned by restraining his effluents that should be abandoned by using have been abandoned by using his effluents that should be abandoned by tolerating have been abandoned by tolerating his effluents that should be abandoned by avoiding have been abandoned by avoiding his effluents that should be abandoned by destroying have been abandoned by destroying his effluents that should be abandoned by developing have been abandoned by developing then he is called a monk who dwells restrained with the restraint of all the effluents He has severed craving thrown off the fetters andthrough the right penetration of conceithas made an end of suffering  stress 
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks responded to him
The Blessed One said 
Monks the ending of the effluents is for one who knows  sees I tell you not for one who doesnt know  doesnt see
For one who knows what  sees what
Appropriate attention  inappropriate attention
When a monk attends inappropriately unarisen effluents arise and arisen effluents increase When a monk attends appropriately unarisen effluents do not arise and arisen effluents are abandoned
There are effluents to be abandoned by seeing those to be abandoned by restraining those to be abandoned by using those to be abandoned by tolerating those to be abandoned by avoiding those to be abandoned by destroying and those to be abandoned by developing
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
There the Venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus thus Friends bhikkhus
 Friend they replied
The Venerable Sariputta said this

When a noble disciple has thus understood the taints the origin of the taints the cessation of the taints and the way leading to the cessation of the taints he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust he abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion he extirpates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit I am and by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge he here and now makes an end of suffering In that way too a noble disciple is one of right view whose view is straight who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma
That is what the Venerable Sariputta said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Venerable Sariputtas words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then early in the morning several monks adjusted their lower robes and carrying their bowls  outer robes went into Sāvatthī for alms
The thought occurred to them Its still too early to go into Sāvatthī for alms What if we were to visit the park of the wanderers of other persuasions
So they headed to the park of the wanderers of other persuasions On arrival they exchanged courteous greetings with the wanderers of other persuasions After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they sat to one side
As they were sitting there the wanderers of other persuasions said to them Friends Gotama the contemplative describes the comprehension of sensuality We too describe the comprehension of sensuality He describes the comprehension of forms We too describe the comprehension of forms He describes the comprehension of feelings We too describe the comprehension of feelings So what is the difference what the distinction what the distinguishing factor between him and us in terms of his teaching and ours his message and ours 
The monks neither delighting nor disapproving of the words of the wanderers of other persuasions got up from their seats We will learn the meaning of these words in the Blessed Ones presence 
Then having gone for alms in Sāvatthī after their meal returning from their alms round the monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they told him what had happened
Monks when the wanderers of other persuasions say this they are to be told What friends with regard to sensuality is the allure what the drawback what the escape
What with regard to forms is the allure what the drawback what the escape
What with regard to feelings is the allure what the drawback what the escape
When asked this they will not manage an answer and what is more will get themselves into trouble
Why is that
Because it lies outside their range
Monks in this world with its devas Māras and Brahmās in this people with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  commonfolk I do not see anyone who can satisfy the mind with an answer to these questions aside from a Tathāgata a Tathāgatas disciples or someone who has heard it from them
Now what monks is the allure of sensuality
These five strings of sensuality
Which five
Forms cognizable via the eyeagreeable pleasing charming endearing enticing linked to sensual desire Sounds cognizable via the ear Aromas cognizable via the nose Flavors cognizable via the tongue Tactile sensations cognizable via the bodyagreeable pleasing charming endearing enticing linked to sensual desire
Now whatever pleasure or happiness arises in dependence on these five strands of sensuality that is the allure of sensuality
And what is the drawback of sensuality
There is the case where on account of the occupation by which a clansman makes a livingwhether checking or accounting or calculating or plowing or trading or cattletending or archery or as a kings man or whatever the occupation may behe faces cold he faces heat being harassed by mosquitoes  flies wind  sun  creeping things dying from hunger  thirst Now this drawback in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
If the clansman gains no wealth while thus working  striving  making effort
he sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraught My work is in vain my efforts are fruitless
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
If the clansman gains wealth while thus working  striving  making effort
he experiences pain  distress in protecting it How will neither kings nor thieves make off with my property nor fire burn it nor water sweep it away nor hateful heirs make off with it
And as he thus guards and watches over his property kings or thieves make off with it or fire burns it or water sweeps it away or hateful heirs make off with it
And he sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraught What was mine is no more
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
Again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source sensuality for the cause the reason being simply sensuality that kings quarrel with kings nobles with nobles brahmans with brahmans householders with householders mother with child child with mother father with child child with father brother with brother sister with sister brother with sister sister with brother friend with friend
And then in their quarrels brawls  disputes they attack one another with fists or with clods or with sticks or with knives
so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
Again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that  taking swords  shields and buckling on bows  quivers charge into battle massed in double array while arrows  spears are flying and swords are flashing
and there they are wounded by arrows  spears and their heads are cut off by swords
so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
Again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that  taking swords  shields and buckling on bows  quivers charge slippery bastions while arrows  spears are flying and swords are flashing
and there they are splashed with boiling cow dung and crushed under heavy weights and their heads are cut off by swords
so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
Again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that break into windows seize plunder commit burglary ambush highways commit adultery
and when they are captured kings have them tortured in many ways They flog them with whips beat them with canes beat them with clubs they cut off their hands cut off their feet cut off their hands  feet they cut off their ears cut off their noses cut off their ears  noses they subject them to the porridge pot the polishedshell shave the Rāhus mouth the flaming garland the blazing hand the grassduty  the barkdress  the burning antelope the meat hooks the coingouging the lye pickling the pivot on a stake the rolledup bed they have them splashed with boiling oil devoured by dogs impaled alive on stakes they have their heads cut off with swords
so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
Again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that engage in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct
Having engaged in bodily verbal and mental misconduct theyon the breakup of the body after deathreappear in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress in the future life has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
And what monks is the escape from sensuality
The subduing of desirepassion for sensuality the abandoning of desirepassion for sensuality That is the escape from sensuality
That any contemplatives or brahmans who do not discern as it has come to be the allure of sensuality as allure the drawback of sensuality as drawback the escape from sensuality as escape would themselves comprehend sensuality or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend sensuality That is impossible
But that any contemplatives or brahmans who discern as it has come to be the allure of sensuality as allure the drawback of sensuality as drawback the escape from sensuality as escape would themselves comprehend sensuality or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend sensuality That is possible
Now what monks is the allure of forms
Suppose there were a maiden of the noble caste the brahman caste or the householder class fifteen or sixteen years old neither too tall nor too short neither too thin nor too plump neither too dark nor too pale Is her beauty  charm at that time at its height 
Yes lord 
Whatever pleasure  happiness arise in dependence on that beauty  charm That is the allure of forms
And what is the drawback of form
There is the case where one might see that very same woman at a later time when shes eighty ninety one hundred years old aged roofrafter crooked bentover supported by a cane palsied miserable brokentoothed grayhaired scantyhaired bald wrinkled her body all blotchy
What do you think Has her earlier beauty  charm vanished and the drawback appeared 
Yes lord 
This monks is the drawback of forms
Again one might see that very same woman sick in pain  seriously ill lying soiled with her own urine  excrement lifted up by others laid down by others
What do you think Has her earlier beauty  charm vanished and the drawback appeared 
Yes lord 
This too monks is the drawback of forms
Again one might see that very same woman as a corpse cast away in a charnel groundone day two days three days dead bloated livid  oozing
What do you think Has her earlier beauty  charm vanished and the drawback appeared 
Yes lord 
This too monks is the drawback of forms
Again one might see that very same woman as a corpse cast away in a charnel ground picked at by crows vultures  hawks by dogs hyenas  various other creatures
a skeleton smeared with flesh  blood connected with tendons a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood connected with tendons a skeleton without flesh or blood connected with tendons bones detached from their tendons scattered in all directionshere a hand bone there a foot bone here a shin bone there a thigh bone here a hip bone there a back bone here a rib there a breast bone here a shoulder bone there a neck bone here a jaw bone there a tooth here a skull
the bones whitened somewhat like the color of shellspiled up more than a year old decomposed into a powder
What do you think Has her earlier beauty  charm vanished and the drawback appeared 
Yes lord 
This too monks is the drawback of forms
And what monks is the escape from forms
The subduing of desirepassion for forms the abandoning of desirepassion for forms That is the escape from form
That any contemplatives or brahmans who do not discern as it has come to be the allure of forms as allure the drawback of forms as drawback the escape from forms as escape would themselves comprehend form or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend form That is impossible
But that any contemplatives or brahmans who discern as it has come to be the allure of forms as allure the drawback of forms as drawback the escape from forms as escape would themselves comprehend form or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend form That is possible
Now what monks is the allure of feelings
There is the case where a monkquite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualitiesenters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
At that time he does not intend his own affliction the affliction of others or the affliction of both He feels a feeling totally unafflicted
The unafflicted I tell you is the highest allure of feelings
Again the monk with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations enters  remains in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluationinternal assurance With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body He enters  remains in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding With the abandoning of pleasure  painas with the earlier disappearance of elation  distresshe enters  remains in the fourth jhāna purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain At that time he does not intend his own affliction the affliction of others or the affliction of both He feels a feeling totally unafflicted
The unafflicted I tell you is the highest allure of feelings
And what is the drawback of feelings
The fact that feeling is inconstant stressful subject to change This is the drawback of feelings
And what is the escape from feelings
The subduing of desirepassion for feelings the abandoning of desirepassion for feelings That is the escape from feelings
That any contemplatives or brahmans who do not discern as it has come to be the allure of feelings as allure the drawback of feelings as drawback the escape from feelings as escape would themselves comprehend feeling or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend feeling That is impossible
But that any contemplatives or brahmans who discern as it has come to be the allure of feelings as allure the drawback of feelings as drawback the escape from feelings as escape would themselves comprehend feeling or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend feeling That is possible 
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monastery
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks replied
The Blessed One said
Monks before my selfawakening when I was still just an unawakened Bodhisatta the thought occurred to me Why dont I keep dividing my thinking into two sorts
 So I made thinking imbued with sensuality thinking imbued with ill will  thinking imbued with harmfulness one sort and thinking imbued with renunciation thinking imbued with nonill will  thinking imbued with harmlessness another sort
And as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with sensuality arose in me
I discerned that Thinking imbued with sensuality has arisen in me
and that leads to my own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of both It obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding
As I noticed that it leads to my own affliction it subsided As I noticed that it leads to the affliction of others  to the affliction of both  it obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding it subsided
Whenever thinking imbued with sensuality had arisen I simply abandoned it dispelled it wiped it out of existence
And as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with ill will  harmfulness arose in me
I discerned that Thinking imbued with harmfulness has arisen in me
and that leads to my own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of both It obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding
 As I noticed that it leads to my own affliction it subsided As I noticed that it leads to the affliction of others to the affliction of both it obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding it subsided
Whenever thinking imbued with harmfulness had arisen I simply abandoned it dispelled it wiped it out of existence
Whatever a monk keeps pursuing with his thinking  pondering that becomes the inclination of his awareness
If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with sensuality abandoning thinking imbued with renunciation his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with sensuality
If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with ill will  harmfulness abandoning thinking imbued with harmlessness his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with harmfulness
Just as in the last month of the Rains in the autumn season when the crops are ripening a cowherd would look after his cows
He would tap  poke  check  curb them with a stick on this side  that
Why is that
Because he foresees flogging or imprisonment or a fine or public censure arising from that if he let his cows wander into the crops
In the same way I foresaw in unskillful qualities drawbacks degradation  defilement and I foresaw in skillful qualities rewards related to renunciation  promoting cleansing
And as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with renunciation arose in me
I discerned that Thinking imbued with renunciation has arisen in me
and that leads neither to my own affliction nor to the affliction of others nor to the affliction of both It fosters discernment promotes lack of vexation  leads to Unbinding
If I were to think  ponder in line with that even for a night 
even for a day 
even for a day  night I do not envision any danger that would come from it
except that thinking  pondering a long time would tire the body
When the body is tired the mind is disturbed
and a disturbed mind is far from concentration
 So I steadied my mind right within settled unified  concentrated it
Why is that
So that my mind would not be disturbed
And as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with nonill will harmlessness arose in me
I discerned that Thinking imbued with harmlessness has arisen in me
and that leads neither to my own affliction nor to the affliction of others nor to the affliction of both It fosters discernment promotes lack of vexation  leads to Unbinding
If I were to think  ponder in line with that even for a night
 even for a day 
even for a day  night I do not envision any danger that would come from it
except that thinking  pondering a long time would tire the body
When the body is tired the mind is disturbed
and a disturbed mind is far from concentration
 So I steadied my mind right within settled unified  concentrated it
Why is that
So that my mind would not be disturbed
Whatever a monk keeps pursuing with his thinking  pondering that becomes the inclination of his awareness
If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with renunciation abandoning thinking imbued with sensuality his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with renunciation
If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with nonill will harmlessness abandoning thinking imbued with harmfulness his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with harmlessness
Just as in the last month of the hot season when all the crops have been gathered into the village a cowherd would look after his cows While resting under the shade of a tree or out in the open he simply keeps himself mindful of those cows
 In the same way I simply kept myself mindful of those mental qualities
 Unflagging persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established My body was calm  unaroused my mind concentrated  single
Quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations I entered  remained in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture I remained in equanimity mindful  alert and physically sensitive of pleasure I entered  remained in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding
 With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  I entered  remained in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past lives
I recollected my manifold past lives
ie  one birth two  five ten   Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes  details
This was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the night Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away  reappearance of beings
I saw  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing  These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  I saw beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma
This was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the night Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations
I discerned as it had come to be that This is stress  This is the origination of stress  This is the cessation of stress  This is the way leading to the cessation of stress 
These are fermentations  This is the origination of fermentations  This is the cessation of fermentations  This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations
 My heart thus knowing thus seeing was released from the fermentation of sensuality released from the fermentation of becoming released from the fermentation of ignorance With release there was the knowledge Released  I discerned that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for this world
 This was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the night Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
Suppose monks that in a forested wilderness there were a large lowlying marsh
in dependence on which there lived a large herd of deer
and a certain man were to appear not desiring their benefit not desiring their welfare not desiring their rest from bondage
He would close off the safe restful path that led to their rapture and would open up a false path set out a male decoy place a female decoy
and thus the large herd of deer would eventually fall into ruin disaster  decimation
Then suppose that a certain man were to appear to that same large herd of deer desiring their benefit desiring their welfare desiring their rest from bondage
He would open up the safe restful path that led to their rapture would close off the false path take away the male decoy destroy the female decoy
and thus the large herd of deer would eventually come into growth increase  abundance
I have given this simile in order to convey a meaning
The meaning is this The large lowlying marsh stands for sensuality
The large herd of deer stands for beings
The man not desiring their benefit not desiring their welfare not desiring their rest from bondage stands for Mara the Evil One
The false path stands for the eightfold wrong path i e  wrong view wrong resolve wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness  wrong concentration
The male decoy stands for passion  delight
The female decoy stands for ignorance
The man desiring their benefit desiring their welfare desiring their rest from bondage stands for the Tathagata the Worthy One the Rightly Selfawakened One
The safe restful path that led to their rapture stands for the noble eightfold path i e  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness  right concentration
So monks I have opened up the safe restful path closed off the false path removed the male decoy destroyed the female
Whatever a teacher should do  seeking the welfare of his disciples out of sympathy for them  that have I done for you
Over there are the roots of trees over there empty dwellings Practice jhana monks Dont be heedless Dont later fall into regret
This is our message to you
 That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monastery
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks replied
The Blessed One said
When a monk is intent on the heightened mind there are five themes he should attend to at the appropriate times
Which five
There is the case where evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  arise in a monk while he is referring to and attending to a particular theme
He should attend to another theme apart from that one connected with what is skillful When he is attending to this other theme apart from that one connected with what is skillful then those evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
Just as a skilled carpenter or his apprentice would use a small peg to knock out drive out and pull out a large one in the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  arise in a monk while he is referring to and attending to a particular theme he should attend to another theme apart from that one connected with what is skillful
When he is attending to this other theme apart from that one connected with what is skillful then those evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
If evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to this other theme connected with what is skillful he should scrutinize the drawbacks of those thoughts Truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful these thoughts of mine are blameworthy these thoughts of mine result in stress
 As he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
Just as a young woman  or man  fond of adornment would be horrified humiliated and disgusted if the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human being were hung from her neck in the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to this other theme connected with what is skillful he should scrutinize the drawbacks of those thoughts Truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful these thoughts of mine are blameworthy these thoughts of mine result in stress
 As he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
If evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts he should pay no mind and pay no attention to those thoughts
As he is paying no mind and paying no attention to them those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
Just as a man with good eyes not wanting to see forms that had come into range would close his eyes or look away
in the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts he should pay no mind and pay no attention to those thoughts As he is paying no mind and paying no attention to them those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
If evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is paying no mind and paying no attention to those thoughts he should attend to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts
As he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
Just as the thought would occur to a man walking quickly
Why am I walking quickly
Why dont I walk slowly
 So he walks slowly
The thought occurs to him Why am I walking slowly
Why dont I stand
 So he stands
The thought occurs to him Why am I standing
Why dont I sit down
 So he sits down
The thought occurs to him Why am I sitting
Why dont I lie down
 So he lies down
In this way giving up the grosser posture he takes up the more refined one
In the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is paying no mind and paying no attention to those thoughts he should attend to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts As he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
If evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts
then  with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he should beat down constrain and crush his mind with his awareness
As  with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he is beating down constraining and crushing his mind with his awareness those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
Just as a strong man seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the shoulders would beat him down constrain and crush him in the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts
then  with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he should beat down constrain and crush his mind with his awareness
As  with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he is beating down constraining and crushing his mind with his awareness those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
Now when a monk  attending to another theme
scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts
paying no mind and paying no attention to those thoughts
attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts
beating down constraining and crushing his mind with his awareness
 steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
He is then called a monk with mastery over the ways of thought sequences
He thinks whatever thought he wants to and doesnt think whatever thought he doesnt
He has severed craving thrown off the fetters and  through the right penetration of conceit  has made an end of suffering and stress
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones words
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Park
Then when it was morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Sāvatthī for alms
Then a number of bhikkhus went to the venerable nanda and said to him Friend nanda it is long since we heard a talk on the Dhamma from the Blessed Ones own lips
It would be good if we could get to hear such a talk friend nanda
Then let the venerable ones go to the brahmin Rammakas hermitage Perhaps you will get to hear a talk on the Dhamma from the Blessed Ones own lips
Yes friend they replied
Then when the Blessed One had wandered for alms in Sāvatthī and had returned from his almsround after his meal he addressed the venerable nanda nanda let us go to the Eastern Park to the Palace of Migāras Mother for the days abiding
Yes venerable sir the venerable nanda replied
Then the Blessed One went with the venerable nanda to the Eastern Park the Palace of Migāras Mother for the days abiding
Then when it was evening the Blessed One rose from meditation and addressed the venerable nanda nanda let us go to the Eastern Bathing Place to bathe
Yes venerable sir the venerable nanda replied
Then the Blessed One went with the venerable nanda to the Eastern Bathing Place to bathe
When he was finished he came up out of the water and stood in one robe drying his limbs
Then the venerable nanda said to the Blessed One Venerable sir the brahmin Rammakas hermitage is nearby
That hermitage is agreeable and delightful
Venerable sir it would be good if the Blessed One went there out of compassion
The Blessed One consented in silence
Then the Blessed One went to the brahmin Rammakas hermitage
Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were sitting together in the hermitage discussing the Dhamma
The Blessed One stood outside the door waiting for their discussion to end
When he knew that it was over he coughed and knocked
and the bhikkhus opened the door for him
The Blessed One entered sat down on a seat made ready
and addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus for what discussion are you sitting together here now
And what was your discussion that was interrupted
Venerable sir our discussion on the Dhamma that was interrupted was about the Blessed One himself Then the Blessed One arrived
Good bhikkhus
It is fitting for you clansmen who have gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness to sit together to discuss the Dhamma
When you gather together bhikkhus you should do either of two things hold discussion on the Dhamma or maintain noble silence
Bhikkhus there are these two kinds of search the noble search and the ignoble search
And what is the ignoble search
Here someone being himself subject to birth seeks what is also subject to birth being himself subject to ageing he seeks what is also subject to ageing being himself subject to sickness he seeks what is also subject to sickness being himself subject to death he seeks what is also subject to death being himself subject to sorrow he seeks what is also subject to sorrow being himself subject to defilement he seeks what is also subject to defilement
And what may be said to be subject to birth
Wife and children are subject to birth men and women slaves goats and sheep fowl and pigs elephants cattle horses and mares gold and silver are subject to birth
These acquisitions are subject to birth
and one who is tied to these things infatuated with them and utterly committed to them being himself subject to birth seeks what it also subject to birth
And what may be said to be subject to ageing
Wife and children are subject to ageing men and women slaves goats and sheep fowl and pigs elephants cattle horses and mares gold and silver are subject to ageing
These acquistions are subject to ageing
and one who is tied to these things infatuated with them and utterly committed to them being himself subject to ageing seeks what is also subject to ageing
And what may be said to be subject to sickness
Wife and children are subject to sickness men and women slaves goats and sheep fowl and pigs elephants cattle horses and mares are subject to sickness
These acquisitions are subject to sickness
and one who is tied to these things infatuated with them and utterly committed to them being himself subject to sickness seeks what is also subject to sickness
And what may be said to be subject to death
Wife and children are subject to death men and women slaves goats and sheep fowl and pigs elephants cattle horses and mares are subject to death
These acquisitions are subject to death
and one who is tied to these things infatuated with them and utterly committed to them being himself subject to death seeks what is also subject to death
And what may be said to be subject to sorrow
Wife and children are subject to sorrow men and women slaves goats and sheep fowl and pigs elephants cattle horses and mares are subject to sorrow
These acquisitions are subject to sorrow
and one who is tied to these things infatuated with them and utterly committed to them being himself subject to sorrow seeks what is also subject to sorrow
And what may be said to be subject to defilement
Wife and children are subject to defilement men and women slaves goats and sheep fowl and pigs elephants cattle horses and mares gold and silver are subject to defilement
These acquisitions are subject to defilement
and one who is tied to these things infatuated with them and utterly committed to them being himself subject to defilement seeks what is also subject to defilement
This is the ignoble search
And what is the noble search
Here someone being himself subject to birth having understood the danger in what is subject to birth seeks the unborn supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being himself subject to ageing having understood the danger in what is subject to ageing he seeks the unageing supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being himself subject to sickness having understood the danger in what is subject to sickness he seeks the unailing supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being himself subject to death having understood the danger in what is subject to death he seeks the deathless supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being himself subject to sorrow having understood the danger in what is subject to sorrow he seeks the sorrowless supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being himself subject to defilement having understood the danger in what is subject to defilement he seeks the undefiled supreme security from bondage Nibbāna
This is the noble search
Bhikkhus before my enlightenment while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisatta I too being myself subject to birth sought what was also subject to birth being myself subject to ageing sickness death sorrow and defilement I sought what was also subject to ageing sickness death sorrow and defilement
Then I considered thus Why being myself subject to birth do I seek what is also subject to birth Why being myself subject to ageing sickness death sorrow and defilement do I seek what is also subject to ageing sickness death sorrow and defilement
Suppose that being myself subject to birth having understood the danger in what is subject to birth I seek the unborn supreme security from bondage Nibbāna Suppose that being myself subject to ageing sickness death sorrow and defilement having understood the danger in what is subject to ageing sickness death sorrow and defilement I seek the unageing unailing deathless sorrowless and undefiled supreme security from bondage Nibbāna 
Later while still young a blackhaired young man endowed with the blessing of youth in the prime of life though my mother and father wished otherwise and wept with tearful faces I shaved off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness
Having gone forth bhikkhus in search of what is wholesome seeking the supreme state of sublime peace I went to ḷāra Kālāma
and said to him Friend Kālāma I want to lead the holy life in this Dhamma and Discipline
 ḷāra Kālāma replied The venerable one may stay here This Dhamma is such that a wise man can soon enter upon and abide in it realising for himself through direct knowledge his own teachers doctrine
I soon quickly learned that Dhamma
As far as mere lipreciting and rehearsal of his teaching went I could speak with knowledge and assurance and I claimed I know and seeand there were others who did likewise
I considered It is not through mere faith alone that ḷāra Kālāma declares By realising for myself with direct knowledge I enter upon and abide in this Dhamma  Certainly ḷāra Kālāma abides knowing and seeing this Dhamma
Then I went to ḷāra Kālāma and asked him Friend Kālāma in what way do you declare that by realising for yourself with direct knowledge you enter upon and abide in this Dhamma
In reply he declared the base of nothingness
I considered Not only ḷāra Kālāma has faith energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom I too have faith energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom
Suppose I endeavour to realise the Dhamma that ḷāra Kālāma declares he enters upon and abides in by realising for himself with direct knowledge 
I soon quickly entered upon and abided in that Dhamma by realising for myself with direct knowledge
Then I went to ḷāra Kālāma and asked him
Friend Kālāma is it in this way that you declare that you enter upon and abide in this Dhamma by realising for yourself with direct knowledge
That is the way friend
It is in this way friend that I also enter upon and abide in this Dhamma by realising for myself with direct knowledge
It is a gain for us friend it is a great gain for us that we have such a venerable one for our companion in the holy life
So the Dhamma that I declare I enter upon and abide in by realising for myself with direct knowledge is the Dhamma that you enter upon and abide in by realising for yourself with direct knowledge
And the Dhamma that you enter upon and abide in by realising for yourself with direct knowledge is the Dhamma that I declare I enter upon and abide in by realising for myself with direct knowledge
So you know the Dhamma that I know and I know the Dhamma that you know
As I am so are you as you are so am I
Come friend let us now lead this community together 
Thus ḷāra Kālāma my teacher placed me his pupil on an equal footing with himself and awarded me the highest honour
But it occurred to me This Dhamma does not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbāna but only to reappearance in the base of nothingness
Not being satisfied with that Dhamma disappointed with it I left 
Still in search bhikkhus of what is wholesome seeking the supreme state of sublime peace I went to Uddaka Rāmaputta and said to him Friend I want to lead the holy life in this Dhamma and Discipline
Uddaka Rāmaputta replied The venerable one may stay here This Dhamma is such that a wise man can soon enter upon and abide in it himself realising through direct knowledge his own teachers doctrine
I soon quickly learned that Dhamma
As far as mere lipreciting and rehearsal of his teaching went I could speak with knowledge and assurance and I claimed I know and seeand there were others who did likewise
I considered It was not through mere faith alone that Rāma declared By realising for myself with direct knowledge I enter upon and abide in this Dhamma  Certainly Rāma abided knowing and seeing this Dhamma
Then I went to Uddaka Rāmaputta and asked him Friend in what way did Rāma declare that by realising for himself with direct knowledge he entered upon and abided in this Dhamma
In reply Uddaka Rāmaputta declared the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception
I considered Not only Rāma had faith energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom I too have faith energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom
Suppose I endeavour to realise the Dhamma that Rāma declared he entered upon and abided in by realising for himself with direct knowledge 
I soon quickly entered upon and abided in that Dhamma by realising for myself with direct knowledge
Then I went to Uddaka Rāmaputta and asked him
Friend was it in this way that Rāma declared that he entered upon and abided in this Dhamma by realising for himself with direct knowledge
That is the way friend
It is in this way friend that I also enter upon and abide in this Dhamma by realising for myself with direct knowledge
It is a gain for us friend it is a great gain for us that we have such a venerable one for our companion in the holy life
So the Dhamma that Rāma declared he entered upon and abided in by realising for himself with direct knowledge is the Dhamma that you enter upon and abide in by realising for yourself with direct knowledge
And the Dhamma that you enter upon and abide in by realising for yourself with direct knowledge is the Dhamma that Rāma declared he entered upon and abided in by realising for himself with direct knowledge
So you know the Dhamma that Rāma knew and Rāma knew the Dhamma that you know
As Rāma was so are you as you are so was Rāma
Come friend now lead this community 
Thus Uddaka Rāmaputta my companion in the holy life placed me in the position of a teacher and accorded me the highest honour
But it occurred to me This Dhamma does not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbāna but only to reappearance in the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception
 Not being satisfied with that Dhamma disappointed with it I left
Still in search bhikkhus of what is wholesome seeking the supreme state of sublime peace I wandered by stages through the Magadhan country until eventually I arrived at Uruvelā at Senānigama
There I saw an agreeable piece of ground a delightful grove with a clearflowing river with pleasant smooth banks and nearby a village for alms resort
I considered This is an agreeable piece of ground this is a delightful grove with a clearflowing river with pleasant smooth banks and nearby a village for alms resort
This will serve for the striving of a clansman intent on striving
And I sat down there thinking This will serve for striving 
Then bhikkhus being myself subject to birth having understood the danger in what is subject to birth seeking the unborn supreme security from bondage Nibbāna I attained the unborn supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being myself subject to ageing having understood the danger in what is subject to ageing seeking the unageing supreme security from bondage Nibbāna I attained the unageing supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being myself subject to sickness having understood the danger in what is subject to sickness seeking the unailing supreme security from bondage Nibbāna I attained the unailing supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being myself subject to death having understood the danger in what is subject to death seeking the deathless supreme security from bondage Nibbāna I attained the deathless supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being myself subject to sorrow having understood the danger in what is subject to sorrow seeking the sorrowless supreme security from bondage Nibbāna I attained the sorrowless supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being myself subject to defilement having understood the danger in what is subject to defilement seeking the undefiled supreme security from bondage Nibbāna I attained the undefiled supreme security from bondage Nibbāna
The knowledge and vision arose in me My deliverance is unshakeable this is my last birth now there is no renewal of being 
I considered This Dhamma that I have attained is profound hard to see and hard to understand peaceful and sublime unattainable by mere reasoning subtle to be experienced by the wise
But this generation delights in attachment takes delight in attachment rejoices in attachment
It is hard for such a generation to see this truth namely specific conditionality dependent origination
And it is hard to see this truth namely the stilling of all formations the relinquishing of all acquisitions the destruction of craving dispassion cessation Nibbāna
If I were to teach the Dhamma others would not understand me and that would be wearying and troublesome for me
Thereupon there came to me spontaneously these stanzas never heard before
Enough with teaching the Dhamma That even I found hard to reach
For it will never be perceived By those who live in lust and hate
Which goes against the worldly stream Subtle deep and difficult to see
Those dyed in lust wrapped in darkness Will never discern this abstruse Dhamma
Considering thus my mind inclined to inaction rather than to teaching the Dhamma
Then bhikkhus the Brahmā Sahampati knew with his mind the thought in my mind and he considered The world will be lost the world will perish since the mind of the Tathāgata accomplished and fully enlightened inclines to inaction rather than to teaching the Dhamma
Then just as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm the Brahmā Sahampati vanished in the Brahmaworld and appeared before me
He arranged his upper robe on one shoulder and extending his hands in reverential salutation towards me said Venerable sir let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma let the Sublime One teach the Dhamma
There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are wasting through not hearing the Dhamma
There will be those who will understand the Dhamma
The Brahmā Sahampati spoke thus
and then he said further
In Magadha there have appeared till now
Impure teachings devised by those still stained
Open the doors to the Deathless
Let them hear The Dhamma that the Stainless One has found
Just as one who stands on a mountain peak
Can see below the people all around
So O Wise One Allseeing Sage
Ascend the palace of the Dhamma
Let the Sorrowless One this human breed Engulfed in sorrow
survey overcome by birth and old age
Arise victorious hero
caravan leader Debtless one and wander in the world
Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma
There will be those who will understand 
Then I listened to the Brahmās pleading and out of compassion for beings I surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha
Surveying the world with the eye of a Buddha I saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in their eyes with keen faculties and with dull faculties with good qualities and with bad qualities easy to teach and hard to teach and some who dwelt seeing fear and blame in the other world
Just as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses some lotuses that are born and grow in the water thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it and some other lotuses that are born and grow in the water rest on the waters surface and some other lotuses that are born and grow in the water rise out of the water and stand clear unwetted by it so too surveying the world with the eye of a Buddha I saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in their eyes with keen faculties and with dull faculties with good qualities and with bad qualities easy to teach and hard to teach and some who dwelt seeing fear and blame in the other world
Then I replied to the Brahmā Sahampati in stanzas
Open for them are the doors to the Deathless
Let those with ears now show their faith
Thinking it would be troublesome I did not speak
the Dhamma subtle and sublime O Brahmā 
Then the Brahmā Sahampati thought The Blessed One has consented to my request that he teach the Dhamma  And after paying homage to me keeping me on the right he thereupon departed at once
I considered thus To whom should I first teach the Dhamma Who will understand this Dhamma quickly
 It then occurred to me ḷāra Kālāma is wise intelligent and discerning he has long had little dust in his eyes
Suppose I taught the Dhamma first to ḷāra Kālāma
He will understand it quickly
Then deities approached me and said Venerable sir ḷāra Kālāma died seven days ago
And the knowledge and vision arose in me ḷāra Kālāma died seven days ago
I thought ḷāra Kālāmas loss is a great one
If he had heard this Dhamma he would have understood it quickly 
I considered thus To whom should I first teach the Dhamma Who will understand this Dhamma quickly
It then occurred to me Uddaka Rāmaputta is wise intelligent and discerning he has long had little dust in his eyes
Suppose I taught the Dhamma first to Uddaka Rāmaputta
He will understand it quickly
Then deities approached me and said Venerable sir Uddaka Rāmaputta died last night
And the knowledge and vision arose in me Uddaka Rāmaputta died last night
I thought Uddaka Rāmaputtas loss is a great one
If he had heard this Dhamma he would have understood it quickly 
I considered thus To whom should I first teach the Dhamma Who will understand this Dhamma quickly
It then occurred to me The bhikkhus of the group of five who attended upon me while I was engaged in my striving were very helpful
Suppose I taught the Dhamma first to them
Then I thought Where are the bhikkhus of the group of five now living
And with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human I saw that they were living at Benares in the Deer Park at Isipatana
Then bhikkhus when I had stayed at Uruvelā as long as I chose I set out to wander by stages to Benares
Between Gayā and the Place of Enlightenment the jīvaka Upaka saw me on the road
and said Friend your faculties are clear the colour of your skin is pure and bright
Under whom have you gone forth friend Who is your teacher Whose Dhamma do you profess
 I replied to the jīvaka Upaka in stanzas
I am one who has transcended all a knower of all Unsullied among all things
renouncing all By cravings ceasing freed Having known this all For myself to whom should I point as teacher
I have no teacher and one like me Exists nowhere
in all the world With all its gods because I have No person for my counterpart
I am the Accomplished One in the world I am the Teacher Supreme
I alone am a Fully Enlightened One Whose fires are quenched and extinguished
I go now to the city of Kāsi To set in motion the Wheel of Dhamma
In a world that has become blind I go to beat the drum of the Deathless 
By your claims friend you ought to be the Universal Victor 
The victors are those like me Who have won to destruction of taints
I have vanquished all evil states Therefore Upaka I am a victor 
When this was said the jīvaka Upaka said May it be so friend  Shaking his head he took a bypath and departed
Then bhikkhus wandering by stages I eventually came to Benares to the Deer Park at Isipatana and I approached the bhikkhus of the group of five
The bhikkhus saw me coming in the distance
and they agreed among themselves thus Friends here comes the recluse Gotama who lives luxuriously who gave up his striving and reverted to luxury
We should not pay homage to him or rise up for him or receive his bowl and outer robe
But a seat may be prepared for him If he likes he may sit down
 However as I approached those bhikkhus found themselves unable to keep their pact
One came to meet me and took my bowl and outer robe another prepared a seat and another set out water for my feet
however they addressed me by name and as friend
Thereupon I told them Bhikkhus do not address the Tathāgata by name and as friend
The Tathāgata is an Accomplished One a Fully Enlightened One
Listen bhikkhus the Deathless has been attained I shall instruct you I shall teach you the Dhamma
Practising as you are instructed by realising for yourselves here and now through direct knowledge you will soon enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness 
When this was said the bhikkhus of the group of five answered me thus Friend Gotama by the conduct the practice and the performance of austerities that you undertook you did not achieve any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones Since you now live luxuriously having given up your striving and reverted to luxury how will you have achieved any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones
 When this was said I told them The Tathāgata does not live luxuriously nor has he given up his striving and reverted to luxury
The Tathāgata is an Accomplished One a Fully Enlightened One
Listen bhikkhus the Deathless has been attained
from the home life into homelessness
A second time the bhikkhus of the group of five said to me Friend Gotamahow will you have achieved any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones
A second time I told them The Tathāgata does not live luxuriouslyfrom the home life into homelessness
A third time the bhikkhus of the group of five said to me Friend Gotamahow will you have achieved any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones 
When this was said I asked them Bhikkhus have you ever known me to speak like this before
No venerable sir
Bhikkhus the Tathāgata is an Accomplished One a Fully Enlightened One
Listen bhikkhus the Deathless has been attained I shall instruct you I shall teach you the Dhamma
Practising as you are instructed by realising for yourselves here and now through direct knowledge you will soon enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness 
I was able to convince the bhikkhus of the group of five
Then I sometimes instructed two bhikkhus while the other three went for alms
and the six of us lived on what those three bhikkhus brought back from their almsround
Sometimes I instructed three bhikkhus while the other two went for alms
and the six of us lived on what those two bhikkhus brought back from their almsround
Then the bhikkhus of the group of five thus taught and instructed by me being themselves subject to birth having understood the danger in what is subject to birth seeking the unborn supreme security from bondage Nibbāna attained the unborn supreme security from bondage Nibbāna being themselves subject to ageing sickness death sorrow and defilement having understood the danger in what is subject to ageing sickness death sorrow and defilement seeking the unageing unailing deathless sorrowless and undefiled supreme security from bondage Nibbāna they attained the unageing unailing deathless sorrowless and undefiled supreme security from bondage Nibbāna
The knowledge and vision arose in them Our deliverance is unshakeable this is our last birth there is no renewal of being 
Bhikkhus there are these five cords of sensual pleasure
What are the five
Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust Sounds cognizable by the earOdours cognizable by the noseFlavours cognizable by the tongueTangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust
These are the five cords of sensual pleasure
As to those recluses and brahmins who are tied to these five cords of sensual pleasure infatuated with them and utterly committed to them and who use them without seeing the danger in them or understanding the escape from them it may be understood of them They have met with calamity met with disaster the Evil One may do with them as he likes
 Suppose a forest deer who was bound lay down on a heap of snares
it might be understood of him He has met with calamity met with disaster the hunter can do with him as he likes
and when the hunter comes he cannot go where he wants
 So too as to those recluses and brahmins who are tied to these five cords of sensual pleasureit may be understood of them They have met with calamity met with disaster the Evil One may do with them as he likes
As to those recluses and brahmins who are not tied to these five cords of sensual pleasure who are not infatuated with them or utterly committed to them and who use them seeing the danger in them and understanding the escape from them it may be understood of them They have not met with calamity not met with disaster the Evil One cannot do with them as he likes
 Suppose a forest deer who was unbound lay down on a heap of snares
it might be understood of him He has not met with calamity not met with disaster the hunter cannot do with him as he likes
and when the hunter comes he can go where he wants
 So too as to those recluses and brahmins who are not tied to these five cords of sensual pleasureit may be understood of them They have not met with calamity not met with disaster the Evil One cannot do with them as he likes
Suppose a forest deer is wandering in the forest wilds he walks confidently stands confidently sits confidently lies down confidently
Why is that
Because he is out of the hunters range
So too quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhāna which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Māra to have become invisible to the Evil One by depriving Māras eye of its opportunity
Again with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhāna which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentration
This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Māra
Again with the fading away as well of rapture a bhikkhu abides in equanimity and mindful and fully aware still feeling pleasure with the body he enters upon and abides in the third jhāna on account of which noble ones announce He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful
This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Māra
Again with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhāna which has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Māra
Again with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact with nonattention to perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite space
This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Māra
Again by completely surmounting the base of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousness
This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Māra
Again by completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of nothingness
This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Māra
Again by completely surmounting the base of nothingness a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception
This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Māra to have become invisible to the Evil One by depriving Māras eye of its opportunity
Again by completely surmounting the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feeling And his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom
This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Māra to have become invisible to the Evil One by depriving Māras eye of its opportunity
and to have crossed beyond attachment to the world He walks confidently stands confidently sits confidently lies down confidently
Why is that
Because he is out of the Evil Ones range 
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Park
There the venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus thus Friends bhikkhus
Friend they replied
The venerable Sāriputta said this Friends just as the footprint of any living being that walks can be placed within an elephants footprint and so the elephants footprint is declared the chief of them because of its great size so too all wholesome states can be included in the Four Noble Truths
In what four
In the noble truth of suffering in the noble truth of the origin of suffering in the noble truth of the cessation of suffering and in the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering
And what is the noble truth of suffering
Birth is suffering ageing is suffering death is suffering sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are suffering not to obtain what one wants is suffering in short the five aggregates affected by clinging are suffering
And what are the five aggregates affected by clinging
They are the material form aggregate affected by clinging the feeling aggregate affected by clinging the perception aggregate affected by clinging the formations aggregate affected by clinging and the consciousness aggregate affected by clinging
And what is the material form aggregate affected by clinging
It is the four great elements and the material form derived from the four great elements
And what are the four great elements
They are the earth element the water element the fire element and the air element
What friends is the earth element
The earth element may be either internal or external
What is the internal earth element
Whatever internally belonging to oneself is solid solidified and clungto that is headhairs bodyhairs nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bonemarrow kidneys heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs intestines mesentery contents of the stomach feces or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is solid solidified and clungto
this is called the internal earth element
Now both the internal earth element and the external earth element are simply earth element
And that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom one becomes disenchanted with the earth element and makes the mind dispassionate toward the earth element
Now there comes a time when the water element is disturbed
and then the external earth element vanishes
When even this external earth element great as it is is seen to be impermanent subject to destruction disappearance and change
what of this body which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while I or mine or I am 
 there can be no considering that as 
So then if others abuse revile scold and harass a bhikkhu who has seen this element as it actually is he understands thus This painful feeling born of earcontact has arisen in me
That is dependent not independent
Dependent on what
Dependent on contact
Then he sees that contact is impermanent that feeling is impermanent that perception is impermanent that formations are impermanent and that consciousness is impermanent
And his mind having made an element its objective support enters into that new objective support and acquires confidence steadiness and resolution
Now if others attack that bhikkhu in ways that are unwished for undesired and disagreeable by contact with fists clods sticks or knives
he understands thus This body is of such a nature that contact with fists clods sticks and knives assail it
But this has been said by the Blessed One in his advice on the simile of the saw Bhikkhus even if bandits were to sever you savagely limb by limb with a twohandled saw he who gave rise to a mind of hate towards them would not be carrying out my teaching
So tireless energy shall be aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness established my body shall be tranquil and untroubled my mind concentrated and unified
And now let contact with fists clods sticks and knives assail this body for this teaching of the Buddhas is being practised by me
When that bhikkhu thus recollects the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha if equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in him
then he arouses a sense of urgency thus It is a loss for me it is no gain for me it is bad for me it is no good for me that when I thus recollect the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in me
Just as when a daughterinlaw sees her fatherinlaw she arouses a sense of urgency to please him so too when that bhikkhu thus recollects the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha if equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in him then he arouses a sense of urgency
But if when he recollects the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha equanimity supported by the wholesome becomes established in him then he is satisfied with it
At that point friends much has been done by that bhikkhu
What friends is the water element
The water element may be either internal or external
What is the internal water element
Whatever internally belonging to oneself is water watery and clungto that is bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease spittle snot oilofthejoints urine or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is water watery and clungto this is called the internal water element
Now both the internal water element and the external water element are simply water element
And that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom one becomes disenchanted with the water element and makes the mind dispassionate toward the water element
Now there comes a time when the external water element is disturbed
It carries away villages towns cities districts and countries
There comes a time when the waters in the great ocean sink down a hundred leagues two hundred leagues three hundred leagues four hundred leagues five hundred leagues six hundred leagues seven hundred leagues
There comes a time when the waters in the great ocean stand seven palms deep six palms deeptwo palms deep only a palm deep
There comes a time when the waters in the great ocean stand seven fathoms deep six fathoms deeptwo fathoms deep only a fathom deep
There comes a time when the waters in the great ocean stand half a fathom deep only waist deep only knee deep only ankle deep
There comes a time when the waters in the great ocean are not enough to wet even the joint of a finger
When even this external water element great as it is is seen to be impermanent subject to destruction disappearance and change what of this body
which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while There can be no considering that as I or mine or I am 
So then if others abuse revile scold and harass a bhikkhu who has seen this element as it actually is he understands thus
At that point too friends much has been done by that bhikkhu
What friends is the fire element
The fire element may be either internal or external
What is the internal fire element
Whatever internally belonging to oneself is fire fiery and clungto that is that by which one is warmed ages and is consumed and that by which what is eaten drunk consumed and tasted gets completely digested or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is fire fiery and clungto this is called the internal fire element
Now both the internal fire element and the external fire element are simply fire element
And that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom one becomes disenchanted with the fire element and makes the mind dispassionate toward the fire element
Now there comes a time when the external fire element is disturbed
It burns up villages towns cities districts and countries
It goes out due to lack of fuel only when it comes to green grass or to a road or to a rock or to water or to a fair open space
There comes a time when they seek to make a fire even with a cocks feather or a hideparing
When even this external fire element great as it is is seen to be impermanent subject to destruction disappearance and change
what of this body which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while There can be no considering that as I or mine or I am 
So then if others abuse revile scold and harass a bhikkhu who has seen this element as it actually is he understands thus
At that point too friends much has been done by that bhikkhu
What friends is the air element
The air element may be either internal or external
What is the internal air element
Whatever internally belonging to oneself is air airy and clungto that is upgoing winds downgoing winds winds in the belly winds in the bowels winds that course through the limbs inbreath and outbreath or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is air airy and clungto this is called the internal air element
Now both the internal air element and the external air element are simply air element
And that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom one becomes disenchanted with the air element and makes the mind dispassionate toward the air element
Now there comes a time when the external air element is disturbed
It sweeps away villages towns cities districts and countries
There comes a time in the last month of the hot season when they seek wind by means of a fan or bellows and even the strands of straw in the dripfringe of the thatch do not stir
When even this external air element great as it is is seen to be impermanent subject to destruction disappearance and change
what of this body which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while I or mine or I am 
 there can be no considering that as 
So then if others abuse revile scold and harass a bhikkhu who has seen this element as it actually is
At that point too friends much has been done by that bhikkhu
Friends just as when a space is enclosed by timber and creepers grass and clay it comes to be termed just house so too when a space is enclosed by bones and sinews flesh and skin it comes to be termed just material form
If friends internally the eye is intact but no external forms come into its range and there is no corresponding conscious engagement then there is no manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousness
If internally the eye is intact and external forms come into its range but there is no corresponding conscious engagement then there is no manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousness
But when internally the eye is intact and external forms come into its range and there is the corresponding conscious engagement
then there is the manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousness
The material form in what has thus come to be is included in the material form aggregate affected by clinging The feeling in what has thus come to be is included in the feeling aggregate affected by clinging The perception in what has thus come to be is included in the perception aggregate affected by clinging The formations in what has thus come to be are included in the formations aggregate affected by clinging The consciousness in what has thus come to be is included in the consciousness aggregate affected by clinging
He understands thus This indeed is how there comes to be the inclusion gathering and amassing of things into these five aggregates affected by clinging
Now this has been said by the Blessed One One who sees dependent origination sees the Dhamma one who sees the Dhamma sees dependent origination
And these five aggregates affected by clinging are dependently arisen
The desire indulgence inclination and holding based on these five aggregates affected by clinging is the origin of suffering
The removal of desire and lust the abandonment of desire and lust for these five aggregates affected by clinging is the cessation of suffering
At that point too friends much has been done by that bhikkhu
If friends internally the ear is intact but no external sounds come into its rangeinternally the nose is intactinternally the tongue is intactinternally the body is intact If friends internally the mind is intact but no external mindobjects come into its range and there is no corresponding conscious engagement then there is no manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousness
If internally the mind is intact and external mindobjects come into its range but there is no corresponding conscious engagement then there is no manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousness
But when internally the mind is intact and external mindobjects come into its range and there is the corresponding conscious engagement then there is the manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousness
The material form in what has thus come to be is included in the material form aggregate affected by clinging The feeling in what has thus come to be is included in the feeling aggregate affected by clinging The perception in what has thus come to be is included in the perception aggregate affected by clinging The formations in what has thus come to be are included in the formations aggregate affected by clinging The consciousness in what has thus come to be is included in the consciousness aggregate affected by clinging
He understands thus This indeed is how there comes to be the inclusion gathering and amassing of things into these five aggregates affected by clinging
Now this has been said by the Blessed One One who sees dependent origination sees the Dhamma one who sees the Dhamma sees dependent origination
And these five aggregates affected by clinging are dependently arisen
The desire indulgence inclination and holding based on these five aggregates affected by clinging is the origin of suffering
The removal of desire and lust the abandonment of desire and lust for these five aggregates affected by clinging is the cessation of suffering
At that point too friends much has been done by that bhikkhu 
That is what the venerable Sāriputta said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the venerable Sāriputtas words
I heard thus At one time the Blessed One lived in a peaked hall in the Great forest in Vesāli
At that time Saccaka the son of Nigan tha a clever disputant considered wise by many lived in Vesāli
He would go about Vesāli saying I do not see a recluse a brahmin a leader of a crowd a teacher of a crowd or one acknowledging he is perfect and rightfully enlightened not shivering trembling and sweating when invited to a dispute by me
Even a lifeless pillar drawn to a dispute by me would shiver and tremble
so what of a human being
Then venerable Assaji putting on robes in the morning taking bowl and robes entered Vsāli for alms
Saccaka the son of Nigantha walking and wandering for exercise saw venerable Assaji coming in the distance
and approached venerable Assaji exchanged friendly greetings
and standing on a side said Good Assaji how are the disciples of the recluse Gotama trained and in what section are they given a lot of the training
Then venerable Assaji said Aggivessana the Blessed One gives his disciples a lot of advice and trains the disciples much in this sectionBhikkhus matter is impermanent Feelings are impermanent Perceptions are impermanent Determinations are impermanent and consciousness is impermanent
Bhikkhus matter is not self Feelings are not self Perceptions are not self Determinations are not self and consciousness is not self
All determinations are impermanent All things are not self
Aggivessana the Blessed One advises the bhikkhus much on this and the training is much on this
Good Assaji we heard something that should not be heard If the recluse Gotama is of this view
indeed we should meet him for a conversation on this To dispel doubts on this view
At that time about five hundred Licchavis were assembled in the assembly hall for some purpose
Then Saccaka the son of Nigan tha approached them and said Come Licchavis today there is a dispute between me and the recluse Gotama
If the recluse Gotama affirms this view of his disciple bhikkhu Assaji we will draw the recluse Gotama to a dispute pulling him about and dragging him about Like a strong man taking a sheep by its long fleece would pull it and drag it about
Or like a strong brewer of liqueur submerging a huge crater in a deep pond would shake it about and holding it by the ears would shake it about In the same manner we would pull and drag about the recluse Gotama in a dispute
Like an elephant of sixty cubits descending a deep pond would enjoy the game of washing hemp We would enjoy the game of washing hemp with the recluse Gotama
Come Licchavis there will be a dispute between me and the recluse Gotama
Then a certain Licchavi would say What has the recluse Gotama a dispute with Saccaka the son of Nigantha Or is it that Saccaka the son of Nigantha has a dispute with the recluse Gotama
Another Licchavi would say What is resplendent Saccaka the son of Nigan tha drawing the recluse Gotama for a dispute Or is the recluse Gotama drawing Saccaka the son of Nigantha for a dispute
Then Saccaka the son of Nigantha approached the gabled hall in the Great forest followed by about five hundred Licchavis
At that time many bhikkhus were doing the walking meditation in the open
Then Saccaka the son of Nigantha approached those bhikkhus and asked Where does good Gotama abide at this time
we like to see him
Aggivessana the Blessed One has entered the great forest and is seated at the root of a tree to spend the day
Then Saccāka the son of Nigantha approached the Great forest and the Blessed One exchanging friendly greetings with him
sat on a side
Then some of those Licchavis worshipped the Blessed One and sat on a side Some exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side
some clasped their hands in the direction of the Blessed One and sat on a side some voiced their names and clans and sat on a side and others sat on a side silently
Saccaka the son of Nigantha then said thus to the Blessed One We would ask a certain question from good Gotama If good Gotama would give us leave and would explain it to us
The Blessed One said ask Aggivessana what you desire
How does good Gotama advise the disciples and in what sections are they given much training
Aggivessana I advise and train my disciple much in this manner Bhikkhus matter is impermanent Feelings are impermanent Perceptions and determinations are impermanent Consciousness is impermanent
Bhikkhus matter is not self Feelings are not self Perceptions and determinations are not self Consciousness is not self
All determinations are impermanent All things are not self
Aggivessana I advise my disciples and train them much in this section
Good Gotama a comparison occurs to me
Say it Aggivessana
Like these seed groups and vegetable groups that grow and develop established and supported on earth
So also all powerful work that has to be done should be done established and supported on earth
In the same manner this person established in matter with the material self accrues merit or demerit This feeling person established in feelings accrues merit or demerit The perceiving person established in perceptions accrues merit or demerit The determining person established in determinations accrues merit or demerit The conscious person established in consciousness accrues merit or demerit
Aggivessana do you say Matter is my self Feelings are my self Perceptions are my self Determinations are my self Conscioussness is my self
Good Gotama I say matter is my self Feelings are my self Perceptions are my self Determinations are my self Consciousness is my self so also this large crowd says it
What does this large crowd say about your view
You should dispute on your view
Good Gotama I say matter is my self Feelings are my self Perceptions are my self Determinations are my self and conscioussness is my self
Then I will cross question you on this and you may reply as it pleases you
Aggivessana do head anointed warrior kings like king Pasenadi of Kosala king Ajātasattu of Magadha wield power over their kingdoms to execute those that have to be executed to produce those that have to be produced and to banish those that have to be banished
Yes good Gotama the head anointed warrior kings such as king Pasenadi of Kosala and king Ajātasattu of Magadha wield power in their kingdoms to execute those that have to be executed to produce those that have to be produced and to banish those that have to be banished
Even the leaders gathered here of the Vajjis and Mallas wield power in their kingdoms to execute those that have to be executed to produce those that have to be produced and to banish those that have to be banished
so there are no doubts about head anointed warrior kings like king Pasenadi of Kosala and king Ajātasattu of Magadha
Aggivessana you say matter is your self do you wield power over that matter as may my matter be thus and not thus
When this was said Saccaka the son of Nigantha became silent
For the second time the Blessed One asked Aggivessana you say matter is your self do you wield power over that matter as may my matter be thus and not thus
For the second time Saccaka the son of Nigantha became silent
Then the Blessed One said explain it Aggivessana It is not the time for you to be silent
If someone does not reply a rightful question asked by the Thus Gone One up to the third time his head splits into seven pieces
At that moment Vajrapāni the demon was seen in space with a flaming thunderbolt in his hand as though to split the head of Saccaka the son of Nigantha if he did not reply the rightful question asked up to the third time by the Thus gone One
Vajrapāni the demon was seen by the Blessed One and Saccaka the son of Nigantha
Then Saccaka the son of Nigantha frightened and with hairs standing on end sought the refuge and protection of the Blessed One said Good Gotama ask me I will explain
Aggivessana you that say matter is your self do you wield power over that matter as may my matter be thus and not otherwise
No good Gotama
Attend carefully and reply Aggivessana
What you said earlier does not agree with what you say now
Aggivessana you that say feelings are your self do you wield power over those feelings as may my feelings be thus and not otherwise
No good Gotama
Attend carefully and reply Aggivessana
What you said earlier does not agree with what you say now
Aggivessana you that say perceptions are your self do you wield power over those perceptions as may my perceptions be thus and not otherwise
No good Gotama
Attend carefully and reply Aggivessana
What you said earlier does not agree with what you say now
Aggivessana you that say determinations are your self do you wield power over those determinations as may my determinations be thus and not otherwise
No good Gotama
Attend carefully and reply Aggivessana
What you said earlier does not agree with what you say now
Aggivessana you that say consciousness is your self do you wield power over that consciousness as may my consciousness be thus and not otherwise
No good Gotama
Attend carefully and reply Aggivessana
What you said earlier does not agree with what you say now
What do you think ggivessana is matter permanent or impermanent
Impermanent good Gotama
That impermanent thing is it unpleasant or pleasant
Unpleasant good Gotama
That impermanent unpleasant changing thing is it suitable to be considered that is mine that I be that is my self
No good Gotama
Aggivessana are feelingsare perceptions are determinations is consciousness permanent or impermanent
Impermanent good Gotama
That impermanent thing is it unpleasanat or pleasant
Unpleasant good Gotama
That impermanent unpleasant changing thing is it suitable to be considered that is mine that I be that is my self
No good Gotama
Aggivessana a certain one clinging to unpleasantness over powered by it pressed down by it and reflecting its mine would think its my self Would he accurately understand unpleasāntness by himself or ward it off and abide
Good Gotama how could it be
No good Gotama that would not happen
Aggivessana like a man wandering in search of heartwood would enter a forest with a dagger
seeing a tall straight new plantain tree
he would cut its roots and top and felling it would open up the sheaves
and would not come even to sapwood so where is heartwood
In the same manner Aggivessana with your own dispute you being cross questioned asked for reasons and we studying with you found you empty useless and gone wrong
Have you said to these gatherings in Vesāli such a thing I do not see a recluse or brahmin a leader of a crowd a teacher of a crowd or even one who acknowledges he is perfect and rightfully enlightened drawn into a dispute by me would not shiver tremble and sweat
Even a lifeless pillar drawn to a dispute by me would shiver and tremble
so what of a human being
As for you Aggivessana there is sweat trickling down your forehead and some drops of sweat have pierced your over shawl and has fallen on the ground
on my body at the moment there is no sweat
Saying that the Blessed One disclosed his golden hued body to that gathering
When this was said Saccaka the son of Nigantha became silent confused his form drooping face turned down unable to reply sat down
Then Dummukha the son of the Licchavis saw Saccaka the son of Nigantha silent confused the form drooping face turned down unable to reply sitting He said to the Blessed One venerable sir a comparison comes to me
The Blessed One said say it Dummukha
Venerable sir close to a village or hamlet theres a pond
in it a crab lives
Then a lot of boys and girls approach the pond descend it and pull out the crab on to dry land
Whenever the crab puts out a limb a boy or a girl would cut it and destroy it with a stick or a stone
Thus the crab with all his limbs destroyed is unable to descend to the pond as before
In the same manner the Blessed One has cut broken and destroyed all the distortions of views and the restlessness of Saccaka the son of Nigantha and it is not possible that he should approach the Blessed One with the intention of a dispute
When this was said Saccaka the son of Nigantha said thus to Dummukha the son of the Licchavis Wait Dhummukha we have to discuss with good Gotama
Good Gotama this view of mine is also the view of all other recluses and brahmins
I think it is idle talk
How do the disciples of good Gotama do the work in the dispensation follow the given advice dispelling doubts become confident and abide not relying on a teacher in the dispensation of the Teacher
Here Aggivessana my disciples see whatever matter in the past future or present internal or external coarse or fine unexalted or exalted far or near all that matter is not mine Im not that it is not my self This is seen with right wisdom as it really is Whatever feelings whatever perceptions whatever determinations whatever consciousness in the past future or present internal or external coarse or fine un exalted or exalted far or near all consciousness is not mine Im not that it is not my self This is seen with right wisdom as it really is
Aggivessana with this much my disciples have done the work in my dispensation followed the advice dispelling doubts have become confident not relying on a teacher abide
Good Gotama how does the bhikkhu become perfect with desires destroyed the holy life lived having done what should be done the weight put down attained the highest good the desire to be destroyed and rightly knowing released
Here Aggivessana whatever matter in the past future or present internal or external coarse or fine unexalted or exalted far or near all matter is not mine Im not that it is not my self This should be seen with right wisdom as it really is and the mind released without holdings Whatever feelings in the past future or present internal or external coarse or fine unexalted or exalted far or near all feelings are not mine Im not that its not my self This should be seen with right wisdom as it really is and the mind released without holdings Whatever perceptions in the past future or present internal or external coarse or fine unexalted or exalted far or near all perceptions are not mine Im not that its not my self This should be seen with right wisdom as it really is and the mind released without holdings Whatever determinations in the past future or present internal or external coarse or fine unexalted or exalted far or near all determinations are not mine Im not that its not my self This should be seen with right wisdom as it really is and the mind released without holdings Whatever consciousness in the past future or present internal or external coarse or fine unexalted or exalted far or near all consciousness is not mine Im not that its not my self This should be seen with right wisdom as it really is and the mind released without holdings
Aggivessana when this much is done the bhikkhu is perfect with desires destroyed the holy life lived what should be done done the weight put down come to the highest good the desires to be destroyed and rightly knowing is released
Aggivessana the mind of the bhīkkhu so released is endowed with three nobilities The nobility of vision the nobility of method and the nobility of release
Aggivessana the bhikkhu so released honours reveres and esteems the Thus Gone One The Blessed One is enlightened preaches for enlightenment the Blessed One tamed preaches for taming the Blessed One appeased preaches for appeasement The Blessed One crossed over preaches for crossing over the Blessed One extinguished preaches for extinguishing
When this was said Saccaka the son of Nigan tha said thus to the Blessed One We were bold and daring and thought should insult good Gotama with a dispute
One insulting a furious elephant would be safe yet not a man insulting good Gotama
There is safety to a man disturbing a burning flame but there is no safety to a man insulting good Gotama
A man insulting a venomous snake would find safety yet one insulting good Gotama would not find safety
We were bold and daring and thought to insult good Gotama with a dispute
May good Gotama accept tomorrows meal from me together with the Community of bhikkhus
The Blessed One accepted in silence
Then Saccaka the son of Nigan tha knowing that the Blessed One had accepted addressed the Licchavis Good Licchavis listen I have invited the Blessed One and the Community of bhikkhus for tomorrows meal
Bring what ever you think is suitable
Then those Licchavis at the end of that night brought five hundred bowls filled with cooked rice
Saccaka the son of Nigantha too caused to prepare plenty of nourishing eatables and drinks in his own monastery and informed the time to the Blessed One Good Gotama it is time the food is ready
Then the Blessed One putting on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes approached the monastery of Saccaka the son of Nigan tha and sat on the prepared seat together with the Community of bhikkhus
Then Saccaka the son of Nigan tha with his own hands offered plenty of nourishing eatables and drinks to the Community of bhikkhus headed by the Enlightened One
Saccaka the son of Nigan tha saw that the Blessed One had finished taking the meal and had put away the bowl then he took a low seat sat on a side
and said to the Blessed One May the excellent merits of this offering be to those givers
Aggivessana may merits accured from offerings made to you not free from greed hate and delusion be to the givers
May merits accured from making offerings to me free of greed hate and delusion be to you
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Vesālī in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked Roof
Now on that occasion when it was morning the Blessed One had finished dressing and had taken his bowl and outer robe desiring to go into Vesālī for alms
Then as Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas son was walking and wandering for exercise he came to the Hall with the Peaked Roof in the Great Wood
The venerable nanda saw him coming in the distance
and said to the Blessed One Venerable sir here comes Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas son a debater and a clever speaker regarded by many as a saint
He wants to discredit the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
It would be good if the Blessed One would sit down for a while out of compassion
The Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready
Then Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas son went up to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
and said to the Blessed One
Master Gotama there are some recluses and brahmins who abide pursuing development of body but not development of mind
They are touched by bodily painful feeling
In the past when one was touched by bodily painful feeling ones thighs would become rigid ones heart would burst hot blood would gush from ones mouth and one would go mad go out of ones mind
So then the mind was subservient to the body the body wielded mastery over it
Why is that
Because the mind was not developed
But there are some recluses and brahmins who abide pursuing development of mind but not development of body
They are touched by mental painful feeling
In the past when one was touched by mental painful feeling ones thighs would become rigid ones heart would burst hot blood would gush from ones mouth and one would go mad go out of ones mind
So then the body was subservient to the mind the mind wielded mastery over it
Why is that
Because the body was not developed
Master Gotama it has occurred to me Surely Master Gotamas disciples abide pursuing development of mind but not development of body 
But Aggivessana what have you learned about development of body 
Well there are for example Nanda Vaccha Kisa Sankicca Makkhali Gosāla They go naked rejecting conventions licking their hands not coming when asked not stopping when asked they do not accept food brought or food specially made or an invitation to a meal they receive nothing from a pot from a bowl across a threshold across a stick across a pestle from two eating together from a pregnant woman from a woman giving suck from a woman in the midst of men from where food is advertised to be distributed from where a dog is waiting from where flies are buzzing they accept no fish or meat they drink no liquor wine or fermented brew
They keep to one house to one morsel they keep to two houses to two morselsthey keep to seven houses to seven morsels
They live on one saucerful a day on two saucerfuls a dayon seven saucerfuls a day
They take food once a day once every two daysonce every seven days
thus even up to once every fortnight they dwell pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervals
But do they subsist on so little Aggivessana
No Master Gotama
sometimes they consume excellent hard food eat excellent soft food taste excellent delicacies drink excellent drinks
Thereby they again regain their strength fortify themselves and become fat 
What they earlier abandoned Aggivessana they later gather together again That is how there is increase and decrease of this body
But what have you learned about development of mind 
When Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas son was asked by the Blessed One about development of mind he was unable to answer
Then the Blessed One told him What you have just spoken of as development of body Aggivessana is not development of body according to the Dhamma in the Noble Ones Discipline
Since you do not know what development of body is how could you know what development of mind is
Nevertheless Aggivessana as to how one is undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mind and developed in body and developed in mind
listen and attend closely to what I shall say
Yes sir Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas son replied
The Blessed One said this
How Aggivessana is one undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mind
Here Aggivessana pleasant feeling arises in an untaught ordinary person
Touched by that pleasant feeling he lusts after pleasure and continues to lust after pleasure
That pleasant feeling of his ceases
With the cessation of the pleasant feeling painful feeling arises
Touched by that painful feeling he sorrows grieves and laments he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught
When that pleasant feeling has arisen in him it invades his mind and remains because body is not developed And when that painful feeling has arisen in him it invades his mind and remains because mind is not developed
Anyone in whom in this double manner arisen pleasant feeling invades his mind and remains because body is not developed and arisen painful feeling invades his mind and remains because mind is not developed is thus undeveloped in body because mind is not developed is thus undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mind
And how Aggivessana is one developed in body and developed in mind
Here Aggivessana pleasant feeling arises in a welltaught noble disciple
Touched by that pleasant feeling he does not lust after pleasure or continue to lust after pleasure
That pleasant feeling of his ceases
With the cessation of the pleasant feeling painful feeling arises
Touched by that painful feeling he does not sorrow grieve and lament he does not weep beating his breast and become distraught
When that pleasant feeling has arisen in him it does not invade his mind and remain because body is developed And when that painful feeling has arisen in him it does not invade his mind and remain because mind is developed
Anyone in whom in this double manner arisen pleasant feeling does not invade his mind and remain because body is developed and arisen painful feeling does not invade his mind and remain because mind is developed
is thus developed in body and developed in mind
I have confidence in Master Gotama thus
Master Gotama is developed in body and developed in mind 
Surely Aggivessana your words are offensive and discourteous but still I will answer you
Since I shaved off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness it has not been possible for arisen pleasant feeling to invade my mind and remain or for arisen painful feeling to invade my mind and remain 
Has there never arisen in Master Gotama a feeling so pleasant that it could invade his mind and remain Has there never arisen in Master Gotama a feeling so painful that it could invade his mind and remain 
Why not Aggivessana
Here Aggivessana before my enlightenment while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisatta I thought Household life is crowded and dusty life gone forth is wide open
It is not easy while living in a home to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell
Suppose I shave off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessness 
Later while still young a blackhaired young man endowed with the blessing of youth in the prime of life
And I sat down there thinking This will serve for striving
Now these three similes occurred to me spontaneously never heard before
Suppose there were a wet sappy piece of wood lying in water
and a man came with an upper firestick thinking I shall light a fire I shall produce heat
What do you think Aggivessana Could the man light a fire and produce heat by taking the upper firestick and rubbing it against the wet sappy piece of wood lying in the water 
No Master Gotama
Why not
Because it is a wet sappy piece of wood and it is lying in water
Eventually the man would reap only weariness and disappointment
So too Aggivessana as to those recluses and brahmins who still do not live bodily withdrawn from sensual pleasures and whose sensual desire affection infatuation thirst and fever for sensual pleasures has not been fully abandoned and suppressed internally even if those good recluses and brahmins feel painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion they are incapable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenment
and even if those good recluses and brahmins do not feel painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion they are incapable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenment
This was the first simile that occurred to me spontaneously never heard before
Again Aggivessana a second simile occurred to me spontaneously never heard before
Suppose there were a wet sappy piece of wood lying on dry land far from water
and a man came with an upper firestick thinking I shall light a fire I shall produce heat
What do you think Aggivessana Could the man light a fire and produce heat by taking the upper firestick and rubbing it against the wet sappy piece of wood lying on dry land far from water 
No Master Gotama
Why not
Because it is a wet sappy piece of wood even though it is lying on dry land far from water
Eventually the man would reap only weariness and disappointment
So too Aggivessana as to those recluses and brahmins who live bodily withdrawn from sensual pleasures but whose sensual desire affection infatuation thirst and fever for sensual pleasures has not been fully abandoned and suppressed internally even if those good recluses and brahmins feel painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion they are incapable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenment
and even if those good recluses and brahmins do not feel painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion they are incapable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenment
This was the second simile that occurred to me spontaneously never heard before
Again Aggivessana a third simile occurred to me spontaneously never heard before
Suppose there were a dry sapless piece of wood lying on dry land far from water
and a man came with an upper firestick thinking I shall light a fire I shall produce heat What do you think Aggivessana
Could the man light a fire and produce heat by rubbing it against the dry sapless piece of wood lying on dry land far from water 
Yes Master Gotama
Why so
Because it is a dry sapless piece of wood and it is lying on dry land far from water 
So too Aggivessana as to those recluses and brahmins who live bodily withdrawn from sensual pleasures and whose sensual desire affection infatuation thirst and fever for sensual pleasures has been fully abandoned and suppressed internally even if those good recluses and brahmins feel painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion they are capable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenment
and even if those good recluses and brahmins do not feel painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion they are capable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenment
This was the third simile that occurred to me spontaneously never heard before
These are the three similes that occurred to me spontaneously never heard before
I thought Suppose with my teeth clenched and my tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth I beat down constrain and crush mind with mind
 So with my teeth clenched and my tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth I beat down constrained and crushed mind with mind
While I did so sweat ran from my armpits
Just as a strong man might seize a weaker man by the head or shoulders and beat him down constrain him and crush him so too with my teeth clenched and my tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth I beat down constrained and crushed mind with mind and sweat ran from my armpits
But although tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was established my body was overwrought and uncalm because I was exhausted by the painful striving
But such painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain
I thought Suppose I practise the breathingless meditation
 So I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my mouth and nose
While I did so there was a loud sound of winds coming out from my earholes
Just as there is a loud sound when a smiths bellows are blown so too while I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my nose and ears there was a loud sound of winds coming out from my earholes
But although tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was established
my body was overwrought and uncalm because I was exhausted by the painful striving
But such painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain
I thought Suppose I practise further the breathingless meditation
 So I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my mouth nose and ears
While I did so violent winds cut through my head
Just as if a strong man were to crush my head with the tip of a sharp sword so too while I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my mouth nose and ears violent winds cut through my head
But although tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was established
my body was overwrought and uncalm because I was exhausted by the painful striving
But such painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain
I thought Suppose I practise further the breathingless meditation
 So I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my mouth nose and ears
While I did so there were violent pains in my head
Just as if a strong man were tightening a tough leather strap around my head as a headband so too while I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my mouth nose and ears there were violent pains in my head
But although tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was established
my body was overwrought and uncalm because I was exhausted by the painful striving
But such painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain
I thought Suppose I practise further the breathingless meditation
 So I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my mouth nose and ears
While I did so violent winds carved up my belly
Just as if a skilled butcher or his apprentice were to carve up an oxs belly with a sharp butchers knife so too while I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my mouth nose and ears violent winds carved up my belly
But although tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was established
my body was overwrought and uncalm because I was exhausted by the painful striving
But such painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain
I thought Suppose I practise further the breathingless meditation
 So I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my mouth nose and ears
While I did so there was a violent burning in my body
Just as if two strong men were to seize a weaker man by both arms and roast him over a pit of hot coals so too while I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths through my mouth nose and ears there was a violent burning in my body
But although tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was established
my body was overwrought and uncalm because I was exhausted by the painful striving
But such painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain
Now when deities saw me some said The recluse Gotama is dead
 Other deities said The recluse Gotama is not dead he is dying
 And other deities said The recluse Gotama is not dead nor dying he is an arahant for such is the way arahants abide 
I thought Suppose I practise entirely cutting off food
 Then deities came to me and said Good sir do not practise entirely cutting off food
If you do so we shall infuse heavenly food into the pores of your skin and you will live on that
 I considered If I claim to be completely fasting while these deities infuse heavenly food into the pores of my skin and I live on that then I shall be lying
 So I dismissed those deities saying There is no need 
I thought Suppose I take very little food a handful each time whether of bean soup or lentil soup or vetch soup or pea soup
 So I took very little food a handful each time whether of bean soup or lentil soup or vetch soup or pea soup
While I did so my body reached a state of extreme emaciation
Because of eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems
Because of eating so little my backside became like a camels hoof
Because of eating so little the projections on my spine stood forth like corded beads
Because of eating so little my ribs jutted out as gaunt as the crazy rafters of an old roofless barn
Because of eating so little the gleam of my eyes sank far down in their sockets looking like the gleam of water that has sunk far down in a deep well
Because of eating so little my scalp shrivelled and withered as a green bitter gourd shrivels and withers in the wind and sun
Because of eating so little my belly skin adhered to my backbone thus if I touched my belly skin I encountered my backbone and if I touched my backbone I encountered my belly skin
Because of eating so little if I defecated or urinated I fell over on my face there
Because of eating so little if I tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands
the hair rotted at its roots fell from my body as I rubbed
Now when people saw me some said The recluse Gotama is black
 Other people said The recluse Gotama is not black he is brown
 Other people said The recluse Gotama is neither black nor brown he is goldenskinned
 So much had the clear bright colour of my skin deteriorated through eating so little
I thought Whatever recluses or brahmins in the past have experienced painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion this is the utmost there is none beyond this
And whatever recluses and brahmins in the future will experience painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion this is the utmost there is none beyond this
And whatever recluses and brahmins at present experience painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion this is the utmost there is none beyond this
But by this racking practice of austerities I have not attained any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones
Could there be another path to enlightenment 
I considered I recall that when my father the Sakyan was occupied while I was sitting in the cool shade of a roseapple tree quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states I entered upon and abided in the first jhāna which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
Could that be the path to enlightenment
 Then following on that memory came the realisation That is indeed the path to enlightenment 
I thought Why am I afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensual pleasures and unwholesome states
 I thought I am not afraid of that pleasure since it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures and unwholesome states 
I considered It is not easy to attain that pleasure with a body so excessively emaciated Suppose I ate some solid foodsome boiled rice and porridge
 And I ate some solid foodsome boiled rice and porridge
Now at that time five bhikkhus were waiting upon me thinking If our recluse Gotama achieves some higher state he will inform us
 But when I ate the boiled rice and porridge the five bhikkhus were disgusted and left me thinking The recluse Gotama now lives luxuriously he has given up his striving and reverted to luxury 
Now when I had eaten solid food and regained my strength then quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states I entered upon and abided in the first jhāna which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
But such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain
With the stilling of applied and sustained thought I entered upon and abided in the second jhāna
With the fading away as well of raptureI entered upon and abided in the third jhāna
With the abandoning of pleasure and painI entered upon and abided in the fourth jhāna
But such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain
When my concentrated mind was thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability I directed it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives
I recollected my manifold past lives that is one birth two birthsThus with their aspects and particulars I recollected my manifold past lives This was the first true knowledge attained by me in the first watch of the night
Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose darkness was banished and light arose as happens in one who abides diligent ardent and resolute
But such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain
When my concentrated mind was thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability I directed it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings
Thus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human I saw beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and I understood how beings pass on according to their actions This was the second true knowledge attained by me in the middle watch of the night Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose darkness was banished and light arose as happens in one who abides diligent ardent and resolute
But such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain
When my concentrated mind was thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability I directed it to knowledge of the destruction of the taints
I directly knew as it actually is This is sufferingThis is the origin of sufferingThis is the cessation of sufferingThis is the way leading to the cessation of suffering
These are the taintsThis is the origin of the taintsThis is the cessation of the taintsThis is the way leading to the cessation of the taints
When I knew and saw thus my mind was liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of being and from the taint of ignorance
When it was liberated there came the knowledge It is liberated
 I directly knew Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being 
This was the third true knowledge attained by me in the last watch of the night Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose darkness was banished and light arose as happens in one who abides diligent ardent and resolute
But such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain
Aggivessana I recall teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of many hundreds
and even then each person thinks of me The recluse Gotama is teaching the Dhamma especially for me
 But it should not be so regarded the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma to others only to give them knowledge
When the talk is finished Aggivessana then I steady my mind internally quieten it bring it to singleness and concentrate it on that same sign of concentration as before in which I constantly abide 
This is a matter about which Master Gotama can be trusted as an accomplished and fully enlightened one should be
But does Master Gotama recall sleeping during the day 
I recall Aggivessana in the last month of the hot season on returning from my almsround after my meal I lay out my outer robe folded in four and lying down on my right side I fall asleep mindful and fully aware 
Some recluses and brahmins call that abiding in delusion Master Gotama 
It is not in such a way that one is deluded or undeluded Aggivessana
As to how one is deluded or undeluded listen and attend closely to what I shall say
Yes sir Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas son replied
The Blessed One said this
Him I call deluded Aggivessana who has not abandoned the taints that defile bring renewal of being give trouble ripen in suffering and lead to future birth ageing and death
for it is with the nonabandoning of the taints that one is deluded
Him I call undeluded who has abandoned the taints that defile bring renewal of being give trouble ripen in suffering and lead to future birth ageing and death
for it is with the abandoning of the taints that one is undeluded
The Tathāgata Aggivessana has abandoned the taints that defile bring renewal of being give trouble ripen in suffering and lead to future birth ageing and death he has cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump done away with them so that they are no longer subject to future arising
Just as a palm tree whose crown is cut off is incapable of further growth so too the Tathāgata has abandoned the taints that defiledone away with them so that they are no longer subject to future arising 
When this was said Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas son said It is wonderful Master Gotama it is marvellous enlightened
how when Master Gotama is spoken to offensively again and again assailed by discourteous courses of speech the colour of his skin brightens and the colour of his face clears as is to be expected of one who is accomplished and fully
I recall Master Gotama engaging Pūraṇa Kassapa in debate
and then he prevaricated led the talk aside and showed anger hate and bitterness
But when Master Gotama is spoken to offensively again and again assaulted by discourteous courses of speech the colour of his skin brightens and the colour of his face clears as is to be expected of one who is accomplished and fully enlightened
I recall Master Gotama engaging Makkhali GosālaAjita KesakambalinPakudha KaccāyanaSañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta in debate
and then he prevaricated led the talk aside and showed anger hate and bitterness
But when Master Gotama is spoken to offensively again and again assailed by discourteous courses of speech the colour of his skin brightens and the colour of his face clears as is to be expected of one who is accomplished and fully enlightened
And now Master Gotama we depart
We are busy and have much to do
Now is the time Aggivessana to do as you think fit
Then Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas son having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones words got up from his seat and departed
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monastery
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said
On one occasion recently I was staying in Ukkattha in the Subhaga forest at the root of a royal sala tree
Now on that occasion an evil viewpoint had arisen to BakaBrahma This is constant This is permanent This is eternal This is total This is not subject to falling away  for this does not take birth does not age does not die does not fall away does not reappear And there is no other higher escape
So I  having known with my awareness the train of thought in Baka Brahmas awareness  as a strong man would extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm vanished into the root of the royal sala tree in the Subhaga forest in Ukkattha and appeared in that brahma world
Baka Brahma saw me coming in the distance and on seeing me said Come good sir You are wellcome good sir
It has been long good sir since you arranged to come here
 for this good sir is constant This is permanent This is eternal This is total This is not subject to falling away  for here one does not take birth does not age does not die does not fall away does not reappear
And there is no other higher escape
When this was said I told Baka Brahma How immersed in ignorance is Baka Brahma How immersed in ignorance is Baka Brahma  in that what is actually inconstant he calls constant What is actually impermanent he calls permanent What is actually noneternal he calls eternal What is actually partial he calls total What is actually subject to falling away he calls not subject to falling away Where one takes birth ages dies falls away and reappears he says For here one does not take birth does not age does not die does not fall away does not reappear And there being another higher escape he says There is no other higher escape 
Then Mara the Evil One taking possession of an attendant of the Brahma assembly said to me Monk Monk Dont attack him Dont attack him For this Brahma monk is the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be
There were monk before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the world who found fault with earth and were disgusted with earth who found fault with liquid and were disgusted with liquid who found fault with fire and were disgusted with fire who found fault with wind and were disgusted with wind who found fault with beings and were disgusted with beings who found fault with devas and were disgusted with devas who found fault with Pajapati and were disgusted with Pajapati who found fault with Brahma and were disgusted with Brahma They with the breakup of the body with the cutting off of life were established in a coarse body
There were monk before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the world who praised earth and were delighted with earth who praised liquid and were delighted with liquid who praised fire and were delighted with fire who praised wind and were delighted with wind who praised beings and were delighted with beings who praised devas and were delighted with devas who praised Pajapati and were delighted with Pajapati who praised Brahma and were delighted with Brahma They with the breakup of the body with the cutting off of life were established in a refined body
So I tell you monk Please good sir do only as Brahma says Dont defy the word of Brahma
If you defy the word of Brahma then  as a man when the goddess of fortune approaches chases her away with a stick or as a man falling into hell loses hold of the earth with his hands and feet  that will be what you have accomplished
Please good sir do only as Brahma says Dont defy the word of Brahma
Dont you see that Brahmas assembly has gathered
And so Mara the Evil One directed my attention to Brahmas assembly
When this was said I told Mara the Evil One I know you Evil One Dont assume He doesnt know me
You are Mara Evil One
And Brahma and Brahmas assembly and the attendants of Brahmas assembly have all fallen into your hands They have all fallen into your power
And you think This one too has come into my hands has come under my control
But Evil One I have neither come into your hands nor have I come under your control
When this was said Baka Brahma told me But good sir what is actually constant I call constant What is actually permanent I call permanent What is actually eternal I call eternal What is actually total I call total What is actually not subject to falling away I call not subject to falling away Where one does not take birth age die fall away or reappear I say For this does not take birth does not age does not die does not fall away does not reappear
And there being no other higher escape I say There is no other higher escape
There were monk before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the world whose ascetic practice lasted as long as your entire life span
They knew when there was another higher escape that there was another higher escape or when there was no other higher escape that there was no other higher escape
So I tell you monk both that you will not find another higher escape and that to that extent you will reap your share of trouble  weariness
Monk if you relish earth you will lie close to me lie within my domain for me to banish and to do with as I like
If you relish liquid  fire  wind  beings  devas  Pajapati  brahma you will lie close to me lie within my domain for me to banish and to do with as I like
I too know that brahma If I relish earth I will lie close to you lie within your domain for you to banish and to do with as you like
If I relish liquid  fire  wind  beings  devas  Pajapati  brahma I will lie close to you lie within your domain for you to banish and to do with as you like Moreover I discern your sphere I discern your splendor Baka Brahma has this much great power Baka Brahma has this much great might Baka Brahma has this much great influence 
Well monk how do you discern my sphere how do you discern my splendor Baka Brahma has this much great power Baka Brahma has this much great might Baka Brahma has this much great influence 
As far as suns  moons revolve shining illuminating the directions
over a thousandfold world your control holds sway
There you know those above  below those with lust  those without
the state of what is as it is the state of what becomes otherwise the coming  going of beings
That brahma is how I discern your sphere that is how I discern your splendor Baka Brahma has this much great power Baka Brahma has this much great might Baka Brahma has this much great influence
There are brahma bodies other than yours that you dont know dont see but that I know I see
There is brahma the body named Abhassara from which you fell away  reappeared here
From your having lived here so long your memory of that has become muddled That is why you dont know it dont see it but I know it I see it
Thus I am not your mere equal in terms of direct knowing so how could I be inferior
I am actually superior to you
There is brahma the body named Subhakinha  the body named Vehapphala  the body named Abhibhu  which you dont know dont see but that I know I see
Thus I am not your mere equal in terms of direct knowing so how could I be your inferior
I am actually superior to you
Having directly known earth as earth and having directly known the extent of what has not been experienced through the earthness of earth I wasnt earth I wasnt in earth I wasnt coming from earth I wasnt Earth is mine I didnt affirm earth
Thus I am not your mere equal in terms of direct knowing so how could I be inferior
I am actually superior to you
Having directly known liquid as liquid  fire as fire  wind as wind  beings as beings  devas as devas  Pajapati as Pajapati  brahma as brahma  the radiant as radiant  the beautiful black as the beautiful black  the skyfruit as the skyfruit  the conqueror as the conqueror  Having directly known the all as the all and having directly known the extent of what has not been experienced through the allness of the all I wasnt the all I wasnt in the all I wasnt coming forth from the all I wasnt The all is mine I didnt affirm the all
Thus I am not your mere equal in terms of direct knowing so how could I be inferior
I am actually superior to you
If good sir you have directly known the extent of what has not been experienced through the allness of the all may it not turn out to be actually vain and void for you
Consciousness without surface endless radiant all around has not been experienced through the earthness of earth  the liquidity of liquid  the fieriness of fire  the windiness of wind  the allness of the all
Well then good sir I will disappear from you
Well then brahma disappear from me if you can
Then Baka Brahma thinking I will disappear from Gotama the contemplative I will disappear from Gotama the contemplative was not able to disappear from me
When this was said I said to Baka Brahma Well then brahma I will disappear from you
Well then good sir disappear from me if you can
So then monks I fabricated a fabrication of psychic power to the extent that Brahma the Brahma assembly and the attendants of the Brahma assembly heard my voice but did not see me
Having disappeared I recited this verse
Having seen danger right in becoming and becoming searching for nonbecoming
I didnt affirm any kind of becoming or cling to any delight
Then in Brahma the Brahma assembly and the attendants of the Brahma assembly there arose a sense of amazement  awe How amazing How awesome
 The great power the great might of Gotama the contemplative Never before have we seen or heard of any other contemplative or brahman of such great power such great might as that of this Gotama the contemplative who went forth from a Sakyan clan
Living in a generation that so delights in becoming so rejoices in becoming is so fond of becoming he has pulled out becoming by the root
Then Mara the Evil One taking possession of an attendant of the Brahma assembly said to me If good sir this is what you discern if this is what you have awakened to do not lead disciples or those gone forth Do not teach the Dhamma to disciples or those gone forth Do not yearn for disciples or those gone forth
There were good sir before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the world who claimed to be worthy  rightly selfawakened
They led disciples  those gone forth They taught the Dhamma to disciples  those gone forth They yearned for disciples  those gone forth Having led disciples  those gone forth having taught the Dhamma to disciples  those gone forth having yearned for disciples  those gone forth they  on the breakup of the body with the cutting off of life  were established in a coarse body
There were good sir before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the world who claimed to be worthy  rightly selfawakened
They did not lead disciples or those gone forth They did not teach the Dhamma to disciples or those gone forth They did not yearn for disciples or those gone forth Having not led disciples or those gone forth having not taught the Dhamma to disciples or those gone forth having not yearned for disciples or those gone forth they  on the breakup of the body with the cutting off of life  were established in a refined body
So monk I tell you this Please good sir be effortless Abide committed to a pleasant abiding in the herenow  for it is skillful good sir that this not be taught Dont instruct others
When this was said I told Mara the Evil One I know you Evil One Dont assume He doesnt know me
You are Mara Evil One
And its not sympathetic to welfare that you speak thus to me Its sympathetic to what is not welfare that you speak thus to me
You think this Evil One Those to whom Gotama the contemplative will teach the Dhamma will defy my sovereignty
Without being rightly selfawakened Evil One your contemplatives  brahmans claimed to be rightly selfawakened
I however being rightly selfawakened claim to be rightly selfawakened
For when the Tathagata is teaching the Dhamma to his disciples he is Such When he is not teaching the Dhamma to his disciples he is Such
When leading his disciples he is Such When not leading his disciples he is Such
Why is that
The fermentations that defile that lead to further becoming that disturb that ripen in stress that tend to future birth aging  death Those the Tathagata has abandoned their root destroyed like an uprooted palmyra tree deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Just as a palmyra tree with its crown cut off is incapable of growing again so too the fermentations that defile that lead to further becoming that disturb that ripen in stress that tend to future birth aging  death Those the Tathagata has abandoned their root destroyed like an uprooted palmyra tree deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Thus because of the silencing of Mara and because of the brahmas invitation this discourse is entitled The Brahma Invitation
I have heard that on one occasion when the Blessed One was on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large Saṅgha of monks he arrived at the brahman village of the Kosalans called Sāla
The brahman householders heard Master Gotama the contemplativethe son of the Sakyans having gone forth from the Sakyan clanon a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large Saṅgha of monkshas arrived at Sāla
And of that master Gotama this fine reputation has spread He is indeed a Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in clearknowing  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the cosmos unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed teacher of devas  human beings awakened blessed
He has made knownhaving realized it through direct knowledgethis world with its devas Māras  Brahmās this generation with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  common people
He has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end has expounded the holy life both in its particulars  in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure
It is good to see such a worthy one
So the brahman householders of Sāla went to the Blessed One On arrival some of them bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side
Some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one side
Some of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palmtopalm over their hearts
Some of them sat to one side having announced their name  clan
Some of them sat to one side in silence
As they were sitting there the Blessed One asked them Householders is there any teacher agreeable to you in whom you have found grounded conviction
No lord there is no teacher agreeable to us in whom we have found grounded conviction
As you have not found an agreeable teacher you should adopt and practice this safebet teaching
for this safebet teachingwhen accepted and adoptedwill be to your longterm welfare  happiness
And what is the safebet teaching
 There are some contemplatives  brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions There is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no contemplatives or brahmans who faring rightly and practicing rightly proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselves
B Some contemplatives  brahmans speaking in direct opposition to those contemplatives  brahmans
say this There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed There are fruits  results of good  bad actions There is this world  the next world There is mother  father There are spontaneously reborn beings there are contemplatives  brahmans who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves
What do you think householders Dont these contemplatives  brahmans speak in direct opposition to each other
Yes lord
A Now householders of those contemplatives  brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this viewThere is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions There is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no contemplatives or brahmans who faring rightly and practicing rightly proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselves
it can be expected that shunning these three skillful activitiesgood bodily conduct good verbal conduct good mental conductthey will adopt  practice these three unskillful activities bad bodily conduct bad verbal conduct bad mental conduct
Why is that
Because those venerable contemplatives  brahmans do not see in unskillful activities the drawbacks the degradation and the defilement nor in skillful activities the rewards of renunciation resembling cleansing
A Because there actually is the next world the view of one who thinks There is no next world is his wrong view
Because there actually is the next world when he is resolved that There is no next world that is his wrong resolve
Because there actually is the next world when he speaks the statement There is no next world that is his wrong speech
Because there actually is the next world when he says that There is no next world he makes himself an opponent to those arahants who know the next world
Because there actually is the next world when he persuades another that There is no next world that is persuasion in what is not true Dhamma
And in that persuasion in what is not true Dhamma he exalts himself and disparages others
Whatever good habituation he previously had is abandoned while bad habituation is manifested And this wrong view wrong resolve wrong speech opposition to the arahants persuasion in what is not true Dhamma exaltation of self  disparagement of others
These many evil unskillful activities come into play in dependence on wrong view
A With regard to this an observant person considers thus If there is no next world thenwith the breakup of the body after deaththis venerable person has made himself safe But if there is the next world then this venerable personon the breakup of the body after deathwill reappear in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hell
Even if we didnt speak of the next world and there werent the true statement of those venerable contemplatives  brahmans this venerable person is still criticized in the here  now by the observant as a person of bad habits  wrong view one who holds to a doctrine of nonexistence
If there really is a next world then this venerable person has made a bad throw twice in that he is criticized by the observant here  now and in thatwith the breakup of the body after deathhe will reappear in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hell
Thus this safebet teaching when poorly grasped  poorly adopted by him covers one side and leaves behind the possibility of the skillful

Even if we didnt speak of action and there werent the true statement of those venerable contemplatives  brahmans this venerable person is still praised in the here  now by the observant as a person of good habits  right view one who holds to a doctrine of action
If there really is a next world then this venerable person has made a good throw twice in that he is praised by the observant here  now and in thatwith the breakup of the body after deathhe will reappear in a good destination a heavenly world
Thus this safebet teaching when well grasped  adopted by him covers both sides and leaves behind the possibility of the unskillful
A There are some contemplatives  brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view There is no causality no requisite condition for the defilement of beings Beings are defiled without causality without requisite condition
There is no causality no requisite condition for the purification of beings Beings are purified without causality without requisite condition
There is no strength no effort no human energy no human endeavor All living beings all life all beings all souls are powerless devoid of strength devoid of effort Subject to the changes of fate serendipity and nature they experience pleasure and pain in the six great classes of birth
B Some contemplatives  brahmans speaking in direct opposition to those contemplatives  brahmans
say this There is causality there is requisite condition for the defilement of beings Beings are defiled with causality with requisite condition
There is causality there is requisite condition for the purification of beings Beings are purified with causality with requisite condition
There is strength there is effort there is human energy there is human endeavor Its not the case that all living beings all life all beings all souls are powerless devoid of strength devoid of effort or that subject to the changes of fate serendipity and nature they experience pleasure and pain in the six great classes of birth
What do you think householders Dont these contemplatives  brahmans speak in direct opposition to each other
Yes lord
A Now householders of those contemplatives  brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this viewThere is no cause no requisite condition for the defilement of beings
 Subject to the changes of fate serendipity and nature they experience pleasure and pain in the six great classes of birth
it can be expected that shunning these three skillful activitiesgood bodily conduct good verbal conduct good mental conductthey will adopt  practice these three unskillful activities bad bodily conduct bad verbal conduct bad mental conduct
Why is that
Because those venerable contemplatives  brahmans do not see in unskillful activities the drawbacks the degradation and the defilement nor in skillful activities the rewards of renunciation resembling cleansing
A Because there actually is causality the view of one who thinks There is no causality is his wrong view
Because there actually is causality when he is resolved that There is no causality that is his wrong resolve
Because there actually is causality when he speaks the statement There is no causality that is his wrong speech
Because there actually is causality when he says that There is no causality he makes himself an opponent to those arahants who teach causality
Because there actually is causality when he persuades another that There is no causality that is persuasion in what is not true Dhamma
And in that persuasion in what is not true Dhamma he exalts himself and disparages others
Whatever good habituation he previously had is abandoned while bad habituation is manifested And this wrong view wrong resolve wrong speech opposition to the arahants persuasion in what is not true Dhamma exaltation of self  disparagement of others
These many evil unskillful activities come into play in dependence on wrong view
A With regard to this an observant person considers thus If there is no causality thenwith the breakup of the body after deaththis venerable person has made himself safe But if there is causality then this venerable personon the breakup of the body after deathwill reappear in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hell
Even if we didnt speak of causality and there werent the true statement of those venerable contemplatives  brahmans this venerable person is still criticized in the here  now by the observant as a person of bad habits  wrong view one who holds to a doctrine of noncausality
If there really is a next world then this venerable person has made a bad throw twice in that he is criticized by the observant here  now and in thatwith the breakup of the body after deathhe will reappear in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hell
Thus this safebet teaching when poorly grasped  poorly adopted by him covers one side and leaves behind the possibility of the skillful

There are some contemplatives  brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view There is no total formlessness
Some contemplatives  brahmans speaking in direct opposition to those contemplatives  brahmans
say this There is total formlessness
What do you think householders Dont these contemplatives  brahmans speak in direct opposition to each other
Yes lord
With regard to this an observant person considers thus As for those venerable contemplatives  brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this viewThere is no total formlessnessI havent seen that As for those venerable contemplatives  brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this viewThere is total formlessnessI havent known that

The taking up of rods  weapons quarrels contention disputes recrimination divisiveness  false speech are seen to arise from form
but not from total formlessness
Reflecting thus he practices for disenchantment toward forms for dispassion toward forms and for the cessation of forms
There are some contemplatives  brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view There is no total cessation of becoming

Reflecting thus he practices for disenchantment toward becomings for dispassion toward becomings and for the cessation of becomings
Householders there are these four types of individuals to be found existing in the world
Which four
There is the case where a certain individual torments himself and is devoted to the practice of torturing himself
There is the case where a certain individual torments others and is devoted to the practice of torturing others
There is the case where a certain individual torments himself and is devoted to the practice of torturing himself and also torments others and is devoted to the practice of torturing others
There is the case where a certain individual neither torments himself nor is he devoted to the practice of torturing himself neither torments others nor is he devoted to the practice of torturing others Neither tormenting himself nor tormenting others he dwells in the here  now free of hunger unbound cooled sensitive to happiness with a Brahmālike mind
And which is the individual who torments himself and is devoted to the practice of torturing himself
There is the case where a certain individual goes without cloth rejecting conventions licking his hands not coming when called not staying when asked He does not accept food brought or specially made He does not consent to an invitation  He doesnt receive anything from the mouth of a pot from the mouth of a container across a threshold across a stick across a pestle from two eating together from a pregnant woman from a woman nursing a child from a woman living with a man from where it is announced that food is to be distributed from where a dog is waiting from where flies are buzzing He accepts no meat no distilled liquor no wine no fermented liquor He limits himself to one house for one morsel to two houses for two morsels to seven houses for seven morsels He lives on one saucerful a day two saucerfuls a day seven saucerfuls a day He takes food once a day once every two days once every seven days and so on up to once every halfmonth He remains devoted to the practice of taking food at stated intervals He eats a diet of green vegetables or millet or wild rice or hideparings or moss or rice bran or ricewater or sesame flour or grass or cow dung He lives off forest roots  fruits He eats fallen fruits He clothes himself in hemp in canvas in shrouds in thrownaway rags in tree bark in antelope hide in woodshavings fabric in headhair wool in wildanimal wool in owls wings He is a hairbeard puller one devoted to the practice of pulling out his hair  beard He is a stander one who rejects seats He is a handsaroundtheknees sitter one devoted to the exertion of sitting with his hands around his knees He is a spikemattresser one who makes his bed on a bed of spikes He is a thirdtimeintheevening bather one who stays devoted to the practice of bathing in water Thus in these many ways he is devoted to the practice of tormenting  persecuting the body
This is called an individual who torments himself and is devoted to the practice of torturing himself
And which is the individual who torments others and is devoted to the practice of torturing others
There is the case where a certain individual is a butcher of sheep a butcher of pigs a butcher of fowl a trapper a hunter a fisherman a thief an executioner a prison warden or anyone who follows any other bloody occupation
This is called an individual who torments others and is devoted to the practice of torturing others
And which is the individual who torments himself and is devoted to the practice of torturing himself and also torments others and is devoted to the practice of torturing others
There is the case where an individual is a headanointed noble warrior king or a brahman of great wealth Having had a new temple built to the east of the city having shaved off his hair  beard having dressed himself in a rough hide having smeared his body with ghee  oil and scratching his back with a deer horn he enters the new temple along with his chief queen  brahman high priest There he makes his bed on the bare ground strewn with grass The king lives off the milk from the first teat of a cow with an identical calf the queen lives off the milk from the second teat the brahman high priest off the milk from the third teat The milk from the fourth teat they pour into the fire The calf lives on what is left He says Let so many bulls be slaughtered for the sacrifice Let so many bullocks so many heifers so many goats so many sheep Let so many horses be slaughtered for the sacrifice Let so many trees be cut down for the sacrificial posts let so many plants be mowed down for the sacrificial grass And his slaves servants  workers make preparations weeping with tearful faces spurred on by punishment spurred on by fear
This is called an individual who torments himself and is devoted to the practice of torturing himself and also torments others and is devoted to the practice of torturing others
And which is the individual who neither torments himself nor is devoted to the practice of torturing himself neither torments others nor is devoted to the practice of torturing others whoneither tormenting himself nor tormenting othersdwells in the here  now free of hunger unbound cooled sensitive to happiness with a Brahmālike mind
There is the case where a Tathāgata appears in the world worthy  rightly selfawakened  Having abandoned these five hindrancesimperfections of awareness that weaken discernmentthen quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities he enters and remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
Then with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluationinternal assurance Then with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body He enters and remains in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding Then with the abandoning of pleasure  painas with the earlier disappearance of elation  distresshe enters and remains in the fourth jhāna purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives 
He recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction and expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance Such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life Passing away from that state I rearose there There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance Such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life Passing away from that state I rearose here Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and details This too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitful
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings
He seesby means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the humanbeings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma These beingswho were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong viewswith the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hell But these beingswho were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right viewswith the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in a good destination a heavenly world Thusby means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the humanhe sees beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the effluents
He discerns as it has come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are effluents This is the origination of effluents This is the cessation of effluents This is the way leading to the cessation of effluents
His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the effluent of sensuality released from the effluent of becoming released from the effluent of ignorance
With release there is the knowledge Released
He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for this world
This is called an individual who neither torments himself nor is devoted to the practice of torturing himself who neither torments others nor is devoted to the practice of torturing others Neither tormenting himself nor tormenting others he dwells in the here  now free of hunger unbound cooled sensitive to happiness with a Brahmālike mind
When this was said the brahman householders of Sāla said Magnificent master Gotama Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has master Gotamathrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clear
We go to master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monks
May master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then Vacchagotta the wanderer went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he asked the Blessed One
How is it Master Gotamadoes Master Gotama hold the view The cosmos is eternal only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
  no
Then does Master Gotama hold the view The cosmos is not eternal only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
  no
Then does Master Gotama hold the view The cosmos is finite only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
  no
Then does Master Gotama hold the view The cosmos is infinite only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
  no
Then does Master Gotama hold the view The soul  the body are the same only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
  no
Then does Master Gotama hold the view The soul is one thing and the body another only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
  no
Then does Master Gotama hold the view After death a Tathāgata exists only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
  no
Then does Master Gotama hold the view After death a Tathāgata does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
  no 
Then does Master Gotama hold the view After death a Tathāgata both exists  does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
  no
Then does Master Gotama hold the view After death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
  no
How is it Master Gotama when Master Gotama is asked if he holds the view the cosmos is eternal
after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthless he says   no in each case
Seeing what drawback then is Master Gotama thus entirely dissociated from each of these ten positions
Vaccha the position that the cosmos is eternal is a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of views It is accompanied by suffering distress despair  fever and it does not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation to calm direct knowledge selfawakening unbinding
The position that the cosmos is not eternal the cosmos is finite the cosmos is infinite the soul  the body are the same the soul is one thing and the body another after death a Tathāgata exists after death a Tathāgata does not exist after death a Tathāgata both exists  does not exist after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist does not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation to calm direct knowledge selfawakening unbinding
Does Master Gotama have any position at all
A position Vaccha is something that a Tathāgata has done away with
What a Tathāgata sees is this Such is form such its origination such its disappearance such is feeling such its origination such its disappearance such is perception such are fabrications such is consciousness such its origination such its disappearance
Because of this I say a Tathāgatawith the ending fading away cessation renunciation  relinquishment of all suppositions all excogitations all Imaking  minemaking  obsessions with conceitis through lack of clingingsustenance released
But Master Gotama the monk whose mind is thus released Where does he reappear
Reappear Vaccha doesnt apply
In that case Master Gotama he does not reappear
Does not reappear Vaccha doesnt apply 
both does  does not reappear
doesnt apply
neither does nor does not reappear
doesnt apply
How is it Master Gotama when Master Gotama is asked if the monk reappears
does not reappear
both does  does not reappear
neither does nor does not reappear he says  doesnt apply in each case
At this point Master Gotama I am befuddled at this point confused
The modicum of clarity coming to me from your earlier conversation is now obscured
Of course youre befuddled Vaccha Of course youre confused
Deep Vaccha is this phenomenon hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wise
For those with other views other practices other satisfactions other aims other teachers it is difficult to know
That being the case I will counterquestion you on this matter Answer as you see fit
What do you think Vaccha If a fire were burning in front of you would you know that This fire is burning in front of me
yes
And if someone were to ask you Vaccha This fire burning in front of you dependent on what is it burning Thus asked how would you reply
I would reply This fire burning in front of me is burning dependent on grass  timber as its sustenance
If the fire burning in front of you were to go out would you know that This fire burning in front of me has gone out
yes
And if someone were to ask you This fire that has gone out in front of you in which direction from here has it gone East West North Or south Thus asked how would you reply
That doesnt apply Master Gotama Any fire burning dependent on a sustenance of grass  timber being unnourishedfrom having consumed that sustenance and not being offered any otheris classified simply as out unbound
In the same way Vaccha any form by which one describing the Tathāgata would describe him That the Tathāgata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Freed from the classification of form Vaccha the Tathāgata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the sea
Reappears doesnt apply Does not reappear doesnt apply Both does  does not reappear doesnt apply Neither reappears nor does not reappear doesnt apply
Any feeling Any perception Any fabrication Any consciousness by which one describing the Tathāgata would describe him That the Tathāgata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Freed from the classification of consciousness Vaccha the Tathāgata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the sea
Reappears doesnt apply Does not reappear doesnt apply Both does  does not reappear doesnt apply Neither reappears nor does not reappear doesnt apply
When this was said Vacchagotta the wanderer said to the Blessed One Master Gotama its as if there were a great Sal tree not far from a village or town
From inconstancy its branches and leaves would wear away its bark would wear away its sapwood would wear away so that on a later occasiondivested of branches leaves bark  sapwoodit would stand as pure heartwood In the same way Master Gotamas words are divested of branches leaves bark  sapwood and stand as pure heartwood
Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotamathrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clear I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monks May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monastery
And at that time in King Pasenadis realm there was a bandit named Angulimala brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beings
He turned villages into nonvillages towns into nontowns settled countryside into unsettled countryside
Having repeatedly killed human beings he wore a garland made of fingers 
Then the Blessed One early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe  bowl went into Savatthi for alms
Having wandered for alms in Savatthi and returning from his alms round after his meal he set his lodging in order Carrying his robes  bowl he went along the road to where Angulimala was staying
Cowherds shepherds  farmers saw him going along the road to where Angulimala was staying
and on seeing him said to him Dont go along that road contemplative
for on that road is Angulimala brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beings
He has turned villages into nonvillages towns into nontowns settled countryside into unsettled countryside
Having repeatedly killed human beings he wears a garland made of fingers
Groups of ten twenty thirty  forty men have gone along that road
and even they have fallen into Angulimalas hands
When this was said the Blessed One kept going in silence
A second time A third time cowherds shepherds  farmers said to the Blessed One Dont go along that road contemplative
Groups of ten twenty thirty  forty men have gone along that road
and even they have fallen into Angulimalas hands
When this was said the Blessed One kept going in silence
Then Angulimala saw the Blessed One coming from afar
and on seeing him this thought occurred to him Isnt it amazing Isnt it astounding
Groups of ten twenty thirty  forty men have gone along this road
and even they have fallen into my hands
and yet now this contemplative comes attacking as it were alone and without a companion
Why dont I kill him
So Angulimala taking up his sword  shield buckling on his bow  quiver followed right behind the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One willed a feat of psychic power such that Angulimala though running with all his might could not catch up with the Blessed One walking at normal pace
Then the thought occurred to Angulimala Isnt it amazing Isnt it astounding
In the past Ive chased  seized even a swiftrunning elephant a swiftrunning horse a swiftrunning chariot a swiftrunning deer But now even though Im running with all my might I cant catch up with this contemplative walking at normal pace
So he stopped and called out to the Blessed One Stop contemplative Stop
I have stopped Angulimala You stop
Then the thought occurred to Angulimala These Sakyan contemplatives are speakers of the truth asserters of the truths
and yet this contemplative even while walking says I have stopped Angulimala You stop
Why dont I question him 
So Angulimala the bandit addressed this verse to the Blessed One
While walking contemplative you say I have stopped
But when I have stopped you say I havent
I ask you the meaning of this
How have you stopped How havent I 
The Buddha I have stopped Angulimala once  for all
having cast off violence toward all living beings
You though are unrestrained toward beings
Thats how Ive stopped and you havent
Angulimala At long last a greatly revered great seer for my sake
has come to the great forest
I will go about having abandoned evil
Having heard your verse in line with the Dhamma
So saying the bandit hurled his sword  weapons
over a cliff into a chasm a pit
Then the bandit paid homage to the feet of the One Wellgone
and right there requested the Goingforth
The Awakened One the compassionate great seer
the teacher of the world along with its devas
said to him then Come bhikkhu
That in itself was bhikkhuhood for him
Then the Blessed One set out wandering toward Savatthi with Ven Angulimala as his attendant monk
After wandering by stages he reached Savatthi
and there he lived near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monastery
Now at that time a large crowd of people loud  noisy had gathered at the gates to King Pasenadi Kosalas inner palace calling out There is a bandit in your realm sire named Angulimala brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beings
He has turned villages into nonvillages towns into nontowns settled countryside into unsettled countryside
Having repeatedly killed human beings he wears a garland made of fingers
The king must stamp him out
Then King Pasenadi Kosala with a cavalry of roughly  horsemen drove out of Savatthi
and entered the monastery
Driving as far as the ground was passable for chariots he got down from his chariot and went on foot to the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down he sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him What is it great king Has King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha provoked you or have the Licchavis of Vesali or some other hostile king
No lord King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha hasnt provoked me nor have the Licchavis of Vesali nor has some other hostile king
There is a bandit in my realm lord named Angulimala brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beings
He has turned villages into nonvillages towns into nontowns settled countryside into unsettled countryside
Having repeatedly killed human beings he wears a garland made of fingers
I am going to stamp him out
Great king suppose you were to see Angulimala with his hair  beard shaved off wearing the ochre robe having gone forth from the home life into homelessness refraining from killing living beings refraining from taking what is not given refraining from telling lies living the holy life on one meal a day virtuous  of fine character what would you do to him 
We would bow down to him lord or rise up to greet him or offer him a seat or offer him robes almsfood lodgings or medicinal requisites for curing illness or we would arrange a lawful guard protection  defense
But how could there be such virtue  restraint in an unvirtuous evil character 
Now at that time Ven Angulimala was sitting not far from the Blessed One
So the Blessed One pointing with his right arm said to King Pasenadi Kosala That great king is Angulimala
Then King Pasenadi Kosala was frightened terrified his hair standing on end
So the Blessed One sensing the kings fear  hairraising awe said to him Dont be afraid great king Dont be afraid He poses no danger to you
Then the kings fear his terror his hairstandingonend subsided
He went over to Ven Angulimala and said Are you really Angulimala lord 
Yes great king
What is your fathers clan What is your mothers clan
My father is a Gagga great king and my mother a Mantani
Then may Master Gagga Mantaniputta delight in staying here
I will be responsible for your robes almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisites for curing illness
Now it so happened that at that time Ven Angulimala was a wildernessdweller an almsgoer wearing one set of the triple robe made of castoff cloth
So he said to King Pasenadi Kosala Enough great king My triple robe is complete
So King Pasenadi Kosala went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Its amazing lord Its astounding
how the Blessed One has tamed the untamed pacified the unpeaceful and brought to Unbinding those who were not unbound
For what we could not tame even with blunt or bladed weapons the Blessed One has tamed without blunt or bladed weapons
Now lord we must go Many are our duties many our responsibilities
Then do great king what you think it is now time to do
Then King Pasenadi Kosala got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and keeping him to his right departed
Then Ven Angulimala early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe  bowl went into Savatthi for alms
As he was going from house to house for alms he saw a woman suffering a breech birth
On seeing her the thought occurred to him How tormented are living beings How tormented are living beings
Then having wandered for alms in Savatthi and returning from his alms round after his meal he went to the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now lord early in the morning having put on my robes and carrying my outer robe  bowl I went into Savatthi for alms
As I was going from house to house for alms I saw a woman suffering a breech birth
On seeing her the thought occurred to me How tormented are living beings How tormented are living beings
In that case Angulimala go to that woman and on arrival say to her Sister since I was born I do not recall intentionally killing a living being Through this truth may there be wellbeing for you wellbeing for your fetus
But lord wouldnt that be a lie for me
For I have intentionally killed many living beings
Then in that case Angulimala go to that woman and on arrival say to her Sister since I was born in the noble birth I do not recall intentionally killing a living being Through this truth may there be wellbeing for you wellbeing for your fetus
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Angulimala went to that woman and on arrival said to her Sister since I was born in the noble birth I do not recall intentionally killing a living being Through this may there be wellbeing for you wellbeing for your fetus
And there was wellbeing for the woman wellbeing for her fetus
Then Ven Angulimala dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now
He knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for the sake of this world
And thus Ven Angulimala became another one of the arahants
Then Ven Angulimala early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe  bowl went into Savatthi for alms
Now at that time a clod thrown by one person hit Ven Angulimala on the body a stone thrown by another person hit him on the body and a potsherd thrown by still another person hit him on the body
So Ven Angulimala  his head broken open and dripping with blood his bowl broken and his outer robe ripped to shreds  went to the Blessed One
The Blessed One saw him coming from afar
and on seeing him said to him Bear with it brahman Bear with it
The fruit of the kamma that would have burned you in hell for many years many hundreds of years many thousands of years you are now experiencing in the herenow
Then Ven Angulimala having gone alone into seclusion experienced the bliss of release At that time he exclaimed
Who once was heedless but later is not
brightens the world like the moon set free from a cloud
His evildone deed is replaced with skillfulness
he brightens the world like the moon set free from a cloud
Whatever young monk devotes himself to the Buddhas bidding
he brightens the world like the moon set free from a cloud
May even my enemies hear talk of the Dhamma
May even my enemies devote themselves to the Buddhas bidding
May even my enemies associate with those people
who  peaceful good  get others to accept the Dhamma
May even my enemies from those who advise endurance who praise nonopposition
hear the Dhamma time  again forbearance and may they follow it
For surely he wouldnt harm me or anyone else
he would attain the foremost peace would protect the feeble  firm
Irrigators guide the water Fletchers shape the arrow shaft
Carpenters shape the wood The wise control themselves
Some tame with a blunt stick with hooks  with whips
But without blunt or bladed weapons I was tamed by the one who is Such
Doer of No Harm is my name but I used to be a doer of harm
Today I am true to my name for I harm no one at all
A bandit I used to be renowned as Angulimala
Swept along by a great flood I went to the Buddha as refuge
Bloodyhanded I used to be renowned as Angulimala
See my going for refuge Uprooted is craving the guide to becoming
Having done the type of kamma that would lead to many bad destinations
touched by the fruit of that kamma unindebted I eat my food
Theyre addicted to heedlessness  dullards fools
 while one who is wise cherishes heedfulness as his highest wealth
Dont give way to heedlessness or to intimacy with sensual delight 
for a heedful person absorbed in jhana attains an abundant bliss
This has come well  not gone away it was not badly thought through for me
From among wellanalyzed qualities I have obtained the best
This has come well  not gone away it was not badly thought through for me
The three knowledges have been attained the Buddhas bidding done
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthl in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this  Bhikkhus I shall teach you noble right concentration with its supports and its requisites
Listen and attend closely to what I shall say
 Yes venerable sir the bhikkhus replied
The Blessed One said this
What bhikkhus is noble right concentration with its supports and its requisites
that is right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort and right mindfulness Unification of mind equipped with these seven factors is called noble right concentration with its supports and its requisites
Therein bhikkhus right view comes first
And how does right view come first
One understands wrong view as wrong view and right view as right view this is ones right view
And what bhikkhus is wrong view
There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed no fruit or result of good and bad actions no this world no other world no mother no father no beings who are reborn spontaneously no good and virtuous recluses and brahmins in the world who have realised for themselves by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world  This is wrong view
And what bhikkhus is right view
Right view I say is twofold there is right view that is affected by taints partaking of merit ripening on the side of attachment and there is right view that is noble taintless supramundane a factor of the path
And what bhikkhus is right view that is affected by the taints partaking of merit ripening on the side of attachment
There is what is given and what is offered and what is sacrificed there is fruit and result of good and bad actions there is this world and the other world there is mother and father there are beings who are reborn spontaneously there are in the world good and virtuous recluses and brahmins who have realised for themselves by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world  This is right view affected by taints partaking of merit ripening on the side of attachment

The wisdom the faculty of wisdom the power of wisdom the investigationofstates enlightenment factor the path factor of right view in one whose mind is noble whose mind is taintless who possesses the noble path and is developing the noble path this is right view that is noble taintless supramundane a factor of the path
One makes an effort to abandon wrong view and to enter upon right view this is ones right effort
Mindfully one abandons wrong view mindfully one enters upon and abides in right view this is ones right mindfulness
Thus these three states run and circle around right view that is right view right effort and right mindfulness
Therein bhikkhus right view comes first
And how does right view come first
One understands wrong intention as wrong intention and right intention as right intention this is ones right view
And what bhikkhus is wrong intention
The intention of sensual desire the intention of ill will and the intention of cruelty this is wrong intention
And what bhikkhus is right intention
Right intention I say is twofold there is right intention that is affected by taints partaking of merit ripening on the side of attachment and there is right intention that is noble taintless supramundane a factor of the path
And what bhikkhus is right intention that is affected by taints partaking of merit ripening on the side of attachment
The intention of renunciation the intention of nonill will and the intention of noncruelty this is right intention that is affected by taints   on the side of attachment
And what bhikkhus is right intention that is noble taintless supramundane a factor of the path
The thinking thought intention mental absorption mental fixity directing of mind verbal formation in one whose mind is noble whose mind is taintless who possesses the noble path and is developing the noble path this is right intention that is noble  a factor of the path
One makes an effort to abandon wrong intention and to enter upon right intention this is ones right effort
Mindfully one abandons wrong intention mindfully one enters upon and abides in right intention this is ones right mindfulness
Thus these three states run and circle around right intention that is right view right effort and right mindfulness
Therein bhikkhus right view comes first
And how does right view come first
One understands wrong speech as wrong speech and right speech as right speech this is ones right view
And what bhikkhus is wrong speech
False speech malicious speech harsh speech and gossip this is wrong speech
And what bhikkhus is right speech
Right speech I say is twofold there is right speech that is affected by taints partaking of merit ripening on the side of attachment and there is right speech that is noble taintless supramundane a factor of the path
And what bhikkhus is right speech that is affected by taints partaking of merit ripening on the side of attachment
Abstinence from false speech abstinence from malicious speech abstinence from harsh speech abstinence from gossip this is right speech that is affected by taints   on the side of attachment
And what bhikkhus is right speech that is noble taintless supramundane a factor of the path
The desisting from the four kinds of verbal misconduct the abstaining refraining abstinence from them in one whose mind is noble whose mind is taintless who possesses the noble path and is developing the noble path this is right speech that is noble  a factor of the path
One makes an effort to abandon wrong speech and to enter upon right speech this is ones right effort
Mindfully one abandons wrong speech mindfully one enters upon and abides in right speech this is ones right mindfulness

Therein bhikkhus right view comes first
And how does right view come first
One understands wrong action as wrong action and right action as right action this is ones right view
And what bhikkhus is wrong action
Killing living beings taking what is not given and misconduct in sensual pleasures this is wrong action
And what bhikkhus is right action
Right action I say is twofold there is right action that is affected by taints partaking of merit ripening on the side of attachment and there is right action that is noble taintless supramundane a factor of the path
And what bhikkhus is right action that is affected by taints partaking of merit ripening on the side of attachment
Abstinence from killing living beings abstinence from taking what is not given abstinence from misconduct in sensual pleasures this is right action that is affected by taints   on the side of attachment
And what bhikkhus is right action that is noble taintless supramundane a factor of the path
The desisting from the three kinds of bodily misconduct the abstaining refraining abstinence from them in one whose mind is noble whose mind is taintless who possesses the noble path and is developing the noble path this is right action that is noble   a factor of the path
One makes an effort to abandon wrong action and to enter upon right action this is ones right effort

Thus these three states run and circle around right action that is right view right effort and right mindfulness
Therein bhikkhus right view comes first
And how does right view come first
One understands wrong livelihood as wrong livelihood and right livelihood as right livelihood this is ones right view
And what bhikkhus is wrong livelihood
Scheming talking hinting belittling pursuing gain with gain this is wrong livelihood
And what bhikkhus is right livelihood

And what bhikkhus is right livelihood that is affected by taints partaking of merit ripening on the side of attachment
Here bhikkhus a noble disciple abandons wrong livelihood and gains his living by right livelihood this is right livelihood that is affected by taints   on the side of attachment
And what bhikkhus is right livelihood that is noble taintless supramundane a factor of the path
The desisting from wrong livelihood the abstaining refraining abstinence from it in one whose mind is noble whose mind is taintless who possesses the noble path and is developing the noble path this is right livelihood that is noble a factor of the path
One makes an effort to abandon wrong livelihood and to enter upon right livelihood this is ones right effort
Mindfully one abandons wrong livelihood mindfully one enters upon right livelihood this is ones right mindfulness
Thus these three states rim and circle around right livelihood that is right view right effort and right mindfulness
Therein bhikkhus right view comes first
And how does right view come first
In one of right view right intention comes into being in one of right intention right speech comes into being in one of right speech right action comes into being in one of right action right livelihood comes into being in one of right livelihood right effort comes into being in one of right effort right mindfulness comes into being in one of right mindfulness right concentration comes into being in one of right concentration right knowledge comes into being in one of right knowledge right deliverance comes into being
Thus bhikkhus the path of the disciple in higher training possesses eight factors the arahant possesses ten factors 
Therein bhikkhus right view comes first
And how does right view come first
In one of right view wrong view is abolished
and the many evil unwholesome states that originate with wrong view as condition are also abolished
and the many wholesome states that originate with right view as condition come to fulfilment by development
In one of right intention wrong intention is abolished and the many evil unwholesome states that originate with wrong intention as condition are also abolished and the many wholesome states that originate with right intention as condition come to fulfilment by development In one of right speech wrong speech is abolished  In one of right action wrong action is abolished  In one of right livelihood wrong livelihood is abolished   In one of right effort wrong effort is abolished  In one of right mindfulness wrong mindfulness is abolished  In one of right concentration wrong concentration is abolished  In one of right knowledge wrong knowledge is abolished 
In one of right deliverance wrong deliverance is abolished and the many evil unwholesome states that originate with wrong deliverance as condition are also abolished
and the many wholesome states that originate with right deliverance as condition come to fulfilment by development
Thus bhikkhus there are twenty factors on the side of the wholesome and twenty factors on the side of the unwholesome  This Dhamma discourse on the Great Forty has been set rolling and cannot be stopped by any recluse or brahmin or god or Mara or Brahma or anyone in the world
Bhikkhus if any recluse or brahmin thinks that this Dhamma discourse on the Great Forty should be censured and rejected then there are ten legitimate deductions from his assertions that would provide grounds for censuring him here and now If that worthy one censures right view then he would honour and praise those recluses and brahmins who are of wrong view If that worthy one censures right intention then he would honour and praise those recluses and brahmins who are of wrong intention If that worthy one censures right speech  right action  right livelihood  right effort  right mindfulness   right concentration   right knowledge   right deliverance then he would honour and praise those recluses and brahmins who are of wrong deliverance
If any recluse or brahmin thinks that this Dhamma discourse on the Great Forty should be censured and rejected then these are ten legitimate deductions from his assertions that would provide grounds for censuring him here and now
Bhikkhus even those teachers from Okkala Vassa and Bhanna who held the doctrine of noncausality the doctrine of nondoing and the doctrine of nihilism would not think that this Dhamma discourse on the Great Forty should be censured and rejected
Why is that
For fear of blame attack and confutation
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthl in the Eastern Park in the Palace of Migaras Mother together with many very wellknown elder disciples  the venerable Sariputta the venerable Maha Moggallana the venerable Maha Kassapa the venerable Maha Kaccana the venerable Maha Kotthita the venerable Maha Kappina the venerable Maha Cunda the venerable Anuruddha the venerable Revata the venerable Ananda and other very wellknown elder disciples
Now on that occasion elder bhikkhus had been teaching and instructing new bhikkhus
some elder bhikkhus had been teaching and instructing ten new bhikkhus some elder bhikkhus had been teaching and instructing twenty  thirty  forty new bhikkhus
And the new bhikkhus taught and instructed by the elder bhikkhus had achieved successive stages of high distinction
On that occasion  the Uposatha day of the fifteenth on the fullmoon night of the Pavarana ceremony  the Blessed One was seated in the open surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus
Then surveying the silent Sangha of bhikkhus he addressed them thus  Bhikkhus I am content with this progress My mind is content with this progress
So arouse still more energy to attain the unattained to achieve the unachieved to realise the unrealised
I shall wait here at Savatthl for the Komudi full moon of the fourth month
The bhikkhus of the countryside heard The Blessed One will wait there at Savatthi for the Komudi full moon of the fourth month
And the bhikkhus of the countryside left in due course for SavatthI to see the Blessed One
And elder bhikkhus still more intensively taught and instructed new bhikkhus
some elder bhikkhus taught and instructed ten new bhikkhus some elder bhikkhus taught and instructed twenty thirty  forty new bhikkhus
And the new bhikkhus taught and instructed by the elder bhikkhus achieved successive stages of high distinction
On that occasion  the Uposatha day of the fifteenth the fullmoon night of the Komudi full moon of the fourth month  the Blessed One was seated in the open surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus
Then surveying the silent Sangha of bhikkhus he addressed them thus  Bhikkhus this assembly is free from prattle this assembly is free from chatter It consists purely of heartwood
Such is this Sangha of bhikkhus such is this assembly Such an assembly as is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation an incomparable field of merit for the world 
such is this Sangha of bhikkhus such is this assembly Such an assembly that a small gift given to it becomes great and a great gift greater 
such is this Sangha of bhikkhus such is this assembly Such an assembly as is rare for the world to see 
such is this Sangha of bhikkhus such is this assembly Such an assembly as would be worth journeying many leagues with a travelbag to see  such is this Sangha of bhikkhus such is this assembly
In this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who are arahants with taints destroyed who have lived the holy life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached the true goal destroyed the fetters of being and are completely liberated through final knowledge  such bhikkhus are there in this Sangha of bhikkhus

In this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who abide devoted to the development of mindfulness of breathing
Bhikkhus when mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it is of great fruit and great benefit
When mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it fulfils the four foundations of mindfulness
When the four foundations of mindfulness are developed and cultivated they fulfil the seven enlightenment factors
When the seven enlightenment factors are developed and cultivated they fulfil true knowledge and deliverance
And how bhikkhus is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is of great fruit and great benefit
Here a bhikkhu gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut sits down having folded his legs crosswise set his body erect and established mindfulness in front of him
ever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
Breathing in long he understands I breathe in long or breathing out long he understands I breathe out long Breathing in short he understands I breathe in short or breathing out short he under stands I breathe out short  He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body of breath he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body of breath  He trains thus I shall breathe in tranquillising the bodily formation he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquillising the bodily formation
  He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing rapture he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing rapture  He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing pleasure he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing pleasure  He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the mental formation he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing the mental formation  He train thus I shall breathe in tranquillising the mental formation he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquillising the mental formation
  He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the mind he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing the mind  He trains thus I shall breathe in gladdening the mind he trains thus I shall breathe out gladdening the mind  He trains thus I shall breathe in concentrating the mind he trains thus I shall breathe out concentrating the mind  He trains thus I shall breathe in liberating the mind he trains thus I shall breathe out liberating the mind
  He trains thus I shall breathe in contemplating impermanence he trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating impermanence  He trains thus I shall breathe in contemplating fading away he trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating fading away  He trains thus I shall breathe in contemplating cessation he trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating cessation  He trains thus I shall breathe in contemplating relinquishment he trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating relinquishment
   Bhikkhus that is how mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated so that it is of great fruit and great benefit
And how bhikkhus does mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated fulfil the four foundations of mindfulness
Bhikkhus on whatever occasion a bhikkhu breathing in long understands I breathe in long or breathing out long understands I breathe out long breathing in short understands I breathe in short or breathing out short understands I breathe out short trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body of breath trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body of breath trains thus I shall breathe in tranquillising the bodily formation trains thus I shall breathe out tranquillising the bodily formation  on that occasion a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world
I say that this is a certain body among the bodies namely inbreathing and outbreathing
That is why on that occasion a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world
Bhikkhus on whatever occasion a bhikkhu trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing rapture trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing rapture trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing pleasure trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing pleasure trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the mental formation trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing the mental formation trains thus I shall breathe in tranquillising the mental formation trains thus I shall breathe out tranquillising the mental formation  on that occasion a bhikkhu abides contemplating feelings as feelings ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world

I do not say that there is the development of mindfulness of breathing for one who is forgetful who is not fully aware
That is why on that occasion a bhikkhu abides contemplating mind as mind ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world
Bhikkhus on whatever occasion a bhikkhu trams thus I shall breathe in contemplating impermanence trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating impermanence trams thus I shall breathe in contemplating fading away trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating fading away trains thus I shall breathe in contemplating cessation trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating cessation trams thus I shall breathe in contemplating relinquishment trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating relinquishment  on that occasion a bhikkhu abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world
Having seen with wisdom the abandoning of covetousness and grief he closely looks on with equanimity
That is why on that occasion a bhikkhu abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world
Bhikkhus that is how mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated fulfils the four foundations of mindfulness
And how bhikkhus do the four foundations of mindfulness developed and cultivated fulfil the seven enlightenment factors
Bhikkhus on whatever occasion a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world  on that occasion unremitting mindfulness is established in him
On whatever occasion unremitting mindfulness is established in a bhikkhu  on that occasion the mindfulness enlightenment factor is aroused in him
and he develops it and by development it comes to fulfilment in him
Abiding thus mindful he investigates and examines that state with wisdom and embarks upon a full inquiry into it
On whatever occasion abiding thus mindful a bhikkhu investigates and examines that state with wisdom and embarks upon a full inquiry into it  on that occasion the investigationofstates enlightenment factor is aroused in him and he develops it and by development it comes to fulfilment in him
In one who investigates and examines that state with wisdom and embarks upon a full inquiry into it tireless energy is aroused
On whatever occasion tireless energy is aroused in a bhikkhu who investigates and examines that state with wisdom and embarks upon a full inquiry into it  on that occasion the energy enlightenment factor is aroused in him and he develops it and by development it comes to fulfilment in him
In one who has aroused energy unworldly rapture arises
On whatever occasion unworldly rapture arises in a bhikkhu who has aroused energy  on that occasion the rapture enlightenment factor is aroused in him and he develops it and by development it comes to fulfilment in him
In one who is rapturous the body and the mind become tranquil
On whatever occasion the body and the mind become tranquil in a bhikkhu who is rapturous  on that occasion the tranquillity enlightenment factor is aroused in him and he develops it and by development it comes to fulfilment in him
In one whose body is tranquil and who feels pleasure the mind becomes concentrated
On whatever occasion the mind becomes concentrated in a bhikkhu whose body is tranquil and who feels pleasure  on that occasion the concentration enlightenment factor is aroused in him and he develops it and by development it comes to fulfilment in him
He closely looks on with equanimity at the mind thus concentrated
On whatever occasion a bhikkhu closely looks on with equanimity at the mind thus concentrated  on that occasion the equanimity enlightenment factor is aroused in him and he develops it and by development it comes to fulfilment in him
Bhikkhus on whatever occasion a bhikkhu abides contemplating feelings as feelings mind as mind mindobject as mindobjects ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world

Bhikkhus that is how the four foundations of mindfulness developed and cultivated fulfil the seven enlightenment factors
And how bhikkhus do the seven enlightenment factors developed and cultivated fulfil true knowledge and deliverance
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu develops the mindfulness enlightenment factor which is supported by seclusion dispassion and cessation and ripens in relinquishment
He develops the investigationofstates enlightenment factor  the energy enlightenment factor  the rapture enlightenment factor  the tranquillity enlightenment factor  the concentration enlightenment factor  the equanimity enlightenment factor which is supported by seclusion dispassion and cessation and ripens in relinquishment
Bhikkhus that is how the seven enlightenment factors developed and cultivated fulfil true knowledge and deliverance
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monastery
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said Monks I will teach you the summary  exposition of one who has had an auspicious day
Listen  pay close attention I will speak
As you say lord the monks replied
The Blessed One said
You shouldnt chase after the past or place expectations on the future
What is past is left behind The future is as yet unreached
Whatever quality is present you clearly see right there right there
Not taken in unshaken thats how you develop the heart
Ardently doing what should be done today for  who knows  tomorrow death
There is no bargaining with Mortality  his mighty horde
Whoever lives thus ardently relentlessly both day  night
has truly had an auspicious day so says the Peaceful Sage
And how monks does one chase after the past
One gets carried away with the delight of In the past I had such a form  In the past I had such a feeling In the past I had such a perception In the past I had such a thoughtfabrication In the past I had such a consciousness This is called chasing after the past
And how does one not chase after the past
One does not get carried away with the delight of In the past I had such a form  In the past I had such a feeling In the past I had such a perception In the past I had such a thoughtfabrication In the past I had such a consciousness This is called not chasing after the past
And how does one place expectations on the future
One gets carried away with the delight of In the future I might have such a form  In the future I might have such a feeling In the future I might have such a perception In the future I might have such a thoughtfabrication In the future I might have such a consciousness This is called placing expectations on the future
And how does one not place expectations on the future
One does not get carried away with the delight of In the future I might have such a form  In the future I might have such a feeling In the future I might have such a perception In the future I might have such a thoughtfabrication In the future I might have such a consciousness This is called not placing expectations on the future
And how is one taken in with regard to present qualities
There is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person who has not seen the noble ones is not versed in the teachings of the noble ones is not trained in the teachings of the noble ones sees form as self or self as possessing form or form as in self or self as in form Heshe sees feeling as self or self as possessing feeling or feeling as in self or self as in feeling Heshe sees perception as self or self as possessing perception or perception as in self or self as in perception Heshe sees thoughtfabrications as self or self as possessing thoughtfabrications or thoughtfabrications as in self or self as in thoughtfabrications Heshe sees consciousness as self or self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousness This is called being taken in with regard to present qualities
And how is one not taken in with regard to present qualities
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones who has seen the noble ones is versed in the teachings of the noble ones is welltrained in the teachings of the noble ones does not see form as self or self as possessing form or form as in self or self as in form Heshe does not see feeling as self or self as possessing feeling or feeling as in self or self as in feeling Heshe does not see perception as self or self as possessing perception or perception as in self or self as in perception Heshe does not see thoughtfabrications as self or self as possessing thoughtfabrications or thoughtfabrications as in self or self as in thoughtfabrications Heshe does not see consciousness as self or self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousness This is called not being taken in with regard to present qualities
You shouldnt chase after the past or place expectations on the future
What is past is left behind The future is as yet unreached
Whatever quality is present you clearly see right there right there
Not taken in unshaken thats how you develop the heart
Ardently doing what should be done today for  who knows  tomorrow death
There is no bargaining with Mortality  his mighty horde
Whoever lives thus ardently relentlessly both day  night
has truly had an auspicious day so says the Peaceful Sage
Monks I will teach you the summary  exposition of one who has had an auspicious day Thus was it said and in reference to this was it said
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones words
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Benares in the Deer Park at Isipatana
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this

That is what the venerable Sariputta said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the venerable Sariputtas words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monastery
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks responded to him
Monks I will teach you the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end I will expound the holy life both in its particulars  in its essence entirely complete surpassingly pure  in other words the six sextets
Listen  pay close attention I will speak 
As you say lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said
The six internal media should be known The six external media should be known The six classes of consciousness should be known The six classes of contact should be known The six classes of feeling should be known The six classes of craving should be known
The six internal media should be known  Thus was it said
In reference to what was it said
The eyemedium the earmedium the nosemedium the tonguemedium the bodymedium the intellectmedium
The six internal media should be known  Thus was it said And in reference to this was it said
This is the first sextet
The six external media should be known  Thus was it said
In reference to what was it said
The formmedium the soundmedium the aromamedium the flavormedium the tactile sensationmedium the ideamedium
The six external media should be known  Thus was it said And in reference to this was it said
This is the second sextet
The six classes of consciousness should be known  Thus was it said
In reference to what was it said
Dependent on the eye  forms there arises consciousness at the eye Dependent on the ear  sounds there arises consciousness at the ear Dependent on the nose  aromas there arises consciousness at the nose Dependent on the tongue  flavors there arises consciousness at the tongue Dependent on the body  tactile sensations there arises consciousness at the body Dependent on the intellect  ideas there arises consciousness at the intellect
The six classes of consciousness should be known  Thus was it said And in reference to this was it said
This is the third sextet
The six classes of contact should be known  Thus was it said
In reference to what was it said
Dependent on the eye  forms there arises consciousness at the eye The meeting of the three is contact
The six classes of feeling should be known  Thus was it said
In reference to what was it said
Dependent on the eye  forms there arises consciousness at the eye The meeting of the three is contact With contact as a requisite condition there is feeling
The six classes of craving should be known  Thus was it said
In reference to what was it said
Dependent on the eye  forms there arises consciousness at the eye The meeting of the three is contact With contact as a requisite condition there is feeling With feeling as a requisite condition there is craving
If anyone were to say The eye is the self that wouldnt be tenable
The arising  falling away of the eye are discerned
And when its arising  falling away are discerned it would follow that My self arises  falls away
 Thats why it wouldnt be tenable if anyone were to say The eye is the self
 So the eye is notself
If anyone were to say Forms are the self that wouldnt be tenable
Thus the eye is notself and forms are notself
If anyone were to say Consciousness at the eye is the self that wouldnt be tenable
Thus the eye is notself forms are notself consciousness at the eye is notself
If anyone were to say Contact at the eye is the self that wouldnt be tenable
Thus the eye is notself forms are notself consciousness at the eye is notself contact at the eye is notself
If anyone were to say Feeling is the self that wouldnt be tenable
Thus the eye is notself forms are notself consciousness at the eye is notself contact at the eye is notself feeling is not self
If anyone were to say Craving is the self that wouldnt be tenable
The arising  falling away of craving are discerned
And when its arising  falling away are discerned it would follow that My self arises  falls away
 Thats why it wouldnt be tenable if anyone were to say Craving is the self
 Thus the eye is notself forms are notself consciousness at the eye is notself contact at the eye is notself feeling is not self craving is notself
If anyone were to say The ear is the self that wouldnt be tenable
If anyone were to say Ideas are the self that wouldnt be tenable
Thus the intellect is notself ideas are notself consciousness at the intellect is notself
Thus the intellect is notself ideas are notself consciousness at the intellect is notself contact at the intellect is notself
If anyone were to say Feeling is the self that wouldnt be tenable
Thus the intellect is notself ideas are notself consciousness at the intellect is notself contact at the intellect is notself feeling is not self
If anyone were to say Craving is the self that wouldnt be tenable
The arising  falling away of craving are discerned
And when its arising  falling away are discerned it would follow that My self arises  falls away
 Thats why it wouldnt be tenable if anyone were to say Craving is the self
 Thus the intellect is notself ideas are notself consciousness at the intellect is notself contact at the intellect is notself feeling is not self craving is notself
This monks is the path of practice leading to selfidentification One assumes about the eye that This is me this is my self this is what I am 
Dependent on the eye  forms there arises consciousness at the eye The meeting of the three is contact With contact as a requisite condition there arises what is felt either as pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain
If when touched by a feeling of pleasure one relishes it welcomes it or remains fastened to it
then ones passionobsession gets obsessed
If when touched by a feeling of pain one sorrows grieves  laments beats ones breast becomes distraught
then ones resistanceobsession gets obsessed
If when touched by a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain one does not discern as it actually is present the origination passing away allure drawback or escape from that feeling
then ones ignoranceobsession gets obsessed
That a person  without abandoning passionobsession with regard to a feeling of pleasure without abolishing resistanceobsession with regard to a feeling of pain without uprooting ignoranceobsession with regard to a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain without abandoning ignorance and giving rise to clear knowing  would put an end to suffering  stress in the here  now such a thing isnt possible
Dependent on the ear  sounds 
Dependent on the eye  forms there arises consciousness at the eye The meeting of the three is contact With contact as a requisite condition there arises what is felt either as pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain
If when touched by a feeling of pleasure one does not relish it welcome it or remain fastened to it
then ones passionobsession doesnt get obsessed
If when touched by a feeling of pain one does not sorrow grieve or lament beat ones breast or become distraught
then ones resistance obsession doesnt get obsessed
If when touched by a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain one discerns as it actually is present the origination passing away allure drawback  escape from that feeling
then ones ignoranceobsession doesnt get obsessed
That a person  through abandoning passionobsession with regard to a feeling of pleasure through abolishing resistanceobsession with regard to a feeling of pain through uprooting ignoranceobsession with regard to a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain through abandoning ignorance and giving rise to clear knowing  would put an end to suffering  stress in the here  now such a thing is possible
Dependent on the ear  sounds
Dependent on the nose  aromas
Dependent on the tongue  flavors
Dependent on the body  tactile sensations
Dependent on the intellect  ideas there arises consciousness at the intellect The meeting of the three is contact With contact as a requisite condition there arises what is felt either as pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain
If when touched by a feeling of pleasure one does not relish it welcome it or remain fastened to it
then ones passionobsession doesnt get obsessed
If when touched by a feeling of pain one does not sorrow grieve or lament beat ones breast or become distraught

Seeing thus the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with the eye disenchanted with forms disenchanted with consciousness at the eye disenchanted with contact at the eye disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with craving
He grows disenchanted with the ear
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted at his words
And while this explanation was being given the hearts of  monks through no clinging were fully released from fermentationeffluents
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monastery
And on that occasion Anathapindika the householder was diseased in pain severely ill
Then Anathapindika the householder said to one of his men Come my good man Go to the Blessed One and on arrival pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say Lord Anathapindika the householder is diseased in pain severely ill
He pays homage with his head to the Blessed Ones feet
Then go to Ven Sariputta and on arrival pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say Venerable sir Anathapindika the householder is diseased in pain severely ill
He pays homage with his head to your feet
Then say It would be good if Ven Sariputta would visit Anathapindikas home out of sympathy for him
Responding As you say lord to Anathapindika the householder the man went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said Lord Anathapindika the householder is diseased in pain severely ill
He pays homage with his head to the Blessed Ones feet

He pays homage with his head to Ven Sariputtas feet Then he said It would be good if Ven Sariputta would visit Anathapindikas home out of sympathy for him
Ven Sariputta acquiesced through silence
Then Ven Sariputta having put on his robes and taking his bowl  outer robe went to the home of Anathapindika the householder with Ven Ananda as his attendant On arrival he sat down on a prepared seat
and said to Anathapindika the householder I trust you are getting better householder I trust you are comfortable
I trust that your pains are lessening and not increasing I trust that there are signs of their lessening and not of their increasing
Anathapindika I am not getting better venerable sir I am not comfortable
My severe pains are increasing not lessening There are signs of their increasing and not of their lessening
Extreme forces slice through my head just as if a strong man were slicing my head open with a sharp sword
Extreme pains have arisen in my head just as if a strong man were tightening a turban on my head with a tough leather strap
Extreme forces carve up my stomach cavity just as if an expert butcher or his apprentice were to carve up the stomach cavity of an ox with a sharp butchers knife
There is an extreme burning in my body just as if two strong men seizing a weaker man with their arms were to roast and broil him over a pit of hot embers
I am not getting better venerable sir I am not comfortable
My severe pains are increasing not lessening There are signs of their increasing and not of their lessening

When this was said Anathapindika the householder wept and shed tears
Ven Ananda said to him Are you sinking householder Are you foundering 
No venerable sir Im not sinking nor am I foundering Its just that for a long time I have attended to the Teacher and to the monks who inspire my heart but never before have I heard a talk on the Dhamma like this
This sort of talk on the Dhamma householder is not given to lay people clad in white This sort of talk on the Dhamma is given to those gone forth
In that case Ven Sariputta please let this sort of talk on the Dhamma be given to lay people clad in white
There are clansmen with little dust in their eyes who are wasting away through not hearing this Dhamma There will be those who will understand it
Then Ven Sariputta and Ven Ananda having given this instruction to Anathapindika the householder got up from their seats and left
Then not long after they left Anathapindika the householder died and reappeared in the Tusita heaven
Then Anathapindika the devas son in the far extreme of the night his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jetas Grove went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to him and stood to one side
As he was standing there he addressed the Blessed One with this verse
This blessed Jetas Grove home to the community of seers
where there dwells the Dhamma King the source of rapture for me
Action clearknowing  mental qualities virtue the highest way of life
through this are mortals purified not through clan or wealth
Thus the wise seeing their own benefit
investigating the Dhamma appropriately should purify themselves right there
As for Sariputta in discernment virtue  calm
any monk who has gone beyond at best can only equal him
That is what Anathapindika the devas son said
The Teacher approved
Then Anathapindika the devas son knowing The Teacher has approved of me bowed down to him circled him three times keeping him to his right and then disappeared right there
Then when the night had past The Blessed One addressed the monks Last night monks a certain devas son in the far extreme of the night his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jetas Grove came to me and on arrival bowed down to me and stood to one side
As he was standing there he addressed me with this verse
This blessed Jetas Grove home to the community of seers
where there dwells the Dhamma King the source of rapture for me
Action clearknowing  mental qualities virtue the highest way of life
through this are mortals purified not through clan or wealth
Thus the wise seeing their own benefit
investigating the Dhamma appropriately should purify themselves right there
As for Sariputta in discernment virtue  calm
any monk who has gone beyond at best can only equal him
That is what the devas son said
And thinking The Teacher has approved of me he bowed down to me circled me three times and then disappeared right there
When this was said Ven Ananda said to the Blessed One Lord that must have been Anathapindika the devas son
Anathapindika the householder had supreme confidence in Ven Sariputta
Very good Ananda Very good
to the extent that you have deduced what can be arrived at through logic
That was Anathapindika the devas son and no one else
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Ven Ananda delighted in the Blessed Ones words
THUS HAVE I HEARD  On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Kuru country at a town of the Kurus named Kammasadhamma
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this
Bhikkhus this is the direct path  for the purification of beings  for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation for the disappearance of pain and grief for the attainment of the true way for the realisation of Nibbana  namely the four foundations of mindfulness 
What are the four
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu  abides contemplating the body as a body ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world  He abides contemplating feelings as feelings ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world He abides contemplating mind as mind ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world He abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary
Then the lay follower Visakha went to the bhikkhuni Dhammadinna and after paying homage to her he sat downat one side and asked her
Lady personality personality is said
What is called personality by the Blessed One 
Friend Visakha these five aggregates affected by clinging are called personality by the Blessed One that is the material form aggregate affected by clinging the feeling aggregate affected by clinging the perception aggregate affected by clinging the formations aggregate affected by clinging and the consciousness aggregate affected by clinging
These five aggregates affected by clinging are called personality by the Blessed One
Saying Good lady the lay follower Visakha delighted and rejoiced in the bhikkhunl Dhammadinnas words Then he asked her a further question   Lady origin of personality origin of personality is said
What is called the origin of personality by the Blessed One 
Friend Visakha it is craving which brings renewal of being is accompanied by delight and lust and delights in this and that that is craving for sensual pleasures craving for being and craving for nonbeing This is called the origin of personality by the Blessed One
 Lady cessation of personality cessation of personality Is said
What is called the cessation of personality by the Blessed One 
Friend Visakha it is the remainderless fading away and ceasing the giving up relinquishing letting go and rejecting of that same craving This is called the cessation of personality by the Blessed One
Lady the way leading to the cessation of personality the way leading to the cessation of personality is said
What is called the way leading to the cessation of personality by the Blessed One 
Friend Visakha it is just this Noble Eightfold Path that is right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
Lady is that clinging the same as these five aggregates affected by clinging or is the clinging something apart from the five aggregates affected by clinging 
Friend Visakha that clinging is neither the same as these five aggregates affected by clinging nor is clinging something apart from the five aggregates affected by clinging
It is the desire and lust in regard to the five aggregates affected by clinging that is the clinging there
Lady how does personality view come to be 
Here friend Visakha an untaught ordinary person who has no regard for noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma regards material form as self or self as possessed of material form or material form as in self or self as in material form
He regards feeling as self or self as possessed of feeling or feeling as in self or self as in feeling He regards perception as self or self as possessed of perception or perception as in self or self as in perception He regards formations as self or self as possessed of formations or formations as in self or self as in formations He regards consciousness as self or self as possessed of consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousness
That is how personality view comes to be
Lady how does personality view not come to be 
Here friend Visakha a welltaught noble disciple who has regard for noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma does not regard material form as self or self as possessed of material form or material form as in self or self as in material form
He does not regard feeling as self or self as possessed of feeling or feeling as in self or self as in feeling He does not regard perception as self or self as possessed of perception or perception as in self or self as in perception He does not regard formations as self or self as possessed of formations or formations as in self or self as in formations He does not regard consciousness as self or self as possessed of consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousness
Lady what is the Noble Eightfold Path 
Friend Visakha it is just this Noble Eightfold Path that is right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
Lady is the Noble Eightfold Path conditioned or unconditioned 
Lady are the three aggregates included by the Noble Eightfold Path or is the Noble Eightfold Path included by the three aggregates 
The three aggregates are not included by the Noble Eightfold Path friend Visakha but the Noble Eightfold Path is included by the three aggregates
Right speech right action and right livelihood  these states are included in the aggregate of virtue
Right effort right mindfulness and right concentration  these states are included in the aggregate of concentration
Right view and right intention  these states are included in the aggregate of wisdom
Lady what is concentration What is the basis of concentration What is the equipment of concentration What is the development of concentration 
Unification of mind friend Visakha is concentration the four foundations of mindfulness are the basis of concentration the four right kinds of striving are the equipment of concentration
the repetition development and cultivation of these same states is the development of concentration therein
Lady how many formations are there 
There are these three formations friend Visakha the bodily formation the verbal formation and the mental formation
But lady what is the bodily formation What is the verbal formation What is the mental formation 
Ihbreathing and outbreathing friend Visakha are the bodily formation applied thought and sustained thought are the verbal formation perception and feeling are the mental formation
But lady why are inbreathing and outbreathing the bodily formation Why are applied thought and sustained thought the verbal formation Why are perception and feeling the mental formation 
Friend Visakha inbreathing and outbreathing are bodily these are states bound up with the body that is why inbreathing and outbreathing are the bodily formation
First one applies thought and sustains thought and subsequently one breaks out into speech that is why applied thought and sustained thought are the verbal formation
Perception and feeling are mental these are states bound up with the mind that is why perception and feeling are the mental formation
Lady how does the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling come to be 
Friend Visakha when a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and feeling it does not occur to him I shall attain the cessation of perception and feeling or I am attaining the cessation of perception and feeling or I have attained the cessation of perception and feeling
Lady when a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and feeling which states cease first in him the bodily formation the verbal formation or the mental formation 
Friend Visakha when a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and feeling first the verbal formation ceases then the bodily formation then the mental formation
Lady how does emergence from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling come to be 
Friend Visakha when a bhikkhu is emerging from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling it does not occur to him I shall emerge from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling or I am emerging from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling or I have emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling
but rather his mind has previously been developed in such a way that it leads him to that state
Lady when a bhikkhu is emerging from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling which states arise first in him the bodily formation the verbal formation or the mental formation 
Friend Visakha whert a bhikkhu is emerging from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling first the mental formation arises then the bodily formation then the verbal formation
Lady when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling how many kinds of contact touch him 
Friend Visakha when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling three kinds of contact touch him voidness contact signless contact desireless contact
Lady when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling to what does his mind incline to what does it lean to what does it tend 
Friend Visakha when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling his mind inclines to seclusion leans to seclusion tends to seclusion
Lady how many kinds of feeling are there 
Friend Visakha there are three kinds of feeling pleasant feeling painful feeling and neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
But lady what is pleasant feeling What is painful feeling What is neither painfulnorpleasant feeling 
Friend Visakha whatever is felt bodily or mentally as pleasant and soothing is pleasant feeling
Whatever is felt bodily or mentally as painful and hurting is painful feeling
Whatever is felt bodily or mentally as neither soothing nor hurting is neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
Lady what is pleasant and what is painful in regard to pleasant feeling What is painful and what is pleasant in regard to painful feeling What is pleasant and what is painful in regard to neitherpairtfulnorpleasant feeling 
Friend Visakha pleasant feeling is pleasant when it persists and painful when it changes Painful feeling is painful when it persists and pleasant when it changes Neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling is pleasant when there is knowledge of it and painful when there is no knowledge of it
Lady what underlying tendency underlies pleasant feeling What underlying tendency underlies painful feeling What underlying tendency underlies neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling 
Friend Visakha the underlying tendency to lust underlies pleasant feeling The underlying tendency to aversion underlies painful feeling The underlying tendency to ignorance underlies neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
Lady does the underlying tendency to lust underlie all pleasant feeling Does the underlying tendency to aversion underlie all painful feeling Does the underlying tendency to ignorance underlie all neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling 
Friend Visakha the underlying tendency to lust does not underlie all pleasant feeling The underlying tendency to aversion does not underlie all painful feeling The underlying tendency to ignorance does not underlie all neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
Lady what should be abandoned in regard to pleasant feeling What should be abandoned in regard to painful feeling What should be abandoned in regard to neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling 
Friend Visakha the underlying tendency to lust should be abandoned in regard to pleasant feeling The underlying tendency to aversion should be abandoned in regard to painful feeling The underlying tendency to ignorance should be abandoned in regard to neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
Lady does the underlying tendency to lust have to be abandoned in regard to all pleasant feeling Does the underlying tendency to aversion have to be abandoned in regard to all painful feeling Does the underlying tendency to ignorance have to be abandoned in regard to all neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling 
Friend Visakha the underlying tendency to lust does not have to be abandoned in regard to all pleasant feeling The underlying tendency to aversion does not have to be abandoned in regard to all painful feeling The underlying tendency to ignorance does not have to be abandoned in regard to all neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
Here friend Visakha quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana jwhich is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
With that he abandons lust and the underlying tendency to lust does not underlie that
Here a bhikkhu considers thus When shall I enter upon and abide in that base that the noble ones now enter upon and abide in
 In one who thus generates a longing for the supreme liberations grief arises with that longing as condition
With that he abandons aversion and the underlying tendency to aversion does not underlie that
Here with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana which has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
With that he abandons ignorance and the underlying tendency to ignorance does not underlie that
Lady what is the counterpart of pleasant feeling 
Friend Visakha painful feeling is the counterpart of pleasant feeling
What is the counterpart of painful feeling 
Pleasant feeling is the counterpart of painful feeling
What is the counterpart of neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling 
Ignorance is the counterpart of neitherpainfulnor pleasant feeling
What is the counterpart of ignorance 
True knowledge is the counterpart of ignorance
What is the counterpart of true knowledge 
Deliverance is the counterpart of true knowledge
What is the counterpart of deliverance 
Nibbana is the counterpart of deliverance
Lady what is the counterpart of Nibbana 
Friend Visakha you have pushed this line of questioning too far you were not able to grasp the limit to questions
For the holy life friend Visakha merges in Nibbana culminates in Nibbana ends in Nibbana
If you wish friend Visakha go to the Blessed One and ask him about the meaning of this As the Blessed One explains it to you so you should remember it
Then the lay follower Visakha having delighted and rejoiced in the bhikkhuni Dhammadinnas words rose from his seat and after paying homage to her keeping her on his right he went to the Blessed One
After paying homage to him he sat down at one side and told the Blessed One his entire conversation with the bhikkhuni Dhammadinna
When he finished speaking the Blessed One told him  The bhikkhuni Dhammadinna is wise Visakha the bhikkhuni Dhammadinna has great wisdom
If you had asked me the meaning of this I would have explained it to you in the same way that the bhikkhuni Dhammadinna has explained it
Such is its meaning
That is what the Blessed One said
The lay follower Visakha was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
That is how personality view does not come to be
Friend Visakha the Noble Eightfold Path is conditioned
And how bhikkhus does a bhikkhu abide contemplating the body as a body
Here a bhikkhu gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut sits down having folded his legs crosswise set his body erect and established mindfulness in front of him
ever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
Breathing in long he understand wreathe in long or breathing out long he understands I breathe out long
Breathing in short he understands I breathe in short or breathing out short he understands I breathe out short
He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body of breath he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body of breath
He trains thus I shall breathe in tranquillizing the bodily formation he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquillizing the bodily formation
Just as a skilled turner or his apprentice when making a long turn understands I make a long turn or when making a short turn understands I make a short turn so too breathing in long
a bhikkhu understands I breathe in long
he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquillizing the bodily formation
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally or he abides contemplating the body as a body externally or he abides contemplating the body as a body both internally and externally  Or else he abides contemplating in the body its arising factors or he abides contemplating in the body its vanishing factors or he abides contemplating in the body both its arising and vanishing factors
Or else mindfulness that there is a body is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
but rather his mind has previously been developed in such a way that it leads him to that state
Again bhikkhus when walking a bhikkhu understands I am walking when standing he understands I am standing when sitting he understands I am sitting when lying down he understands I am lying down
or he understands accordingly however his body is disposed
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally externally and both internally and externally
And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
and so you should remember it
Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu is one who acts in full awareness when going forward and returning  who acts in full aware ness when looking ahead and looking away who acts in full awareness when flexing and extending his limbs who acts in full awareness when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl who acts in full awareness when eating drink ing consuming food and tasting who acts in full awareness when defecating and urinating who acts in full awareness when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and keeping silent
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally externally and both internally and externally  
And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha at Isigili  the Gullet of the Seers
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied The Blessed One said this
You see bhikkhus do you not that mountain Vebhara
 Yes venerable sir
There used to be another name another designation for that mountain Vebhara
You see bhikkhus do you not that mountain Pandava 
Yes venerable sir
There used to be another name another designation for that mountain Pandava
You see bhikkhus do you not that mountain Vepulla
 Yes venerable sir
There used to be another name another designation for that mountain Vepulla
You see bhikkhus do you not that mountain Gijjhakuta  the Vulture Peak
 Yes venerable sir
There used to be another name another designation for that mountain Gijjhakuta  the Vulture Peak
You see bhikkhus do you not that mountain Isigili  the Gullet of the Seers 
Yes venerable sir
There used to be this same name this same designation for this mountain Isigili  the Gullet of the Seers
For in former times five hundred paccekabuddhas dwelt long on this mountain the Gullet of the Seers
They were seen entering into this hill once gone in they were no longer seen
People who saw this said This mountain swallows up these seers And so it was that this came to be named The Gullet of the Seers
I shall tell you bhikkhus the names of the paccekabuddhas I shall relate to you the names of the paccekabuddhas I shall teach you the names of the paccekabuddhas
Listen and attend closely to what I shall say 
Yes venerable sir the bhikkhus replied
The Blessed One said this
Bhikkhus the paccekabuddha Arittha dwelt long on this mountain Isigili The paccekabuddha Uparittha dwelt long on this mountain Isigili The paccekabuddha Tagarasikhin Yasassin Sudassana Piyadassin Gandhara Pindola Upasabha Nitha Tatha Sutava Bhavitatta dwelt long on this mountain Isigili
Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu reviews this same body up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair bounded by skin as full of many kinds of impurity thus
In this body there are headhairs bodyhairs nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bonemarrow kidneys heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs large intestines small intestines contents of the stomach feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease spittle snot oil of the joints and urine
Just as though there were a bag with an opening at both ends full of many sorts of grain such as hill rice red rice beans peas millet and white rice and a man with good eyes were to open it and review it thus This is hill rice this is red rice these are beans these are peas this is millet this is white rice
so too a bhikkhu reviews this same bodyas full of many kinds of impurity thus
In this body there are headhairsand urine
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally externally and both internally and externally 
And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
These saintly beings desireless rid of suffering
Who each achieved awakening by himself 
Hear me relate the names of these the greatest Of men
who have plucked out the dart of pain
Arittha Uparittha Tagarasikhin Yasassin

Two sages named Jali and Atthaka
Then Kosala the enlightened then Subahu
Upanemi and Nemi and Santacitta
Right and true immaculate and wise

Anga and Panga and Gutijjita too
Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu reviews this same body how ever it is placed however disposed as consisting of elements thus In this body there are the earth element the water element the fire element and the air element
Just as though a skilled butcher or his apprentice had killed a cow and was seated at the crossroads with it cut up into pieces
so too a bhikkhu reviews this same bodyas consisting of elements thus In this body there are the earth element the water element the fire element and the air element
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally externally and both internally and externally 
And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
Passin conquered attachment the root of suffering
Aparajita conquered Maras power
Satthar Pavattar Sarabhanga Lomahamsa
Uccangamaya Asita Anasava
Manomaya and Bandhumant the free from pride
Tadadhimutta stainless and resplendent

Asayha Khemabhirata and Sorata
Durannaya Sangha and then Ujjaya
Another sage Sayha of noble endeavour
And twelve between  Anandas Nandas and Upanandas 
And Bharadvaja bearing his last body
Then Bodhi Mahanama the supreme
Bharadvaja with faircrested mane
Tissa and Upatissa not bound to being
Upasidarin and Sidarin free from craving
Enlightened was Mangala free from lust
Usabha cut the net the root of suffering
Upanita attained the state of peace
Purified excellent truly named
Jeta Jayanta Paduma and Uppala
Padumuttara Rakkhita and Pabbata
Manatthaddha glorious Vitaraga
And Kanha enlightened with mind released
These and also other great and mighty
Paccekabuddhas no more led to being 
Honour these sages who transcending craving
Have attained final Nibbana past all measure
Againbhikkhus as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground one two or three days dead bloated livid and oozing matter
a bhikkhu compares this same body with it thus This body too is of the same nature it will be like that it is not exempt from that fate
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally externally and both internally and externally 
And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
Again as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground being devoured by crows hawks vultures dogs jackals or various kinds of worms

Here a bhikkhu abides con templating mindobjects as mindobjects in terms of the five hindrances
And how does a bhikkhu abide contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in terms of the five hindrances
Here there being sensual desire in him a bhikkhu understands There is sensual desire in me or there being no sensual desire in him he understands There is no sensual desire in me

Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in terms of the five aggregates affected by clinging
And how does a bhikkhu abide contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in terms of the five aggregates affected by clinging
Here a bhikkhu understands Such is material form such its origin such its disappearance such is feeling such its origin such its disappearance such is perception such its origifi such its disappearance such are the formations such their origin such their disappearance such is consciousness such its origin such its disappearance
In this way he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects internally externally and both internally and externally

Bhikkhus if anyone should develop these four foundations of mindfulness in such a way for seven years one of two fruits could be expected for him either final knowledge here and now or if there is a trace of clinging left nonreturn
Let alone seven years bhikkhus
If anyone should develop these four foundations of mindfulness in such a way for six years for five years for four years for three years for two years for one year Let alone one year bhikkhus

Bhikkhus this is the direct path for the purification of beings for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation for the disappearance of pain and grief for the attainment of the true way for the realisation of Nibbana  namely the four foundations of mindfulness
So it was with reference to this that it was said
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living among the Kurus Now the Kurus have a town named Kammasadhamma
There Ven Ananda approached the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Its amazing lord its astounding
how deep this dependent coarising is and how deep its appearance and yet to me it seems as clear as clear can be
The Buddha Dont say that Ananda Dont say that
Deep is this dependent coarising and deep its appearance
Its because of not understanding and not penetrating this Dhamma that this generation is like a tangled skein a knotted ball of string like matted rushes and reeds and does not go beyond transmigration beyond the planes of deprivation woe and bad destinations
If one is asked Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for aging and death  one should answer There is
If one is asked From what requisite condition do aging and death come  one should say Aging and death come from birth as their requisite condition
If one is asked Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for birth  one should answer There is
If one is asked From what requisite condition does birth come  one should say Birth comes from becoming as its requisite condition
If one is asked Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for becoming  one should answer There is
If one is asked From what requisite condition does becoming come  one should say Becoming comes from clinging as its requisite condition
If one is asked Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for clinging  one should answer There is
If one is asked From what requisite condition does clinging come  one should say Clinging comes from craving as its requisite condition
If one is asked Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for craving  one should answer There is
If one is asked From what requisite condition does craving come  one should say Craving comes from feeling as its requisite condition
If one is asked Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for feeling  one should answer There is
If one is asked From what requisite condition does feeling come  one should say Feeling comes from contact as its requisite condition
If one is asked Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for contact  one should answer There is
If one is asked From what requisite condition does contact come  one should say Contact comes from nameandform as its requisite condition
If one is asked Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for nameandform  one should answer There is
If one is asked From what requisite condition does nameandform come  one should say Nameandform comes from consciousness as its requisite condition
If one is asked Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for consciousness  one should answer There is
If one is asked From what requisite condition does consciousness come  one should say Consciousness comes from nameandform as its requisite condition
Thus Ananda from nameandform as a requisite condition comes consciousness From consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameandform From nameandform as a requisite condition comes contact From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging From clinging as a requisite condition comes becoming From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth From birth as a requisite condition aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair come into play
Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress
From birth as a requisite condition come aging and death Thus it has been said And this is the way to understand how from birth as a requisite condition come aging and death
If there were no birth at all in any way of anything anywhere  i e  of devas in the state of devas of celestials in the state of celestials of spirits in the state of spirits of demons in the state of demons of human beings in the human state of quadrupeds in the state of quadrupeds of birds in the state of birds of snakes in the state of snakes or of any being in its own state 
in the utter absence of birth from the cessation of birth would aging and death be discerned
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for aging and death i e  birth
From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth Thus it has been said And this is the way to understand how from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth
If there were no becoming at all in any way of anything anywhere  i e  sensual becoming form becoming or formless becoming  in the utter absence of becoming from the cessation of becoming would birth be discerned 
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for birth i e  becoming
From clinging as a requisite condition comes becoming Thus it has been said And this is the way to understand how from clinging as a requisite condition comes becoming
If there were no clinging at all in any way of anything anywhere  i e  clinging to sensuality clinging to precepts and practices clinging to views or clinging to doctrines of the self  in the utter absence of clinging from the cessation of clinging would becoming be discerned 
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for becoming i e  clinging
From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging Thus it has been said And this is the way to understand how from craving as a requisite condition comes clinging
If there were no craving at all in any way of anything anywhere  i e  craving for sensuality craving for becoming craving for no becoming  in the utter absence of craving from the cessation of craving would clinging be discerned 
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for clinging i e  craving 
From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving Thus it has been said And this is the way to understand how from feeling as a requisite condition comes craving
If there were no feeling at all in any way of anything anywhere  i e  feeling born of contact at the eye feeling born of contact at the ear feeling born of contact at the nose feeling born of contact at the tongue feeling born of contact at the body or feeling born of contact at the intellect  in the utter absence of feeling from the cessation of feeling would craving be discerned 
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for craving i e  feeling
Now craving is dependent on feeling seeking is dependent on craving acquisition is dependent on seeking ascertainment is dependent on acquisition desire and passion is dependent on ascertainment attachment is dependent on desire and passion possessiveness is dependent on attachment stinginess is dependent on possessiveness defensiveness is dependent on stinginess
and because of defensiveness dependent on defensiveness various evil unskillful phenomena come into play the taking up of sticks and knives conflicts quarrels and disputes accusations divisive speech and lies
And this is the way to understand how it is that because of defensiveness various evil unskillful phenomena come into play the taking up of sticks and knives conflicts quarrels and disputes accusations divisive speech and lies
If there were no defensiveness at all in any way of anything anywhere in the utter absence of defensiveness from the cessation of defensiveness would various evil unskillful phenomena  the taking up of sticks and knives conflicts quarrels and disputes accusations divisive speech and lies  come into play
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for the comingintoplay of various evil unskillful phenomena  the taking up of sticks and knives conflicts quarrels and disputes accusations divisive speech and lies  i e  defensiveness
Defensiveness is dependent on stinginess Thus it has been said And this is the way to understand how defensiveness is dependent on stinginess
If there were no stinginess at all in any way of anything anywhere in the utter absence of stinginess from the cessation of stinginess would defensiveness be discerned 
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for defensiveness i e  stinginess
Seeking is dependent on craving Thus it has been said And this is the way to understand how seeking is dependent on craving
If there were no craving at all in any way of anything anywhere  i e  craving for sensuality craving for becoming craving for no becoming  in the utter absence of craving from the cessation of craving would seeking be discerned 
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for seeking i e  craving
Thus Ananda these two phenomena the chain of conditions leading from craving to birth aging and death and the chain of conditions leading from craving to quarrels etc as a duality flow back into one place at feeling
From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling Thus it has been said And this is the way to understand how from contact as a requisite condition comes feeling
If there were no contact at all in any way of anything anywhere  i e  contact at the eye contact at the ear contact at the nose contact at the tongue contact at the body or contact at the intellect  in the utter absence of contact from the cessation of contact would feeling be discerned 
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for feeling i e  contact
From nameform as a requisite condition comes contact Thus it has been said And this is the way to understand how from nameform as a requisite condition comes contact
If the qualities traits themes  indicators by which there is a description of namegroup were all absent would designationcontact with regard to the formgroup be discerned 
No lord
If the permutations signs themes and indicators by which there is a description of formgroup were all absent would resistancecontact with regard to the namegroup be discerned 
No lord
If the permutations signs themes and indicators by which there is a description of namegroup and formgroup were all absent would designationcontact or resistancecontact be discerned 
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for contact i e  nameandform
From consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameandform Thus it has been said And this is the way to understand how from consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameandform
If consciousness were not to descend into the mothers womb would nameandform take shape in the womb 
No lord
If after descending into the womb consciousness were to depart would nameandform be produced for this world 
No lord
If the consciousness of the young boy or girl were to be cut off would nameandform ripen grow and reach maturity 
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for nameandform i e  consciousness
From nameandform as a requisite condition comes consciousness Thus it has been said And this is the way to understand how from nameandform as a requisite condition comes consciousness
If consciousness were not to gain a foothold in nameandform would a comingintoplay of the origination of birth aging death and stress in the future be discerned
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for consciousness i e  nameandform
This is the extent to which there is birth aging death passing away and rearising
This is the extent to which there are means of designation expression and delineation This is the extent to which the sphere of discernment extends the extent to which the cycle revolves for the manifesting of this world  ie nameandform together with consciousness
To what extent Ananda does one delineate when delineating a self
Either delineating a self possessed of form and finite one delineates that My self is possessed of form and finite
Or delineating a self possessed of form and infinite one delineates that My self is possessed of form and infinite
Or delineating a self formless and finite one delineates that My self is formless and finite
Or delineating a self formless and infinite one delineates that My self is formless and infinite
Now the one who when delineating a self delineates it as possessed of form and finite
either delineates it as possessed of form and finite in the present or of such a nature that it will naturally become possessed of form and finite in the futureafter death or he believes that Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way
This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and finite obsesses him
The one who when delineating a self delineates it as possessed of form and infinite
either delineates it as possessed of form and infinite in the present or of such a nature that it will naturally become possessed of form and infinite in the futureafter death or he believes that Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way
This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and infinite obsesses him
The one who when delineating a self delineates it as formless and finite
either delineates it as formless and finite in the present or of such a nature that it will naturally become formless and finite in the futureafter death or he believes that Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way
This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self formless and finite obsesses him
The one who when delineating a self delineates it as formless and infinite
either delineates it as formless and infinite in the present or of such a nature that it will naturally become formless and infinite in the futureafter death or he believes that Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way
This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self formless and infinite obsesses him
To what extent Ananda does one not delineate when not delineating a self
Either not delineating a self possessed of form and finite one does not delineate that My self is possessed of form and finite
Or not delineating a self possessed of form and infinite one does not delineate that My self is possessed of form and infinite
Or not delineating a self formless and finite one does not delineate that My self is formless and finite
Or not delineating a self formless and infinite one does not delineate that My self is formless and infinite
Now the one who when not delineating a self does not delineate it as possessed of form and finite
does not delineate it as possessed of form and finite in the present nor does he delineate it as of such a nature that it will naturally become possessed of form and finite in the futureafter death nor does he believe that Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way
This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and finite does not obsess him
The one who when not delineating a self does not delineate it as possessed of form and infinite
does not delineate it as possessed of form and infinite in the present nor does he delineate it as of such a nature that it will naturally become possessed of form and infinite in the futureafter death nor does he believe that Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way
This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and infinite does not obsess him
The one who when not delineating a self does not delineate it as formless and finite
does not delineate it as formless and finite in the present nor does he delineate it as of such a nature that it will naturally become formless and finite in the futureafter death nor does he believe that Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way
This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self formless and finite does not obsess him
The one who when not delineating a self does not delineate it as formless and infinite
does not delineate it as formless and infinite in the present nor does he delineate it as of such a nature that it will naturally become formless and infinite in the futureafter death nor does he believe that Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way
This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self formless and infinite does not obsess him
To what extent Ananda does one assume when assuming a self
Assuming feeling to be the self one assumes that Feeling is my self
or Feeling is not my self My self is oblivious to feeling
or Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious to feeling but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling
Now one who says Feeling is my self should be addressed as follows There are these three feelings my friend  feelings of pleasure feelings of pain and feelings of neither pleasure nor pain
Which of these three feelings do you assume to be the self
At a moment when a feeling of pleasure is sensed no feeling of pain or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed Only a feeling of pleasure is sensed at that moment
At a moment when a feeling of pain is sensed no feeling of pleasure or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed Only a feeling of pain is sensed at that moment
At a moment when a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed no feeling of pleasure or of pain is sensed Only a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed at that moment
Now a feeling of pleasure is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessation
A feeling of pain is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessation
A feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessation
Having sensed a feeling of pleasure as my self
then with the cessation of ones very own feeling of pleasure my self has perished
Having sensed a feeling of pain as my self
then with the cessation of ones very own feeling of pain my self has perished
Having sensed a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain as my self
then with the cessation of ones very own feeling of neither pleasure nor pain my self has perished
Thus he assumes assuming in the immediate present a self inconstant entangled in pleasure and pain subject to arising and passing away he who says Feeling is my self
Thus in this manner Ananda one does not see fit to assume feeling to be the self
As for the person who says Feeling is not the self My self is oblivious to feeling he should be addressed as follows My friend where nothing whatsoever is sensed at all would there be the thought I am 
No lord
Thus in this manner Ananda one does not see fit to assume that Feeling is not my self My self is oblivious to feeling
As for the person who says Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious to feeling but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling
he should be addressed as follows My friend should feelings altogether and every way stop without remainder
then with feeling completely not existing owing to the cessation of feeling would there be the thought I am
No lord
Thus in this manner Ananda one does not see fit to assume that Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious to feeling but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling
Now Ananda in as far as a monk does not assume feeling to be the self nor the self as oblivious nor that My self feels in that my self is subject to feeling
then not assuming in this way he is not sustained by anything in the world Unsustained he is not agitated Unagitated he is totally unbound right within He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for this world
If anyone were to say with regard to a monk whose mind is thus released that The Tathagata exists after death is his view that would be mistaken
that The Tathagata does not exist after death
that The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death
that The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death is his view that would be mistaken
Why
Having directly known the extent of designation and the extent of the objects of designation the extent of expression and the extent of the objects of expression the extent of description and the extent of the objects of description the extent of discernment and the extent of the objects of discernment the extent to which the cycle revolves Having directly known that the monk is released To say that The monk released having directly known that does not see does not know is his opinion that would be mistaken
Ananda there are these seven stations of consciousness and two spheres
Which seven
There are beings with diversity of body and diversity of perception such as human beings some devas and some beings in the lower realms
This is the first station of consciousness
There are beings with diversity of body and singularity of perception such as the devas of the Brahma hosts generated by the first jhana and some beings in the four realms of deprivation
This is the second station of consciousness
There are beings with singularity of body and diversity of perception such as the Radiant Devas
This is the third station of consciousness
There are beings with singularity of body and singularity of perception such as the Beautifully Lustrous Devas
This is the fourth station of consciousness
There are beings whowith the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving Infinite space arrive at the dimension of the infinitude of space
This is the fifth station of consciousness
There are beings who with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space perceiving Infinite consciousness arrive at the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
This is the sixth station of consciousness
There are beings who with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness perceiving There is nothing arrive at the dimension of nothingness
This is the seventh station of consciousness
The dimension of nonpercipient beings and second the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception These are the two spheres
Now as for the first station of consciousness  beings with diversity of body and diversity of perception such as human beings some devas and some beings in the lower realms
If one discerns that station of consciousness discerns its origination discerns its passing away discerns its allure discerns its drawbacks discerns the escape from it would it be proper by means of that discernment to take delight there 
No lord
Ananda when knowing  as they actually are  the origination passing away allure drawbacks of  and escape from  these seven stations of consciousness and two spheres a monk is released through lack of clinging he is said to be a monk released through discernment
Ananda there are these eight emancipations
Which eight
Possessed of form one sees forms This is the first emancipation
Not percipient of form internally one sees forms externally This is the second emancipation
One is intent only on the beautiful This is the third emancipation
With the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving Infinite space one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space This is the fourth emancipation
With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space perceiving Infinite consciousness one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness This is the fifth emancipation
With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness perceiving There is nothing one enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness This is the sixth emancipation
With the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness one enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception This is the seventh emancipation
With the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception one enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling This is the eighth emancipation
Now when a monk attains these eight emancipations in forward order in reverse order in forward and reverse order when he attains them and emerges from them wherever he wants however he wants and for as long as he wants
when through the ending of the mental fermentations he enters and remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease and discernmentrelease having directly known it and realized it in the here and now he is said to be a monk released in both ways
And as for another release in both ways higher or more sublime than this there is none
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Ven Ananda delighted in the Blessed Ones words

These bhikkhus are those trifling and insignificant matters those minor details of mere moral virtue that a worldling would refer to when speaking in praise of the Tathāgata
There are monks other matters profound hard to see hard to understand peaceful excellent beyond mere thought subtle to be experienced by the wise which the Tathagata having realised them by his own superknowledge proclaims and about which those who would truthfully praise the Tathagata would rightly speak
And what are these matters
There are monks some ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the past having fixed views about the past and who put forward various speculative theories about the past in eighteen different ways
On what basis on what grounds do they do so
There are bhikkhus other dhammas deep difficult to see difficult to understand peaceful and sublime beyond the sphere of reasoning subtle comprehensible only to the wise which the Tathāgata having realized for himself with direct knowledge propounds to others and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speak
And what are these dhammas
There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the past who hold settled views about the past and who on eighteen grounds assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past
And owing to what with reference to what do these honourable recluses and brahmins frame their speculations
There are some ascetics and Brahmins who are Eternalists who proclaim the eternity of the self and the world in four ways
On what grounds
Wrong view  Here monks a certain ascetic or Brahmin has by means of effort exertion application earnestness and right attention attained to such a state of mental concentration that he thereby recalls past existences 
one birth two births three four five ten births a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand births several hundred several thousand several hundred thousand births There my name was soandso my clan was soandso my caste was soandso my food was suchandsuch I experienced suchandsuch pleasant and painful conditions I lived for so long Having passed away from there I arose there There my name was so andso   And having passed away from there I arose here
Thus he remembers various past lives their conditions and details
And he says The self and the world are eternal barren like a mountainpeak set firmly as a post These beings rush round circulate pass away and rearise but this remains eternally
Why so
I have by means of effort exertion attained to such a state of mental concentration that I have thereby recalled various past existences
That is how I know the self and the world are eternal
That is the first way in which some ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the eternity of the self and the world
Wrong view  And what is the second way
Here monks a certain ascetic or Brahmin has by means of effort exertion attained to such a state of mental concentration that he thereby recalls one period of contraction and expansion
two such periods three four five ten periods of contraction and expansion There my name was soandso
That is the second way in which some ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the eternity of the self and the world
Wrong view  And what is the third way
Here monks a certain ascetic or Brahmin has by means of effort attained to such a state of mental concentration
that he recalls ten twenty thirty forty periods of contraction and expansion There my name was soandso
That is the third way in which some ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the eternity of the self and the world
Wrong view  And what is the fourth way
Here a certain ascetic or Brahmin is a logician a reasoner Hammering it out by reason following his own line of thought he argues The self and the world are eternal barren like a mountainpeak set firmly as a post These beings rush round circulate pass away and rearise but this remains for ever
That is the fourth way in which some ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the eternity of the self and the world
These are the four ways in which these ascetics and Brahmins are Eternalists and proclaim the eternity of the self and the world on four grounds
And whatever ascetics or Brahmins are Eternalists and proclaim the eternity of the self and the world they do so on one or other of these four grounds There is no other way
This monks the Tathagata understands These viewpoints thus grasped and adhered to will lead to suchandsuch destinations in another world This the Tathagata knows and more but he is not attached to that knowledge And being thus unattached he has experienced for himself perfect peace
and having truly understood the arising and passing away of feelings their attraction and peril and the deliverance from them the Tathagata is liberated without remainder
There are monks other matters profound hard to see hard to understand peaceful excellent beyond mere thought subtle to be experienced by the wise which the Tathagata having realised them by his own superknowledge proclaims and about which those who would truthfully praise the Tathagata would rightly speak And what are these matters

There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are eternalists and who on four grounds proclaim the self and the world to be eternal
And owing to what with reference to what do these honourable recluses and brahmins proclaim their views
In the first case bhikkhus some recluse or a brahmin by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated purified clarified unblemished devoid of corruptions he recollects his numerous past lives
that is one birth two three four or five births ten twenty thirty forty or fifty births a hundred a thousand or a hundred thousand births many hundreds of births many thousands of births many hundreds of thousands of births Then I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my span of life Passing away thence I rearose there There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my span of life Passing away thence I rearose here
 Thus he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their details
He speaks thus The self and the world are eternal barren steadfast as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar And though these beings roam and wander  pass away and rearise yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself
What is the reason
Because I by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection attain to such a degree of mental concentration that with my mind thus concentrated I recollect my numerous past lives in their modes and their details
For this reason I know this the self and the world are eternal barren steadfast as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar And though these beings roam and wander  pass away and rearise yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself
This bhikkhus is the first case
In the second case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins eternalists who proclaim the self and the world to be eternal
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or brahmin by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his numerous past lives
that is one aeon of worldcontraction and expansion throughout two three four five or ten aeons of worldcontraction and expansion Then I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my span of life Passing away thence I rearose there There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my span of life Passing away thence I rearose here 
Thus he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their details
He speaks thus The self and the world are eternal barren steadfast as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar And though these beings roam and wander  pass away and rearise yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself
What is the reason
This bhikkhus is the second reason
In the third case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins eternalists who proclaim the self and the world to be eternal
Herein bhikkhus some recluse or brahmin by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his numerous past lives that is ten aeons of worldcontraction and expansion throughout twenty thirty or forty aeons of worldcontraction and expansion 
Thus he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their details
He speaks thus The self and the world are eternal barren steadfast as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar And though these beings roam and wander  pass away and rearise yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself
What is the reason
This bhikkhus is the third case
In the fourth case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins eternalists who proclaim the self and the world to be eternal
Herein bhikkhus some recluse or brahmin is a rationalist an investigator He declares his viewhammered out by reason deduced from his investigations following his own flight of thoughtthus The self and the world are eternal barren steadfast as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar And though these beings roam and wander  pass away and rearise yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself 
This bhikkhus is the fourth case
It is on these four grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are eternalists proclaim the self and the world to be eternal
Whatever recluses and brahmins there may be who proclaim the self and the world to be eternal all of them do so on these four grounds or on a certain one of them Outside of these there is none
This bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands And he understands These standpoints thus assumed and thus misapprehended lead to such a future destination to such a state in the world beyond  He understands as well what transcends this yet even that understanding he does not misapprehend And because he is free from misapprehension he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace
Having understood as they really are the origin and the passing away of feelings their satisfaction their unsatisfactoriness and the escape from them the Tathāgata bhikkhus is emancipated through nonclinging
These are those dhammas bhikkhus that are deep difficult to see difficult to understand peaceful and sublime beyond the sphere of reasoning subtle comprehensible only to the wise which the Tathāgata having realized for himself with direct knowledge propounds to others and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speak
 There are monks some ascetics and Brahmins who are partly Eternalists and partly NonEternalists who proclaim the partial eternity and the partial noneternity of the self and the world in four ways
On what grounds
 There comes a time monks sooner or later after a long period when this world contracts
At a time of contraction beings are mostly reborn in the Abhassara Brahma world
And there they dwell mindmade feeding on delight self luminous moving through the air glorious  and they stay like that for a very long time
 Wrong view  But the time comes sooner or later after a long period when this world begins to expand
In this expanding world an empty palace of Brahma appears
And then one being from exhaustion of his lifespan or of his merits falls from the Abhassara world and arises in the empty Brahmapalace
And there he dwells mindmade feeding on delight selfluminous moving through the air glorious  and he stays like that for a very long time
 Then in this being who has been alone for so long there arises unrest discontent and worry and he thinks Oh if only some other beings would come here
And other beings from exhaustion of their lifespan or of their merits fall from the Abhassara world and arise in the Brahma palace as companions for this being
And there they dwell mindmade and they stay like that for a very long time
 And then monks that being who first arose there thinks I am Brahma the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing the AllPowerful the Lord the Maker and Creator Ruler Appointer and Orderer Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be
These beings were created by me
How so
Because I first had this thought Oh if only some other beings would come here
That was my wish and then these beings came into this existence
But those beings who arose subsequently think This friends is Brahma Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing the AllPowerful the Lord the Maker and Creator Ruler Appointer and Orderer Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be
How so
We have seen that he was here first and that we arose after him
 And this being that arose first is longerlived more beautiful and more powerful than they are
And it may happen that some being falls from that realm and arises in this world
Having arisen in this world he goes forth from the household life into homelessness
Having gone forth he by means of effort exertion application earnestness and right attention attains to such a degree of mental concentration that he thereby recalls his last existence but recalls none before that
And he thinks That Brahma he made us and he is permanent stable eternal not subject to change the same for ever and ever
But we who were created by that Brahma we are impermanent unstable shortlived fated to fall away and we have come to this world
This is the first case where by some ascetics and Brahmins are partly Eternalists and partly NonEternalists
 Wrong view  And what is the second way
There are monks certain devas called Corrupted by Pleasure
They spend an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment play and enjoyment so that their mindfulness is dissipated
and by the dissipation of mindfulness those beings fall from that state
 And it can happen that a being having fallen from that state arises in this world
Having arisen in this world he goes forth from the household life into homelessness
Having gone forth he by means of effort exertion   recalls his last existence but recalls none before that
 He thinks Those reverend devas who are not corrupted by pleasure do not spend an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment play and enjoyment
Thus their mindfulness is not dissipated
and so they do not fall from that state They are permanent stable eternal not subject to change the same for ever and ever
But we who are corrupted by pleasure spent an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment play and enjoyment
Thus we by the dissipation of mindfulness
have fallen from that state we are impermanent unstable shortlived fated to fall away and we have come to this world
This is the second case
Wrong view  And what is the third way
There are monks certain devas called Corrupted in Mind They spend an excessive amount of time regarding each other with envy
By this means their minds are corrupted
On account of their corrupted minds they become weary in body and mind
And they fall from that place
And it can happen that a being having fallen from that state arises in this world
He
recalls his last existence but recalls none before that
He thinks Those reverend devas who are not corrupted in mind do not spend an excessive amount of time regarding each other with envy
They do not become corrupted in mind
or weary in body and mind
and so they do not fall from that state They are permanent stable eternal
But we who are corrupted in mind
are impermanent unstable shortlived fated to fall away and we have come to this world
This is the third case
Wrong view  And what is the fourth way
Here a certain ascetic or Brahmin is a logician a reasoner
Hammering it out by reason following his own line of thought he argues Whatever is called eye or ear or nose or tongue or body that is impermanent unstable noneternal liable to change
But what is called thought or mind or consciousness that is a self that is permanent stable eternal not subject to change the same for ever and ever
This is the fourth case
These are the four ways in which these ascetics and Brahmins are partly Eternalists and partly NonEternalists
Whatever ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the partial eternity and the partial noneternity of the self and the world they do so on one or other of these four grounds There is no other way
This monks the Tathagata understands These viewpoints thus grasped and adhered to will lead to such andsuch destinations in another world
This the Tathagata knows and more but he is not attached to that knowledge
And being thus unattached he has experienced for himself perfect peace and having truly understood the arising and passing away of feelings their attraction and peril and the deliverance from them the Tathagata is liberated without remainder
These monks are those other matters profound hard to see hard to understand peaceful excellent beyond mere thought subtle to be experienced by the wise which the Tathagata having realised them by his own superknowledge proclaims and about which those who would truthfully praise the Tathagata would rightly speak
There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are eternalists in regard to some things and noneternalists in regard to other things and who on four grounds proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternal
And owing to what with reference to what do these honourable recluses and brahmins proclaim their views
There comes a time bhikkhus when after the lapse of a long period this world contracts 
While the world is contracting beings for the most part are reborn in the bhassara Brahmaworld
There they dwell mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the air abiding in glory And they continue thus for a long long period of time
But sooner or later bhikkhus after the lapse of a long period there comes a time when this world begins to expand once again
While the world is expanding an empty palace of Brahmā appears
Then a certain being due to the exhaustion of his lifespan or the exhaustion of his merit passes away from the bhassara plane and rearises in the empty palace of Brahmā
There he dwells mind made feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the air abiding in glory And he continues thus for a long long period of time
Then as a result of dwelling there all alone for so long a time there arises in him dissatisfaction and agitation  Oh that other beings might come to this place
Just at that moment due to the exhaustion of their lifespan or the exhaustion of their merit certain other beings pass away from the bhassara plane and rearise in the palace of Brahmā in companionship with him
There they dwell mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the air abiding in glory And they continue thus for a long long period of time
Thereupon the being who rearose there first thinks to himself I am Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Vanquisher the Unvanquished the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord the Maker and Creator the Supreme Being the Ordainer the Almighty the Father of all that are and are to be
And these beings have been created by me
What is the reason
Because first I made the wish Oh that other beings might come to this place
And after I made this resolution now these beings have come
And the beings who rearose there after him also think This must be Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Vanquisher the Unvanquished the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord the Maker and Creator the Supreme Being the Ordainer the Almighty the Father of all that are and are to be
And we have been created by him
What is the reason
Because we see that he was here first and we appeared here after him 
Herein bhikkhus the being who rearose there first possesses longer life greater beauty and greater authority than the beings who rearose there after him
Now bhikkhus this comes to pass that a certain being after passing away from that plane takes rebirth in this world
Having come to this world he goes forth from home to homelessness
When he has gone forth by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection he attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life but none previous to that
He speaks thus We were created by him by Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Vanquisher the Unvanquished the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord the Maker and Creator the Supreme Being the Ordainer the Almighty the Father of all that are and are to be He is permanent stable eternal not subject to change and he will remain the same just like eternity itself
But we who have been created by him and have come to this world are impermanent unstable shortlived doomed to perish 
This bhikkhus is the first case
In the second case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins eternalists in regard to some things and noneternalists in regard to other things proclaiming the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternal
There are bhikkhus certain gods called corrupted by play 
These gods spend an excessive time indulging in the delights of laughter and play As a consequence they become forgetful and
when they become forgetful they pass away from that plane
Now bhikkhus this comes to pass that a certain being after passing away from that plane takes rebirth in this world
Having come to this world he goes forth from home to homelessness
When he has gone forth by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection he attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life but none previous to that
He speaks thus Those honourable gods who are not corrupted by play do not spend an excessive time indulging in the delights of laughter and play
As a consequence they do not become forgetful
and because they do not become forgetful they do not pass away from that plane Those gods are permanent stable eternal not subject to change and they will remain the same just like eternity itself
But we were gods corrupted by play We spent an excessive time indulging in the delights of laughter and play
and as a consequence we became forgetful
When we became forgetful we passed away from that plane Coming to this world now we are impermanent unstable short lived doomed to perish 
This bhikkhus is the second case
In the third case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins eternalists in regard to some things and noneternalists in regard to other things proclaiming the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternal
There are bhikkhus certain gods called corrupted by mind  These gods contemplate one another with excessive envy
As a consequence their minds becomes corrupted by anger towards one another
When their minds are corrupted by anger their bodies and minds become exhausted
and consequently they pass away from that plane
Now bhikkhus this comes to pass that a certain being after passing away from that plane takes rebirth in this world
Having come to this world he goes forth from home to homelessness
When he has gone forth by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection he attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life but none previous to that
He speaks thus Those honourable gods who are not corrupted by mind do not contemplate each other with excessive envy
As a result their minds do not become corrupted by anger towards one another
their bodies and minds do not become exhausted
and they do not pass away from that plane Those gods are permanent stable not subject to change and they will remain the same just like eternity itself
But we were gods corrupted by mind We contemplated each other with excessive envy
and as a result our minds became corrupted by anger towards one another When our minds were corrupted by anger our bodies and minds became exhausted and consequently we passed away from that plane
Coming to this world now we are impermanent unstable shortlived doomed to perish 
This bhikkhus is the third case
In the fourth case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins eternalists in regard to some things and noneternalists in regard to other things proclaiming the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternal
Herein bhikkhus recluse or a certain brahmin is a rationalist an investigator
He declares his viewhammered out by reason deduced from his investigations following his own flight of thoughtthus That which is called the eye the ear the nose the tongue and the bodythat self is impermanent unstable noneternal subject to change
But that which is called mind or mentality or consciousness that self is permanent stable eternal not subject to change and it will remain the same just like eternity itself 
This bhikkhus is the fourth case
It is on these four grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are partialeternalists proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternal
Whatever recluses and brahmins there may be who proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternal all of them do so on these four grounds or on a certain one of them Outside of these there is none
This bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands And he understands These standpoints thus assumed and thus misapprehended lead to such a future destination to such a state in the world beyond
 He understands as well what transcends this yet even that understanding he does not misapprehend
And because he is free from misapprehension he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace Having understood as they really are the origin and the passing away of feelings their satisfaction their unsatisfactoriness and the escape from them the Tathāgata bhikkhus is emancipated through nonclinging
These are those dhammas bhikkhus that are deep difficult to see difficult to understand peaceful and sublime beyond the sphere of reasoning subtle comprehensible only to the wise which the Tathāgata having realized for himself with direct knowledge propounds to others and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speak
There are monks some ascetics and Brahmins who are Finitists and Infinitists and who proclaim the finitude and infinitude of the world on four grounds
What are they
Wrong view  Here a certain ascetic or Brahmin has by means of effort attained to such a state of concentration that he dwells perceiving the world as finite
He thinks This world is finite and bounded by a circle
How so
Because I have   attained to such a state of concentration that I dwell perceiving the world as finite
Therefore I know that this world is finite and bounded by a circle
This is the first case
Wrong view  And what is the second way
Here a certain ascetic or Brahmin has attained to such a state of concentration that he dwells perceiving the world as infinite
He thinks This world is infinite and unbounded
Those ascetics and Brahmins who say it is finite and bounded are wrong
How so
Because I have attained to such a state of concentration that I dwell perceiving the world as infinite
Therefore I know that this world is infinite and unbounded
This is the second case
Wrong view  And what is the third way
Here a certain ascetic or Brahmin has attained to such a state of consciousness that he dwells perceiving the world as finite up anddown and infinite across
He thinks The world is finite and infinite
Those ascetics and Brahmins who say it is finite are wrong
and those who say it is infinite are wrong
How so
Because I have attained to such a state of concentration that I dwell perceiving the world as finite upanddown and infinite across
Therefore I know that the world is both finite and infinite
This is the third case
Wrong view  And what is the fourth case
Here a certain ascetic or Brahmin is a logician a reasoner
Hammering it out by reason he argues This world is neither finite nor infinite
Those who say it is finite are wrong
and so are those who say it is infinite
and those who say it is finite and infinite
This world is neither finite nor infinite
This is the fourth case
These are the four ways in which these ascetics and Brahmins are Finitists and Infinitists and proclaim the finitude and infinitude of the world on four grounds
There is no other way
This monks the Tathagata understands These viewpoints thus grasped and adhered to will lead to suchandsuch destinations in another world
These monks are those other matters profound hard to see hard to understand peaceful excellent beyond mere thought subtle to be experienced by the wise which the Tathagata having realised them by his own superknowledge proclaims and about which those who would truthfully praise the Tathagata would rightly speak
There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are extensionists and who on four grounds proclaim the world to be finite or infinite
And owing to what with reference to what do these honourable recluses and brahmins proclaim their views
In the first case bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he abides perceiving the world as finite
He speaks thus The world is finite and bounded
What is the reason
Because I attain to such concentration of mind that I abide perceiving the world as finite
For that reason I know this the world is finite and bounded 
This bhikkhus is the first case
In the second case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins extensionists proclaiming the world to be finite or infinite
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he abides perceiving the world as infinite
He speaks thus The world is infinite and boundless
Those recluses and brahmins who declare the world to be finite and bounded speak falsely
The world is infinite and boundless
What is the reason
Because I attain to such concentration of mind that I abide perceiving the world as infinite
For this reason I know this the world is infinite and boundless 
This bhikkhus is the second case
In the third case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins extensionists proclaiming the world to be finite or infinite
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he abides perceiving the world as finite in the upward and downward directions but as infinite across
He speaks thus The world is both finite and infinite
Those recluses and brahmins who declare the world to be finite and bounded speak falsely
and those recluses and brahmins who declare the world to be infinite and boundless also speak falsely
The world is both finite and infinite
For what reason
Because I attain to such concentration of mind that I abide perceiving the world as finite in the upward and downward directions but as infinite across
For this reason I know this the world is both finite and infinite 
This bhikkhus is the third case
In the fourth case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins extensionists proclaiming the world to be finite or infinite
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin is a rationalist an investigator
He declares his viewhammered out by reason deduced from his investigations following his own flight of thoughtthus The world is neither finite nor infinite
Those recluses and brahmins who declare the world to be finite and bounded
those who declare it to be infinite and boundless
and those who declare it to be both finite and infiniteall these speak falsely
The world is neither finite nor infinite
This bhikkhus is the fourth case
It is on these four grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are extensionists proclaim the world to be finite of infinite
Whatever recluses or brahmins there may be who proclaim the world to be finite or infinite all of them do so on these four grounds or on a certain one of them Outside of these there is none
This bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands 
and it is concerning these that those who would praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speak
There are monks some ascetics and Brahmins who are EelWrigglers When asked about this or that matter they resort to evasive statements and they wriggle like eels on four grounds
What are they
Wrong view  In this case there is an ascetic or Brahmin who does not in truth know whether a thing is good or bad
He thinks I do not in truth know whether this is good or whether it is bad
Not knowing which is right I might declare That is good or That is bad and that might be a lie
and that would distress me
And if I were distressed that would be a hindrance to me
Thus fearing to lie abhorring to lie he does not declare a thing to be good or bad but when asked about this or that matter he resorts to evasive statements and wriggles like an eel I dont say this I dont say that I dont say it is otherwise I dont say it is not I dont not say it is not
This is the first case
Wrong view  What is the second way
Here an ascetic or Brahmin does not in truth know whether a thing is good or bad
He thinks 
I might declare That is good or That is bad and I might feel desire or lust or hatred or aversion
If I felt desire lust hatred or aversion that would be attachment on my part
If I felt attachment that would distress me
and if I were distressed that would be a hindrance to me
Thus fearing attachment abhorring attachment he resorts to evasive statements
This is the second case
Wrong view  What is the third way
Here an ascetic or Brahmin does not in truth know whether a thing is good or bad
He thinks 
I might declare That is good or That is bad
but there are ascetics and Brahmins who are wise skilful practised debaters like archers who can split hairs who go around destroying others views with their wisdom and they might crossexamine me demanding my reasons and arguing
And I might not be able to reply
Not being able to reply would distress me
and if I were distressed that would be a hindrance to me
Thus fearing debate abhorring debate he resorts to evasive statements
This is the third case
Wrong view  What is the fourth way
Here an ascetic or Brahmin is dull and stupid
Because of his dullness and stupidity when he is questioned he resorts to evasive statements and wriggles like an eel If you ask me whether there is another world  if I thought so I would say there is another world But I dont say so And I dont say otherwise And I dont say it is not and I dont not say it is not
Is there no other world  Is there both another world and no other world  Is there neither another world nor no other world   Are there spontaneouslyborn beings   Are there not  Both  Neither  Does the Tathagata exist after death Does he not exist after death Does he both exist and not exist after death Does he neither exist nor not exist after death   If I thought so I would say so   I dont say it is not
This is the fourth case
These are the four ways in which those ascetics and Brahmins who are EelWrigglers resort to evasive statements 
There is no other way   This monks the Tathagata understands These viewpoints thus grasped and adhered to will lead to suchandsuch destinations in another world  These monks are those other matters profound hard to see which the Tathagata having realised them by his own superknowledge proclaims and about which those who would truthfully praise the Tathagata would rightly speak
There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are endless equivocators When questioned about this or that point on four grounds they resort to evasive statements and to endless equivocation
And owing to what with reference to what do these honourable recluses and brahmins do so
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin does not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesome
He thinks I do not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesome
If without understanding I were to declare something to be wholesome or unwholesome my declaration might be false
If my declaration should be false that would distress me
and that distress would be an obstacle for me
 Therefore out of fear and loathing of making a false statement he does not declare anything to be wholesome or unwholesome But when he is questioned about this or that point he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation I do not take it thus nor do I take it in that way nor do I take it in some other way I do not say that it is not nor do I say that it is neither this nor that 
This bhikkhus is the first case
In the second case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins endless equivocators resorting to evasive statements and to endless equivocation
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin does not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesome
He thinks I do not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesome
If without understanding I were to declare something to be wholesome or unwholesome desire and lust or hatred and aversion might arise in me
Should desire and lust or hated and aversion arise in me that would be clinging on my part
Such clinging would distress me
and that distress would be an obstacle for me
 Therefore out of fear and loathing of clinging he does not declare anything to be wholesome or unwholesome But when questioned about this or that point he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation I do not take it thus nor do I take it in that way nor do I take it in some other way I do not say that it is not nor do I say that it is neither this nor that 
This bhikkhus is the second case
In the third case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins endless equivocators resorting to evasive statements and to endless equivocation
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin does not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesome
He thinks I do not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesome
Now there are recluses and brahmins who are wise clever experienced in controversy who wander about demolishing the views of others with their wisdom If without understanding I were to declare something to be wholesome or unwholesome they might crossexamine me about my views press me for reasons and refute my statements
If they should do so I might not be able to reply
If I could not reply that would distress me
and that distress would be an obstacle for me
 Therefore out of fear and loathing of being crossexamined he does not declare anything to be wholesome or unwholesome But when questioned about this or that point he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation I do not take it thus nor do I take it in that way nor do I take it in some other way I do not say that it is not nor do I say that it is neither this nor that 
This bhikkhus is the third case
In the fourth case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins endless equivocators resorting to evasive statements and to endless equivocation
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin is dull and stupid
Due to his dullness and stupidity when he is questioned about this or that point he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation If you ask me whether there is a world beyondif I thought there is another world I would declare that there is But I do not take it thus nor do I take it in that way nor do I take it in some other way I do not say that it is not nor do I say that is neither this nor that 
Similarly when asked any of the following questions he resorts to the same evasive statements and to endless equivocation Is there no world beyond Is it that there both is and is not a world beyond Is it that there neither is nor is not a world beyond Are there beings spontaneously reborn Are there no beings spontaneously reborn Is it that there both are and are not beings spontaneously reborn Is it that there neither are nor are not beings spontaneously reborn Is there fruit and result of good and bad action Is there no fruit and result of good and bad action Is it that there both is and is not fruit and result of good and bad action Is it that there neither is nor is not fruit and result of good and bad action Does the Tathāgata exist after death Does the Tathāgata not exist after death Does the Tathāgata both exist and not exist after death Does the Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death 
This bhikkhus is the fourth case
It is on these four grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are endless equivocators resort to evasive statements and to endless equivocation when questioned about this or that point
Whatever recluses or brahmins there may be who resort to evasive statements and to endless equivocation all of them do so on these four grounds or on a certain one of them Outside of these there is none This bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands  and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speak
There are monks some ascetics and Brahmins who are ChanceOriginationists and who proclaim the chance origin of the self and the world on two grounds
What are they
Wrong view  There are monks certain devas called Unconscious
As soon as a perception arises in them those devas fall from that realm
And it may happen that a being falls from that realm and arises in this world
He
recalls his last existence but none before that
He thinks The self and the world have arisen by chance
How so
Before this I did not exist Now from notbeing I have been brought to being
This is the first case
Wrong view  What is the second case
Here an ascetic or Brahmin is a logician a reasoner
He hammers out his own opinion and declares The self and the world have arisen by chance
This is the second case
These are the two ways in which those ascetics and Brahmins who are ChanceOriginists proclaim the chance origin of the self and the world
There is no other way  This monks the Tathagata understands These monks are those other matters profound hard to see   which the Tathagata having realised them by his own superknowledge proclaims and about which those who would truthfully praise the Tathagata would rightly speak
And these monks are the eighteen ways in which these ascetics and Brahmins are speculators about the past
There is no other way
This monks the Tathagata understands
There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are fortuitous originationists and who on two grounds proclaim the self and the world to originate fortuitously
And owing to what with reference to what do these honourable recluses and brahmins proclaim their views
There are bhikkhus certain gods called nonpercipient beings
 When perception arises in them those gods pass away from that plane
Now bhikkhus this comes to pass that a certain being after passing away from that plane takes rebirth in this world
Having come to this world he goes forth from home to homelessness
When he has gone forth by means of ardour endeavour application diligence and right reflection he attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects the arising of perception but nothing previous to that
He speaks thus The self and the world originate fortuitously
What is the reason
Because previously I did not exist but now I am Not having been I sprang into being 
This bhikkhus is the first case
In the second case owing to what with reference to what are some honourable recluses and brahmins fortuitous originationists proclaiming the self and the world to originate fortuitously
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin is a rationalist an investigator
He declares his viewhammered out by reason deduced from his investigations following his own flight of thoughtthus The self and the world originate fortuitously 
This bhikkhus is the second case
It is on these two grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are fortuitous originationists proclaim the self and the world to originate fortuitously
Whatever recluses or brahmins there may be who proclaim the self and the world to originate fortuitously all of them do so on these two grounds or on a certain one of them Outside of these there is none This bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands  and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speak
It is on these eighteen grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the past and hold settled views about the past assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past
Whatever recluses or brahmins are speculators about the past hold settled views about the past and assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past all of them do so on these eighteen grounds or on a certain one of them Outside of these there is none
This bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands And he understands These standpoints thus assumed and thus misapprehended lead to such a future destination to such in the world beyond
 He understands as well what transcends this yet even that understanding he does not misapprehend And because he is free from misapprehension he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace
Having understood as they really are the origin and the passing away of feelings their satisfaction their unsatisfactoriness and the escape from them the Tathāgata bhikkhus is emancipated through nonclinging
These are those dhammas bhikkhus that are deep difficult to see difficult to understand peaceful and sublime beyond the sphere of reasoning subtle comprehensible only to the wise which the Tathāgata having realized for himself with direct knowledge propounds to others and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speak
There are monks some ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the future having fixed views about the future and who put forward various speculative theories about the future in fortyfour different ways
On what basis on what grounds do they do so
There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the future who hold settled views about the future and who on fortyfour grounds assert various conceptual theorems referring to the future
And owing to what with reference to what do these honourable recluses and brahmins frame their speculations
There are monks some ascetics and Brahmins who proclaim a doctrine of Conscious PostMortem Survival and do so in sixteen different ways
On what basis
Wrong views  They declare that the self after death is healthy and conscious and material

 There are monks some ascetics and Brahmins who are Annihilationists who proclaim the annihilation destruction and nonexistence of beings and they do so in seven ways
On what basis
Wrong view  Here a certain ascetic or Brahmin declares and holds the view Since this self is material composed of the four great elements the product of mother and father at the breakingup of the body it is annihilated and perishes and does not exist after death This is the way in which this self is annihilated
That is how some proclaim the annihilation destruction and nonexistence of beings
Wrong view  Another says to him Sir there is such a self as you say I dont deny it But that self is not wholly annihilated
For there is another self divine material belonging to the sensesphere fed on real food
You dont know it or see it
but I do
It is this self that at the breakingup of the body perishes 
Wrong view  Another says to him Sir there is such a self as you say I dont deny it But that self is not wholly annihilated
For there is another self divine material mind made complete with all its parts not defective in any sense organ 
It is this self that at the breakingup of the body perishes
Wrong view  Another says to him Sir there is such a self as you say
There is another self which by passing entirely beyond bodily sensations by the disappearance of all sense of resistance and by nonattraction to the perception of diversity seeing that space is infinite has realised the Sphere of Infinite Space
It is this self that at the breaking up of the body perishes
Wrong view  Another says to him 
There is another self which by passing entirely beyond the Sphere of Infinite Space seeing that consciousness is infinite has realised the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness
It is this self that at the breakingup of the body perishes
Wrong view  Another says to him There is another self which by passing entirely beyond the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness seeing that there is no thing has realised the Sphere of NoThingness
It is this self that at the breakingup of the body perishes
Wrong view  Another says to him Sir there is such a self as you say I dont deny it But that self is not wholly annihilated
For there is another self which by passing entirely beyond the Sphere of NoThingness and seeing This is peaceful this is sublime has realised the Sphere of Neither PerceptionNorNonPerception
You dont know it or see it
but I do
It is this self that at the breakingup of the body is annihilated and perishes and does not exist after death This is the way in which the self is completely annihilated
That is how some proclaim the annihilation destruction and nonexistence of beings
These are the seven ways in which these ascetics and Brahmins proclaim a doctrine of annihilation destruction and nonexistence of beings
There is no other way  This monks the Tathagata understands   These monks are those other matters profound hard to see which the Tathagata having realised them by his own superknowledge proclaims and about which those who would truthfully praise the Tathagata would rightly speak
There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are annihilationists and who on seven grounds proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being
And owing to what with reference to what do these honourable recluses and brahmins proclaim their views
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin asserts the following doctrine and view The self good sir has material form it is composed of the four primary elements and originates from father and mother Since this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death at this point the self is completely annihilated
 In this way some proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being
To him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated
For there is good sir another selfdivine having material form pertaining to the sense sphere feeding on edible nutriment
That you neither know nor see
but I know it and see it
Since this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death at this point the self is completely annihilated
 In this way others proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being
To him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated
For there is good sir another selfdivine having material form mindmade complete in all its limbs and organs not destitute of any faculties
That you neither know nor see
but I know it and see it
Since this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death at this point the self is completely annihilated
 In this way others proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being
To him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated
For there is good sir another self belonging to the base of infinite space the complete surmounting of perceptions of material form by the disappearance of perceptions of resistance by nonattention to perceptions of diversity Space is infinite
 That you neither know nor see
but I know it and see it
Since this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death at this point the self is completely annihilated
 In this way others proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being
To him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated
For there is good sir another self belonging to the base of infinite consciousness completely surmounting the base of infinite space  Consciousness is infinite
That you neither know nor see
But I know it and see it
Since this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after deathat this point the self is completely annihilated
In this way some proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being
To him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated
For there is good sir another self belonging to the base of nothingness completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness  There is nothing
 That you neither know nor see
But I know it and see it
Since this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after deathat this point the self is completely annihilated
 In this way some proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being
To him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated
For there is good sir another self belonging to the base of neither perception nor nonperception completely surmounting the base of nothingness  This is the peaceful this is the sublime
 That you neither know nor see
But I know it and see it
Since this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after deathat this point the self is completely annihilated
 In this way some proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being
It is on these seven grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are annihilationists proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being
Whatever recluses or brahmins proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being all of them do so on these seven grounds or on a certain one of them Outside of these there is none This bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands  and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speak
There are monks some ascetics and Brahmins who are proclaimers of Nibbana Here and Now and who proclaim Nibbana here and now for an existent being in five ways
On what grounds
Wrong view  Here a certain ascetic or Brahmin declares and holds the view In as far as this self being furnished and endowed with the fivefold sensepleasures indulges in them then that is when the self realises the highest Nibbana here and now
So some proclaim it
Wrong view  Another says to him Sir there is such a self as you say I dont deny it But that is not where the self realises the highest Nibbana here and now
Why so
Because sir sensedesires are impermanent painful and subject to change and from their change and transformation there arise sorrow lamentation pain grief and distress
But when this self detached from sensedesires detached from unwholesome states enters and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by thinking and pondering and the delight and happiness born of detachment that is when the self realises the highest Nibbana here and now
Wrong view  Another says to him Sir there is such a self as you say But that is not when the self attains Nibbana
How so
Because on account of thinking and pondering that state is considered gross
But when the self by the subsiding of thinking and pondering enters and abides in the second jhana with inner tranquillity and oneness of mind which is free from thinking and pondering and is bom of concentration and accompanied by delight and joy that is when the self realises the highest Nibbana here and now
Wrong view  Another says to him Sir there is such a self as you say But that is not when the self attains Nibbana
How so
Because on account of the presence of delight there is mental exhilaration and that state is considered gross
But when the self with the waning of delight dwells in equanimity mindful and clearly aware experiencing in his own body that joy of which the Noble Ones say Happy dwells one who has equanimity and mindfulness and so enters and abides in the third jhana that is when the self realises the highest Nibbana here and now
Wrong view  Another says to him Sir there is such a self as you say I dont deny it But that is not where the self experiences the highest Nibbana here and now
Why so
Because the mind contains the idea of joy and that state is considered gross
But when with the abandonment of pleasure and pain with the disappearance of previous joy and grief one enters and abides in a state beyond pleasure and pain in the fourth jhana which is purified by equanimity and mindfulness that is where the self realises the highest Nibbana here and now
That is how some proclaim the highest Nibbana here and now for an existent being
These are the five ways in which these ascetics and Brahmins proclaim a doctrine of Nibbana here and now
There is no other way  This monks the Tathagata understands
These are the fortyfour ways in which those ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the future having fixed ideas about the future put forward various speculative views about the future
There is no other way  This monks the Tathagata understands  
These are the sixtytwo ways in which those ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the past the future or both put forward views about these
There is no other way
This monks the Tathagata understands These viewpoints thus grasped and adhered to will lead to suchandsuch destinations in another world
This the Tathagata knows and more but he is not attached to that knowledge And being thus unattached he has experienced for himself perfect peace
and having truly understood the arising and passing away of feelings their attraction and peril and the deliverance from them the Tathagata is liberated without remainder
These monks are those other matters profound hard to see hard to understand peaceful excellent beyond mere thought subtle to be experienced by the wise which the Tathagata having realised them by his own superknowledge proclaims and about which those who would truthfully praise the Tathagata would rightly speak
There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who maintain a doctrine of Nibbāna here and now and who on five grounds proclaim Nibbāna here and now for an existent being
And owing to what with reference to what do these honourable recluses and brahmins proclaim their views
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin asserts the following doctrine or view When this self good sir furnished and supplied with the five strands of sense pleasures revels in themat this point the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now
 In this way some proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent being
To him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now
What is the reason
Because good sir sense pleasures are impermanent suffering subject to change and through their change and transformation there arise sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
But when the self quite secluded from sense pleasures secluded from unwholesome states enters and abides in the first jhāna which is accompanied by initial and sustained thought and contains the rapture and happiness born of seclusionat this point good sir the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now
 In this way others proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent being
To him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now
What is the reason
Because that jhāna contains initial and sustained thought therefore it is declared to be gross
But when with the subsiding of initial and sustained thought the self enters and abides in the second jhāna which is accompanied by internal confidence and unification of mind is free from initial and sustained thought and contains the rapture and happiness born of concentrationat this point good sir the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now
 In this way others proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent being
To him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now
What is the reason
It is declared to be gross because of the mental exhilaration connected with rapture that exists there
But when with the fading away of rapture one abides in equanimity mindful and clearly comprehending and still experiencing happiness with the body enters and abides in the third jhāna so that the ariyans announce He abides happily in equanimity and mindfulnessat this point good sir the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now
 In this way some proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent being
To him another says There is good sir such a self as you assert That I do not deny But it is not at that point that the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now
What is the reason
It is declared to be gross because a mental concern Happiness exists there
But when with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the disappearance of previous joy and grief one enters and abides in the fourth jhāna which is without pleasure and pain and contains purification of mindfulness through equanimityat this point good sir the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now
 In this way some proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent being
It is on these five grounds bhikkhus that these recluses and brahmins who maintain a doctrine of Nibbāna here and now proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent being
Whatever recluses or brahmins proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent being all of them do so on these five grounds or on a certain one of them Outside of these there is none This bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands  and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speak
It is on these fortyfour grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the future and hold settled views about the future assert various conceptual theorems referring to the future
Whatever recluses or brahmins bhikkhus are speculators about the future hold settled views about the future and assert various conceptual theorems referring to the future all of them do so on these fortyfour grounds or on a certain one of them Outside of these there is none This bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands  and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speak
It is on these sixtytwo grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the past speculators about the future and speculators about the past and the future together who hold settled views about the past and the future assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past and the future
Whatever recluses or brahmins bhikkhus are speculators about the past or speculators about the future or speculators about the past and the future together hold settled views about the past and the future and assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past and the future all of them do so on these sixtytwo grounds or on a certain one of them Outside of these there is none
This bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands And he understands These standpoints thus assumed and thus misapprehended lead to such a future destination to such a state in the world beyond
 He understands as well what transcends this yet even that understanding he does not misapprehend And because he is free from misapprehension he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace
Having understood as they really are the origin and the passing away of feelings their satisfaction their unsatisfactoriness and the escape from them the Tathāgata bhikkhus is emancipated through nonclinging
These are those dhammas bhikkhus that are deep difficult to see difficult to understand peaceful and sublime beyond the sphere of reasoning subtle comprehensible only to the wise which the Tathāgata having realized for himself with direct knowledge propounds to others and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speak
Wrong views  Thus monks when those ascetics and Brahmins who are Eternalists proclaim the eternity of the self and the world in four ways that is merely the feeling of those who do not know and see the worry and vacillation of those immersed in craving

Therein bhikkhus when those recluses and brahmins who are eternalists proclaim on four grounds the self and the world to be eternalthat is only the feeling of those who do not know and do not see that is only the agitation and vacillation of those who are immersed in craving
When those recluses and brahmins who are eternalists in regard to some things and noneternalists in regard to other things proclaim on four grounds the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternalthat too is only the feeling of those who do not know and do not see that is only the agitation and vacillation of those who are immersed in craving
When those recluses and brahmins who are extensionists proclaim on four grounds the world to be finite or infinite
When those recluses and brahmins who are endless equivocators on four grounds resort to evasive statements and endless equivocation when questioned on this or that point
When those recluses and brahmins who are fortuitous originationists proclaim on two grounds the self and the world to originate fortuitously
When those recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the past and hold settled views about the past assert on eighteen grounds various conceptual theorems referring to the past
When those recluses and brahmins who maintain a doctrine of percipient immortality proclaim on sixteen grounds the self to survive percipient after death
When those recluses and brahmins who maintain a doctrine of nonpercipient immortality proclaim on eight grounds the self to survive nonpercipient after death

When those recluses and brahmins who are annihilationists proclaim on seven grounds the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being
When those recluses and brahmins who maintain a doctrine of Nibbāna here and now proclaim on five grounds supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent being
When those recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the future and hold settled views about the future assert on fortyfour grounds various conceptual theorems referring to the future
When those recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the past speculators about the future speculators about the past and the future together who hold settled views about the past and the future assert on sixtytwo grounds various conceptual theorems referring to the past and the futurethat too is only the feeling of those who do not know and do not see that is only the agitation and vacillation of those who are immersed in craving
When those ascetics and Brahmins who are Eternalists proclaim the eternity of the self and the world in four ways that is conditioned by contact 
When those who are partly Eternalists and partly Non Eternalists
When those who are Finitists and Infinitists
When those who are EelWrigglers
When those who are ChanceOriginationists
When those who are speculators about the past in eighteen ways

When those who are Annihilationists
When those who are proclaimers of Nibbana Here and Now
When those who are speculators about the future
When those ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the past the future or both having fixed views put forward views in sixtytwo different ways that is conditioned by contact
Therein bhikkhus when those recluses who are eternalists proclaim on four grounds the self and the world to be eternalthat is conditioned by contact
When those recluses and brahmins who are eternalists in regard to some things and noneternalists in regard to other things proclaim on four grounds the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternalthat too is conditioned by contact
When those recluses and brahmins who are extensionists proclaim their views
when those who are fortuitous originationists proclaim their views

When those recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the past speculators about the future speculators about the past and the future together who hold settled views about the past and the future assert on sixtytwo grounds various conceptual theorems referring to the past and the futurethat too is conditioned by contact
That all of these should experience that feeling without contact is impossible
That they can experience that feeling without contactsuch a case is impossible
With regard to all of these they experience these feelings by repeated contact through the six sense bases feeling conditions craving craving conditions clinging clinging conditions becoming becoming conditions birth birth conditions ageing and death sorrow lamentation sadness and distress 
Therein bhikkhus those recluses and brahmins who are eternalists and proclaim on four grounds the self and the world to be eternal and those who are eternalists in regard to some things and noneternalists in regard to others and those who are extensionists and those who are endless equivocators and those who are fortuitous originationists and those who are speculators about the past and those who maintain a doctrine of percipient immortality and those who maintain a doctrine of nonpercipient immortality and those who maintain a doctrine of neither percipient nor nonpercipient immortality and those who are annihilationists and those who maintain a doctrine of Nibbāna here and now and those who are speculators about the future and those who are speculators about the past speculators about the future speculators about the past and the future together hold settled views about the past and the future and assert on sixtytwo grounds various conceptual theorems referring to the past and the futureall these recluses and brahmins experience these feelings only by repeated contacts through the six bases of contact With feeling as condition there arises in them craving with craving as condition clinging arises with clinging as condition existence with existence as condition birth and with birth as condition ageing and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair arise
When monks a monk understands as they really are the arising and passing away of the six bases of contact their attraction and peril and the deliverance from them he knows that which goes beyond all these views
Whatever ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the past or the future or both having fixed views on the matter and put forth speculative views about it these are all trapped in the net with its sixtytwo divisions and wherever they emerge and try to get out they are caught and held in this net
Just as a skilled fisherman or his apprentice might cover a small piece of water with a finemeshed net
thinking Whatever larger creatures there may be in this water they are all trapped in the net
caught and held in the net so it is with all these they are trapped and caught in this net
Monks the body of the Tathagata stands with the link that bound it to becoming cut
As long as the body subsists devas and humans will see him
But at the breakingup of the body and the exhaustion of the lifespan devas and humans will see him no more
Monks just as when the stalk of a bunch of mangoes has been cut all the mangoes on it go with it just so the Tathagatas link with becoming has been cut As long as the body subsists devas and humans will see him But at the breakingup of the body and the exhaustion of the lifespan devas and humans will see him no more
At these words theVenerable Ananda said to the Lord It is marvellous Lord it is wonderful What is the name of this exposition of Dhamma 
Ananda you may remember this exposition of Dhamma as the Net of Advantage the Net of Dhamma the Supreme Net the Net of Views or as the Incomparable Victory in Battle
Thus the Lord spoke
and the monks rejoiced and were delighted at his words
And as this exposition was being proclaimed the tenthousand worldsystem shook
When bhikkhus a bhikkhu understands as they really are the origin and passing away of the six bases of contact their satisfaction unsatisfactoriness and the escape from them then he understands what transcends all these views
Whatever recluses or brahmins bhikkhus are speculators about the past speculators about the future speculators about the past and the future together hold settled views about the past and the future and assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past and the futureall are trapped in this net with its sixtytwo divisions Whenever they emerge they emerge caught within this net trapped and contained within this very net
Just as bhikkhus a skillful fisherman or a fishermans apprentice after spreading a finemeshed net over a small pool of water
might think Whatever sizeable creatures there are in this pool all are trapped within this net trapped and contained in this very net
in the same way all those recluses and brahmins are trapped in this net with its sixtytwo divisions Whenever they emerge they emerge caught within this net trapped and contained within this very net
The body of the Tathāgata bhikkhus stands with the leash that bound it to existence cut
As long as his body stands gods and men shall see him
But with the breakup of the body and the exhaustion of the lifefaculty gods and men shall see him no more
Just as bhikkhus when the stalk of a bunch of mangoes has been cut all the mangoes connected to the stalk follow along with it in the same way the body of the Tathāgata stands with the leash that bound it to existence cut As long as his body stands gods and men shall see him But with the breakup of the body and the exhaustion of the lifefaculty gods and men shall see him no more 
When this was said the Venerable nanda said to the Exalted One It is wonderful venerable sir it is marvelous What is the title venerable sir of this exposition of the Dhamma 
nanda you may remember this exposition of the Dhamma as the Net of the Good as the Net of the Dhamma as the Supreme Net as the Net of Views You may remember it also as the Incomparable Victory in Battle 
Thus spoke the Exalted One
Elated in mind the bhikkhus delighted in the word of the Exalted One
And while this exposition was being spoken the tenthousandfold world system shook
THUS HAVE I HEARD Once the Lord was staying at Raja gaha in Jivaka Komarabhaccas mangogrove together with a large company of some twelve hundred and fifty monks
And at that time King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha having gone up to the roof of his palace was sitting there surrounded by his ministers on the fifteenthday fastday the fullmoon of the fourth month called Komudi
And King Ajatasattu on that fastday gave vent to this solemn utterance Delightful friends is this moonlight night Charming is this moonlight night Auspicious is this moonlight night
Can we not today visit some ascetic or Brahmin to visit whom would bring peace to our heart 
Then one minister said to King Ajatasattu Sire there is Purana Kassapa who has many followers a teacher of many who is wellknown renowned the founder of a sect highly honoured by the multitude of long standing longsince gone forth aged and venerable
May Your Majesty visit this Purana Kassapa
He may well bring peace to Your Majestys heart
At these words King Ajatasattu was silent
Another minister said Sire there is Makkhali Gosala who has many followers
He may well bring peace to your Majestys heart
At these words King Ajatasattu was silent
Another minister said Sire there is Ajita Kesakamball 
At these words King Ajatasattu was silent
Another minister said Sire there is Pakudha Kaccayana 
At these words King Ajatasattu was silent
Another minister said Sire there is Sanjaya Belatthaputta
At these words King Ajatasattu was silent
Another minister said Sire there is the Nigantha Nataputta who has many followers a teacher of many who is wellknownaged and venerable
May Your Majesty visit the Nigantha Nataputta
He may well bring peace to Your Majestys heart
At these words King Ajatasattu was silent
t Jthis time Jivaka Komarabhacca was sitting silently near King Ajatasattu
The King said to him You friend Jivaka why are you silent
Sire there is this Blessed Lord the Arahant the fullyenlightened Buddha staying in my mangogrove with a large company of some twelve hundred and fifty monks
And concerning the Blessed Gotama this fair report has been spread about This Blessed Lord is an Arahant a fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct the WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessed
May Your Majesty visit the Blessed Lord
He may well bring peace to Your Majestys heart
Then Jivaka have the ridingelephants made ready 
Very good Sire said Jivaka and he had five hundred sheelephants made ready and for the King the royal tusker Then he reported Sire the ridingelephants are ready Now is the time to do as Your Majesty wishes
And King Ajatasattu having placed his wives each on one of the five hundred sheelephants mounted the royal tusker and proceeded in royal state accompanied by torchbearers from Rajagaha towards Jivakas mangogrove
And when Kihg Ajatasattu came near the mangogrove he felt fear and terror and his hair stood on end
And feeling this fear and the rising of the hairs the King said to Jivaka Friend Jivaka you are not deceiving me
You are not tricking me
You are not delivering me up to an enemy
How is it that from this great number of twelve hundred and fifty monks not a sneeze a cough or a shout is to be heard 
Have no fear Your Majesty
I would not deceive you or hick you or deliver you up to an enemy
Approach Sire approach There are the lights burning in the round pavilion
So King Ajatasattu having ridden on his elephant as far as the ground would permit alighted and continued on foot to the door of the round pavilion Then he said Jivaka where is the Lord 
That is the Lord Sire That is the Lord sitting against the middle column with his order of monks in front of him 
Then King Ajatasattu went up to the Lord and stood to one side
and standing there to one side the King observed how the order of monks continued in silence like a clear lake and he exclaimed If only Prince Udayabhadda were possessed of such calm as this order of monks
Do your thoughts go to the one you love Your Majesty
Lord Prince Udayabhadda is very dear to me
If only he were possessed of the same calm as this order of monks
Then King Ajatasattu having bowed down to the Lord and saluted the order of monks with joined hands sat down to one side
and said Lord I would ask something if the Lord would deign to answer me
Ask Your Majesty anything you like
Lord just as there are these various craftsmen such as elephantdrivers horsedrivers chariotfighters archers stan dardbearers adjutants army caterers champions and senior officers scouts heroes brave fighters cuirassiers slaves sons cooks barbers bathmen bakers garlandmakers bleachers weavers basketmakers potters calculators and accountants and whatever other skills there are they enjoy here and now the visible fruits of their skills they themselves are delighted and pleased with this as are their parents children and colleagues and friends they maintain and support ascetics and Brahmins thus assuring for themselves a heavenly happy reward tending towards paradise
Can you Lord point to such a reward visible here and now as a fruit of the homeless life 
Your Majesty do you admit that you have put this question to other ascetics and Brahmins
 I admit it Lord 
Would Your Majesty mind saying how they replied
 I do not mind telling the Lord or one like him
Well then Your Majesty tell me
Once Lord I went to see Purana Kassapa
Having exchanged courtesies I sat down to one side
and said Good Kassapa just as there are these various craftsmen they enjoy here and now the visible fruits of their skills  
Can you Kassapa point to such a reward visible here and now as a fruit of the homeless life 
At this Lord Purana Kassapa said Your Majesty by the doer or instigator of a thing by one who cuts or causes to be cut by one who bums or causes to be burnt by one who causes grief and weariness by one who agitates or causes agitation who causes life to be taken or that which is not given to be taken commits burglary carries off booty commits robbery lies in ambush commits adultery and tells lies no evil is done
If with a razorsharp wheel one were to make of this earth one single mass and heap of flesh there would be no evil as a result of that no evil would accrue
If one were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing slaying cutting or causing to be cut burning or causing to be burnt there would be no evil as a result of that no evil would accrue
Or if one were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and causing to be given sacrificing and causing to be sacrificed there would be no merit as a result of that no merit would accrue
In giving selfcontrol abstinence and telling the truth there is no merit and no merit accrues 
Thus Lord Purana Kassapa on being asked about the present fruits of the homeless life explained nonaction to me
Just as if on being asked about a mango he were to describe a breadfruittree or on being asked about a breadfruittree he were to describe a mfingo so Purana Kassapa on being asked about the present fruits of the homeless life explained nonaction to me
And Lord I thought How should one like me think despitefully of any ascetic or Brahmin dwelling in my territory
so I neither applauded nor rejected Purana Kas sapas words
but though displeased not expressing my displeasure saying nothing rejecting and scorning speech I got up and left
Once I visited Makkhali Gosala and asked him the same question
Makkahali Gosala said Your Majesty there is no cause or condition for the defilement of beings they are defiled without cause or condition
There is no cause or condition for the purification of beings they are purified without cause or condition
There is no selfpower or otherpower there is no power in humans no strength or force no vigour or exertion
All beings all living things all creatures all that lives is without control without power or strength they experience the fixed course of pleasure and pain through the six kinds of rebirth
Tbere are one million four hundred thousand principal sorts of birth and six thousand others and again six hundred There are five hundred kinds of kamma or five kinds and three kinds and halfkamma sixtytwo paths sixtytwo intermediary aeons six classes of humankind eight stages of human progress four thousand nine hundred occupations four thousand nine hundred wanderers four thousand nine hundred abodes of nagas two thousand sentient existences three thousand hells thirtysix places of dust seven classes of rebirth as conscious beings seven as unconscious beings and seven as beings freed from bonds seven grades of devas men goblins seven lakes seven great and seven small protuberances seven great and seven small abysses seven great and seven small dreams eight million four hundred thousand aeons during which fools and wise run on and circle round till they make an end of suffering
Therefore there is no such thing as saying By this discipline or practice or austerity or holy life I will bring my unripened kamma to fruition or I will gradually make this ripened kamma go away
Neither of these things is possible because pleasure and pain have been measured out with a measure limited by the round of birthanddeath and there is neither increase nor decrease neither excellence nor inferiority
Just as a ball of string when thrown runs till it is all unravelled so fools and wise run on and circle round till they make an end of suffering 
Thus Lord Makkhali Gosala on being asked about the fruits of the homeless life explained the purification of the round of birthanddeath to me
So I neither applauded nor rejected Makkhali Gosalas words
but got up and left
Once I visited Ajita Kesakamball and asked him the same question
Ajita Kesakamball said Your Majesty there is nothing given bestowed offered in sacrifice there is no fruit or result of good or bad deeds there is not this world or the next there is no mother or father there are no spontaneously arisen beings there are in the world no ascetics or Brahmins who have attained who have perfectly practised who proclaim this world and the next having realised them by their own superknowledge
This human being is composed of the four great elements and when one dies the earth part reverts to earth the water part to water the fire part to fire the air part to air and the faculties pass away into space
They accompany the dead man with four bearers and the bier as fifth
their footsteps are heard as far as the cremationground
There the bones whiten the sacrifice ends in ashes
It is the idea of a fool to give this gift
the talk of those who preach a doctrine of survival is vain and false
Fools and wise at the breakingup of the body are destroyed and perish they do not exist after death
Thus Lord Ajita Kesakamball on being asked about the fruits of the homeless life explained the doctrine of annihilation to me
I got up and left
Once I visited Pakudha Kaccayana and asked him the same question
Pakudha Kaccayana said Your Majesty these seven things are not made or of a kind to be made uncreated unproductive barren false stable as a column
They do not shake do not change obstruct one another nor are they able to cause one another pleasure pain or both
What are the seven
The earthbody the waterbody the firebody the air body pleasure and pain and the lifeprinciple These seven are not made  
Thus there is neither slain nor slayer neither hearer nor proclaimer neither knower nor causer of knowing
And whoever cuts off a mans head with a sharp sword does not deprive anyone of life he just inserts the blade in the intervening space between these seven bodies 
Thus Lord Pakudha Kaccayana on being asked about the fruits of the homeless life answered with something quite different 
I got up and left
I visited the Nigantha Nataputta and asked him the same question
The Nigantha Nataputta said Your Majesty here a Nigantha is bound by a fourfold restraint
What four
He is curbed by all curbs enclosed by all curbs cleared by all curbs and claimed by all curbs
And as far as a Nigantha is bound by this fourfold restraint thus the Nigantha is called selfperfected selfcontrolled selfestablished
Thus Lord the Nigantha Nataputta on being asked about the fruits of the homeless life explained the fourfold restraint to me 
I got up and left
Once I visited Sanjaya Belatthaputta and asked him the same question
Sanjaya Belatthaputta said If you ask me Is there another world  if I thought so I would say so
But I dont think so I dont say it is so and I dont say otherwise I dont say it is not and I dont not say it is not
If you ask Isnt there another world   Both   Neither   Is there fruit and result of good and bad deeds  Isnt there    Both    Neither    Does the Tathagata exist after death  Does he not    Both    Neither   
 dont not say it is not 
Thus Lord Sanjaya Belatthaputta on being asked about the fruits of the homeless life replied by evasion
Just as if on being asked about a mango he were to describe a breadfruit tree
And I thought Of all these ascetics and Brahmins Sanjaya Belatthaputta is the most stupid and confused
 So I neither applauded nor rejected his words but go up and left
And so Lord I now ask the Blessed Lord Just as there are these various craftsmen   who enjoy here and now the visible fruits of their skills  assuring for themselves a heavenly happy reward 
Can you Lord point to such a reward visible here and now as a fruit of the homeless life 
I can Your Majesty
I will just ask a few questions in return
and you Sire shall answer as you see fit
What do you think Sire Suppose there were a man a slave a labourer getting up before you and going to bed after you willingly doing whatever has to be done wellmannered pleasantspoken working in your presence
And he might think It is strange it is wonderful the destiny and fruits of meritorious deeds
This King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha is a man and I too am a man
The King is addicted to and indulges in the fivefold sensepleasures just like a god
whereas I am a slave working in his presence
I ought to do something meritorious
Suppose I were to shave off my hair and beard don yellow robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness
And before long he does so
And he having thus gone forth might dwell restrained in body speech and thought satisfied with the minimum of food and clothing content in solitude
And then if people were to announce to you Sire you remember that slave who worked in your presence and who shaved off his hair and beard and went forth into homelessness
He is living restrained in body speech and thought  in solitude 
would you then say That man must come back and be a slave and work for me as before 
No indeed Lord
For we should pay homage to him we should rise and invite him and press him to receive from us robes food lodging medicines for sickness and requisites and make arrangements for his proper protection 
What do you think Sire Is that one fruit of the homeless life visible here and now
Certainly Lord
Then that Sire is the first such fruit of the homeless life
But Lord can you show any other reward visible here and now as a fruit of the homeless life 
I can Sire
I will just ask a few questions in return
and you Sire shall answer as you see fit
What do you think Sire Suppose there were a man a farmer a householder in your service the steward of an estate
He might think It is strange it is wonderful the destiny and fruits of meritorious deeds
This King Ajatasattu is a man and I too am a man
The King is addicted to and indulges in the fivefold senseplea sures just like a god
whereas I am a farmer the steward of an estate
I ought to do something meritorious
Suppose I were to  go forth from the household life into homelessness
