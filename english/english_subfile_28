venerable ones conduct has been unbroken flawless unblemished and unblotched and he consistently observes and follows virtuous behaviorBut in another case someone is afflicted with the loss of relatives wealth or health but he does reflect thus Human life in the world is such that the eight worldly conditions revolve around the world and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions namely gain and loss disrepute and fame blame and praise and pleasure and painThus when afflicted with the loss of relatives wealth or health he does not sorrow languish and lament he does

having abandoned these five obstructions hindrances encumbrances of the mind states that weaken wisdom it is possible that a bhikkhu with his powerful wisdom might know his own good the good of others

will is nonDhamma good will is the DhammaImpurity by body Cunda is threefoldIn a way bhikkhus you have all spoken well but listen and attend closely as I tell you what I intended when I said in the Pārāyana in The Questions of MetteyyaIn dependence on the right course there is success not failureIn earlier days Master Gotama a long time ago the brahmin student Soṇakāyana approached me and said The ascetic Gotama prescribes the desistance from all kammaIn misfortune their fortitude can be known and this only after a long time not casually by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive and by one who is wise not by one who is unwiseIn relation to the elementsIn that case bhikkhu you should train yourself thus My mind will be firm and well settled internallyIn that case friends you should come on the uposatha dayIn that case Sāriputta he does not give a gift with expectations with a bound mind looking for rewards he does not give a gift Having passed away I will make use of thisHe does not give a gift Giving is goodHe does not give a gift Giving was practiced before by my father and forefathers I should not abandon this ancient family customHe does not give a gift I cook these people do not cookIn that case Sāriputta he gives a gift with expectations with a bound mind looking for rewards he gives a gift Having passed away I will make use of thisHaving given such a gift with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in companionship with the devas the four great kingsIn that lodging elder bhikkhus are dwelling who are learned heirs to the heritage experts

past brahmins did not buy and sell brahmin women and they would initiate cohabitation only through mutual affection doing so for the sake of family continuityIn the past brahmins did not store up wealth grain silver and goldIn the past brahmins went seeking almsfood in the evening for their evening meal and in the morning for their morning mealIn the past householder there was a brahmin named VelāmaIn the past there was a teacher named Mūgapakkha   a teacher named Aranemi   a teacher named Kuddālaka   a teacher named Hatthipāla   a teacher named Jotipāla the founder of a spiritual sect one

seats each hoping Brahmā would sit on his couchAlso a monk continually contemplates the rise and fall of the five aggregates of grasping thinking Such is material form its arising and passing such are feelings such are perceptions such are the mental formations such is consciousness its arising and passingAlso a monk having learnt much remembers and bears in mind what he has learnt and those things that are beautiful in the beginning in the middle and in the ending which in spirit and letter proclaim the absolutely perfected and purified holy life he remembers and reflects on and penetrates them with visionAlso there were three monks who having observed the holy life under the Blessed Lord had been reborn in the inferior condition of gandhabbasAm now reborn a male a god Rejoicing in celestial blissAmbaravatiya Ambattha approached them and said Where is the Reverend Gotama to be found just nowAmbattha went up to the dwelling and on to the verandah coughed and knockedAmbattha you have not perfected your trainingamong the animalsamong the asurasamong the petasAmong them fierce enmity will prevail one for another fierce hatred fierce anger and thoughts of killing mother against child and child against mother father against child and child against father brother against brother brother against sister just as the hunter feels hatred for the beast he stalksAmong them kudrūsagrain will be the chief food just as rice and curry are todayAmong whom dwelling I shall make my final home An end of doubts our homage due The Buddha Victor Lord we givean immeasurable splendid lightAn important reference to the two truths referred to in DA as conventional speech and ultimately true speechAnanda replied Lord five hundred carts have passed this wayAnanda in Nadika more than fifty layfollowers have by the destruction of the five lower fetters been spontaneously reborn and will gain Nibbana from that state without returning to this worldAnd a Brahmin did likewise a Vessa did likewise and so did a SuddaAnd a certain practiser of mortification called Nigrodha consulted me about the practice of austerityAnd a certain tribe was on the move and its leader stayed for one night near the fireworshippers dwelling and then leftAnd a certain jīvika chanced to be coming along the main road towards Pāvā and he had picked a coraltree flower in Kusinārāand a disciple lives according to that doctrine and conforms to itAnd a lot of people went out of Atuma to where the two brothers and the four oxen were killedAnd a man from the crowd came to me saluted me and stood to one sideAnd a man with good eyesight taking it in his hand would describe it as suchAnd a second and a third time the Venerable Ananda made the same requestAnd a second time the Great Brahmā replied as beforeAnd a second time and a third timeAnd a young Brahmin called Uttara was put in charge of the distributionand adopting the ascetic Gotamas own wordsAnd after having eaten the meal provided by Cunda the Lord was attacked by a severe sickness with bloody diarrhoea and with sharp pains as if he were about to dieAnd after many hundreds and thousands of years the man saw that the sacred WheelTreasure had slipped from its positionAnd after that reward was done He reappeared with turbaned headAnd after the battle as victor I thought Whatever is now the food of the gods and what is the food of the asuras henceforth we shall enjoy bothAnd after thus reflecting in solitude on behalf of the Magadhan devotees the Venerable Ananda rose at the crack of dawn went to the Lord and saluted himAnd again a monk being fond of abandoning rejoices in abandoning and being fond of developing rejoices in developing is not therefore conceitedAnd all the five hundred garments even the innermost and the outermost cloth were burnt upAnd all the nonhuman beings full of rage would overwhelm him with abuseAnd all this has come aboutAnd all who lived in the villages round about started their daily work thinking it was daylightAnd Ambapali met the young Licchavis axle to axle wheel to wheel yoke to yokeAnd Ambapali when night was nearly over having had choice hard and soft food prepared at her home announced to the Lord that the meal was readyAnd among a number of monks who had gathered together after their meal after the almsround sitting in the Kareri pavilion there arose a serious discussion on former lives as they said This is how it was in a former life or That was how it wasAnd Ananda came to them and delivered the Lords wordsAnd Ananda thought If I allow the Mallas of Kusinārā to salute the Lord individually the night will have passed before they have all paid homageAnd another saidAnd another said No that is not how it isAnd any foolish people who have doubts or queries about the Tathagata will by listening to such talk have their doubts and queries resolvedAnd any monk who is an Arahant whose corruptions are destroyed who has lived the life done what was to be done laid down the burden gained the true goal who has completely destroyed the fetter of becoming and is liberated by supreme insight is incapable of doing nine things He is incapable of deliberately taking the life of a living being he is incapable of taking what is not given so as to constitute theft he is incapable of sexual intercourse he is incapable of telling a deliberate lie he is incapable of storing up goods for sensual indulgence as he did formerly in the household life he is incapable of acting wrongly through attachment he is incapable of acting wrongly through hatred he is incapable of acting wrongly through folly he is incapable of acting wrongly through fearAnd any who die while making the pilgrimage to these shrines with a devout heart will at the breakingup of the body after death be reborn in a heavenly worldAnd are rightly praised by allAnd as a result of the disappearance of their selfluminance the moon and the sun appeared night and day were distinguished months and fortnights appeared and the year and its seasonsand as a result the children of those whose lifespan had been a thousand years lived for only five hundredand as a result the children of those whose lifespan had been five hundred years lived some for two hundred and fifty years some for only two hundredAnd as far as a Nigantha is bound by this fourfold restraint thus the Nigantha is called selfperfected selfcontrolled selfestablishedAnd as he did so I gained insight into that Dhamma and from among the various things I established one in particular which was serene confidence in the Teacher that the Blessed Lord is a fullyenlightened Buddha that the Dhamma is well taught by the Blessed Lord and that the order of monks is welltrainedAnd as he did so on the fastday of the fifteenth when he had washed his head and gone up to the verandah on top of his palace for the fastday the sacred WheelTreasure appeared to him thousandspoked complete with felloe hub and all appurtenancesAnd as he receives the teaching he gains a grasp of both the spirit and the letter of the teachingAnd as he remained contemplating the rise and fall of the five aggregates of dinging before long his mind was freed from the corruptions without remainder And as he walked along with the Lord Ambattha looked out for the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on the Lords bodyAnd as I dwelt there in seclusion it occurred to me There is no abode of beings easily accessible that has not been visited by me for so long as that of the devas of the Pure AbodesAnd as I spoke with them they did not know me and wondered Who is it that speaks like this  a deva or a manAnd as Pokkharasati sat there the Lord delivered a graduated discourse on generosity on morality and on heaven showing the danger degradation and corruption of sensedesires and the profit of renunciationAnd as the night was ending Cunda had a fine meal of hard and soft food prepared with an abundance of pigs delight I have chosen this ambiguous expression to translate the controversial term sūkaramaddavaAnd as they continued to feed on the fungus so their bodies became coarser still and the difference in their looks increased still moreAnd as they did so their bodies became coarser still and the difference in their looks became even greaterAnd as they did so their bodies became coarser and a difference in looks developed among themAnd as they did so their bodies became even coarser and the difference in their looks increased still moreAnd as they sat there the Lord thanked them with these versesAnd as they sat the Lord instructed inspired fired and delighted them with a talk on DhammaAnd as this exposition was being proclaimed the tenthousand worldsystem shookAnd at his death the Niganthas were split into two parties quarrelling and disputing fighting and attacking each other with wordy warfare You dont understand this doctrine and discipline  I do How could you understand this doctrine and discipline Your way is all wrong  mine is right I am consistent  you arent You said last what you should have said first and you said first what you should have said last What you took so long to think up has been refuted Your argument has been overthrown youre defeated Go on save your doctrine  get out of that if you can You would have thought the Niganthas Nataputtas disciples were bent on killing each otherAnd at his death the Niganthas were split into two parties quarrelling and disputingAnd at his end to heaven went To dwell in joy and happinessAnd at my words Sunakkhatta left this Dhamma and discipline like one condemned to hellAnd at my words Sunakkhatta left this Dhamma and discipline like one condemned to hellAnd at that moment Vajirapāni the yakkha holding a huge iron club flaming ablaze and glowing up in the sky just above Ambattha was thinking If this young man Ambattha does not answer a proper question put to him by the Blessed Lord by the third time of asking Ill split his head into seven pieces The Lord saw Vajirapāni and so did AmbatthaAnd at that the Brahmins and householders leaving Khānumata in great numbers went to AmbalatthikaAnd at that time a large number of Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha were staying at Vesālī on some businessAnd at that time a lot of Sakyans were sitting on high seats in their meetinghall poking each other with their fingers laughing and playing about together and it seemed to me that they were just making fun of me and no one offered me a seatAnd at that time a multitude of thousands of devas were taking up lodging in PataligamaAnd at that time a wanderer called Subhadda was in Kusinārā and he heard that the ascetic Gotama was to attain final Nibbāna in the final watch of that nightAnd at that time King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha having gone up to the roof of his palace was sitting there surrounded by his ministers on the fifteenthday fastday the fullmoon of the fourth month called KomudiAnd at that time many very wellknown and prosperous Brahmins were staying at Manasakata including Canki Tārukkha Pokkharasati Jāṇussoni and TodeyyaAnd at that time Prince Payasi was living at Setavya a populous place full of grass timber water and corn which had been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift and with royal powersAnd at that time Sakka lord of the gods felt a strong desire to see the LordAnd at that time several hundred Brahmins were staying at Khānumata intending to take part in Kūṭadantas sacrificeAnd at that time Sigalaka the householders son having got up early and gone out of Rajagaha was paying homage with wet clothes and hair and with joined palms to the different directions to the east the south the west the north the nadir and the zenithAnd at that time the Brahmin Lohicca was living at Sālavatikā a populous place full of grass timber water and corn which had been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift and with royal powersAnd at that time the Lord was explaining the rebirths of various devotees up and down the country who had died and passed away Kasis and Kosalans Vajjians and Mallas Cetis and Vamsas Kurus and Pancalas Macchas and Surasenas saying This one was reborn there and that one thereAnd at that time the naked ascetic Korakkhattiya the dogman was going round on all fours sprawling on the ground and chewing and eating his food with his mouth aloneAnd at that time the wanderer Nigrodha was staying at the Udumbarikā lodging for wanderers with a large company of some three thousand wanderersAnd at that time the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda was at the debatinghall near the Tinduka tree in the singlehalled park of Queen Mallikā with a large crowd of about three hundred wanderersAnd at that time the youth Subha Todeyyas son was staying at Savatthi on some businessAnd at that time there was a naked ascetic living in Vesālī called Kaḷāramuṭṭhaka who enjoyed great gains and fame in the Vajjian capitalAnd at that time there was a naked ascetic living in Vesālī called Patikaputta who enjoyed great gains and fame in the Vajjian capitalAnd at that time Vasettha and Bhāradvāja were living among the monks hoping to become monks themselvesAnd at the Blessed Lords final passing there was a great earthquake terrible and hairraising accompanied by thunderAnd at the end of four months those monks who are established in mind may let him go forth and give him ordination to the status of a monkAnd at the end of one year the devas would proclaim Gentlemen one year has passed five remainAnd at the first campingplace they did not find any grass wood or water nor at the second the third fourth fifth sixth or seventh but there they saw the other caravan that had come to ruin and destruction and they saw the bones of those men and cattle that had been gobbled up by the yakkhaspiritAnd at the news he was overcome with fear and trembling and his hair stood on endAnd at the sight Ambattha was terrified and unnerved his hairs stood on end and he sought protection shelter and safety from the LordAnd at the thought Cessation cessation there arose in the Bodhisatta Vipassi with insight into things never realised before knowledge vision awareness and lightAnd at the thought Origin origin there arose in the Bodhisatta Vipassi with insight into things never realised before knowledge wisdom awareness and lightAnd at these words Nigrodha was silent and upset his shoulders drooped he hung his head and sat there downcast and bewilderedAnd at these words Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer said to the Lord Excellent Lord excellentand attains the four jhānasAnd because it was said that he was unblinkingly watchful the prince came to be called VipasSīAnd because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks the savoury earth disappearedAnd because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks the sweet fungus disappearedAnd before each gate were set seven pillars three or four times a mans heightAnd being thus delighted Ambapali said Lord may the Lord consent to take a meal from me tomorrow with his order of monks The Lord consented by silence and Ambapali understanding his acceptance rose from her seat saluted the Lord and passing him by to the right departedAnd being thus delighted they said Lord may the Lord consent to take a meal from us tomorrow with his order of monks But Licchavis I have already accepted a meal for tomorrow from the courtesan AmbapaliAnd being thus unattached he has experienced for himself perfect peace and having truly understood the arising and passing away of feelings their attraction and peril and the deliverance from them the Tathagata is liberated without remainderAnd being thus unattached he has experienced for himself perfect peace and having truly

for himself perfect peace and having truly understood the arising and passing away of feelings their attraction and peril and the deliverance from them the Tathagata is liberated without remainderAnd beyond this there is no further development of knowledge and conduct that is higher or more perfectAnd beyond this there is no sacrifice that is greater and more perfectAnd Bharadvaja agreedAnd Bhesika the barber followed the Lord close at handAnd Brahmā Sahampati uttered this verseand by compassionate love for the welfare of all living beings his mind is purified of illwill and hatredAnd by passing entirely beyond the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness seeing that there is no thing he reaches and remains in the Sphere of NoThingnessAnd by passing entirely beyond the Sphere of Infinite Space seeing that consciousness is infinite he reaches and remains in the Sphere of Infinite ConsciousnessAnd by passing entirely beyond the Sphere of NoThingness he reaches and remains in the Sphere of NeitherPerceptionNorNonPerceptionAnd by right liberation many wholesome states are developed and perfectedAnd by right view many wholesome states are developed and perfectedAnd by the understanding the penetration of the same Noble Truth of Suffering of the Origin of Suffering of the Cessation of Suffering and of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering the craving for becoming has been

heard that the Lord had arrived at Pāvā and was staying at his mangogroveAnd Cunda understanding his consent rose from his seat saluted the Lord and passing by to the right departedAnd cut the bonds of worldly living Delicious food hed still receiveAnd delightful to their earsAnd devas from ten worldsystems frequently came there to visit the Lord and his order of monksAnd did you not think I might cause this real Arahant ascetic offenceAnd during the Rains the Lord was attacked by a severe sickness with sharp pains as if he were about to dieAnd even at these words Pāṭikaputta still wriggled about but could not riseAnd every one of the gods he spoke to thought He is sitting on my couch he is speaking to me aloneAnd feeling this fear and the rising of the hairs the King said to Jīvaka Friend Jivaka you are not deceiving meAnd finesttasting drinks he wasAnd five hundred carts went rumbling by very close to himAnd for fear of contaminating the stock they cohabited with their own sistersAnd for that reason the ThirtyThree Gods were pleased happy filled with delight and joy saying The devas hosts are growing the asuras hosts are declining And for this reason he was all the more called VipassiAnd from the moment of his ordination the Venerable Subhadda alone secluded unwearying zealous and resolute in a short time attained to that for which young men of good family go forth from the household life into homelessness that unexcelled culmination of the holy life having realised it here and now by his own insight and dwelt therein Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is nothing further hereAnd from these four classes the class of ascetics came into existenceand gets his filland gets his fillAnd goes with others wellloved wivesAnd grasped its meaningand has been banished from the country or the cityand have right views will after death at the breakingup of the body be born in a happy state a heavenly worldAnd having been made King Renu abandoned himself to the pleasures of the five sensesAnd having passed away from there I arose hereAnd having passed away from there I arose hereAnd having stayed at Naḷanda as long as he wished the Lord said to Ananda Let us go to Paṭaligama And they did soAnd having thereby delivered that company from the great bondage thus rescuing eightyfour thousand beings from the great path of peril I entered into the fireelement and rose into the air to the height of seven palmtrees and projecting a beam for the height of another seven so that it blazed and shed fragrance I

consciousness which is bound to it and dependent on it And he knows This my body is material made up of the four great elementsAnd he made a good and fair division into eight portions and then said to the assembly Gentlemen please give me the urn and I will erect a great stupa for itAnd he made this declaration in the assembly of Vesālī The ascetic Gotama claims to be a man of wisdom and I make the same claimAnd he might think It is strange it is wonderful the destiny and fruits of meritorious deedsAnd he might think These are entering a houseAnd he might think This pond is clearAnd he said to

by itAnd he spread out his cloak gathered up the dung in it made it into a bundle and put it on his head and went onAnd he stayed in the dense jungle of IcchanankalaAnd he that sings Lift up your hearts And he thinks So my body is light and fitAnd he thinks So my body is strong and fitAnd he thinks That Brahmahe made us and he is permanent stable eternal not subject to change the same for ever and everand he thinks This indisposition might get worse so Ill stir up energyand he thinksit might be that the illness will recurAnd he thought There were also Magadhan disciples of long standing who have died and passed awayAnd he thought What difference is there between me and the lion king of beastsAnd he thought Alas the world is perishing it will be destroyed because the mind of Vipassi the Blessed Lord the Arahant the fullyenlightened Buddha is inclined to inaction rather than to teaching the DhammaAnd he thought These eightyfour thousand elephants wait on me evening and morningAnd he was delighted with my explanation beyond all measure Lord who on hearing Dhamma from you would fail to be delighted beyond all measureAnd he was devoted to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and observed the discipline perfectlyAnd he would rejoice and be glad about thatAnd he constantly patrolling and following along a path might not see the joins and clefts in the bastion even such as a cat might creep throughAnd he constantly patrolling and following along a path might not see the joins and clefts in the bastion even such as a cat might creep throughAnd he having thus gone forth might dwell restrained in body speech and thought satisfied with the minimum of food and clothing content in solitudeAnd he having thus gone forth might dwellAnd HeWhoKnowsbyInsight saw all thisAnd HeWhoKnowswithInsight was awareAnd here he said to the monks Monks I will teach you four criteriaAnd here Lord having been sent by King Vessavana on some business to King Virulhaka I saw the Lord entering the Brick House and sitting down and considering the question of the Magadhan devoteesand his disciples have fully mastered the true Dhamma the full purity of the holy life has become clear and evident to them in the logic of its unfolding and has been sufficiently grounded among them while being thus wellproclaimed among humans by the time of the Teachers passing from themand his gross tendencies of body speech and thought are allayedAnd how does a monk dwell as an island unto himself as a refuge unto himself with no other refuge with the Dhamma as his island with the Dhamma as his refuge with no other refugeAnd how does a monk dwell as an island unto himselfAnd how does a monk live as an island unto himselfAnd how does this craving come to be abandoned how does its cessation come aboutAnd however much one declares it is so and not otherwiseAnd however much one declares it is so and not otherwiseAnd I am not under the sway of what I know and not being under its sway I have come to know for myself that quenching by the realisation of which the Tathagata cannot fall into perilous pathsAnd I am not under the sway of what I know and not being under its sway I have come to know for myself that quenching by the realisation of which the Tathāgata cannot fall into perilous pathsAnd I do not see this division of Ariyan concentration fulfilled thus anywhere among the ascetics and Brahmins of other schoolsAnd I do not see this division of Ariyan morality fulfilled thus anywhere among the ascetics and Brahmins of other schoolsAnd I do not see this division of Ariyan wisdom fulfilled thus anywhere among the ascetics and Brahmins of other schoolsAnd I dont say it is not and I dont not say it is not Is there no other world Is there both another world and no other world Is there neither another world nor no other world Are there spontaneouslyborn beings Are there not Both Neither Does the Tathagata exist after deathAnd I dont say otherwiseAnd I go for refuge to the Blessed Lord Gotama to the Dhamma and to the SanghaAnd I have heard say that when this happens to a wheelturning monarch he has not much longer to liveAnd I instructed inspired fired and delighted them with a discourse on DhammaAnd I might not be able to replyAnd I perceived the destiny and fate of each one of themAnd I repliedAnd I said to himAnd I said to him Well Sunakkhatta what do you thinkAnd I say to you I declare to you Sunakkhatta there will be those who will say Sunakkhatta the Licchavi was unable to maintain the holy life under the ascetic Gotama and being thus unable he abandoned the training and reverted to a base lifeand I say Kill this man without wounding his cuticle skin flesh sinews bones or marrow and they do soAnd I say Take this man and put him alive in a jarand I say Weigh this man on the scales alive then strangle him and weigh him againAnd I thought Of all these ascetics and Brahmins Sañjaya Belatthaputta is the most stupid and confusedAnd I knowing his thought in my own mind said to him You foolish man do you claim to be a follower of the Sakyan Lord what do you mean by this question Sunakkhatta did you not on seeing that naked ascetic going around on all fours think Now that is a real Arahant ascetic who goes round on all fours sprawling on the ground and chewing and eating his food with his mouth alone I did LordAnd I Lord go for refuge to the Blessed Lord the Dhamma and the SanghaAnd I Lord go for refuge to the Blessed Lord the Dhamma and the SanghaAnd I Lord go for refuge to the Blessed Lord to the Dhamma and to the SanghaAnd I Reverend Kassapa go for refuge to the Blessed Lord to the Dhamma and to the SanghaAnd if any of them were to have found this perfection in themselves they would have been so delighted that they would have said Weve done enoughAnd if any of them were to have found this perfection in themselves they would have been so delighted that they would have said Weve done enoughAnd if anyone blames that teacher his blame is improper untrue not in accordance with reality and faultyAnd if anyone blames that teacher his blame is improper untrue not in accordance with reality and faultyAnd if anyone were despised by this company his reputation would suffer and then his income would suffer for our income depends on the gaining of a reputationAnd if anyone were to say to such a disciple Well reverend sir by following that system you will be successful then the one who thus commended it and that which was commended and the one who on hearing such commendation shouldmake still greater efforts would all gain much meritAnd if anyone were to say to that pupil Come now reverend sir and practise according to the doctrine proclaimed and given out by your teacher  then the one who urged this the thing urged and the one who so practised would all gain much demeritAnd if anyone were to say Well reverend sir by following that system you will be successful the one who so recommended it that which was recommended and the one who on hearing such recommendation should make still greater efforts would all gain much demeritAnd if anyone were to say Well reverend sir you should follow the teaching proclaimed by your teacher then the one who urged this that which was urged and the one who so practised would all gain much meritAnd if he goes forth into homelessness he will become a fullyenlightened BuddhaAnd if he goes forth into homelessness he will become a fullyenlightened BuddhaAs such how does he benefitand if he is learned and wise and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle  then he can be recognised as a true Brahmin and truthfully claim to be so And if he performs four I will perform eightAnd if he replies They mean this then his words should be neither rejected nor disparaged but you should explain to him carefully the correct meaningAnd if he thinks otherwise his head will split in pieces And if he thinks otherwise his head will split in piecesAnd if he were to add anything to it thinking In this way it will be more complete then he does not see itAnd if I were distressed that would be a hindrance to meAnd if I were then asked Venerable Sariputta why do you accord this highest recognition to one and not the otherAnd if I were to teach Dhamma to others and they did not understand me that would be a weariness and a trouble to meAnd if on entering the assembly I should take off my turban may you take it as if I had bowed at your feetAnd if people were to tell you thisAnd if having come into the presence of the ascetic Gotama I were to turn away without showing myself this company might despise meAnd in connection with this the Great King Vessavana reflected in his mind It is marvellous it is wonderful that such a glorious Teacher should arise that there should be such a glorious proclamation of Dhamma and that such glorious paths to the sublime should be made known Then Brahmā Sanankumāra reading King Vessavanas mind said to him What do you think King Vessavanaand in mastering these one is aware that one knows and sees themAnd in return we would grant him a share of the riceAnd in the evening emerging from meditative seclusion the Lord came out of the Brick House and sat down on the prepared seat in the shade of his lodgingAnd in the evening the Lord rose from his secluded meditation and came out of the mansion and started walking up and down in its shadeAnd in the parts where powerful devas settled they caused the minds of the most powerful royal officials to pick those sites for their dwellings and where middle and lowerranking devas settled so too they caused the minds of royal officials of corresponding grade to pick those sites for their dwellingsAnd in the time of those people this continent of Jambudipa will be powerful and prosperous and villages towns and cities will be but a cocks flight one from the nextAnd in this present fortunate aeon the Lords Buddhas Kakusandha Konagamana and Kassapa arose in the worldAnd in this sacrifice no bulls were slainAnd in this way Vasettha taking what was not given and censuring and lying and punishment took their originAnd in those days whenever anyone sneezed or stumbled they used to say Praise be to the Great StewardAnd in whatever country the Wheel stopped the King took up residence with his fourfold armyAnd in whatever country the Wheel stopped the King took up residence with his fourfold armyAnd indeed all this came aboutAnd indeed it is good to see such ArahantsAnd indeed it is good to see such ArahantsAnd indeed it is good to see such ArahantsAnd indeed it is good to see such ArahantsAnd indeed as that night was ending the Venerable Ananda dressed in the early morning took his robe and bowl and accompanied by the Venerable Cetaka came to Subhas dwelling and sat down on the prepared seatand inform them of the way in which Prince Pāyāsi and the young Brahmin Uttara have been rebornAnd is he of such nature and not otherwise Sir he is as he is reported to be and he is of such nature and not otherwiseAnd it is by understanding and penetrating the Ariyan morality the Ariyan concentration the Ariyan wisdom and the Ariyan liberation that the craving for becoming has been cut off the tendency towards becoming has been exhausted and there will be no more rebirthAnd it is good to see such ArahantsAnd it may be that he will tell you Friend Sunakkhatta I know my fateAnd it may happen that a being falls from that realm and arises in this worldAnd it may happen that some being falls from that realm and arises in this worldAnd it occurred to four devas of the Pure Abodes The Blessed Lord is staying at Kapilavatthu with a large company of some five hundred monks all ArahantsAnd it seems to me that if these good ascetics and Brahmins who are so moral and wellconducted know that after death they will be better off then these good people would now take poison take a knife and kill themselves hang themselves or jump off a cliffAnd it seems to me Lord that the drift of the Dhamma is the sameAnd it seems to me Lord that the drift of the Dhamma is the sameAnd it was not long before their minds were freed from the corruptions without remainderAnd it was through having undertaken these seven rules that he enjoyed the greatest gains and fame of all in the Vajjian capitalAnd it was twelve yojanas long from east to west and seven yojanas wide from north to southAnd it was twelve yojanas long from east to west and seven yojanas wide from north to southAnd just as a clean cloth from which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly so in Prince Khanda and Tissa the chaplains son as they sat there there arose the pure and spotless DhammaEye and they knew Whatever things have an origin must come to cessationAnd just as a clean cloth from which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly so in the Brahmin Kūṭadanta as he sat there there arose the pure and spotless Dhammaeye and he knew Whatever things have an origin must come to cessationAnd just as a clean cloth from which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly so in the Brahmin Pokkharasati as he sat there there arose the pure and spotless Dhammaeye and he knew Whatever things have an origin must come to cessation And just as a clean clothreceives the dye perfectly so in those eightyfour thousand as they sat there there arose the pure and spotless Dhammaeye and they knew Whatever things have an origin must come to cessationAnd just as in a pool of blue red or white lotuses some are born in the water grow in the water and not leaving the water thrive in the water some are born in the water and reach the surface while some are born in the water and having reached the surface grow out of the water and are not polluted by it in the same way monks the Lord Buddha Vipassi surveying the world with his Buddhaeye saw some beings with little dust on their eyesAnd just then Nigrodha was sitting in the midst of a large crowd of wanderers who were all shouting and screaming and making a great clamour and indulging in various kinds of unedifying conversation about kings robbers ministers armies dangers war food drink clothes beds garlands perfumes relatives carriages villages towns and cities countries women heroes street and wellgossip talk of the departed desultory chat speculation about land and sea talk of being and nonbeingAnd just then Prince Payasi had gone up to the verandah for his midday restAnd just then the river was so full that a crow could drink out of itAnd King Ajatasattu said to his chief minister the Brahmin Vassakara Brahmin go to the Blessed Lord worship him with your head to his feet in my name ask if he is free from sickness or disease if he is living at ease vigorously and comfortably and then say Lord King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha wishes to attack the Vajjians and says I will strike the Vajjiansbring them to ruin and destruction And whatever the Lord declares to you report that faithfully back to me for Tathagatas never lieAnd King Ajatasattu on that fastday gave vent to this solemn utterance Delightful friends is this moonlight nightAnd King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha heard that the Lord had passed away at KusinārāAnd he sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārā The Lord was a Khattiya and I am a KhattiyaAnd King Ajātasattu having placed his wives each on one of the five hundred sheelephants mounted the royal tusker and proceeded in royal state accompanied by torchbearers from Rajagaha towards Jīvakas mangogroveAnd King Mahasudassana thinking What is this great noise as of a crowd of people came out of the door and saw Queen Subhadda leaning against the doorpostAnd King Okkāka furiously angry exclaimed So this fellow the son of a slavegirl wants my daughter and put an arrow to his bowAnd Korakkhattiya sat up and rubbed his back with his hand and said Friend Sunakkhatta I know my fateAnd Kutadanta planned a great sacrifice seven hundred bulls seven hundred bullocks seven hundred heifers seven hundred hegoats and seven hundred rams were all tied up to the sacrificial postsAnd Kūṭadanta served the Buddha and his monks with the finest foods with his own hands until they were satisfiedAnd later because of this burning they indulged in sexual activityAnd leaving that he entered the second the third the fourth jhānaAnd leaving the road the Venerable Kassapa the Great sat down under a treeAnd led the life the Buddha taughtAnd led the matchless life he taught Have reappeared in humble state And not attained your proper rank A sorry sight it is to seeAnd likewise about the futureAnd likewise with compassion sympathetic joy and equanimityAnd likewise do the ways of the various Brahminslead the one who follows them to union with BrahmāAnd Lohicca said to Bhesika the barber Friend Bhesika go to the ascetic Gotama ask in my name after his health and then say May the Reverend Gotama consent to take tomorrows meal with his order of monks from the Brahmin LohiccaAnd Lohicca as the night was ending had choice hard and soft foods prepared at his own homeAnd many thousands of them came to me saluted me and stood to one sideAnd Maras hosts drew back from those on whomAnd may the Reverend Gotama and his order of monks accept a meal from me tomorrowAnd Mara the Evil One came to me stood to one side and said May the Blessed Lord now attain final Nibbana may the WellFarer now attain final Nibbanaand my body is heavy and useless as if I were pregnantAnd night The Shrouder as men say Comes again in daylights place There too this moving watery mass The deep and mighty ocean swells This they know and this men callAnd no one knows any way of escape from this suffering this ageing and deathand not being under the sway of what I know I have come to know that quenching by the realisation of which the Tathāgata cannot fall into perilous waysAnd now in his last hour the Lord tells him to stand aside and not stand in front of himAnd now is the time for the Blessed Lord to do as he sees fitAnd now Ananda let us go to the River Kakutthā Very good Lord said nandaAnd now as for your doubts and perplexities concerning me we will clarify these by your asking me and by my answering your questionsAnd now monks my father was King Suddhodana my mother was Queen Maya and the royal capital was KapilavatthuAnd now Reverend Gotama may I departAnd now sir we must go we have many duties many things to do Do so Kings when you think fitAnd now Sunakkhatta I will go into Vesālī for almsAnd of the three two struggled hard And bore in mind the Teachers wordAnd of these four castes three  the Khattiyas the merchants and the artisans  are entirely subservient to the BrahminsAnd of this world with its devas and maras and Brahmas with its ascetics and Brahmins its princes and people the Tathagata is the unvanquished conqueror the seer and ruler of allAnd of those who have not fully mastered it some by the destruction of the five lower fetters will be reborn spontaneously attaining thence to Nibbana without returning to this world some by the destruction of three fetters and the reduction of greed hatred and delusion will become OnceReturners who will return once more to this world before making an end of suffering and some by the destruction of three fetters will become StreamWinners incapable of falling into states of woe assured of enlightenmentAnd on the seventh day the Mallas of Kusinara thought We have paid sufficient honour with song and danceAnd once installed Jotipāla carried out the business his father had carried out not doing any business his father had not doneAnd once the King to try him mounted the ElephantTreasure at crack of dawn and rode him from sea to sea returning to Kusāvatī in time for breakfastAnd once the King to try it went on nightmanoeuvres on a dark night with his fourfold army with the JewelTreasure fixed to the top of his standardAnd once the King to try him went on board a ship and had it taken to the current in the middle of the GangesAnd one knows Thus conditioned knowledge arisesAnd one man said to his friend Come along lets go to that neighbourhood we might find something valuable His friend agreed so they went to that district and came to a village streetAnd one morning early the householder Sandhana came to Rājagaha in order to see the LordAnd one who is thus skilful not lax clearly aware and mindful is known as a monk who is true to the ancient original Ariyan lineageAnd one who is thus skilful not lax clearly aware and mindful is known as a monk who is true to the ancient original Ariyan lineageAnd out of this body he produces another body having a form mindmade complete in all its limbs and facultiesAnd Pataliputta will face three perils from fire from water and from internal dissensionAnd people said This Brahmin is truly a stewardAnd Pokkharasati heard say The ascetic Gotama son of the Sakyans who has gone forth from the Sakya clanis staying in the dense jungle of IcchanankalaAnd Pokkharasati said to Ambattha Ambattha my son the ascetic GotamaAnd Pokkharasati having seen attained experienced and penetrated the Dhamma having passed beyond doubt transcended uncertainty having gained perfect confidence in the Teachers doctrine without relying on others said Excellent Lord excellentAnd Pokkharasāti said to the Lord May the Reverend Gotama accept a meal from me today together with his order of monks And the Lord consented by silenceAnd Prince Payasi developed the following evil opinion There is no other world there are no spontaneously born beings there is no fruit or result of good or evil deeds Meanwhile the Brahmins and householders of Setavya heard the news The ascetic KumāraKassapa a disciple of the ascetic Gotama is touring round Kosala with a large company of about five hundred monks he has arrived at Setavya and is staying to the north of Setavya in the Simsapā Forest and concerning the Reverend Kassapa a good report has been spread about He is learned experienced wise wellinformed a fine speaker able to give good replies venerable an ArahantAnd Prince Pāyāsi heard of his words so he sent for him and asked him if he had said thatAnd Prince Pāyāsi because he had established his charity grudgingly not with his own hands and without proper concern like something casually tossed aside was reborn after his death at the breakingup of the body in the company of the Four Great Kings in the empty Serīsaka mansionAnd Prince Vipassi gazed at the corpse of the dead manAnd Prince Vipassi mounted a carriage and drove in procession to the pleasureparkAnd Prince Vipassi questioned the man who had gone forthAnd Prince Vipassi was much beloved of the peopleAnd Prince Vipassi shaving off his hair and beard and putting on yellow robes went forth from the household life into homelessnessAnd Pukkusa offered the robes to the Lord saying Here Lord are two fine sets of robes of clothofgoldAnd Pāyāsi of the devas went to the Venerable Gavampati saluted him and stood to one sideAnd Queen Subhadda said to the CounsellorTreasure Friend Counsellor draw up the fourfold armyAnd Sahadhamma Accuta Anejaka Sūleyya Rucira the Vasavanesis These ten with tenfold varied hostsAnd Sakka expressed his delight at the Lords answerAnd Sakka expressed his delight at the Lords answerAnd Sakka rejoiced at the answer as beforeAnd Sakka said to the ThirtyThree Gods Gentlemen when such signs are seen such light is seen and such radiance shines forth Brahma will appearAnd Sakka thought Where is the Blessed Lord the fullyenlightened Buddha now stayingAnd Sakka ruler of the devas uttered this verseAnd seeing Sigalaka paying homage to the different directions he said Householders son why have you got up early to pay homage to the different directions Lord my father when he was dying told me to do soAnd seeing the delight of the ThirtyThree Gods he uttered these verses of rejoicingAnd seeing their intentions he uttered this verse on the spotAnd seven days after the royal sage had gone forth the Wheel disappearedAnd she served the Buddha and his monks with choice hard and soft food till they were satisfiedAnd should he choose to leave the world Such things likewise hell receiveAnd similarly with regard to pleasure and painAnd similarly with the mindmade acquired self and the formless acquired selfAnd since I had only just heard King Vessavana announce to his assembly what those folks fates were it is no wonder that I thought I will go and see the Lord and report this to himAnd since sir you praise that Blessed Lord so highly let us meet todayAnd sitting in the group was one Subhadda who had gone forth late in life and he said to those monks Enough friends do not weep and wailAnd sitting thus crosslegged he said to the ThirtyThree Gods For how long has the Blessed Lord been one of mighty wisdomAnd six thousand yakkhas from Himālaya Of varied hue and wellendowed with powers Fair to see with splendid train have comeAnd so at death he went to heavenAnd so he continues to pervade the whole wide world above below across and everywhere with a mind filled with lovingkindness extensive developed measureless free from hatred and illwillAnd so it is too with nuns with male and female layfollowersAnd so Kūṭadanta went with a large company of Brahmins to AmbalaṭṭhikāAnd so one name for this exposition is The Serene FaithAnd so Sonadanda went with a large company of Brahmins to Gaggarās lotuspondand so suffuses drenches fills and irradiates his body that there is no spot in his entire body that is untouched by this delight and joy born of detachmentAnd so the Brahmins and householders of Setavya leaving Setavya by the north gate in large numbers made for the Simsapā ForestAnd so the gate by which the Lord went out was called the Gotama GateAnd so the holy life waxed mighty and prospered and spread widely as it was proclaimed among mankindAnd so the Lord Buddha Vipassi as swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his flexed arm or flex it again vanished there and then from the root of that tree of enlightenment and reappeared in the royal capital of Bandhumati in the deerpark of KhemaAnd so the ThirtyThree their leader too Each thinks He speaks to me aloneAnd so the Venerable Gavampati on his return to earth declared You should give ungrudgingly with your own hands with proper concern not carelesslyAnd so these Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha went to the Great Forest to the Gabled HallAnd so these two teacher and pupil directly opposing each others arguments followed close behind the Lord and his order of monksAnd so they took the embersAnd so they will abstain from the taking of life and having undertaken this good thing will practise itAnd so this great crowd of eightyfour thousand left Bandhumati for the deerpark of Khema where the Lord Buddha Vipassi wasAnd so too it is with Anandaand so trains himself thinking I will breathe out calming the whole bodily processAnd so we should all recite it together  without disagreement so that this holy life may be enduring and established for a long time thus to be for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit welfare and happiness of devas and humansAnd so carried by such mounts All the region they traverseAnd so gentlemen it seems to me that the ascetic Gotama must have been at that time either King Mahavijita the lord of the sacrifice or else the Brahmin chaplain who conducted the sacrifice for himAnd so Lord I met the lady not then but laterAnd so Lord out of respect for my fathers words which I revere honour and hold sacred I have got up thus early to pay homage in this way to the six directions But householders son that is not the right way to pay homage to the six directions according to the Ariyan discipline Well Lord how should one pay homage to the six directions according to the Ariyan disciplineAnd so monks a great crowd of eightyfour thousand having shaved off their hair and beards and donned yellow robes followed the Bodhisatta Vipassī into homelessnessAnd so Nigrodha when you ask What Lord is this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples and which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support and the perfection of the holy lifeAnd so paying homage in the same way they waited for a second a third a fourth a fifth a sixth dayAnd so Prince I will question you about it and you shall reply as you think fitAnd so renounced or not this signAnd so sir we shall all go to visit the ascetic GotamaAnd some of the Brahmins and householders saluted the Venerable KumāraKassapa and then sat down to one side while some first exchanged courtesies with him some saluted him with joined palms some announced their name and clan and some silently sat down to one sideAnd some of the yakkhas saluted him and sat down to one side some exchanged courtesies with him before sitting down same saluted him with joined palms some announced their name and clan and some sat down in silenceAnd some of the young Licchavis were all in blue with blue makeup blue clothes and blue adornment while some were in yellow some in red some in white with white makeup white clothes and white adornmentAnd some people were looking for a boat and some were looking for a raft and some were binding together a raft of reeds to get to the other sideAnd sometimes a Khattiya takes life takes what is not given commits sexual misconduct tells lies indulges in slander harsh speech or idle chatter is grasping malicious or of wrong viewsAnd Sonadanda served the Buddha and his monks with the finest foods with his own hands until they were satisfiedAnd sooner or later after a very long period of time savoury earth spread itself over the waters where those beings wereAnd spends his time in wicked deeds In this world and the next as wellAnd standing there he might say This is what King Pasenadi of Kosala says Would he be speaking the Kings words as if he were the Kings equal No indeed Reverend GotamaAnd still among gandhabbas dwells These two on highest wisdom set In deep absorption spurn the godsAnd stinginess destroy a manand strives to overcome evil unwholesome mental states that have arisenand strives to overcome evil unwholesome mental states that have arisenand strives to produce unarisen wholesome mental statesAnd Subha said to a certain young man Go my lad to where the ascetic Ananda is ask him in my name if he is in good health free from fatigue strong vigorous and dwelling in comfort and say It would be good if the Reverend Ananda would out of compassion visit the dwelling of Subha the son of TodeyyaAnd Subhadda made his request a second and a third time but still Ananda refused itAnd Subhadda said to the Venerable nanda Friend nanda it is a great gain for you all it is very profitable for you that you have obtained the consecration of discipleship in the Teachers presence And such people will know only three kinds of disease greed fasting and old ageAnd Suppiya  was finding fault in all sorts of ways with the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha whereas his pupil Brahmadatta was speaking in various ways in their praiseAnd Suppiya too stopped there for the night with his pupil BrahmadattaAnd Suppiya went on abusing the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha while his pupil Brahmadatta defended themAnd suppose he were to step aside and some workman or workmans servant were to come along and stand in his placeAnd suppose that after a time when it had grown cold and gone out he weighed it againAnd that has been renounced given up rejected abandoned forsaken the Tathagata has renounced the lifeprincipleAnd that is how the CounsellorTreasure appeared to King Mahasudassana and how he was equipped with all the seven treasuresAnd that is how the ElephantTreasure appeared to King MahasudassanaAnd that is how the HorseTreasure appeared to King MahasudassanaAnd that is how the HouseholderTreasurer appeared to King MahāsudassanaAnd that is how the JewelTreasure appeared to King MahāsudassanaAnd that is how the WomanTreasure appeared to King MahasudassanaAnd that is the reason why Sunakkhatta comes to see heavenly sights but not to hear heavenly sounds and that is the way in which the cessation of perception is brought about by successive steps That is right PoṭṭhapādaAnd that is why Reverend Kassapa I believe there is no other worldAnd that is why Reverend Kassapa I believe there is no other worldAnd that is why seeing the danger of such miracles IAnd that man might say Sir there is something called the Gandhāra charmAnd that man might say Sir there is something called the Manika charmAnd that monk attained to such a state of mental concentration that the way to the devarealms appeared before himAnd that monk went up to him and said Friend where do the four great elements  earth water fire air  cease without remainder to which the Great Brahmā replied Monk I am Brahmā Great Brahmā the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Lord the Maker and Creator the Ruler Appointer and Orderer Father of All That Have Been and Shall BeAnd that stream whose water had been churned up by the wheels and was not good dirty and disturbed as Ananda approached it began to flow pure bright and unsulliedAnd that monks is called the Noble Truth of SufferingAnd that monks is called the Noble Truth of the Cessation of SufferingAnd that monks is called the Noble Truth of the Origin of SufferingAnd that monks is called the way of practice leading to the cessation of sufferingAnd that monks is how a monk abides contemplating body as bodyAnd that monks is how a monk abides contemplating body as bodyAnd that monks is how a

internal and external sensebasesAnd that Poṭṭhapāda is the way in which the cessation of perception is brought about by successive stepsAnd that Reverend Kassapa is my reason for maintaining that there is no other worldAnd that Reverend Kassapa is my reason for maintaining There is no other worldAnd the answer isAnd the ascetics and Brahmins thus ministered to by him as the zenith will reciprocate in six ways they will restrain him from evil encourage him to do good be benevolently compassionate towards him teach him what he has not heard clarify what he has heard and point out to him the way to heavenAnd the Blessed Lord has said I will not take final Nibbana till I have nuns and female disciples who are accomplishedAnd the Blessed Lord taught me Dhamma most excellently and perfectly contrasting the dark with the lightAnd the Brahmins and householders of Campa heard say The ascetic Gotama of the Sakyans who has gone forth from the Sakya clan is travelling among the Angasand is staying by Gaggaras lotuspoolAnd the Brahmins and householders of Khānumata heard say The ascetic Gotamais staying at AmbalatthikaAnd the Brahmins asked him why he did not applaud the ascetic Gotamas fine wordsAnd the children of those whose lifespan was ten years will live for twenty yearsAnd the city of Kusavati was never free of ten sounds by day or night the sound of elephants horses carriages kettledrums sidedrums lutes singing cymbals and gongs with cries of Eat drink and be merry as tenthAnd the city of Kusāvatī was never free of ten sounds by day or night the sound of elephants horses carriages kettledrums sidedrums lutes singing cymbals and gongs with cries of Eat drink and be merry as tenthAnd the devas as well as the Mallas of Kusinara honoured the Lords body with divine and human dancing song and they carried the body to the north of the city brought it in through the north gate through the middle of the city and out through the eastern gate to the Mallas shrine of Makutahere they set the body downand the disciple having taken it up follows it practising it properly and keeping to itAnd the females developed female sexorgans and the males developed male organsAnd the Four Great Kings stood up saluted the Lord passed by on his right side and vanishedAnd the Four Great Kings with a great array of yakkhas of gandhabbas of kumbhandas and of nagas having set up a guard a defensive force a watch over the four quarters as night was drawing to a close went to see the Lord lighting up the entire Vultures Peak with their radiance saluted him and sat down to one sideAnd the gold staircase had gold posts with silver railings and banisters the silver had silver posts with gold railings and banisters and so onAnd the goodlooking ones despised the others saying We are betterlooking than they areAnd the goodlooking ones despised the othersAnd the Great King Vessavana having heard and received it in person related it to his followersAnd the Great Steward felt fear and trembling and his hair stood on end at such a sight as he had never seen beforeAnd the householder Kevaddha  came to the Lord prostrated himself before him and sat down to one sideAnd the householder Sandhāna also returned to RājagahaAnd the King said Do not take lifeAnd the King thought What a wonderful mount if only he could be brought under control And this HorseTreasure

to one side and said May the Lord consent to stay at our resthouse And the Lord consented by silenceAnd the layfollowers of Paṭaligama having washed their feet went in and sat down with their backs to the east wall facing west and with the Lord before themAnd the Licchavis of Vesali heard that the Lord had arrived at Vesali and was staying at Ambapalis groveAnd the Licchavis snapped their fingers saying Weve been beaten by the mangowoman weve been cheated by the mangowoman Then having rejoiced and delighted in his talk they rose from their seats saluted the Lord and passing him by on the right departedAnd the Lord Buddha Vipassi instructed them with a discourse on DhammaAnd the Lord Buddha Vipassi replied to the Great Brahma in verseAnd the Lord consented by silenceAnd the Lord said to Ambattha Well now Ambattha would you behave like this if you were talking to venerable and learned Brahmins teachers of teachers as you do with me walking and standing while I am sitting and uttering vague words of politeness No Reverend GotamaAnd the Lord said to Ananda Ananda it may be that you will think The Teachers instruction has ceased now we have no teacher It should not be seen like this Ananda for what I have taught and explained to you as Dhamma and discipline will at my passing be your teacherAnd the Lord said Ananda have you heard that the Vajjians hold regular and frequent assemblies I have heard Lord that they doAnd the Lord said Ananda these sāltrees have burst forth into an abundance of untimely blossomsAnd the Lord said Enough Ananda do not weep and wailAnd the Lord saw those people who were looking for a boat looking for a raft and binding together a raft of reeds to get to the other sideAnd the Lord spent the remainder of the night in the resthouse left empty by their departureAnd the Lord stayed in the royal park at Ambalatthika  and there he delivered a comprehensive discourse This is morality this is concentration this is wisdomAnd the Lord told him to move Move aside monk do not stand in front of meAnd the Lord went with the Venerable Ananda to the Gabled Hall in the Great ForestAnd the Lord being aware of his doubts effected by his psychic power that Ambattha could see his sheathed genitals and then sticking out his tongue he reached out to lick both ears and both nostrils and then covered the whole circle of his forehead with his tongueAnd the Lord having dressed in the early morning and taken his robe and bowl went with his order of monks to Pokkharasātis residence and sat down on the prepared seatAnd the Lord having heard it himself and also come to know it by his own superknowledge related it to the Venerable Ananda who in turn related it to the monks and nuns the male and female layfollowersAnd the Lord having risen early and

Sonadandas residence and sat down on the prepared seatAnd the Lord having seen the Licchavis from afar said Monks any of you who have not seen the ThirtyThree Gods just look at this troop of LicchavisAnd the Lord reading his mind thought This Sonadanda is worriedAnd the Lord with his divine eye surpassing that of humans saw the thousands of devas taking up residence in PataligamaAnd the Lord with the purified divineear faculty surpassing the powers of humans heard what they were talking aboutAnd the lotusponds were provided with two kinds of parapet gold and silver  the gold parapets having gold posts silver railings and banisters and the silver parapets having silver posts gold railings and banistersAnd the majority of those monks left that very day to wander about the countryAnd the Mallas of Kusinārā poured perfumed water over it for the same purposeAnd the monks strove eagerly to seeAnd the monks told himAnd the monks were delighted and rejoiced at his wordsAnd the monks were delighted and rejoiced at his wordsAnd the monks having washed their feet went in and sat down with their backs to the west wall facing east and with the Lord sitting in front of themAnd the newlyordained Venerable Citta alone secluded unwearying zealous and resolute in a short time attained to that for the sake of which young men of good birth go forth from the household life into homelessness that unexcelled culmination of the holy life having realised it here and now by his own superknowledge and dwelt therein knowing Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is nothing further hereAnd the newlyordained Venerable Kassapa alone secluded unwearying zealous and resolute in a short time attained that for which young men of good birth go forth from the household life into homelessness that unexcelled culmination of the holy life having realised it here and now by his own superknowledge and dwelt therein knowing Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is nothing further hereAnd the one on whose couch he sits down is as thrilled and delighted as a dulyanointed Khattiya king on assuming his royal officeand the people with joy in their heartsAnd the realisation dawned on him Becoming conditions birthAnd the result of this was that their selfluminance disappearedAnd the rough clothes with ballfringes  you would not care to set foot on them much less wear themAnd the royal sage said to him My son you should not grieve or feel sad at the disappearance of the WheelTreasureAnd the same applies to illwill cruelty forms  personalityAnd the same applies to things perceived by the ear the nose the tongue the body and the mindAnd the same thing happened to eighty thousand devas as wellAnd the six nobles went aside and consulted together These Brahmins are greedy for moneyAnd the steward conveyed this message to the Brahmins and householders of CampāAnd the Teacher is passing away who was so compassionate to meAnd the touch of the skin of the WomanTreasure was like cotton or silk and her limbs were cool when it was hot and warm when it was coldAnd the twiceborn winged and clear of sight Fierce garuda birds have come And the Venerable Ananda came to the Lord saluted him sat down to one side and said Lord the monk Saḷha and the nun Nanda have died at NadikaAnd the Venerable Ananda heard of the Lords report and the Nadikans delightAnd the Venerable Ananda rejoiced and was delighted at his wordsAnd the Venerable Ananda said It is wonderful Lord it is marvellousAnd the Venerable Ananda thought It is marvellous it is wonderful how this great earthquake arises this terrible earthquake so dreadful and hairraising accompanied by thunderAnd the Venerable Ananda thought This Venerable Upavāṇa has for long been the Lords attendant keeping close at hand at his beck and callAnd the Venerable Ananda thought Wonderful marvellous are the Tathagatas great and mighty powersAnd the Venerable Ananda uttered this verseAnd the Venerable Ananda went into his lodging and stood lamenting leaning on the doorpost Alas I am still a learner with much to doAnd the Venerable Anuruddha said Now go friend Ananda to Kusinara and announce to the Mallas Vasetthas the Lord has passed awayAnd the Venerable Anuruddha uttered this verseAnd the Venerable Citta son of the elephanttrainer became another of the ArahantsAnd the Venerable Cundaka sat down in front of the LordAnd the venerable Gavampati said to him as he stood there Who are you friend Lord I am Prince Pāyāsi Friend are you not the one who used to say There is no other world there are no spontaneously born beings there is no fruit or result of good or evil deeds Yes Lord I am the one who used to say that but I was converted from that evil view by the Noble KumāraKassapa And where has the young Brahmin Uttara who was in charge of the distribution of your charity been rebornAnd the Venerable Kassapa became another of the ArahantsAnd the Venerable Sariputta saidAnd the Venerable Subhadda became another of the ArahantsAnd the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks referring to this situation and said So illproclaimed was their teaching and discipline so unedifyingly displayed and so ineffectual in calming the passions having been proclaimed by one who was not fully enlightenedAnd the Venerable Sāriputta came to see the Lord saluted him sat down to one side and said It is clear to me Lord that there never has been never will be and is not now another ascetic or Brahmin who is better or more enlightened than the LordAnd the Venerable nanda came to them and delivered the Venerable Anuruddhas messageAnd the very lowest realm that any of them attained was that of the gandhabbasAnd the wanderer Bhaggavagotta said Come Blessed Lord welcome Blessed LordAnd the wanderer Suppiya was also travelling on that road with his pupil the youth BrahmadattaAnd the WellFarer having spoken thus the Teacher added And the WellFarer having spoken the Teacher addedAnd the WellFarer having spoken the Teacher addedAnd the WellFarer having spoken the Teacher addedAnd the WellFarer having spoken the Teacher addedAnd the WellFarer having spoken the Teacher added And the women became excessively preoccupied with men and the men with womenAnd the yakkha Janavasabha having heard it himself related it to the LordAnd the yakkhas stood up and some saluted the Lord passed by on his right and vanished some exchanged courtesies with the Lord some saluted him with joined palms some announced their name and clan some remained silent and they all vanishedAnd the young Brahmin Bharadvaja said This is the only straight pathAnd the young man rose returned to Subha and reported what had passed between him and the Venerable Ananda adding My mission has been thus far accomplished that the Reverend Ananda will probably take the opportunity to come tomorrowAnd then he perceived the destiny and fate of each one of themAnd then he thought I have attained to this Dhamma which is profound hard to see hard to grasp peaceful excellent beyond reasoning subtle to be apprehended by the wiseAnd then I said to them Pāṭikaputta the naked ascetic is not capable of meeting me face to face unless he takes back his words abandons that thought and gives up that viewAnd then if people were to announce to you Sire you remember that slave who worked in your presence and who shaved off his hair and beard and went forth into homelessnessAnd then one being from exhaustion of his lifespan or of his merits falls from the Abhassara world and arises in the empty BrahmapalaceAnd then Sakka ruler of the gods touched the earth with his hand and called out three timesAnd then the Bodhisatta Vipassi thought With what being present does consciousness occurAnd then the company might despise meAnd then the Lord came to the River GangesAnd then the Lord while staying at Vultures Peak gave a comprehensive discourse This is morality this is concentration this is wisdomAnd then  shrank back enraged but powerlessAnd then as a result of the wisdom born of profound consideration the realisation dawned on him Birth being absent ageinganddeath does not occurAnd then as a result of the wisdom born of profound consideration the realisation dawned on him Mindandbody conditions consciousnessAnd then as swiftly as a strong man might stretch his flexed arm or flex it again I vanished from Ukkatṭha and appeared among the Aviha devasAnd then in him just these perceptions arise but other coarser perceptions do not ariseAnd then monks as a result of the wisdom born of profound consideration the realisation dawned on him Birth being present ageinganddeath occurs birth conditions ageinganddeath And then with the purified divine eye he sees beings passing away and arising base and noble well favoured and illfavoured to happy and unhappy destinations as kamma directs themAnd there are five ways in which a wife thus ministered to by her husband as the western direction will reciprocate by properly organising her work by being kind to the servants by not being unfaithful by protecting stores and by being skilful and diligent in all she has to doAnd there are five ways in which friends and companions thus ministered to by a man as the northern direction will reciprocate by looking after him when he is inattentive by looking after his property when he is inattentive by being a refuge when he is afraid by not deserting him when he is in trouble and by showing concern for his childrenAnd there are five ways in which servants and workpeople thus ministered to by their master as the nadir will reciprocate they will get up before him go to bed after him take only what they are given do their work properly and be bearers of his praise and good reputeAnd there are five ways in which their teachers thus ministered to by their pupils as the southern direction will reciprocate they will give thorough instruction make sure they have grasped what they should have duly grasped give them a thorough grounding in all skills recommend them to their friends and colleagues and provide them with security in all directionsAnd there are middleranking monks who are disciplined and experienced there are novices who are disciples there are senior middleranking and novice nuns who are disciples there are whiterobed lay followers male and female celibate and noncelibate and the holy life I proclaim prospers and flourishes is widespread widelyknown proclaimed far and wide wellproclaimed among humansAnd there are prominent yakkhas living there who have no faith in the word of the Blessed LordAnd there for ever beauteous liesAnd there he dwells mindmade feeding on delight selfluminous moving through the air glorious  and he stays like that for a very long timeAnd there he stayed at the Ambalatthika parkAnd there I said nanda Rājagaha is delightful the Vultures Peak is delightfulAnd there is nothing further to be doneAnd there many thousands of devas came saluted me and stood to one side saying Sir it is ninetyone aeons since the Lord Buddha Vipassi appeared in the worldAnd there such food was given out as broken rice with sour gruel and also rough clothing with ballfringesAnd there the Lord addressed the monks It is monks through not understanding not penetrating four things that I as well as you have for a long time fared on round the cycle of rebirthsAnd there the Lord addressed the monks Monks Lord they replied and the Lord saidAnd there the Lord addressed the monks Monks a monk should be mindful and clearly aware this is our charge to youAnd there the one who brought a load of hemp gave no pleasure to his parents nor to his wife and children nor to his friends and colleagues and he did not even get any joy or happiness from it himselfAnd there they dwell mindmade feeding on delight selfluminous moving through the air glorious  and they stay like that for a very long timeAnd there they dwell mindmade feeding on delight selfluminous moving through the air glorious  and they stay like that for a very long timeAnd there they dwell mindmadeAnd there they honoured paid respects worshipped and adored the Lords body with dance and song and music with garlands and scents making awnings and circular tents in order to spend the day thereAnd there they saw a pile of hemp that had been thrown away and one said Heres some hempAnd therefore monk you have acted wrongly you have acted incorrectly by going beyond the Blessed Lord and going in search of an answer to this question elsewhereAnd these are the three kinds of teacher that I spoke of as blameworthyAnd these beings set to and fed on this rice and this lasted for a very long timeAnd these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are caught up hemmed in obstructed entangled in these five hindrancesAnd these four qualities apply to a wheelturning monarch if he is visited by a company of Khattiyas of Brahmins of householders or of ascetics they are pleased at the sight of him and when he talks to them and when he is silent they are disappointedAnd these good folk are fond of quiet they are taught to be quiet and speak in praise of quietAnd these being banished made their home on the flank of the Himālayas beside a lotuspond where there was a big grove of teaktreesAnd these Lord are the two reasons why I came to see the Lord And they became still more arrogant and so the creepers disappeared tooAnd they dealt with the Tathāgatas body accordinglyAnd they did soAnd they did soAnd they do all these things but although he has eyes he does not perceive objects or their spheres although he has ears he does not hear sounds although he has a nose he does not smell smells although he has a tongue he does not taste tastes although he has a body he does not feel tangibles or their spheresAnd they do soAnd they do soAnd they explained to him the duties of a wheelturning monarchAnd they fall from that placeAnd they got up saluted the Lord and went out passing him by on the rightAnd they heard say The ascetic Gotama son of the Sakyans who has gone forth from the Sakya clan is staying at Vesālī at the Gabled Hall in the Great ForestAnd they might say Well then you dont know or see the one you seek for and desire and he would say NoAnd they might say Well then you dont know or see the one you seek for and desire and he would say NoAnd they might say Well then you dont know or see what kind of a palace you are building the staircase for and he would say NoAnd they might say Well then you dont know or see what kind of a palace you are building the staircase for and he would say Noand they question him but he does not answerand they question himAnd they said to Ambattha That is his dwelling with the door closedAnd they said to her Ambapali why do you drive up against us like that Because young sirs the Blessed Lord has been invited by me for a meal with his order of monksAnd they said As soon as he was born he spokeAnd they said We have heard this Reverend Gotama as you have explainedAnd they said We have heard this Reverend Gotama as you have explainedAnd they said We have heard this Reverend Gotama as you have explainedAnd they said We have heard this Reverend Gotama as you have explainedand they stay like that for a very long timeAnd they thought It is too late to cremate the Lords body todayAnd they thought Suppose we were to appoint a certain being who would show anger where anger was due censure those who deserved it and banish those who deserved banishmentAnd they thought This is a great caravan of a thousand cartsAnd they thought This is certainly no common teaching and discipline no common goingforth for which Prince Vipassi has shaved off hair and beard donned yellow robes and gone forth into homelessnessAnd they thought This is certainly no common teaching and disciplinefor which Prince Khanda and Tissa the chaplains son have gone forth into homelessnessAnd they told himAnd they told himAnd they were beloved by the King as children are beloved by their fatherAnd they who from this world are freed And they saying Very good in assent mightAnd this immeasurable light shines forthAnd this is a fault in that selfmortifierAnd this is a fault in that selfmortifierAnd this is a fault in that selfmortifierAnd this is a fault in that selfmortifierAnd this is a fault in that selfmortifierAnd this is a fault in that selfmortifierAnd this is a fault in that selfmortifierAnd this is a fault in that selfmortifierAnd this is a fault in that selfmortifierAnd this is a fault in that selfmortifierAnd this is a fault in that selfmortifierAnd this is a fault in that selfmortifierAnd this is how the WheelTreasure appeared to King Mahasudassanaand this is my consciousness which is bound to it and dependent on itAnd this is that training said the LordAnd this is that training said the LordAnd this King Mahasudassana had this very Kusinara under the name of Kusāvatī for his capitalAnd this lasted for a very long timeand this person is born in the Middle Country and is intelligent not stupid and not deaf or dumb and well able to tell whether something has been well said or ill saidAnd this they will do for seven daysAnd this thought leads to rebirth right thereAnd this thought being launched at such a low level and not developed to a higher level leads to rebirth right thereAnd this WomanTreasure was not unfaithful to the King even in thought much less in deedAnd this Ruler of the Gods is the practice that monk has undertaken who has acquired the restraint required by the rulesAnd this Ruler of the Gods is the practice that monk has undertaken who has reached the right wayleading to the cessation of the tendency to proliferationAnd those beings set to and ate the fungusAnd those beings that have been reborn there recognise each other by this light and know Other beings too have been born here And this tenthousandfold worldsystem trembles and quakes and is convulsedAnd those border folk thought It seems that when the trumpet is accompanied by a man by effort and by the wind then it makes a soundAnd those devas who having lived the holy life under the Lord had recently appeared in the Heaven of the ThirtyThree outshone the other devas in brightness and gloryAnd those KingsAnd those monks who had not yet overcome their passions wept and tore their hair raising their arms throwing themselves down and twisting and turning crying All too soon the Blessed Lord has passed away all too soon the WellFarer has passed away all too soon the Eye of the World has disappeared But those monks who were free from craving endured mindfully and clearly aware saying All compounded things are impermanent  what is the use of thisAnd those monks who had not yet overcome their passions wept and tore their hairAnd those twin sāltrees burst forth into an abundance of untimely blossoms which fell upon the Tathāgatas body sprinkling it and covering it in homageAnd those who had faced him in the eastern region became his subjectsAnd those who had not fully mastered his teaching were reborn either among the ParanimmitaVasavatti devas among the Nimmanarati devas among the Tusita devas among the Yama devas among the devas of the ThirtyThree Gods or among the devas of the Four Great KingsAnd those who had opposed him in the eastern region became his subjectsAnd those who now in my time or afterwards live thus they will become the highest if they are desirous of learningAnd those who opposed him in the eastern region came and said Come Your Majesty welcomeAnd those who were libertines and drunkards in Kusāvatī had their desires assuaged by the sound of those nets of bellsAnd those who were ugly being envious of those who were beautiful committed adultery with others wivesAnd through having undertaken such wholesome things they will increase in lifespan and beautyAnd through his knowing and seeing his mind is delivered from the corruption of sensedesire from the corruption of becoming from the corruption of ignorance and the knowledge arises in him This is deliverance and he knows Birth is finished the holy life has been led done is what had to be done there is nothing further here And through their being inspired fired and delighted with this discourse it was not long before their minds were freed from the corruptions without remainderAnd through this restraint through making this his austerity he takes an upward course and does not fall back into lower thingsAnd thus adjured by the great Adept Cundaka placed the fourfold robeAnd thus disputing they followed close behind the Buddha and his order of monksAnd thus fearful trembling with hair standing on end he addressed Brahmā Sanankumāra in these versesAnd thus he is freed from the corruptions the vexations and fevers that arise from sensedesires and he does not feel that feelingAnd thus he taught his disciples the way to union with the BrahmāworldAnd thus terrified and trembling his hair standing on end he made for the Tinduka lodging of the wanderersAnd thus this whole mass of suffering ceasesAnd thus this whole mass of suffering takes its originAnd to the lovers of his word the Lord Turning said The devahosts approachAnd tonight in the last watch the ascetic Gotama will attain final NibbānaAnd took a pure and righteous courseAnd touch his knees with both his hands And his treelike girth and heightAnd two wanderers Mandissa and Jāliya the pupil of the woodenbowl ascetic came to him exchanged courtesies with him and sat down to one sideAnd two wanderers Mandissa and Jāliya the pupil of the woodenbowl ascetic came to me exchanged courtesies with me and sat down to one sideAnd Vasettha and Bharadvaja went strolling along the road and as they did so an argument broke out between them on the subject of right and wrong pathsAnd Vasettha could not convince Bharadvaja nor could Bharadvaja convince VasetthaAnd waited on them in our homesand was reborn among the ThirtyThree Gods and am known as Gopaka the devas sonAnd weAnd we are here to see the unconquered brotherhoodAnd we can find no proclaimer of the path leading to NibbānaAnd we can find no such teacherAnd we can find no teacher who does likewise in every detail of doctrineAnd we can find no teacher who does thisAnd we can find no teacher who has done the like whether we consider the past or the present other than the LordAnd we can find none who is a proclaimer of such thingsand we have fully mastered the true DhammaAnd we should revere honour esteem and worship guestsAnd we too will do the same as the monks at the end of six years we will come together to the royal capital of Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary codeAnd we too would like to hear those eight truthful statements about the Lord Very well Great Brahmā said Sakka and he repeated those eight statementsAnd we sir who have lived the holy life under the Lord having freed ourselves from sensedesires have arisen hereAnd weariness all gone hell seeAnd well over five hundred by the destruction of three fetters are StreamWinners incapable of falling into states of woe certain of attaining Nibbanaand were to lie down on this bank covering his head with a shawlAnd what are the things that you should recite togetherAnd what are these elementary inferior matters for which the worldling would praise himAnd what are these mattersAnd what are these mattersAnd what are those mattersAnd what is the Ariyan supernormal powerAnd what is there in the world that is agreeable and pleasurableAnd what is this Dhamma that has been well proclaimed by the LordAnd what is thisAnd what they had taken in the evening for supper had grown again and was ripe in the morning and what they had taken in the morning for breakfast was ripe again by evening with no sign of reapingAnd whatever ascetics and Brahmins come to our territory are our guestsAnd whatever ascetics and Brahmins in your kingdom have renounced the life of sensual infatuation and are devoted to forbearance and gentleness each one taming himself each one calming himself and each one striving for the end of craving from time to time you should go to them and consult them as to what is wholesome and what is unwholesome that is blameworthy and what is blameless what is to be followed and what is not to be followed and what action will in the long run lead to harm and sorrow and what to welfare and happinessAnd whatever ascetics or Brahmins are Eternalists and proclaim the eternity of the self and the world they do so on one or other of these four groundsAnd whatever ascetics or Brahmins come to our territory are our guestsAnd whatever ascetics or Brahmins have in the past realised such powers in different ways they have all developed and strongly practised these four ways and the same applies to all who may in the future or who do now realise such powersAnd whatever dark spaces lie beyond the worlds end chaotic blind and black such that they are not even reached by the mighty rays of sun and moon are yet illumined by this immeasurable splendid light surpassing the glory of the most powerful devasAnd whatever sensations of lust that he previously had disappearAnd whatever there was of them men and cattle they were all gobbled up by that yakkhaspirit  and only their bones remainedAnd when a mighty wind blows this stirs up the water and through the stirringup of the water the earth quakesAnd when a neutral feeling is felt no pleasant or painful feeling is felt but only neutral feelingAnd when all these had come in vast array With Indra and the hosts of Brahma too Then too came Maras hosts and now observeAnd when he is dead he will be cast aside on a heap of bīraṇagrass in the charnelgroundAnd when he spoke in that voice to the assembly its sound did not carry outsideand when I am sure they will not recover I go to them and say There are certain ascetics and Brahmins who declare and believe that those who abstain from taking lifeAnd when I am sure they will not recover I go to them and say There are certain ascetics and Brahmins who declare and believe that those who take lifeAnd when I found that I could not win the lady by any manner of means I took my yellow beluvawood lute and went to the home of King Timbarū of the gandhabbas and there I sang these versesAnd when I observed that by the performance of such actions unwholesome factors decreased and wholesome ones increased then such bodily action was to be followedAnd when I observed that in the pursuit of such happiness unwholesome factors decreased and wholesome ones increased then that happiness was to be sought afterAnd when I passed away from there I was reborn in suchandsuch other circumstancesand when it was ready he reported to the Lord Lord the meal is readyAnd when King Ajatasattu came near the mangogrove he felt fear and terror and his hair stood on endAnd when King Mahāvijita was musing in private the thought came to him I have acquired extensive wealth in human terms I occupy a wide extent of land which I have conqueredAnd when six years had passed the devas announced Gentlemen six years have passed it is now time to go to the royal capital of Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary code And those monks some by their own psychic powers and some by that of the devas all in one day came to Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary codeAnd when the Buddha greets their gaze Buddha kinsman of the Sun From afar they offer homageAnd when the Buddha greets their gaze Buddha kinsman of the Sun From afar they offer homageAnd when the householder Sandhāna realised These wanderers of other views are actually listening and attending to the Lords words and inclining their minds to the higher wisdom he said to Nigrodha Reverend Nigrodha you said to me Come now householder do you know whom the ascetic Gotama talks toAnd when the Lord Buddha Vipassi had withdrawn into seclusion he thought There is now this great gathering of monks here in the capitalAnd when the Lord Buddha Vipassi knew that the minds of Khanda and Tissa were ready pliable free from the hindrances joyful and calm then he preached the Buddhas special sermon in brief on suffering its origin its cessation and the pathAnd when the Lord had eaten and taken his hand away from the bowl Kūṭadanta took a low stool and sat down to one sideAnd when the Lord had eaten and taken his hand away from the bowl Sonadanda took a low stool and sat down to one sideAnd when the Lord had stayed at Ambapalis grove as long as he wishedhe went with a large company of monks to the little village of Beluva where he stayedAnd when the Lord had stayed at Bhaṇḍagāma for as long as he wished he said nanda let us go to Hatthigama to Ambagāma to Jambugāma giving the same discourse at each placeAnd when the Lord had stayed at Bhoganagara for as long as he wished he said Ananda let us go to Pāvā Very good Lord said Ananda and the Lord went with a large company of monks to Pāvā where he stayed at the mangogrove of Cunda the smithAnd when the Lord had stayed at Nadika as long as he wishedhe went with a large company of monks to Vesali where he stayed at Ambapalis groveAnd when the Lord had stayed at Rajagaha as long as he wished he said to the Venerable Ananda Come Ananda let us go to Ambalatthika Very good Lord said Ananda and the Lord went there with a large company of monksAnd when the Lord had stood up he said to the Venerable Sariputta Good good SariputtaAnd when the Lord had taken his hand from the bowl Ambapali took a low stool and sat down to one sideAnd when the Lord had taken his hand from the bowl Pokkharasati sat down to one side on a low stoolAnd when the Lord knew that Kūṭadantas mind was ready pliable free from the hindrances joyful and calm then he preached a sermon on Dhamma in brief on suffering its origin its cessation and the pathAnd when the Lord knew that Pokkharasātis mind was ready pliable free from the hindrances joyful and calm then he preached a sermon on Dhamma in brief on suffering its origin its cessation and the pathAnd when the Lord saw this he uttered this verseAnd when the Lord took his hand away from the bowl they sat down on low stools to one sideAnd when the Lords body was burnt up a shower of water from the sky and another which burst forth from the sāltrees extinguished the funeral pyreAnd when the Lords body was burnt what had been skin underskin flesh sinew or jointfluid all that vanished and not even ashes or dust remained only the bones remainedAnd when the night was nearly over Pancasikha of the gandhabbas lighting up the entire Vultures Peak with a splendid radiance approached the Lord saluted him stood to one side and said Lord I wish to report to you what I have personally seen and observed when I was in the presence of the ThirtyThree Gods Tell me then Pancasikha said the LordAnd when the night was over the Lord said to the monks Monks this night the Four Great KingsAnd when there is milk we dont speak of curds of butter of ghee or of cream of ghee we speak of milk when there are curds we dont speak of butter when there is cream of gheeAnd when these nets of bells were stirred by the wind their sound was lovely delightful sweet and intoxicating just like that of the five kinds of musical instruments played in concert by welltrained and skilful playersAnd when they heard the Venerable nandas words the MallasAnd when they heard nandas words the Mallas with their sons daughtersinlaw and wives were struck with anguish and sorrow their minds were overcome with grief so that they were all weeping and tearing their hairThen they all went to the sālgrove where the Venerable Ananda wasAnd when this was done the Lords funeral pyre ignited of itselfAnd whenever he came to a village or town he was like a king to kings like Brahma to the Brahmins like a deity to householdersAnd whenever the pupil of a teacher attains to such excellent distinction that is a teacher who is not to be blamed in the worldAnd whenever the Reverend Gotama visits other families or layfollowers in Ukkattha may he also visit the family of PokkharasatiAnd wherever they went they rapidly consumed all the grass wood and greenstuffAnd while he had been speaking in this dialogue the pure and spotless DhammaEye arose within Sakka ruler of the gods and he knew Whatever things have an origin must come to cessationand who are caught upand who has gained the goal of asceticismAnd whoever cuts off a mans head with a sharp sword does not deprive anyone of life he just inserts the blade in the intervening space between these seven bodies And whoever lays wreaths or puts sweet perfumes and colours there with a devout heart will reap benefit and happiness for a long timeAnd why is each of these worthy of a stupaAnd why notAnd why should not a man like me express approval of such a true and real practice so well taught by the ascetic Gotamaand with an inwardly calmed heart his mind is purified of worryandflurryand with an inwardly calmed mind his heart is purified of worryandflurryAnd with him went the seven anointed Khattiya kings the seven wealthy and distinguished Brahmins with their seven hundred advanced pupils his forty equal wives several thousand Khattiyas several thousand Brahmins several thousand householders even some haremwomenAnd with that wise leader they passed safely through the jungleAnd with that he fell back againAnd with the fading away of delight remaining imperturbable mindful and clearly aware he experienced in himself that joy of which the

wombborn Brahmins talk about being born from Brahmas mouthAnd yet you and your teacher the Brahmin Pokkharasāti utter these words These shaven little ascetics menials black scrapings from Brahmās foot what converse can they have with Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas  even though you cant even manage the duties of one who has failedAnd yet Ananda whatever monk nun male or female layfollower dwells practising the Dhamma properly and perfectly fulfils the Dhammaway he or she honours the Tathāgata reveres and esteems him and pays him the supreme homageand you are following the doctrine of your teacherAnd you might say Bind this mans arms tightly behind him with a strong rope shave his head closely and lead him to the rough sound of a drum through the streets and squares and out through the southern gate and there cut off his headAnd you should reply They can expect four fruits four benefitsAnd you you have deserted the highest class and gone over to the base class of shaveling petty ascetics servants dark fellows born of Brahmās footAnd He Gladdens Others With Dhamma is the meaning of Raja the third title to be introducedAnd Ambattha I am the passeron of the mantras and you are

descending from the Vultures Peak he came to the Peacocks Feeding Ground beside the Sumāgadha Tank and walked up and down there in the open airAnd getting up at break of day he said to the Venerable Ananda Ananda who is building a fortress at Pataligama Lord Sunidha and Vassakara the Magadhan ministers are building a fortress against the VajjiansAnd having given up pleasure and pain and with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness he entered and remained in the fourth jhana which is beyond pleasure and pain and purified by equanimity and mindfulnessAnd having given up pleasure and

having installed his eldest son in due form as king King Daḷhanemi shaved off his hair and beard donned yellow robes and went forth from the household life into homelessnessAnd having listened to them the King established guard and protection but he did not give property to the needy and as a result poverty became rifeAnd having practised the four divine abidings at the breakingup of the body he was reborn in the BrahmaworldAnd having saluted him he passed him by on the right and vanished from the spotAnd just as swiftly as a strong man might stretch forth his flexed arm or flex it again Sakka surrounded by the ThirtyThree Gods and attended by Pancasikha vanished from the heaven of the ThirtyThree and appeared in Magadhaon Mount VediyaAnd just as the Sakyans offer the King humble service so likewise does the King offer humble service to the Tathāgata  thinking If the ascetic Gotama is wellborn I am illborn if the ascetic Gotama is strong I am weak if the ascetic Gotama is pleasant to look at I am illfavoured if the ascetic Gotama is influential I am of little influenceAnd Kassapa there is nothing further or more perfect than this perfection of morality of the heart and of wisdomAnd leaving the fourth jhāna the Lord finally passed awayAnd Lord I thought How should one like me think despitefully of any ascetic or Brahmin dwelling in my territory so I neither applauded nor rejected Pūraṇa Kassapas words but though displeased not expressing my displeasure saying nothing rejecting and scorning speech I got up and leftAnd Lord my body was like a drunkardsAnd Lord when

fullyenlightened BuddhaAnd monks the Lord Buddha Vipassīs reasoning became mentally known to a certain Great BrahmaAnd Reverend Gotama I set free the seven hundred bulls seven hundred bullocks seven hundred heifers seven hundred hegoats and seven hundred ramsAnd Reverend Kassapa I want to make a great sacrificeAnd seven days after the royal sage had gone forth the sacred WheelTreasure vanishedAnd sir we shall all go to visit the ascetic GotamaAnd Sire there is no fruit of the homeless life visible here and now that is more excellent and perfect than this And still disputing they follow closely behind the Blessed Lord and his order of monksAnd too none of them has seen Brahmā face to faceAnd Vasettha those Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are enslaved infatuated by these five strands of
