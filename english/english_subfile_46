Hes suffered defeat already where he crossed from east to west and from west to east He deserves a beating A real lion cub can roar the lions roar Xuedou added the comment Completely exposed Wrong At first too high in the end too low When one realizes ones fault one should reform but how many people can So he went back to meet Guishan for mally Its already his second defeat Danger As Guishan sat there He watches this fellow with cold eyes It takes this kind of man to grab a tigers whiskers Deshan held up his mat and said Teacher He changes heads switches faces he stirs up waves where theres no wind Guishan reached for his whisk Only he could do this he sets his strategy in motion from within his tent Surely he silences everyone in the world whereupon Deshan shouted and left This is the understanding of a wild fox spirit Hes one of those who can grab the clouds and grasp the fog and he is outstanding among them Xuedou added the comment Completely exposed Wrong Check Deshan turned his back on the teaching hall put on his san dals and left He won the hat on his head but lost the shoes on his feet Hes already lost his life That evening Guishan asked the head monk Where is that newcomer  He lost his interest in the east and loses his principle in the west His eyes look southeast but his mind is in the northwest The monk answered At that time he turned his back on the teaching hall put on his sandals and left  The sacred tortoise drags his tail he deserves a beating How many blows to the back of the head would this kind of person need Guishan said Hereafter that lad will go to the summit of a soli tary peak build himself a grass hut and scold the Buddhas and revile the patriarchs He draws his bow after the thief is gone No one in the world can leap out of this Xuedou added the comment  This is adding frost to snow Commentary Three times I added the word check Do you understand Some times I use a blade of grass as the sixteenfoot golden body of the Buddha sometimes I use the sixteenfoot golden body as a blade of grass Originally Deshan was a scholarmonk expounding the Diamond Sutra in western China According to that teaching in the process of the knowledge attained after adamantine concentration one studies the majestic conduct of the Buddhas for a thousand eons and studies the refined practices of the Buddhas for ten thousand eons before finally fulfilling Buddhahood On the other hand the c southern Chan folk at this time were saying that the mind itself is the Buddha So Deshan became incensed and went south with some commentaries on his back to destroy this crew of Chan devils When he got to Hunan he met a woman selling pastry by the roadside he put down his commentaries to buy some refreshment to lighten his mind If you can answer it Ill give you some pastry if not youll have to buy it somewhere else Deshan agreed The woman said  The Diamond Sutra says Past mind cant be grasped present mind cant be grasped future mind can t be grasped Which mind does the learned monk desire to lighten Deshan was speechless The woman directed him to call on Longtan During the night Deshan went to Longtans room and stayed until late Deshan was then greatly enlightened  Then he burned the commentaries Later hearing Guishans teaching was flourishing Deshan went to meet him as an adept What did he mean In the Buddha Dharma there are not so many complications where can you bring intellectual views to bear Since there is noth ing extraordinary or mysterious how will you understand Deshans walking back and forth What was his meaning Old Guishan did not bother with Deshan anyone but Guishan would have been crushed by him See how the old adept Guishan meets him he just sits there and observes the outcome Xuedou adds the comment Completely exposed This is like an iron spike This is called an added comment though it goes for both sides it does not remain on either side How will you under stand his statement Completely exposed Where does the expo sure take place As Guishan sat there Deshan lifted up his mat and said Teacher Guishan reached for his whisk Deshan then shouted and left How extraordinary Many say Guishan was afraid of him What has this to do with it Guishan was not flustered at all So it is said One whose wisdom surpasses a bird can catch a bird one whose wisdom surpasses a beast can catch a beast and one whose wisdom surpasses a man can catch a man It is as high as the sky as broad as the earth If Guishan did not have the ability to silence everyone on earth at that time it would have been very difficult for him to test Deshan Were he not the enlightened teacher of fifteen hundred people at this point he would have been at a loss But Guishan was setting strategy in motion from within his tent that would secure victory over a thousand miles Deshan turned his back on the teaching hall and left Did Deshan win or lose Acting as he did did Guishan win or lose He was like a bystander judging those two ib Afterwards Guishan was unhurried when evening came he finally asked the head monk Where is that newcomer who just came The head monk replied At that time he turned his back on the teaching hall and left Guishan said Hereafter that lad will go up to the summit of a solitary peak build himself a grass hut and scold the Buddhas and revile the patriarchs Guishan was not being kindhearted in the future Deshan could scold the Buddhas and revile the patriarchs pum mel the wind and beat the rain yet he would still never get out of that cave Deshans whole lifetim es methods have been seen through by Guishan Or should we say that when the marsh is wide it can hide a mountain that reason can subdue a leopard Xuedou knows the point of this story so he can dare to settle the case for them by further saying  This is adding frost to snow Once again he offers it up for people to see If you do see Ill allow that youre a fellow student of Guishan Deshan and Xuedou If you dont see beware of vainly producing intellectual interpretations Verse One completely exposed A second completely exposed Adding frost to snow Deshans had a dangerous fall The General of the Flying Cavalry enters the enemy camp Danger No need to bother slashing again at the general of a defeated army He loses his life How many could regain their safety Though you may exhaust all the strategems of supernatural powers what is the use But Guishan doesnt let him go On the summit of the solitary peak he sits among the weeds After all To take him in tow isnt out of the ordinary But why is he sitting among the weeds Tsk Understand Two blades cut each other Two by two three by three they walk the old road Singing and clapping go together I strike Commentary When Xuedou composed verses on one hundred stories in each case he burned incense and offered it up thus his verses have cir culated widely throughout the land He also mastered literary com position When he had penetrated the stories and become easily conversant with them only then could he set his brush to paper Why so It is easy to distinguish dragons from snakes it is hard to fool a Chan practitioner Having penetrated this story Xuedou puts down three comments at those impenetrable misleading places then picks them up to make his verse Adding frost to snow almost a dangerous fall What is Deshan like He is like Li Guang an expert archer whom the emperor commissioned as the General of the Flying Cavalry As Li was weak from his wounds they tied him prone between two horses Li played dead but stealthily ob served that there was a Hun near him riding a good mount Li sud denly sprang up and leaped on the horse throwing off the Hun and seizing his bow and arrows Whipping the horse he galloped south shooting at his pursuers he made good his escape This man had the ability to wrest life from the midst of death Xuedou alludes to this in the verse to make a comparison with Deshan who reentered the hall to meet Guishan and was able to leap out again as before Only if you have the ability to kill a man without blinking an eye can you become a Buddha right where you are Someone who can fulfill Buddhahood on the spot naturally kills people without blinking an eye thus having a share of freedom and independence They totally lack the slightest continuity How many could regain their safety  Deshan hurriedly runs past Deshan shouted and left this is like Li Guangs strategy after being captured seizing a bow to shoot his guard making good his escape from enemy territory Deshan turned away and left  Guishan said Hereaf ter that lad will go to the summit of a solitary peak build himself a grass hut and scold the Buddhas and revile the patriarchs When did he ever let him go At this point why does Xuedou say On the summit of the solitary peak he sits among the weeds  and then add an excla mation Study for thirty more years Xuefengs Grain of Rice Introduction Whoever would uphold the teaching of Chan must be a brave spirit only with the ability to kill a man without blinking an eye can one become a Buddha on the spot Therefore illumination and func tion are simultaneous and wrapping up and opening out are equally expressed It was this way yesterday the matter couldnt be avoided It is this way today too faults fill the skies Without clear eyes lying in the mouth of a tiger one cannot avoid losing ones life Story Xuefeng said to his group One blind man leading a crowd of the blind Its not beyond him Pick up the whole world and its as big as a grain of rice What technique is this I myself have never sported devil eyes  Throw it down before you Im afraid it cant be thrown down Take whats coming to you and get out Better not slight the people Ill beat the drum to call everyone to look Blind The beat of the drum is for the three armies Commentary ia Changqing asked Yunmen In speaking like this is there any place Xuefeng wasnt able to appear Yunmen said Yes Chang qing asked How so Yunmen said One cant always be making wild foxy interpretations Where the kings rule is a little more strict its not permitted to plunder the open markets Dagui Zhe said Ill add more mud to dirt for you He raised his staff and said Look Xuefeng has defecated right in front of you Come now why dont you even recognize the smell of dung Xuefeng said Pick up the whole world and its as big as a grain of rice There was something extraordinary in the way this ancient guided people for their benefit Touzi thrice and going to Dongshan nine times Wherever he went he would serve as rice steward just for the sake of penetrating this matter When he arrived at Dongshan he served as rice steward one day Dongshan asked him What are you doing Xuefeng said Cleaning rice As soon as he got there Xuefeng asked  Does the student have any share in this matter handed down from time immemo rial as the fundamental vehicle Deshan hit him and said What are you saying Through this Xuefeng had an insight  Suddenly Xuefeng was greatly enlightened he bowed and said to Yantou Brother today Ive at last realized the Way People these days only say that the ancients made up special creations for people of the future to rely on as fixed rules To say this is just slandering those ancients this is called spilling the blood of Buddha The ancients werent like people today with spurious b shallow talk otherwise how could they have used a single word or half a phrase for a whole lifetime When it came to upholding the source teaching and perpetuating the life of the Buddhas they would utter a word or half a phrase that spontaneously silenced every one on earth Theres nowhere for you to produce a train of thought to make intellectual interpretations or to rationalize Whenever he utters a word or half a phrase hes not making a living in the ghost cave of mental patterns conceptual consciousness and calculating thought His actions were all like this One day Xuefeng said On South Mountain theres a turtlenosed snake you should take a good look at it Then Changqing came forward and said If so there are a lot of people here wholl lose their lives Another time Xuefeng said The whole earth is one eye of a monk where will you defecate Another time he said I have met with you at Wangzhou Pavilion I have also met with you in the Black Rock Range and I have also met with you in front of the community hall Now Baofu asked Ehu  Leaving aside in front of the community hall what about the meetings at Wangzhou Pa vilion and Black Rock Range Ehu hurried back to his room Xue feng was always bringing up this kind of talk to instruct his group As for Pick up the whole world and its as big as a grain of rice at this point can you figure it out by means of intellectual discrimination Here you must smash through the net at once abandon gain and loss right and wrong to be completely free and untrammeled you then naturally pass through his snare and then you will see what hes doing Tell me where is Xuefengs meaning People often make up intellectual interpretations and say Mind is the master of myriad things the whole world is all at once in my hand Luckily this has no connection Here you must be truly genuine and see all the way through as soon as you hear it brought up penetrating the bone through to the marrow yet without falling into feeling thought conception or imagination If you are a genuine pilgrim you will see that in acting this way Xuefeng was already indulging to help others Smash the mirror and Ill meet with you you must smash it to understand He beats the drum for you to come look but you dont see He sticks you in the eye Dont take it lightly Ignoramuseswhat is there that is hard to see When spring arrives for whom do the hundred flowers bloom Things dont overlap He appears in a cave of entanglements Commentary Naturally Xuedou sees the ancient he only needs to go to his life line and in one spurt he produces a verse for him An ox head disappears  A horse head emerges Tell me what is he saying If you see all the way through to the bottom it is like eating break fast in the morning and lunch at middayjust being ordinary Out of compassion Xuedou shatters with one hammer blow at the outset and cuts through with a single statement He is indeed strict like a spark a lightning flash He doesnt reveal his sword point theres no place for you to fix onto Can you search it out in your conceptual faculty In the third line instead Xuedou opens a pathway and dis plays a bit of formal stylealready hes fallen into the weeds In the fourth line he falls further into the weeds If you produce words on top of words phrases on top of phrases ideas on top of ideas making up explanations and interpretations you will not only bog me down but youll also turn away from Xuedou He never made up principles to bind people In the mirror of Chan absolutely no dust Quite a few people say that a stilled mind is the mirror itself Xuedou has spoken clearly its just that people do not see Therefore being such a dotard he says  He beats the drum for you to come look but you dont see Do the ignorant see When spring comes for whom do the hundred flowers bloom One could say hes opening the doors and windows throwing them wide open all at once for you Story Yunmen said I dont ask about before the fifteenth day Half south of the river half north of the river We dont keep old calen dar dates here try to say something about after the fifteenth day Inevitably it will go from dawn to sunset just dont say that the next day is the sixteenth The days and months seem to flow by He answered himself Every day is a good day Hes gathered it in Though the frog jumps it cant get out of the bas ket Whose house has no bright moon and clear breeze But do you know it The sea god knows its value but not its price Commentary Yunmen first studied with Muzhou Muzhou was swift as light ning so it was difficult to approach him When Yunmen went to see Muzhou on the third time as soon as he knocked on the door Muzhou said W hos there Yunmen gave his name As Muzhou opened the door Yunmen bounded in Muzhou held him fast and said Speak Yunmen hesitated and was ejected he still had one foot inside when Muzhou slammed the door breaking Yunmens leg As Yunmen cried out in pain he suddenly was greatly enlightened Later his teaching style was like that of Muzhou After his enlightenment Yunmen stayed in the home of the ministry president Chen Cao for three years Later Muzhou directed Yunmen to go to Xuefeng There Yun men came forth and asked Xuefeng What is the Buddha  Xue feng said Dont talk in your sleep Yunmen bowed He stayed there for three years One day Xuefeng asked What is your perception Yunmen said  My perception doesnt differ in the slightest from that of all the sages since time immemorial For twenty years Lingshu did not appoint a head monk People called Lingshu the Knowing Sage Chan Master since he knew of past and future events Once King Liu of south China was going to mobilize his army and he intended to go ask Lingshu whether conditions were aus picious or not Knowing of this beforehand Lingshu sat down and calmly passed away The king said angrily Since when was the master ill The attendant answered  The master hadnt been ill He just entrusted a box to me to present to Your Majesty when you arrived King Liu opened the box and took out a card which said The enlightened one is the head monk Understanding the message the king dismissed his soldiers and invited Yunmen to teach at Lingshu monastery Only later did he live at Yunmen  Is the fruit of the spiritual tree ripe yet Yun men said When have you ever heard it was unripe One day King Liu summoned Yunmen to spend the summer in the palace One of the palace functionaries wrote a verse and posted it Only cultivation of great wisdom is Chan Silence not clamor is in order for the Chan school Myriad kinds of clever talk are not as good as reality They lose to Yunmens total not speaking Yunmen usually liked to teach threeword Chan observing Reflect Ha He also taught one word Chan a monk asked When you kill your parents you repent before the Buddha when you kill the Buddha where do you turn to repent  Yunmen said Exposed Another asked What is the treasury of the eye of the true Dharma Yunmen said  Universal There was simply no room for discussion When he uttered a phrase it was like an iron spike Later Yunmen produced four sages Dongshan Shouchu Zhimen Shiguan Deshan Yuanmi and Xianglin Dengyuan Xianglin served as Yunmens attendant for eighteen years whenever Yunmen dealt with him he would just call Attendant Yuan Xianglin would answer Yes Yun men would say What is it It went on like this for eighteen years when one day Xianglin finally awakened Yunmen said I wont call you anymore In Yunmens usual dealings with people he would often use the methods of Muzhou though it was hard to approach him he had the ability to liberate people I dont ask about before the fifteenth day try to say something about after the fifteenth day He cuts off all distinctions and doesnt let ei ther ordinary or holy pass He answered himself Every day is a good day The words before the fifteenth day already cut off distinctions after the fifteenth also cuts off distinctions The fact is that Yunmen did not say that the next day is the sixteenth Later people merely followed his words to produce interpretations but what relevance has this Yunmen established a protean style he surely had ways to benefit people Having spoken some words he then answered himself Every day is a good day These words pervade all time and settle everything at once When I talk like this I too am following his words to produce interpretations Killing others is not as good as killing yourself As soon as you make up a principle you fall into a pit Three statements are inherent in each statement of Yunmen since the basic teaching of his school is like this when Yunmen utters a phrase it must be returned to the source This affair has no multitude of argu ments and propositions though those who have not yet penetrated wish it were like that If you do penetrate then you will immedi ately see the essential meaning of Yunmen Verse He throws away one Seven openings eight holes Where has it gone He lets up a bit Picks up seven Above below and in the four quarters no comparison Above is the sky below the earth East west south north what comparison is there Nevertheless the staff is in my hand Placidly walking along he treads down the sound of the flowing stream Dont ask whats right at your feet Its difficult to investigate it thoroughly Hes gone into a nest of complications His relaxed gaze descries the tracks of flying birds In the eye there is no such happening A wild foxy view as before hes just inside the same old den The grasses grow thick He pulls the arrow out of the back of his head Whats going on here Hes fallen into equanimity The mists overhang He hasnt come out of this nest yet Beneath his feet clouds arise Around Subhutis cliff the flowers make a mess Where is he Hes been completely exposed I snap my fingers how lamentable is Sunyata The four quarters and eight directions the whole cosmos inside Sunyatas nostrils try to say something Where is Sunyata Dont make a move What about your previous words When you move then what If you move thirty blows first he takes the adamantine sword and brings it down once then he reveals a bit of formal style Though its like this ulti mately there are not two understandings He throws away one  Picks up seven People often make an understanding based on the numbers and say He throws away one refers to before the fifteenth day  Having abruptly put down two lines and sealed it up Xuedou then instead reveals it for people to see He throws away one  Picks up seven Avoid turning to the words for your sustenance What soup is there in a cracker People often fall back into conceptualization You must gain understanding before the word arises then the great func tion will become manifest and you will naturally see it All things being void of essence they cannot be conveyed by words I would rather not teach but quickly enter Nirvana When he got to this point even the Buddha couldnt find a way to open his mouth But by virtue of the power of skill in means after he had taught the five mendicants he went to three hundred sixty assemblies and ex pounded the teachings for his age All these were just expedients For this reason he had taken off his regal garments and put on rags He had no choice but to turn toward the shallows within the sphere of the secondary in order to lead his various disciples But tell me what is the supreme statement Here Xuedou re veals a bit of the meaning to let people see Just dont see that there are any Buddhas above dont see that there are sentient beings below dont see that there are mountains rivers and earth without and dont see that there is perception and cognition within Then you will be like one who has died the great death and re turned to life With oppositions united in a whole though you bring them up one by one youll no longer have different views Then you will see the meaning of the saying  He throws away one  Picks up seven  Above below and in the four quar ters no comparison  If you pass through at these lines then and there above below and in the four quarters there is no compari son The myriad forms and appearancesplants animals people everything everywhere completely manifests the way of your own house Thus the saying In myriad forms one body alone is revealed Only by spontaneous acceptance will one be near In past years I mistakenly searched on the road Now I see it as ice within fire In the heavens and on earth I alone am the honored one  Many people pursue the branches and dont seek the root First get the root right then naturally everything will follow  Placidly walking along he treads down the sound of the flow ing stream As he goes along placidly he can tread down and cut off even the roar of a torrent His relaxed gaze descries the tracks of flying birds  At a glance it is as if tracing out even the tracks of flying birds When you get here you will not consider it difficult to blow out the fires under the cauldrons of hell or to shatter sword forests and knife mountains with a shout Because of his compassion at this point Xuedou feared that people would settle down in the realm of unconcern so he went on to say  The grasses grow thick  The mists overhang thus cov ering everything Tell me whose world is this Can it be called Every day is a good day Fortunately theres no connection In fact  Placidly walking along he treads down the sound of the flowing stream isnt it His relaxed gaze descries the tracks of flying birds isnt it either nor is  The grasses grow thick nor  The mists overhang But even something entirely different would just be Around Subhutis cliff the flowers make a mess It is still necessary to go beyond the Other Side a As Subhuti was sitting in silent meditation in a cliffside cave the gods showered flowers in praise Subhuti said Flowers are showering from the sky whose doing is this A god said I am Indra king of gods Subhuti said Why are you offering praise Indra said I esteem your skill in expounding transcendent wis dom Subhuti said I have not spoken a word about wisdom why praise Indra said You have not spoken and I have not heard No speaking no hearingthis is true wisdom And again he caused the earth to tremble and showered flowers The rain has passed the clouds are shrinking Dawn has halfway broken through The multiple peaks are like a drawing of bluegreen rocky crags Subhuti did not know how to sit on a cliff He brought on heavenly flowers and quaking of the earth When the king of gods is shaking the earth and showering flowers where will you go to hide Xuedou also said I fear Subhuti wont be able to escape Even beyond the cosmos all is filled to the brim What end will he know to his frantic turmoil From all sides the pure wind tugs at his clothes Though you be clean and naked bare and purified totally with out affliction this is still not the ultimate In the end though what is I snap my fingers how lamentable is Sunyata  The Sanskrit word Sunyata means the spirit of emptiness Space is her body she has no physical body to be conscious of contact When the Buddhas light shines forth then she manifests her body When you get to be like Sunyata then Xuedou will rightly snap his fingers in lament  Whats it like when you move Sleeping with your eyes open under the bright sun in the blue sky Introduction The sages have not transmitted the statement before sound if you have never seen it personally its as if it were worlds away Thus it is said  The sky cant cover it the earth cant support it space cant contain it sun and moon cant illumine it Where there is no Buddha and you alone are called the Honored One for the first time youve gotten somewhere Do you understand No one knows the sweating horses of the past they only want to emphasize the achievement that crowns the age Story Huichao asked Fayan What does he say Wearing handcuffs he hands over his own indictment Huichao asks the teacher what is the Buddha Fayan said You are Huichao He comes out according to the pattern Iron scrap stuffing He fends him off with a counterattack Commentary b Chan Master Fayan had this ability to get through to people and make simultaneous contact and he knew the use of this ability thus he could answer like this This is what is called passing beyond sound and form achieving the great freedom granting or taking away as the occasion requires where killing or enlivening rests with oneself He is indeed extraordinary Nevertheless people all over who deliberate about this story are many and those who make intellectual interpretations are not few They do not realize that whenever the ancients uttered a word or half a phrase it was like sparks like lightning directly opening up a single straight path People of later times just made up interpretations based on the words Some say Huichao is himself the Buddha that is why Fayan answered thus Some say Its like riding an ox in search of an ox  Some say The asking is it  What relevance has any of this If you want to see Fayans whole potential you must be one who doesnt turn around even when struck one with teeth like sword trees and a mouth like a bowl of blood who knows outside the words what they refer to then you will have a small portion of realization If one by one they make intellectual interpretations everyone on earth would be an exterminator of the Buddhas race As for Chan student Huichaos awakening here he was constantly engrossed in penetrating investigation therefore under the im pact of one word his mind opened up Can you say something m ore Ce said  The fire god is in the province of fire he is seeking fire with fire Likewise I am a Buddha yet I went on searching for a Buddha Fayan said Sure enough you have misunderstood Ce left in a huff and went away These days there are those who just put a glare in their eyes and interpret that as understanding In the Fayan succession this is called arrow points meeting They dont employ the five positions of ruler and minister or the four propositions they simply talk of arrow points meeting But if you ponder over the words to the end you will search without finding c As a public teacher Fayan had five hundred disciples At that time Buddhism flourished Now the future National Teacher Deshao had spent a long time with Sushan and he considered himself to have understood Sushan So he gathered Sushans writ ings and had a portrait of him symbolizing succession and led a band of followers around When they went to Fayans community he himself did not go to encounter the teacher but just had his followers go along with the others for encounters with the teacher One day when Fayan addressed the assembly a monk asked What is one drop from the fount of Chan Fayan said One drop from the fountain of Chan  The monk withdrew dumbfounded but Deshao who was present was suddenly enlightened when he heard this Later he became a public teacher as one of Fayans successors The summit of the peak of the mystic crossing Is not human society Outside the mind there are no things Green mountains fill the eyes Fayan gave his approval and said This one verse alone can per petuate my school In the future kings and lords will honor you I am not equal to you  Observe those ancients when they awaken like this what truth is this Thus when Huichao asked Fayan What is the Buddha The pattern is already showing Partridges are calling deep in the flowers Whats the use of this chatter Blown by the wind into a different tune Is there such a thing At the threetiered Dragon Gate where the waves are high fish become dragons Traverse this one road Dont fool the great congregation Tread on the dragons head Yet fools still go on scooping up the evening pond water Leaning on fences groping along walls next to the gate standing by the door what use is this for a Chan practitioner The points of the ancients that are hard to get your teeth into hard to chew hard to penetrate and hard to see impenetrable riddles he produces in verse to let people see This is indeed extraordinary Xuedou knew Fayans key device and he also knew where Huichao was at Still lest people in the future mistakenly make intellectual interpretations of Fayans words he came out with this verse This monks asking like this Fayans answering like this this is In the river country the spring wind isnt blowing  Deep in the flowers partridges are calling These two lines are just one line But say where is Xuedous meaning In Jiangxi and Jiangnan many people make a twopart inter pretation they say In the river country the spring wind isnt blow ing is used to versify You are Huichao and that this sceneeven if the spring wind doesnt blow still deep in the flowers partridges are calling is used to compare the endless haggling over these words everywhere to the partridges crying deep in the flowers Do you want to have no seam or gap Clearly I tell you his speech is true his words are true they cover heaven and earth Xuedou is extremely compassionate in the third and fourth lines all at once he explains completely for people Chan Master Huichaos great awakening is like fish becoming dragons where the waves are high at the threetiered Dragon Gate while fools still go on dragging through evening pond water The ancient sage King Yu cut the Dragon Gate making a threelevel passage for the Yellow River Nowadays on the third day of the third month when the peach blossoms bloom influenced by heaven and earth if there are fish that can get through the Dragon Gate horns sprout on their heads they raise their bristling tails catch hold of the clouds and fly away Those who cannot leap through fail and fall back Fools who gnaw on words are as it were scooping out evening pond water looking for fish not realizing that the fish have al ready turned into dragons Master Baiduan wrote a verse on this story A copper coin Buys a fried cake He gobbles it down into his belly And then no longer feels hunger This verse is very good only its too crude Xuedous verse is very clever and he doesnt cut his hand on the sharp point Librarian Qing used to like to ask people What is Fish turn into dragons at the threetiered Dragon Gate where the waves are high   For me its not necessary but now Im asking you having turned into dragons where are they now Introduction If you understand you can make use of it on the road like a dragon reaching water like a tiger in the mountains If you dont under stand then worldly truth prevails and you are like a ram caught in a fence like a fool watching over a stump waiting for a rabbit Sometimes a saying is like a lion crouching on the ground some times a saying is like a diamond sword sometimes a saying cuts off the tongues of everyone on earth and sometimes a saying fol lows the waves and goes along with the currents If you make use of it on the road when you meet with one who knows you distinguish whats appropriate to the occasion you know whats right and wrong and together you witness each others illumination Where worldly truth prevails one who has the single eye can occupy the ten directions and stand like a milehigh wall Therefore it is said that when the great function appears it does not keep to fixed patterns Sometimes we take a blade of grass and use it as the sixteenfoot golden body of the Buddha sometimes we take the sixteenfoot golden body and use it as a blade of grass But tell me what principle does this depend on Do you really know Story At the end of a summer retreat Cuiyan said to the group All summer Ive been talking to you If you open your mouth how can you know it to be so see if my eyebrows are still there All hes achieved is that his eyes have fallen out too along with his nostrils which hes already lost He enters hell like an arrow shot Baofu said  The thiefs heart is cowardly Obviously This is a thief recognizing a thief Changqing said Grown His tongue falls to the ground he meets error with error No one in the world can leap out Overcome Commentary The ancients had morning study and evening inquiry But tell me in the whole Buddhist Canon with its five thousand fortyeight volumes in which there is talk of mind and nature of sudden and gradual is there such an event Theyre all this kind of occasion but among them this story of Cui yan is outstanding When the ancients let down a hook  it was never an empty gesture they invariably had a reason to benefit people Many misunderstand and say Under the bright sun in the blue sky Cuiyan spoke aimless talk producing concern where there was none at the end of the summer he spoke of his own faults and examined himself first to avoid others criticism Fortunately this has nothing to do with it The appearance in the world of the succes sive generations of teaching adepts would have been entirely with out benefit if they hadnt reached out to instruct people What would have been the purpose When you get here if you can see all the way through then you will know that the ancients had the method of driving off a plowmans ox and snatching away a hun gry mans food People today when questioned immediately chew on the words making a living on Cuiyans eyebrows If there is nothing extraordinary about these words of Cuiyan why then would these threeYunmen Baofu and Changqinghave replied to him so profusely Baofu said  The thiefs heart is cowardly How much intel lectual interpretation these words have provoked lately What does Baofu mean You must avoid searching for that ancient one in his words If you give rise to feelings and arouse thoughts your eyes are snatched away But this has nothing to do with it They dont know that Changqing brings out his own understanding when he says Grown Each has expressed himself Now I ask you where is the growth If you can break through views of the ordinary cur rent and cut off gain and loss right and wrong then you will see where Changqing responded to Cuiyan Great master Yunmen often taught with oneword Chan though in the one word the three statements were always present This then is the way to make a statement Since the meaning is not there tell me where is it If you are cleareyed with the ability to illumine heaven and earth it will be crystal clear immediately For his single word barrier and the words of the other three Xuedou has strung them together on one verse Verse Cuiyan teaches the followers For a thousand years no reply In a thousand or ten thousand still theres one or a half He divides a tally The word barrier answers him back Didnt you believe what I said Indeed extraordinary Only such a person can understand such talk He loses his money and suffers punishment Xuedou too has done quite a bit of this Id strike while hes still talking Decrepit old Baofu Fellow travelers on the same path still acting this way Two three Censure and praise are impossible to apply Letting go holding still Who is born the same and dies the same Dont slander him Luckily theres no connection Talkative Cuiyan Is clearly a thief The clear jewel has no flaws Who can distinguish true from false Many are just false I myself have never had the eye Bodhidharma can Changqing knows A spirit recognizing a spirit only he could do this Yet he still hasnt gotten a half His eyebrows have grown Where From head to foot there isnt a single blade of grass Commentary How could Xuedou be called a teacher if he hadnt been this com passionate making a verse to enable people to see Since later students became attached to their words and increasingly con ceive intellectual interpretations therefore they do not see the ancients message Though one acts like this one would still have to have really arrived in this realm Xuedou says For a thousand ages there is no reply Cuiyan just said See if my eyebrows are still there Whats so extraordi nary that theres no reply for a thousand ages You must realize that when the ancients uttered a word or half a phrase it wasnt blurted out one must have the eye to judge heaven and earth before this is possible When Xuedou writes something its like a diamond sword like a lion crouching on the ground like sparks like lightning Had he not the eye on the forehead how could he have seen what Cuiyan was getting at This lesson that Cuiyan gave the people was such that for a thousand ages there is no reply It goes beyond Deshans staff and Linjis shout But where is Xuedous meaning for us How will you understand his statement For a thousand ages there is no reply The word barrier answers him back  He loses his money and suffers punishment  What is the meaning of this Even if you have the eye to pass through this barrier when you get here you must be most thoroughgoing before you are done Tell me is it Cuiyan who loses his money and suffers punishment or is it Xuedou or is it Yunmen Decrepit old Baofu  Censure and praise are impossible to apply Does he censure himself Where does Baofu censure Where does Baofu praise  Talkative Cuiyan  Is clearly a thief What has he stolen that Xuedou says hes a thief You must avoid being whirled around following after the stream of his words when you get here you must have your own accomplishment before youll understand  The clear jewel has no flaws Xuedou says that Cuiyan is like a clear jewel without any flaws Who can distinguish true from false It can be said that rarely is there anyone who can make this distinction Only at the very end does he say Changqing knows  His eyebrows have grown Tell me where have they grown Look quickly Zhaozhous Four Gates Introduction When a clear mirror is on its stand beautiful and ugly are distin guished by themselves With a sharp sword in hand one can kill or bring life to fit the occasion In the midst of death one finds life in the midst of life one finds death If you havent the eye to penetrate barriers if you havent room to turn around at this point obvi ously you wont know what to do What is the barrierpenetrating eye what is room to turn around in Story A monk asked Zhaozhou What is Zhaozhou There are thorns in the soft mud If its not south of the river then its north of the river Zhaozhou replied East gate west gate south gate north gate Open I strike Commentary Chan study is to understand yourself clearly avoid picking and choosing among verbal formulations In the Chan founders coming from the West for the sole transmis sion of the mind seal directly pointing to the mind for perception of essence and attainment of Buddhahood where were there any such complications When you penetrate through to libera tion this can be compared to a dragon reaching water or a tiger at home in the mountains To have seen but not yet penetrated or to have penetrated but not yet become illuminedamong the experienced worthies of the past this called for seeking more instruction When one who has investigated for a long time asks for more in struction this would be giving a ladder to a thief In reality this matter is not in words thus Yunmen said If this matter were in words are there no words in the Canon  Within Fenyangs eighteen categories of question the one in this story is called a question to examine the host and it is also called a seekingout question The monks question is indeed ex traordinary anyone but Zhaozhou would have found it hard to reply The monk asked What is Zhaozhou A true adept Zhao zhou immediately replied East gate west gate south gate north gate  The monk said I wasnt asking about that Zhaozhou  Zhao zhou said What Zhaozhou were you asking about Later people said this was nothing Chan cheating quite a few people When the monk asked about Zhaozhou Zhaozhou answered East gate west gate south gate north gate  so people thought Zhaozhou was just answering about the city after which he was named If you understand in this fash ion then any rustic from a village of three families understands more about Buddhism than you do Its like comparing a fish eye to a bright pearl in appearance they are similar but actually they are not the same Tell me is there something or is there nothing c Fushan said At the very last word one finally reaches the impenetrable barrier The inner essence of pointing out the Way is not in words and explanations In ten days one breeze in five days one rain In the peaceful countryside they enjoy their tasks drumming full bellies and singing hallelujah This is called the time of great peace When I call this having no concerns it is not a matter of covering your eyes and saying you have no concerns You must penetrate through the barrier emerge from the forest of brambles clean and naked bare and untrammeled its up to you  This is vain talk I call this claiming attainment without having at tained claiming realization without having realized As they havent made a penetrating investigation when they hear talk of mind or essence of the mysterious and abstruse they say it is just mad talk and there really isnt anything to be concerned with This could be called the blind leading the blind They still dont know that before the Chan founder came people did not call the sky earth or call mountains rivers why did the founder still come from the West And when you see through then as ever sky is sky earth is earth mountains are mountains rivers are rivers An ancient said Mind is the sense things are the objects both elements are like flaws on a mirror  When you get to this realm you will naturally be clean and naked bare and untram meled Yet speaking in terms of the ultimate principle even this is not yet the place of peace and security They seem to be right yet theyre all wrong This monk asked this way Zhaozhou answered this way tell me how will you look for them This way wont do not this way wont do either ultimately how is it One day while Zhaozhou was sitting his attendant reported to him The king has come Chan Master Huanglong Human commented on this saying The attendant only knew how to announce a guest he did not know that he himself was in the imperial city Zhaozhou went into the weeds to look for the man heedless of getting his whole body soaked in muddy water  Do you know the truth of this Look into Xuedous verse Verse In their words they show their ability in direct confrontation Echoing When fish swim through the water is disturbed Better not slander Zhaozhou The adamantine eye is completely void of dust Why search the sky and grope over the earth East west south norththe gates face each other Theyre open Where are there so many gates If you turn your back on Zhaozhou city where will you go An endless series of hammer blows cant smash them open Its just that your revolving hammer is insufficient Theyre open Commentary Zhaozhou faces situations like a diamond sword if you hem and haw he cuts your head right off time and again he will go on to snatch your eyes right away Nevertheless this monk dares to grab the tigers whiskers and pose a question Its like giving rise to something where theres nothing yet nonetheless in his words there is ability Once the monk had shown his ability Zhaozhou did not turn away from the question thus he too showed his abil ity in answering It wasnt that he acted thus out of whimsy be cause he had penetrated he naturally fit in the same groove with the monk as if it were all arranged He said  Tell me is this sparrow in my hand dead or alive The Buddha straddled the threshold and said You tell me am I going out or coming in The outsider was speech less he then bowed This story is just like the one here ever since then the bloodline of the ancients has been unbroken Thus it is said The question is in the answer the answer is in the question Since Xuedou can see through things like this he says In their words they show their ability in direct confrontation There is skill in the monks words which seem to bear two meanings he seems to ask about the man and also about the place Without stirring at all Zhaozhou immediately replies East gate west gate south gate north gate  The adamantine eye is completely void of dust This praises Zhaozhou snatching away both subject and object showing his ability in his words giving an answer This is called having abil ity and perspective The moment the monk turns around Zhaozhou sees through his innermost heart If he couldnt do this it would have been difficult for Zhaozhou to parry the monks question The adamantine eye illumines and sees everywhere without obstruc tion It can not only make out clearly a tiny hair a thousand miles away but also determine what is false and decide what is true distinguish gain and loss discern whats appropriate to the occa sion and recognize right and wrong Xuedou says East west south norththe gates face each other an endless series of hammer blows cant smash them open Since the hammer blows continue without limit why cant they smash the gate open Its that Xuedous vision is like this How will you get these gates open Please examine this thoroughly Introduction So so not so not so In battle each occupies a pivotal position So it is said Turn upward and even Sakyamuni Maitreya Manjusrl Samantabhadra the myriad sages and all the adepts in the world all gasp and fall silent Still he does know how to act like this Muzhou said  Ive been shouted at by you once A trap to fell a tiger He seems to be right but actually isnt Im afraid he has a dragons head but a snakes tail Muzhou said After three or four shouts then what A wave against the current Theres never been any one who could come forth Muzhou hit him and said If we let Muzhou carry out his mandate to the full all the plants and trees on earth would be cut into three pieces You phony  Commentary b Whoever would uphold and establish the teaching of the source must have the eye of a true teacher of the source and must have the functional ability of a true teacher of the source Muzhous mental acuity is like lightning He liked to put scholars to the test he would usually utter a word or half a phrase like a thicket of brambles that cant be stepped on or touched As soon as he saw a monk coming he would say The issue is obvious Ill give you a thrashing This monk was also well polished and prepared but neverthe less he had a dragons head but a snakes tail At the time anyone but Muzhou would have been thrown into confusion by this monk The old fellow wasnt flustered at all calmly he replied Ive been shouted at by you once  He seems to take that shout and put it to one side and he also seems to test him he leans over to watch him Again the monk shouted he seems to be right but isnt reallyhe was taken in tow by Muzhou who asked After three or four shouts then what  After all the monk was speechless Muzhou then hit him and called him a phony The aim of testing people is to know them intimately the minute they speak Too bad this monk was speechless provoking Muzhou to call him a phony If it had been any of you who had been asked by Muzhou After three or four shouts then what how should you have replied in order to avoid his calling you a phony Here if you can discern survival and destruction and dis tinguish right and wrong if your feet tread the real ground then who is concerned with After three or four shouts then what But since this monk was speechless his case was decided by old Muzhou on the basis of the facts Verse Two shouts and a third shout The sound of thunder is tremendous but there isnt a single drop of rain How can you ride a tigers head Many people have understood in this way and there are still those who entertain this view Both of them would turn out to be blind Why only two Take whats due you and get out Who is blind When you look its not that it isnt there but if you stare at it youll go blind If you set your eyes to look you are grabbing empty space with both hands Sometimes a shout is like a crouching lion sometimes a shout is like a diamond sword  Xinghua said  I see all of you shouting in the east hall and shouting in the west hall I have never set out real pearls for you inside the royal curtains As for you all here what are you doing when you just go on with wild random shouting Linji said Ive heard you all imitate my shouting But I ask you if a monk comes from the east hall and another monk comes from the west hall and they both shout at once which one is the guest and which one is the host If you cant distinguish host and guest then you must not imitate me any more Therefore Xuedou says in his verse Adepts recognize the op portune moment to change Although the monk in the case was taken in by Muzhou he still could perceive the opportune moment to change Tell me where did he do this  This is where the teachers silenced everyone in the world If you recognize the opportune moment to change then when something is raised you immediately know what it comes down to Let them shout twenty or thirty times or even go on shouting until king dom come and call this riding the tigers headif you understand in this way its because you dont know Muzhou Even if you want to see the monk youre still too far away To ride a tigers head one must have a sword in hand and versatility too Xuedou says if you call this riding the tigers head The two of them would both turn out blind Xuedou is like a long sword leaning against the sky stern and awesome in full majesty Xuedou goes on to say Who is blind Tell me is it the guest whos blind or is it the host Or are the guest and host both blind Notice on Overcoming Demons at once  This is the living point where Xuedou finishes the verse all at once Yet why does he say I bring it out for everyone to see How will you see it Open your eyes and you can shut your eyes and you can too Is there anyone who can avoid it Notice on Overcoming Demons a by Chan Master Wuai of Jiashan appended by Huifang I have heard that the road of the three vehicles is wide and that the realm of reality is boundless When the ocean of wisdom is calm and clear the ten directions are secure and peaceful At this time an army of demons arises to invade the mind field Since the six brigands are strong the mind king is startled In the morning they produce a hundredfold weirdness in the evening they pro duce a thousandfold perversion The road of enlightenment is cut off and made impassable They destroy Nirvana and ruin the three treasures the jewels of nondoing are stolen away and the spiri tual wealth of the great treasury is plundered Material passions block the sun and the fire of desire spans the sky They ravage the citadel of the Dharma and burn the realm of sanctity Having seen such violence I feared that Buddhism would be hard to preserve so I discussed the matter with the six perfec tions to eliminate it together I sent essential emptiness as a se cret emissary to spy on the demon army and saw that it was garrisoned in the mountains of the five clusters with over eightyfour thousand troops Finally I activated the heroic soldiers of the eighteen elements with the emptiness of substance as their com mon battle cry Everyone has the power of nonobstruction everyone has the ability to be brave and strong The straightforward mind is the achievement of seeing essence one right gets rid of the confusion of a hundred wrongs Putting on the armor of steadfastness hold ing the lance of concentration with the arrows of knowledge the bow of meditation and the radiant sword of wisdom they train in the school of the Great Vehicle they encamp in the mountains of tranquillity They fly their flag on the ridge of the three insights and line up along the eightfold right path Sending great aware ness as a general who captures enemies alive they roam the four quarters looking for the tracks of errant thought Cutting off the traces of ignorance they also enable the king of compassion to break through the blockade of the three poisons The commander of forbearance attacks the citadel of anger the army of diligence gets rid of the troublemaker of pride and the soldiers of joy and equanimity capture the thieves of stinginess and greed While on patrol the demon army arises up in full force its murderous atmosphere striking the very skies At this time the eyes do not look upon form the ears do not listen to sound the nose does not smell odors the tongue does not discern flavors the body does not sense feelings and the mind does not cling to objects Proceeding ahead singlemindedly not retreating thought after thought suddenly I find that the demon army has been overwhelmingly defeated and that the six brigands have completely lost The slaughter knows no bounds and there is a clean sweep I capture errant thought and ignorance alive take them to the place of Nirvana and cut them into three pieces with the sword of wisdom The forest of afflictions is then cut down and the mountains of others and self turn to dust The net of folly and attachment burns when it meets the fire of knowledge the forest of erroneous views is withered by the wind of wisdom Inwardly and outwardly flawless open and clear the mind king sits in the throne room of joy and true thusness climbs the tower of emanci pation Inherent essence roams in the halls of nonobstruction and the three bodies sit on the seat of objective emptiness Henceforth the reality realm is peaceful and quiet forever free from noise and dust Together we cross the river of birth and death reaching the shore of enlightenment as one Once the demon army has retreated we should announce it on high together Introduction The great capacity of the enlightened is under ones control the lifeline of humans and gods is subject to ones direction With a casual saying one astounds the crowd and stirs the masses with one device one perspective one smashes chains and knocks off fetters Tell me who has ever been like this Are there any who know where such a one is at Story Huangbo said to his group Drawing water one is limited by the size of the container He swallows all in one gulp No one in the world can leap clear All of you are gobblers of dregs if you go on traveling around this way You said it Youll wear out your shoes He overturns the heaven and shakes the earth where will you have Today Whats the use of Today He certainly astounds the crowd and stirs up the community  Do you know that there are no Chan teachers in all of China I hadnt realized He swallows all in one gulp Hes a fellow with a dragons head but a snakes tail Commentary Huangbo was seven feet tall on his forehead was a lump like a round pearl He understood Chan by nature Tiantai he met a monk on the way They talked and laughed together like old acquaintances Huangbo looked him over carefully the light in his eyes was piercing and his appearance was extremely unusual As they traveled along together when they came to a swollen valley stream Huangbo stopped there The monk tried to take Huangbo across with him but Huangbo told him to cross over himself The monk gathered up his robes and walked on the water as though on land  The monk said in admiration You are a true vessel of the teaching of the Great Vehicle As his words ended he disappeared Majestic Where do you come from Huangbo said Magnifi cent majestic Ive come from the mountains Baizhang said What have you come for Huangbo said Not for anything else i ic Baizhang saw him to have profound capacity The next day Huangbo took leave of Baizhang Tell me did Huangbo know this when he asked or not Huangbo asked What did he say when he was alive Baizhang then re lated the circumstances of his second encounter with Mazu When Mazu saw me approach he raised his whisk Mazu drew himself up and gave a shout that left me deaf for three days Huangbo unconsciously stuck out his tongue in awe Baizhang said After this wont you be a successor of Mazu Huangbo said No Today through your recital Ive gotten to see Mazus great capacity and great function if I were to succeed Mazu in the future I would be bereft of descendants  Baizhang said It is so If your view equals the teacher you have less than half the teachers virtue only when your wisdom goes beyond the teacher are you worthy to pass on the transmission You must see for yourself how father and son act in that house before you begin to understand Huangbo was an informal friend of prime minister Pei Xiu When Pei was commander of Wanling he invited the master to come to the district capital He showed the master a composition expressing his understanding The master took it and put it down without even opening it Hes inherited the mind seal from a great adept Theres a round pearl on his brow his bodys seven feet tall He hung up his staff and stayed ten years by the river Shu Today his floating coracle has crossed the banks of the Zhang Eight thousand dragons and elephants follow his giant strides Over myriad miles fragrant flowers join his excellent cause I hope to serve the master as his disciple I do not know to whom he will entrust the teaching The master made no sign of being pleased but said My mind is like the boundlessness of the ocean My mouth spews red lotuses to nurse a sick body I myself have a pair of hands with nothing to do I have never received an idle person When Linji was in his group Muzhou was the head monk Why dont you go question the teacher Linji said What should I ask Muzhou said Why not ask what the essential mean ing of Buddhism is Linji then went and asked Huangbo three times he was beaten and driven out He took leave saying to the head monk I have been bidden to ask the question three times and have been beaten and driven out  Dayu said Huangbo was so kind he exerted himself to the utmost for you why do you go on speaking of fault or no fault Suddenly enlightened Linji said  Huangbos Buddhism is no big deal Dayu grabbed him and said You just said you were at fault and now you say Buddhism is no big deal Linji hit Dayu in the ribs thrice Dayu pushed him away and said Your teacher is Huangbo its none of my business One day Huangbo said to his group The great master Farong of Ox Head Mountain spoke horizontally and vertically but he still didnt know the key of transcendence These days Chan fol lowers after Shitou and Mazu speak of Chan and Tao volumi nously But why did Huangbo talk like this It was because of this that he said You are all gobblers of dregs if you travel around like this youll be laughed at As soon as you hear of a place with eight hundred or a thousand people you immediately go there It wont do just to seek out the hubbub if you always take things easy here then where else would there be this matter of Today In the Tang dynasty they used to revile people by calling them gobblers of dregs so many people say Huangbo was reviling the people Those with eyes see for themselves what he was getting at There was a Chan man in the group who didnt fear for his life so he could come forth this way from the crowd to question Huangbo What about those who order followers and lead communities He makes a good point too As soon as I speak this way Ive already lost my head Where are your nostrils Verse His cold severe solitary mien does not take pride in itself He himself doesnt know he has it He too is a cloud dwelling saint b Solemnly dwelling in the sea of the world he distinguishes dragons and snakes It is necessary to distinguish initiate and outsider and to distinguish absolute and relative The emperor has been lightly handled What emperor are you talking about However great he too must get up from the ground and even higher theres still the skywhat about that Three times he personally felt those claws and fangs at work Its not yet anything extraordinary its still a minor skill When his great capacity and great function become manifest the mountains rivers and earth the whole world will be at Huangbos place begging for their lives Commentary This verse by Xuedou seems just like a eulogy on a portrait of Huangbo yet you mustnt understand it as such Xuedou clearly says  His cold severe solitary mien does not take pride in itself When Huangbo instructed the group this way he wasnt contesting with others or asserting himself displaying himself or boasting of himself If you understand what happened here you are free in all direc tions sometimes you stand alone on a solitary peak sometimes you stretch out in the bustling marketplace How could you onesidedly stick to one corner The more you abandon the more you arent at rest the more you seek the more you dont see the more you take on the more you sink down An ancient said Without wings fly through the sky with fame you become known through out the world Xuedou says Solemnly dwelling in the sea of the world he distinguishes dragons and snakes Is it a dragon or a snake As soon as anyone comes in through the door he poses a test this is called the eye to distinguish dragons and snakes the ability to capture tigers and rhinos Xuedou also said Judging dragons and snakeshow is that eye correct Capturing tigers and rhinos that skill is not complete Xuedou also says  The emperor has been lightly handled  Three times he personally felt those claws and fangs at work Huangbo is not just acting bad right here hes always been thus As for this emperor the Tang dynasty emperor Xianzong had two sons Muzong and Xuanzong The one referred to here is Xuanzong When Xuanzong was thirteen though young he was acute He used to like to sit in the lotus posture During the reign of Muzong once when morning audience was over Xuanzong play fully sat on the imperial throne and pretended to salute the court One of the ministers saw this and thought Xuanzong was demented so he reported it to Muzong Seeing Xuanzong Muzong praised him My younger brother is indeed a valiant son of our clan Muzong died in  leaving three sonsJingzong Wenzong and Wuzong Jingzong succeeded to the throne and reigned for two years until the inner court removed him Wenzong succeeded him and reigned for fourteen years When Wuzong came to the throne he always spoke of Xuanzong as an imbecile One day filled with hatred for Xuanzong because he had long ago playfully climbed up on his fathers throne he finally had Xuanzong beaten almost to death thrown out into the back yard and drenched with filthy water to revive him After this Xuanzong went into hiding in the community of Chan Master Xiangyan Later he had his head shaved as a novice but did not receive full ordination Lu Xiangyan made up a poem about a waterfall Piercing clouds penetrating rock never declining the work When the land is distant you know how high is the place it appears Having intoned these two lines Xiangyan remained silent in thought he wanted to draw Xuanzong out to see what he was like Eventually it must return to the ocean as waves Now Xiangyan realized that Xuanzong was no ordinary man and he silently acknowledged him Huangbo was there serving as head monk One day as Huangbo was paying respects to a Buddha image Xuanzong saw him and asked  If you dont seek from the Buddha dont seek from the Dharma and dont seek from the Sangha what are you seeking by bowing Huangbo replied I dont seek from the Buddha the Dharma or the SanghaI always pay respects this way Xuanzong said Whats the use of paying respects Immediately Huangbo slapped him Xuanzong said Too coarse Huangbo said Where is this to talk of coarse and fine and slapped him again Later when Xuanzong succeeded to the throne he gave Huangbo the title Coarse Acting Monk When prime min ister Pei Xiu was at court later he proposed that Huangbo be given the title Duanji Chanshi Boundless Chan Master Xuedou know where his bloodline came from so he could use it cleverly Right now is there anyone to use those claws and fangs Introduction The sword that kills the sword that gives life this is the standard way of antiquity and the essential pivot for today too If you dis cuss killing you dont harm a single hair if you discuss giving life you lose your life So it is said The sages have not transmitted the single transcendental path students toil over appearances like monkeys grasping at reflections Let those with eyes try to discern Story A monk asked Dongshan What is the Buddha Iron brambles no one on earth can leap clear Dongshan said Three pounds of flax Commentary So many people misunderstand this story It is really hard to chew since theres no place to sink your teeth into Because it is flavorless The ancients had quite a few answers to the question of what the Buddha is  He indeed cut off the tongues of the ancients Many people base their understanding on the words and say that Dongshan was in the storehouse at the time weighing out flax when the monk questioned him and that is why he answered this way Some say that when Dongshan is asked about east he answers about west Some say that since you are a Buddha and yet you still go around asking about a Buddha Dongshan answers this in a roundabout way And theres yet another type of dead people who say that the three pounds of flax is itself the Buddha If you seek from Dongshans words this way you can search until kingdom come and still never see it even in a dream Not realizing the intent of the ancients people just search in their words what grasp have they An ancient said Basically the Way has no words for it but we use words to illustrate the Way Once you see the Way the words are forgotten To get to this point you must first go back to your own original state This three pounds of flax is like the single track of the high way to the Capital as you go nothing is not it This story is the same as Yunmens Cake undeniably difficult to understand My teacher Wuzu made a verse on it The cheapselling boardcarrying fellow Weighs it out three pounds of flax With a hundred thousand years of unsold goods He has no place to put it all You must clean it all up when defiling feelings conceptual think ing and comparisons of gain and loss and right and wrong are all cleared away at once then you will spontaneously understand Verse The sun hurries In the left eye half a pound Lay down in flames of fire The moon is swift In the right eye eight ounces He makes his nest in the palace of Heng O the Moon Lady Has there ever been carelessness in a good response To see Dongshan as laying out facts according to the situation Mistakenly sticking by the zero point of the scale Its just you who see things this way Is like a lame tortoise and a blind turtle entering an empty valley Take your due and get out In the same pit theres no different dirt Who killed your hawk Flowery groves clusters of brocade A double case he handles all crimes on the same indictment As before theyre the same Bamboo of the south wood of the north There is also a third level A quadruple case He puts a head on top of his head So I think of Changqing and Officer Lu A leper drags his companions along with him I am this way and Xuedou is this way too He knew how to say he should laugh not cry Commentary Xuedou can see all the way through so he immediately says The sun hurries  The moon is swift This is of the same kind as Dongshans reply Three pounds of flax  The sun rises the moon sets every day its like this People often make up intellectual interpretations and just say the sun is the left eye and the moon is the right eye when questioned they glare and say Here What connection is there If you understand in this way the Chan school will disappear That is why it is said Setting out a hook in the four seas is just to fish out terrible dragons the mysterious device outside convention is for seeking those who know the self Xuedou is one who has left the mundane how could he make up this sort of interpretation Xuedou easily reveals a little some thing to let you see where barriers are broken and hinges are smashed there he adds a footnote saying Has there ever been carelessness in a good response Dongshan does not reply lightly he is like a bell when struck like a valley echoing At once Xuedou has brought out his heart and presented it to you Presented face to face its not a matter of multiplicity Dragons and snakes are easily distinguished but Chan practitioners are hard to deceive The golden hammers shadow moves the jewel swords light is cold They strike directly be quick to look After a while he said Some day Ill go where there are no human hearths and build a hut I wont store any rice or plant any vegetables  Dongshan then left Later when he worked as a teacher to deal with peoples various potentials the words three pounds of flax were understood everywhere merely as a reply to the ques tion about the Buddha people just make their reasoning in terms of the Buddha Xuedou says that to understand Dongshans reply as expressing facts in accordance with the situation is like a lame tortoise or a blind turtle going into an empty valley when will they ever find a way out Flowery groves clusters of brocade When a monk asked Fude Xian What is the mind of the ancient Buddhas He replied Flowery groves clusters of brocade The monk also asked Mingjiao What is the inner meaning o fthree pounds of flax  Mingjiao said Bamboo of the south wood of the north The monk came back and recounted this to Dongshan who said I wont explain this just for you but for the whole community Later he entered the hall and said Words do not express facts speech does not accord with the situation Those who accept words are lost those who linger over sayings are deluded  To smash peoples intellectual views Xuedou purposely draws these together on a single thread to produce his verse They dont realize that bamboo of the south wood of the north and three pounds of flax are just like daddy and papa When the ancients answered with a turn of words their intention was definitely not like this Its just like Xuedous saying The sun hurries  The moon is swift its just as broad Its just that gold and brass are hard to tell apart similar written characters get mixed up So I think of Changqing and Officer Lu  He knew how to say he should laugh not cry To discuss the verse itself the first three lines by themselves have already completed the verse Its just that he is extremely compassion ate therefore he does this When Officer Lu Xuan was Inspector of Xuanzhou he studied with Nanquan When Nanquan passed on Lu heard the sound of mourning so he went to the temple for the funeral He laughed aloud The temple director said The late master was your teacher why arent you crying Lu said If you can speak appropriately Ill cry The temple director had nothing to say Lu gave a loud lament Alas Our late teacher is long gone Later Changqing heard of this and said The officer should have laughed not cried Xuedou borrows the essence of this meaning to say that if you make up these kinds of intellectual interpretations this calls for laughter not crying This is so but at the very end theres a single word that is in fact easy to misunderstand when he goes on to say Ha  Has Xuedou washed clean The School of Kanadeva Introduction Clouds are frozen over the great plain but the world is not hid den When snow covers the white flowers its hard to distinguish the outlines Its coldness is cold as snow and ice its fineness is fine as flour Its depths are hard for even the Buddhas eye to peer into its secrets are impossible for demons and outsiders to fathom Tell me whose business is this Story A monk asked Baling What is the school of Kanadeva A white horse enters white flowers Check Baling said Piling snow in a silver bowl He chokes you A profuse outburst Commentary People often misunderstand this story and say this is a heretical school Whats the connection The fifteenth patriarch Kanadeva was indeed once an outsider but when he met the fourteenth pa triarch Nagarjuna who presented a bowl of water to him he put a needle into the bowl Nagarjuna recognized his capacity trans mitted the enlightened mind teaching to him and invested him as the fifteenth patriarch If you have not been able to comprehend it you cant avoid defeat What about it If you say words are it this is off the mark if you say words are not it this too is off the mark Where does Mazus meaning lie  Dasui raised his whisk and said ManjusrI and Samantabhadra are both here The monk drew a circle and presented it to Dasui then he threw it behind him Dasui said Attendant bring tea for this monk  He also said The red flag is in my hand In doctrinal disputes in India the winner held a red flag while the loser turned his clothes inside out and departed through a side door Those who wanted to hold debates in India were re quired to obtain royal permission Bells and drums would be sounded in the great temples and afterwards the debates began In Kanadevas day heretics had impounded the bell and drum in the Buddhist temple in a persecution Now Kanadeva knew that Buddhism was in trouble so he made use of his supernormal pow ers to go up the bell tower and ring the bell for he wanted to drive out the heretics Soon one of the heretics called out Who is up in the tower ringing the bell Kanadeva answered A deva The heretic asked Who is the deva Kanadeva said I The heretic said Who is T   Kanadeva said You is a dog The heretic asked Who is the dog Kanadeva said  The dog is you  After seven gorounds like this the heretic realized he was beaten so he submitted and opened the door of the bell tower whereupon Kanadeva came down b holding a red flag At such times Kanadeva would hold a red flag in his hand and the defeated one would stand beneath the flag Among the heretics to have their heads cut off was gen erally the punishment for defeat but now Kanadeva put a stop to this he only required his defeated adversaries to shave their heads and enter the Buddhist path Therefore the school of Kanadeva flourished greatly Later on Xuedou uses this in his verse When he was traveling he always sewed sitting mats He had attained deep realization under Yunmen thus he was outstanding Later he be came a teacher a spiritual heir of Yunmen First he lived at Bal ing He didnt compose a document of succession to the teaching but just used three turning words to offer up to Yunmen What is the Way One with clear eyes falls into a well What is the ra zorsharp sword Each branch of coral upholds the moon  What is the school of Kanadeva Piling snow in a silver bowl Yunmen said Later on on the anniversary of my death just recite these three turning words and you will have repaid my kindness in full  Thereafter as it turned out he did not hold ceremonial feasts on the anniversary of the death of his teacher Yunmen but followed Yunmens will and just brought up these sayings Though people all over have given answers to this question about the school of Kanadeva they have mostly answered in terms of events Then too without revealing a trace of his sharp point he takes on enemies from all sides and blow by blow finds a way out He has the skill to fell tigers he strips off human sentimental views As for the matter of uniformity to get here you must have penetrated all the way through on your own but after all you must meet another before you are done Therefore it is said When Daowu brandished his scepter one who was his equal would understand when Shikong bent his bow an adept would tacitly comprehend For this truth if you have no certain transmission from a teacher what can you use to carry on the esoteric conversation Verse Old Baling A thousand soldiers are easy to get but one general is hard to find Talkative teacher Is truly something else What truth is this Have you even dreamed of the peak experience He knows to say Piling snow in a silver bowl The frog cant jump out of the basket A double case Quite a few people will lose their lives The heretics must know for themselves Youre included too but do you know All are buried in the same pit If you dont know ask the moon in the sky Its farther than far Take whats due you and get out Address your plea to the sky The school of Kanadeva Kanadevas school Beneath the red flag arouses the pure wind Just cut off your heads and arms and Ill speak a phrase for you Commentary Old Baling  Is truly something else Xuedou has ample praise for him All words are the Buddhas teaching When I talk like this whats the reason Xuedou subtly reveals a little of his meaning when he says its just that Baling is truly something else Afterwards he opens up and says He knows to say Piling snow in a silver bowl  Xuedou goes on to provide you with further footnotes If you dont know ask the moon in the sky An ancient once gave this answer to this question Ask the moon in the sky  ic Xuedous eulogy finished at the end there must be a living road a phrase where the lion rears He raises it higher for you and says  The school of Kanadeva Kanadevas school  Beneath the red flag arouses the pure wind Baling said he piled snow in a silver bowl why then does Xuedou speak of rousing the pure wind beneath the red flag Do you know that Xuedou kills people without using a sword Story A monk asked Yunmen What are the teachings of a whole life tim e Even now theyre still not finished The professor does not understand hes in a cave of complications Yunmen said An appropriate statement An iron hammerhead with no hole A rat gnawing on raw ginger Commentary Members of the Chan school if you want to know the meaning of the Buddha nature you must observe times and conditions This is called the special transmission outside doctrine the sole com munication of the mind seal directly pointing to the mind for the perception of the essence and the realization of enlightenment For fortynine years Skyamuni Buddha stayed in the world at three hundred sixty assemblies he expounded the sudden and gradual the temporary and the true teachings These are what are called the teachings of a whole lifetime The monk picked this out to ask What are the teachings of a whole lifetime Why didnt Yunmen explain for him in full detail but instead say An appropriate statement Yunmen ordinarily included three statements in one state ment These are called the statement that contains the universe the statement that follows the waves and the statement that cuts off all streams He lets go and gathers in naturally extraordinary like cutting nails or shearing iron What connection is there Not only do they not understand they go to hell as fast as an arrow Therefore it is said Even to shatter ones bones and crush ones body is not sufficient recompense when a single statement is understood you transcend ten billion Extraordinary indeed What are the teachings of a whole lifetime just boils down to his saying An appropriate statement If you can grasp this im mediately you can go home and sit in peace If not listen humbly to the verdict Verse An appropriate statement Leaping with life The words are still in our ears Its not merely like a milehigh wall Is there any such thing He wedges a stake into the iron hammerhead with no hole He misunderstands the words Old Yunmen too is washing a lump of dirt in mud Xuedou too is just pasting on ornaments Under the Jambu Tree I laugh This fellow has never been anywhere Only those on the same road would know How many could there be who know Last night the black dragon had its horn wrenched off Its not just the black dragon that gets twisted and broken Has anyone seen Do you have proof Dumb Exceptional exceptional Ample praise it takes Xuedou to do this Where is he exceptional Old Yunmen got one horn Where is it Even Deshan and Linji must fall back three thousand miles Again what about that other horn  How utterly unique Xuedou can not praise him enough It is like a precipitous cliff ten miles high Then too it is like a millionman battle line there is no place for you to get in No one on earth can do anything about it And Yunmen answered this way much like wedging a stake into the iron hammerhead with no hole Xuedou employs lan guage so artfully Under the Jambu Tree I laugh In the Scrip ture on Creation o f the World it says South of Sumeru a crystal tree shines over the continent Jambu making all in between a clear blue This continent takes its name from this great tree hence it is called Jambudvipa This tree is seven thousand leagues high beneath it are the golden mounds of the Jambu altar which is twenty leagues high Since gold is produced from beneath the tree it is called the Jambu Tree Thus Xuedou says of himself that he is under the Jambu Tree laughing What is he laughing at Hes laughing at the black dragon that got its horn wrenched off last night All he can do is look up respectfully and praise Yunmen Its like breaking off one of the black dragons horns At this point if there were no such thing how could he have spoken as he did Exceptional exceptional  Old Yunmen got one horn Why doesnt Xuedou say he got them both How is it that he just got one horn Introduction The sword that kills the sword that enlivens the customary rule of time immemorial is still the pivotal essential for today Tell me right now which is the killing sword and which the enlivening sword Fall back three thousand miles Yunmen said An upsidedown statement They come out even Truth comes out of the convicts mouth he cant be let go This is a question to ib demonstrate understanding and it can also be called a question with a concealed barb Anyone but Yunmen would have no way to cope with this monk Yunmen possesses such ability that he can not but reply once the question is raised An expert teach ing master is like a mirror An ancient said If you want to attain intimate understand ing dont use a question to ask a question Because the question is in the answer and the answer is in the question Since when have the sages ever had anything to give people Where is there Chan or the Way that can be given to you If you dont do hellish deeds naturally you will not bring on hellish results If you dont create heavenly conditions naturally you wont receive heav enly rewards Whatever you do you experience the results yourself Yunmen clearly tells you When we discuss this affair its not in the words Were it in the words doesnt the Canon contain words Tell me where is the confusion This is why it is said The teaching is carried out according to facts the banner of the teaching is set up according to the situation  When its not the present potential and not the present situ ation what is it is just worth a nod Someone with eyes couldnt be fooled one bit Since the point of the question was abstruse the answer too had to be thus In fact Yunmen is riding the thiefs horse in pursuit of the thief Some people mistakenly say  Basically these are words of a host but it was a guest who spoke them therefore Yunmen said An upsidedown statement  What is the rush This monk asked well When its not the present potential and not the present situation what is it Why didnt Yunmen answer him with some other words Still to say An upsidedown statement at this point is to gouge a wound in healthy flesh The emergence of tracks of words is the source from which divergent opinions are born  Suppose there were no words have the pillars and lamps here ever had any words If you dont under stand at this point you still need to turn over before you will know where the ultimate point of this is Dividing one token Part on your side part on my side Half south of the river half north of the river Walking together hand in hand Dying with you being born with you to give you certainty Washing a lump of dirt in mud For what reason He greatly diminishes these peoples grandeur The ignorant are plentiful Thirtythree people entered the tigers den One can only know for oneself A band of wild fox spirits Distinctly outstanding The moon in the churning rushing water Xuedou has always had the technique of letting go he dares to enter the mud and water for your sake to die and be born together with you This is the reason Xuedou praises Yunmen this way These days however people spin out intellectual interpreta tions based on his words  If Yunmen were not someone whose whole capacity had pen etrated through to liberation how could he die with you and be born with you Why can he do this Because he is free from the many leaking points of gain and loss right and wrong emo tional leakage leakage of views and verbal leakage If there is leakage of views the potential does not leave its position and falls into a sea of poison With emotional leakage knowledge always turns toward and against and ones view is biased You should know these three kinds of leakage for yourself  There are also three mysteries the mystery within the essence the mystery within the expression and the mystery within the mys tery When the ancients came into this realm their whole capac ity was fully used if you happened to be born they would be born together with you if you happened to die they would die with you They stretched out in the tigers mouth letting go they would follow your lead for a thousand miles The Buddha held up a flower and Kasyapa alone broke into a smile the others did not know what he meant Thus Xuedou says that the eightyfour thousand were not worthy successors Thirtythree people entered the tigers den  Ananda asked Kasyapa The Buddha bequeathed to you his golden robe what special teaching did he transmit besides Kasyapa said Ananda Ananda said Y es Kasyapa said  Take down the banner in front of the gate Ananda was enlightened at this Thereafter transmission continued person to person in India and China through thirtythree patriarchs All of them had the ability to enter the tigers den The ancients said if you dont enter the tigers den how can you catch a tiger cub Yunmen is this kind of person able to accompany people through birth and death To help people a Chan teacher must be like this making you break open and letting you grab the tigers whiskers Those on the solitary peak the teacher rescues and sends into the wild weeds those fallen into the wild weeds the teacher rescues and puts on the solitary peak If you enter a boiling cauldron or a fiery furnace the teacher also enters the boiling cauldron and fiery furnace Spiritual light undimmed Ages of good advice Once it comes through this door Dont keep intellectual understanding Distinctly outstandingThe moon in the churning rushing wa ter Xuedou unfailingly has a way to manifest in being and also the skill to bring people to life He has picked this out to get people to awaken to their own living potential Dont follow anothers words if your follow them that indeed would be the moon in the churning rushing water Right now how will you find peace I leave it up to you Introduction The Way has no byroads one who stands on it is utterly alone Truth is not seeing or hearing words and thoughts are far removed from it If you can penetrate through the forest of thorns and untie the bonds of the enlightened state you attain the land of inner peace where the gods have no way to offer flowers where outsiders have no door to spy through Then you work all day without ever work ing talk all day without ever talking then you can unfold the device of breaking in and breaking out and use the doubleedged sword that kills and brings life with freedom and independence Even if you are thus you must also know that within the me dium of provisional expedients there is lifting up with one hand and pressing down with one hand Yet this still amounts only to a little bit As for the fundamental matter this has nothing to do with it Story A monk asked Jingqing I am breaking out I ask the teacher to break in Why raise waves where theres no wind He buys the hat to fit the head He meets error with error Every one cant be this way The monk said If I werent alive Id be laughed at by people He drags others into it Take whats coming to you and get out He cant be let go Commentary Jingqing was a successor of Xuefeng and a contemporary of the likes of Benren Xuansha Sushan and Taiyuan Fu First he met Xuefeng and understood the message He was skilled at teaching according to the potentialities of his listeners Therefore he questioned like this I am breaking out I ask the teacher to break in In the CaoDong line this is called using phenomena to illustrate ones condition When the chick breaks out and the mother breaks in they are naturally perfectly simultaneous Jingqing too does well we could say his fists and feet are coordi nated his mind and eye illumine each other He answered by say ing Can you live The monk too does well he also knows how to change with the circumstances In this one sentence of Jingqings there is guest and host illumination and function killing and enliv ening The monk said If I werent alive Id be laughed at by people  Jingqing said You too are a man in the weeds Everyone goes into the mud and water but Jingqing is indeed severe Since the monk understood enough to question in this way why did Jingqing nevertheless say he was a man in the weeds Because the eye of an adept must be this way like sparks like lightning Whether you can reach it or not you wont avoid losing your life If you are this way then you see Jingqing calling him a man in the weeds Therefore Nanyuan said Everywhere they only have the per ception to break in and out simultaneously but not the ability Later that monk went to Yunmens community where he brought up this conversation A monk said to him Did Nanyuans staff break The first monk was greatly awakened at this But tell me where is the meaning c The monk returned to see Nanyuan but since Nanyuan had passed on he saw Fengxue instead As soon as he bowed Fengxue said Arent you the one who was asking our late teacher about simultaneous breaking in and out The monk said he was Feng xue said What was your understanding at that time The monk said At first it was as if I were walking in the light of a lamp Fengxue said Youve understood What principle is this The monk just said At first it was as if I were walking in the light of a lamp  why did Fengxue immediately tell him hed understood Later Cuiyan commented Though Nanyuan put his plan into operation from within his tent nevertheless the country is big the people few and those who know are rare Fengxue commented At the time Nanyuan should have hit him right across the back the minute he opened his mouth to see what he would do If you see this story you see where the monk and Jingqing met How would you avoid Jingqing calling you someone in the weeds Verse The ancient Buddhas had a family tradition The words are still in our ears Dont slander old Sakyamuni Buddha Responsive preaching comes to scornful detraction Eight blows pays for thirteen What about you Once again he receives a blow All the Chan practitioners in the world name and describe it in vain If there is that one too is in the weeds From time immemorial the darkness is boundless it is everywhere but no one understands Commentary With the one line The ancient Buddhas had a family tradition Xuedou has completed his verse Whoever comes forth simply wont be able to approach If you do approach youre ten thousand miles away As soon as you come forth youve fallen into the weeds So devices of breaking in and out are all in the family tradition of the ancient Buddhas If you can attain to this Way youll be able to knock down a mountain fortress with a blow of your fist and topple a clifftop temple with a single kick Its like a bonfire approach and it will burn off your face Its like a sharp sword fool around with it and you lose your life Only those who have penetrated through to the great liberation can be like this Otherwise if you miss the source and get stuck on the words you surely wont be able to grasp this kind of talk Responsive preaching comes to scornful detraction  This is One guest one host one question one answer Right in the ask ing and answering theres the scornful detraction Its called re sponsive preaching coming to scornful detraction Xuedou has deep knowledge of this matter so he can complete his verse in only two lines Neither is aware of the other At the moment of breaking in and breaking out who is it that breaks in and out together The chick breaks out the hen breaks in when the chick awakens there is no shell On the same path chanting in har mony through the marvelous mystery walking alone Nonetheless Xuedou comes down into the weeds and creates complications by saying A peck This one word praises Jingqings answer Can you live  He awakens praises the monks reply  If I werent alive Id be laughed at by people Why then does Xuedou go on to say Hes still in the shell Jingqing said You too are a man in the weeds Xuedou says Once again he receives a blow This difficult part is it when Jingqing says You too are a man in the weeds  can this be called snatching the mans eyes away This has nothing to do with it When I talk like this I too am a man in the weeds All the Chan practitioners in the world name and describe it in vain Who doesnt name and describe At this point Xuedou himself cannot name or describe it yet he drags in others the Chan practitioners of the world Now tell me how did Jingqing help this monk No one in the world can leap out Introduction Cut through nails shear through iron then you can be a genuine Chan master If you run away from arrows and avoid swords how can you possibly be an adept Where even a needle cannot enter I leave aside for now tell me whats it like when the waves flood the skies Story A monk asked Xianglin What is the living meaning of Chan There have been many people with doubts about this there is still news of this around Xianglin said Sitting for a long time one becomes weary When a fish swims through the water is disturbed when a bird flies by feathers fall Better shut that dogs mouth This is difficult to penetrate Commentary Xianglin says Sitting for a long time one becomes weary Un derstand If you do understand you can put down your shield and spear on the hundred grasses If not listen humbly to the verdict When Yunmen was teaching in south China Xianglin came to him from west China He was contemporary with Ehu and Jingqing He first went to Baoci then later came to Yunmen whom he attended for eighteen years He stayed with Yunmen for eighteen years time and again Yunmen would call to him then when he responded Yunmen would say What is it Then no matter how much Xianglin spoke to present his understanding and exercise his mind he never reached accord One day though he suddenly said he understood Later Xianglin returned to western China Master Zhimen was originally from eastern China but made a special trip west to see Xianglin of whose teaching he had heard so much Zhimen was Xuedous teacher Though Yunmen taught innumerable people Xianglins stream flourished most of all among the wayfarers of that generation He taught for forty years living until the age of eighty  Ordinarily he would say Whenever you go traveling to search for teachers you must bring along the eye to distinguish initiate from superficialist to tell shallow from deep Only Xianglin in this story has silenced everyone on earth there is no place for you to calculate or ratio nalize What is the living meaning of Chan Sitting for a long time one becomes weary These could be called flavorless words which choke people and leave no place to breathe out If you would see just see immediately If you dont see avoid entertaining in tellectual interpretations Xianglin had encountered an adept so he possessed Yunmens technique and harmonious mastery of the three statements People often misunderstand and say  The Chan founder came to China and sat facing a wall for nine years isnt this sitting for a long time and becoming weary What is there to hold onto They dont see that Xianglin had attained the realm of great independence and had his feet on the ground of reality without so many theories and views of Buddhism he could meet the situation and act accord ingly As it is said The teaching is carried on according to facts the banner of the teaching is set up according to the situation  Xuedou uses this wind to fan the fire and from his position as a bystander points out one or a half Verse One two a thousand ten thousand Why not practice accordingly Very plentiful why are they congregating into a crowd Strip off the blinders unload the saddle bags From now on you must be purified clean and at ease Can you rest yet Turning to the left turning to the right following up behind You still cant let yourself go Reflections upon reflections echoes upon echoes I strike Zihu had to hit Iron Grindstone Liu He draws his bow after the thief has gone so I strike Danger Commentary ic Xuedou strikes directly like sparks like lightning he pushes it out for you to see which you can do only if you understand imme diately as soon as you hear it mentioned If you can directly and immediately under stand in this way then you are indeed extraordinary One two a thousand ten thousand  Strip off the blinders unload the saddle bags Purified clean and at ease they are not stained by birth and death they are not bound by emotional in terpretations of sanctity and profanity Above theres nothing to look to for support below theres no personal self Theyre just like Xianglin and Xuedou how could there be just a thousand or ten thousand In fact all the people in the world each and every one are all like this The past and future Buddhas are all like this too If you make up intellectual understandings of the words then this is like Zihu had to hit Iron Grindstone Liu In fact as soon as such interpretations are raised Xuedou strikes while you are still speaking Zihu studied under Nanquan along with Zhaozhou and Tiger Cen At that time Iron Grindstone Liu had set up a hut on Mt One day Zihu came to see her Answering the monk who asked about the living meaning of Chan Xianglin said Sitting for a long time one becomes weary  If you understand this way you are turning to the left turning to the right following up behind But tell me what is Xuedous meaning in such a verse Story Emperor Taizong asked National Teacher Huizhong What will you need after a hundred years He scratches before it itches As it turns out hell create a model and draw a likeness though great and vener able he acts this w ayhe shouldnt point to the east as the west The teacher said Build a seamless monument for m e It cant be grasped The emperor said Tell me what would the monu ment look like The teacher was silent after a while he asked Understand  Confined in prison one increases in wisdom After all he points to the east as the west and takes the south for the north All he can do is frown The emperor said I dont understand Lucky he doesnt understand had he pressed further at this time and made the teacher gulp a mouthful of frost hed have gotten somewhere The teacher said I have a succes sor Danyuan who knows all about this Please summon him and ask him Hes lucky the emperor didnt overturn his meditation seat why didnt he give some of his own provisions Dont confuse the man He let the initiative go After the National Teacher passed on What a pity After all the emperor will mistakenly go by the zero point of the scale the emperor summoned Danyuan and asked him what the meaning of this was The son takes up the fathers work He too falls into the second level into the third level Danyuan said South of Xiang north of Tan This too cant be grasped Two by two three by threewhat are you doing Half open half closed Xuedou commented A single hand does not make random sound The blind leading the blind After all he is following the words to produce interpretations Above is the sky below is the earth Ive had no such news This too is creating a model and drawing a likeness Beneath the shadowless tree the community ferry boat Xuedou commented  The sea calm the rivers are clear Vast waves flood the skies This still only amounts to a little bit within the crystal palace theres no one who knows Xuedou commented Hes raised it up He draws his bow after the thief has gone The words are still in our ears Commentary Suzong and Daizong were descendants of Xuanzong When they were princes they were fond of meditation When Suzong came to the throne National Teacher Huizhong was living on White Cliff Mountain Though he did not come down from the mountain for more than forty years word of his practice of the Way reached the imperial precincts In  the emperor Suzong sent an emissary to summon Huizhong to the palace The emperor regarded him as his teacher and honored him greatly Huizhong lectured the emperor on the supreme Way then when he left court the emperor per sonally escorted him The courtiers were angry at this and wanted to make their displeasure known to the emperor But the teacher who could read minds went to the emperor first and said In the presence of Indra I have seen countless emperors evanescent as a flash of lightning  The emperor respected him even more after this There was a certain Chan master once the traveling compan ion of the National Teacher the latter asked the emperor to sum mon him to court But this master did not rise to three imperial summonses and used to criticize the National Teacher for addic tion to fame and fortune and for liking the company of people Huizhong was National Teacher under two emperors father and son Both emperors studied meditation According to the Trans mission o f the Lamp Daizong asked the question in this story Suzong asked about the Ten Body Controller When the National Teachers life was over and he was about to enter Nirvana he took leave of Daizong who asked him what he would need after death It should have been enough to build a monument why did he say to build a seamless monument Many say that the National Teachers not speaking is itself what the monument is like If you understand in this way the whole Chan school will be wiped off the face of the earth If you say keeping silent is it then mutes too must understand Chan An outsider asked the Buddha I dont ask about the spoken or the unspoken The Buddha remained silent The outsider bowed and said in praise The Buddhas great compassion has dispersed the clouds of my delusions and afforded me insight My teacher Wuzu said of the seamless monument In front pearls and agate in back agate and pearls on the east are Avalokitesvara and Mahasthamaprapta on the west are Manjusri and Samantabhadra Now tell me is this I dont understand the same as Emperor Wus I dont know They seem the same but actually theyre not The National Teacher said I have a successor Danyuan who knows all about this Please summon him and ask him about it Putting aside Taizongs not understanding for the moment did Danyuan understand All that was needed was to say What would the monument be like no one in the world can do anything about it Wuzu commented You are teacher of a whole nation why dont you speak instead of deferring to your disciple After the National Teacher died the emperor summoned Danyuan to ask about the meaning of this South of Xiang north of Tan Within theres gold filling the whole country Beneath the shadowless tree the community ferryboat In the crystal palace theres no one who knows i c Danyuan was the National Teachers attendant After he had be come a teacher himself Yangshan came to see him Danyuans words were severe his nature harsh and unapproachable It was impossible to stay there so Yangshan went to Chan master Xingkong  Xingkong then called to Yangshan Novice drag this corpse out of here Later Yangshan took this up with Danyuan and asked How can one get the man out of the w ell Danyuan said Tsk Who is in the w ell Yangshan didnt understand later he asked Guishan who immediately called Yangshan by name He said At Danyuans I attained the essence at Guishans I attained the function  As for this little verse of Danyuans it has led many people into false interpretations Therein is the seamless monument so the verse says theres gold within filling the country Beneath the shadowless tree the community ferryboat is the interchange between the teacher and the emperor The emperor didnt understand so the verse says Inside the crystal palace theres no one who knows  Also some say the first line means south of Xiang province and north of Tan province In between theres gold filling the country they say praises the emperor As for Xuedous four comments how will you understand them People today dont know the ancients meaning How do you un derstand south of Xiang north of Tan How do you understand within theres gold filling the nation How do you understand beneath the shadowless tree the community ferryboat How do you understand within the crystal palace theres no one who knows If you can see thus you will be joyful and happy all your life South of Xiang north of Tan Xuedou says A single hand does not make a random sound He couldnt but explain for you  Inside the crystal palace theres no one who knows Xuedou says Hes raised it He has explained for you all at once but nevertheless its hard to see Having clearly made all his comments afterward he simply eulogizes the seamless monument A clear pool does not admit the blue dragons coils Great waves vast gigantic Where will the blue dragon coil Here it just cannot be found Layers upon layers Shadows upon shadows The whole body is an eye You fall into sevens and eights Two by two three by three walking the old road turning to the left turning to the right following up behind For ever and ever it is shown to people How will blind people see Can you catch a glimpse Commentary a Right off Xuedou says  The seamless monumentto see it is hard Though it stands uniquely revealed with nothing hidden when you want to see it its hard to see Xuedou is very compassionate and tells you more A clear pool does not admit the blue dragons coils Wuzu said In Xuedous whole volume of poems on old stories I just like the line A clear pool does not admit the blue dragons coils  Yet this is still a little Has it not been said  Reclining dragons are not to be seen in stagnant water Where they are not theres moonlight and the ripples are settled where they are waves arise without wind Also it is said Reclining dragons always fear the blue pools clarity As for Xuedou even if huge waves flooded the sky he still would not coil up in there Getting to this Xuedous verse is finished Afterwards he ap plies a little bit of eye and carves a seamless monument Follow ing up behind he says  Layers upon layers  Shadows upon shadows  For ever and ever it is shown to people How will you look upon it Where is it right now Even if you see it clearly dont make the mistake of sticking by the zero point of the scale Introduction When a single particle arises the whole earth is contained therein when a single flower blooms the world emerges So it is said Its like cutting a skein of thread when one strand is cut all are cut Its like dying a skein of thread when one strand is dyed all are dyed  This very moment you should cut off all com plications Bring out your own family jewels and respond every where high and low before and after without missing Each and every one will be fully manifest Story Whenever anything was asked Master Judi would just raise one finger This old fellow too would silence everyone on earth When its warm all heaven and earth are warm when its cold all heaven and earth are cold He snatches away the tongues of everyone on earth Commentary If you understand at the finger you turn away from Judi if you dont understand at the finger its like cast iron So it is said As soon as a single particle arises the whole earth is contained therein when a single flower blooms the world comes into being If you know its not worth taking hold of if not it blocks you completely Master Judi was from eastern China When he was living in a hermitage a nun named Shiji came to his hut When she got there she went straight in without taking off her hat she walked around his meditation seat thrice holding her staff  If you can speak she said Ill take off my hat She questioned him three times but Judi had no reply Then as she was leaving Judi said Its latewould you stay the night The nun said If you can speak Ill stay Again Judi had no reply The nun then walked out He meant to leave his hermitage to go in search of a teacher but that night after he had prepared his bindle the spirit of the moun tain told him You dont have to leave tomorrow a living saint will come and teach you  As it turned out the next day Master Tianlong actually came Judi welcomed him and gave a full account of the previous events Tianlong just lifted up one finger to show him suddenly Judi was greatly enlightened Later whenever anything was asked he just raised a finger Changqing said Delicious food is not for the satisfied one to eat Xuansha said Had I seen him then Id have broken the finger off  Xuanjue said When Xuansha spoke this way what did he m ean Yunju Xi said When Xuansha spoke this way was he agreeing with Judi or not If he agreed why did he speak of breaking off the finger If not where was Judis error  Caoshan said Judis realization was crude he only recognized one device one perspective Why was his realization crude If he wasnt enlightened how could he say he used onefinger Chan all his life without exhausting it Where is Caoshans meaning At that time Judi actually didnt understand If you understand it as a finger you definitely wont see the ancients meaning This kind of Chan is easy to approach but hard to under stand People these days who just hold up a finger or a fist as soon as theyre questioned are just fooling around It is necessary to pierce the bone penetrate the marrow and see all the way through At Judis hermitage there was a servant boy While he was away from the hermitage he was asked what method his master used to teach people the boy held up a finger When he returned he told the master of this Judi cut off the boys finger with a knife As the boy ran out screaming Judi called to him when the boy looked back Judi raised his finger at which the boy opened up to understanding Tell me what truth did he see When nearing death Judi said I attained Tianlongs one finger Chan and have used it all my life without exhausting it Do you want to understand Mingjiao later asked Guotai Shen An ancient said Judi just recited a threeline spell and thereby became more famous than anyone else How can you quote the threeline spell for someone Shen raised a finger Minjiao said If not for today how could I know this borderlands traveler What does this mean The Earthbeater would just hit the ground once whenever anything was asked Once someone hid his staff and then asked What is the Buddha He just opened his mouth wide These methods too were used for a whole lifetime without being exhausted He transmitted only the mind seal to instruct those on the paths of illusion Those who attain it do so regardless of ignorance or knowledge worldli ness or holiness Anyone with power will immediately rest right this moment and abruptly still all entanglements thus passing beyond the stream of birth and death and going far beyond the usual patterns Even if you have family and estate it is attained naturally without ambition All his life to every question Wuye would say  Dont think falsely  Generally people these days are not this way they just in dulge in conceptual and emotional interpretations and dont un derstand the essential point of the ancients Why did he just employ one finger You must realize that here is where Judi helps people so profoundly and intimately Go back to Yuanmings saying When its cold all throughout heaven and earth is cold when its warm all throughout heaven and earth is warm  Mountains rivers and earth myriad forms and appear ances above and below are one solitary sheer unity where will you find one finger Chan Verse For his appropriate teaching I deeply admire old Judi A leper drags along his companions Only those on the same path know Two threetheres still one more He too should be struck dead Having cast a piece of driftwood onto the ocean Its all this So it is but its too inaccessible Worn out sandals what use does it have Together in the night waves we take in blind turtles When we take them in what are they good for We act according to what is imperative Ill drive them toward a world where there is no Buddha He especially likes to make up verses for obscure and unusual stories Thus he says For his appropriate teaching I deeply admire old Judi Since the universe began who else has there ever been Had it been anyone else inevitably hed have been inconsistent only Judi just used one finger till he died People often interpret this wrongly and say Mountains riv ers and earth are empty people are empty the Dharma is empty too Even if the universe were emptied out all at once its just this one old Judi This has nothing to do with it Having cast a piece of driftwood onto the ocean Nowadays they call this the ocean of birth and death Within the ocean of doing beings appear and disappear without understanding them selves without hope of getting out Old Judi extends his mercy to take people in in the ocean of birth and death he uses one figure to rescue others Its like setting down a piece of driftwood to res cue a blind turtle He enables all beings to reach the other shore  Together in the night we take in blind turtles The Lotus Sutra says Its like a oneeyed turtle sticking its nose through a hole in a floating boardit wont sink and drown When a great teacher receives someone who is like a dragon or a tiger he directs him to a world where there is a Buddha to act in turn as guest and host and to a world where there is no Buddha to occupy the essen tial way across Having taken in a blind turtle what use is it Introduction Piled in mountains heaped in ranges up against walls pressed against barriers if you linger in thought holding back your po tential youll be bitterly cramped Or else someone may appear and overturn the ocean kick over the polar mountain scatter the white clouds with shouts break up space and straightaway with one device one object silence everyone on earth so that there is no way for you to approach Story i b Longya asked Cuiwei What is the living meaning of Chan Its an old tale known everywhere but still he wants to put it to the test Cuiwei said Pass me the meditation brace What will he use the meditation brace for Just about let go Danger Longya gave Cuiwei the brace He cant hold onto it Given a fine steed he doesnt know how to ride it What a pity that he doesnt take charge right away Cuiwei took it and hit him Got him Theyre buried in the same pit Longya handed Linji the cushion As before he cant hold onto it as before hes not very clever Got him What a pity to be hitting this kind of dead man Linji comes out of the same pattern as Cuiwei Longya said Hit me if you will but theres no meaning of Chan Obvi ously He draws his bow after the thief is gone C om m en ta ry Master Cuiyan Zhi said It was so at that time but do Chan prac titioners these days still have blood under their skin Guishan Zhe said Cuiwei and Linji can be called genuine Chan masters Longya was pulling out the weeds seeking the Way like everyone and indeed he can serve as a model for people of later times After he became a teacher a monk asked Did you agree with those two adepts at that tim e Longya said I agreed as far as agreement goes its just that theres no meaning of Chan Longya looks carefully in front and behind and dispenses medi cine to suit the disease I however am not this way when asked whether Longya had agreed with the two adepts whether he un derstood or not I would have brought my staff down across the questioners back This not only supports Cuiwei and Linji but also doesnt turn away from the questioner Shimen Cong said Longya is still all right if theres no one to press him but when hes pressed by a Chan practitioner he loses one eye Xuedou said Linji and Cuiwei only knew how to hold still not how to let go Once hes clear hes clear why then is there no meaning of Chan Understand On the staff there is an eye bright as the sun to tell whether gold is real see it in fire Linji and Cuiwei may have beaten the wind and hit the rain startled heaven and shaken the earth but they have never really hit a cleareyed person c When the ancients studied Chan they suffered some pains having established powerful resolve they would traverse moun tains and rivers to call on adepts First Longya met Cuiwei and Linji later he saw Deshan There he asked How is it when a student holding a sharp sword tries to take the teachers head Deshan stretched out his neck and uttered a grunt Longya said The teachers head has fallen  Deshan smiled and said nothing Next Longya went to Dongshan Then he burned incense and bowed in the direction of Deshan to repent When he heard this Deshan said Old Dongshan cant tell good from bad this fellow has been dead so long whats the use of saving him Let him wander over the earth carrying my head Longya was basically intelligent and acute We can say that his words were not spoken in vain that his effort was not expended haphazardly they issued from this doing his work When Wuxie went to see Shitou he had told himself that he would stay if there was accord at the first word but otherwise would leave Shitou just sat there Wuxie left Shitou knew that Wuxie was a vessel of truth so he had extended his teaching to him but Wuxie didnt understand and left When Magu came to Changqing he walked around the medi tation seat thrice shook his staff and stood there Changqing said Right right He also went to Nanquan and again circled thrice shook his staff and stood there Nanquan said Wrong wrong  Nanquan said Changqing is right it is you who are wrong Inevitably the ancients had to take up this one matter and penetrate it People today when questioned are found not to have made the slightest effort theyre this way today and theyll be this way tomorrow too If you just keep on like this you will never have a day of completion Observe Longya coming out with one question on the living meaning of Chan And it wont do to say Longya didnt understand for why then would he pass the brace to Cuiwei He didnt go to the living water to act but went into dead water for sustenance Acting as master throughout he said  Hit me if you will but theres no meaning of Chan Longya also called on Linji and asked the same question Linji said Pass me the cushion When Longya gave it to him he took it and hit him You must realize that each word each phrase of the ancients was not uttered at random Later when Longya was teaching a monk asked Did you agree with those two adepts back then Longya said As far as agreement goes I agreed but there is no meaning of Chan  There are thorns in the soft mud If you understand this way you fall into the realm of noth ingness Therefore Yuanmi said You must study the living word not the dead word If you can understand at the living word you will never forget it if you understand at the dead word you wont even be able to save yourself  When Longya spoke this way he had undeniably done his best An ancient said Continuity is very difficult The ancients did not speak at random before and after mutually illuminating with both temporal and real with both perception and function guest and host were clear interchanging vertically and horizontally If you want to discern the inside story since Longya was not ignorant of the fundamental vehicle how could he have fallen into second place At the time when the two adepts asked for the brace and cushion Longya could not but have known their intention Even so nonetheless his use of it was too extreme Longya asked this way and the two elders answered this way why then is there no meaning of Chan When you get here you must know theres something else extraordinary Verse In Dragon Tusk Mountain the dragon has no eyes Blind Other people may be fooled  This is washing dirt in mud Everyone on earth knows When has stagnant water ever displayed the ancient b way Should it suddenly come to life nothing can be done He drags in everyone on earth so that they cant come forth If you cant use the meditation brace and cushion Who would you have say this What do you want to do with the brace and cushion Ignoramus dont entertain such views Commentary Xuedou settles the case according to the facts Though he versifies this way tell me where is his meaning Where does the dragon lack eyes Where is he in stagnant water At this point you need the power to transform and pass through That is why it is said In a clear pool theres no place for the blue dragon to coil Has there ever been a fierce dragon in stagnant water Havent you heard it said Stagnant water cannot conceal a dragon If it is a live dragon it must go where huge waves flood the skies This is to say that Longya went into stagnant water and was hit by the others Clearly Longya has been given a fine steed its just that he doesnt know how to ride it that he is unable to make use of it Lu is the sixth patriarch this is wrong Xuedou has called himself Mr Lu before in a verse called Anonymous Bequest I saw its picture that year and loved Dongting In the waves seventytwo peaks of blue Now resting on high I think back to what was before To the picture Ive added Mr Lu leaning against a wall Xuedou wanted to walk on Longyas head but he still feared that people would misunderstand so he made up another verse to cut away peoples doubtful interpretations Verse Since this old fellow couldnt yet put an end to it again he makes a verse Obviously How many people would know He knew himself that he had gotten only a half luckily he has a final word Once Mr Lu has accepted them why depend on them Even if you search the whole world such a person is hard to find Who would you have comprehend your words Sitting leaningcease taking these to continue the lamp of Chan He sits under the black mountain Hes fallen into a ghost cave Its worth replying the evening clouds returning have not yet come together One a half Bring it up and already youre wrong After all he cant get out Distant mountains without end layer upon layer of blue They block your eyes and ears Sunk in a deep pit Study for thirty more years Commentary Once Mr Lu has accepted them why depend on them What is there to depend on Then what more need is there for some thing to rely on Whether sitting or leaning on the brace its not worth considering it the principle of Buddhism That is why Xuedou says Sitting leaningcease taking these to continue the lamp of Chan At once Xuedou has brought it up completely he has room to turn around and at the end he reveals this scene where theres a bit of a nice place the evening clouds returning have not yet come to gether Where is Xuedous meaning When the evening clouds have returned and are about to join together but have not yet done so how is it then  Distant mountains without end layer upon layer of blue As before hes gone into a ghost cave Dis tant mountains without end layer upon layer of blue Tell me is this Manjusris realm Is it Samantabhadras realm Is it Avalokitesvaras realm When you get here whose affair is this c Lotus Flower Lotus Leaves Introduction Setting up the banner of the teaching establishing the essential message this is adding flowers to brocade If you can discern the statement outside of patterns then when one part is raised you understand the rest Story A monk asked Zhimen How is it when the lotus flower has not yet emerged from the water The hook is in an unsuspected place Washing dirt in mud How did he get this news Zhimen said A lotus flower One two three four five six seven He stumps everyone on earth The monk said What about after it has emerged from the water Dont go in a ghost cave to live Two heads three faces He kills everyone on earth with laughter Commentary In treating people according to potential Zhimen has attained a little when it comes to cutting off all streams hes a million miles away If you can see thus Ill grant youve gained access None theless if you say its the same you confuse Buddha nature and cloud thusness If you say its different mind and objects are not yet forgotten and you descend to travel the road of intellectual interpretationwhen will you ever cease Tell me what does the ancient mean In reality there arent so many things So Touzi said Just dont stick to names and words classification and phrasing There is then no multiplicity of gradations of differences you take in all things but all things wont be able to take you in Fundamentally there is no gain or loss no illusions or dreams no multiplicity of names Since you ask questions therefore I say something If you didnt ask what could you have me say that would be right All concerns are what you take upnone of it is any of my business An ancient said  If you want to know the meaning of the Bud dha nature you must observe time and condition Yunmen cited this story a monk asked Lingyun  How was it before the Buddha appeared in the world Lingyun raised his whisk Yunmen said The first time he hit the second time he missed He also said With out speaking of appearing or not appearing where would there be the time of his asking With each answer to each question the ancients accorded with the time and situation without a multitude of concerns If you pursue words and follow phrases there will never be any connec tion If in words you can penetrate through words if in meanings you can pass through meanings if within devices you can pen etrate the devices and if you make yourself free only then will you see the point of Zhimens answer There is no right or wrong no gain or loss no born or not born  Here the ancients laid down one path where theres an entrance and an exit One who hasnt yet understood gropes and clings if you make him let go then he goes into a state of wild desolation This monk asked  How is it when the lotus flower has not yet emerged from the water Zhimen said A lotus flower Havent you heard how Yantou said I always appreciate it when nothing has been saidthat is getting somewhere i b Where Zhimen revealed his mind he was already leaking Students these days dont wake up to the ancients meaning they just go on talking theoretically of emerged from the water and not yet emerged from the water What connection is there A monk asked Zhimen What is the body of wisdom He said An oyster swallowing the moon The monk asked What is the functioning of wisdom  Zhimen said A rabbit becomes pregnant See him responding like this no one on earth can search out the stream of his words If someone asked me how it is when the lotus flower hasnt emerged from the water I would just answer  The pillars and lamps Is this the same as the lotus flower or different And dont mistakenly stick by the zero point of the scale Lotus flower lotus leaveshe reports for you to know Doting kindness An obvious issue Its pattern is already revealed How can emerging from the water compare to before emergence Washing dirt in mud Dividing them is all right but you cant lump them together North of the river south of the river ask Old Wang Where is the master Why ask Old Master Wang Youre just wearing out your shoes Foxy doubt after foxy doubt I bury them in one pit Its you who doubt You wont avoid feelings of doubt without respite Xuedou was Zhimens true successor he saw well Zhimens most hidden most subtle point and said directly Lotus flower lotus leaveshe reports for you to know  How can emerging from the water compare to before emergence Here he wants people to understand directly I say how is it when it hasnt emergedthe pillars and lamps What about after its emergedthe staff upholds the sun and moon underfoot how muddy and deep But dont mistakenly abide by the zero point of the scale What limit is there to people these days chewing over the words and phrases of others Tell me when it emerges from the water what time is this Before emergence what time is this If you can see to this point Ill allow that youve seen Zhimen personally Xuedou says if you dont see North of the river south of the river ask Old Wang Xuedou means that you should just go north and south to ask adepts about emerged from the water and not emerged from the water If you add two phrases south of the river add two phrases north of the river add one load upon an other load creating doubts over and over just tell me when will you be free of doubt Youre like wild foxes full of doubt walking on river ice They listen for the sound of the water if there is no sound they can cross the river If students have foxy doubt after foxy doubt when will they attain peace Introduction Reality is infinitely vast yet minute as an atomic particle Whether to hold on or let go is not up to another whether to roll up or roll out is up to oneself If you want to free what is stuck and loose what is bound you simply must cut away the traces and swallow the sounds All people occupy the essential crossing point each towers like a milehigh wall Tell me whose realm is this Story c Xuefeng said to the assembly On South Mountain theres a turtle nosed snake Indeed it causes people to doubt All of you must take a good look Aha A case of overindulgence Changqing said In the hall today there certainly are people losing their lives  A man from the land of brig ands escorts a bandit He judges others on the basis of himself A monk related this to Xuansha Theres no different dirt in the same pit When the manservant sees the maidservant he takes care Those with the same disease sympathize with each other Xuansha said Only Changqing can be like this Nonetheless I do not concur He doesnt avoid forming a wild fox spirit view What news is this His poison breath afflicts others The monk asked What about you Xuansha said Why use South Mountain Only this wild fox spirit has attained a little Hes lost his life and doesnt even realize it Yunmen threw his staff down in front of Xuefeng and made a gesture of fright One son has intimately attained All of them are doing mental gymnastics All of you try to discern this Commentary If you spread it out evenly I let you spread it out evenly if you break it up I let you break it up Xuefeng traveled with Yantou and Qinshan In all he went to Touzi thrice and Dongshan nine times One day he went with Yantou to visit Qinshan On the way they were snowed in on Tortoise Mountain Day after day Yantou just slept while Xuefeng constantly sat in meditation Yantou yelled at him and said Get some sleep Every day youre on the meditation seat just like a clay statue in a village He prostrated himself crying out again and again Today on Tor toise Mountain Ive finally achieved enlightenment Later Xuefeng lived on Elephant Bone Mountain in Fukien Human life so fleeting is but a brief instant How can you dwell for long in the evanescent world At thirtytwo I emerged from the mountains Now over forty I return to Fukien I humbly report to the scarlet and purple clad nobles who fill the court The king of death has no awe of the golden emblems of rank you wear Usually Xuefeng would teach by saying In every respect cover the universe He talked no more of mystery or marvel nor of mind or nature He appeared striking unique like a great fiery mass approach and he burns off your face Like a sharp sword fool around with him and you lose your life If you linger in thought holding back your potential you lose contact Baizhang asked Huangbo Where are you coming from  Huangbo said Ive been at the foot of the mountain picking mush rooms Baizhang said See any tigers Huangbo roared like a tiger Baizhang picked up an axe and made a chopping gesture Huangbo slapped him Baizhang chuckled and went back and told the group Theres a tiger on the mountain all of you should watch out for him Today I myself got bitten Whenever Zhaozhou saw a monk right away he would say Have you ever been here Whether the monk said he had or hadnt Zhaozhou would say Go have some tea  The temple over seer asked You always ask monks if theyve been here or not then always tell them to go have tea  On the gate at Zihu was a sign that said At Zihu theres a dog These stories are just like Xuefengs saying On South Moun tain theres a turtlenosed snake all of you should watch it care fully At such a time how would you reply See how Xuefeng teaches this way without speaking to you of practice or understanding Can you figure him out by means of intellectual discrimination This is why an ancient said On hearing words you must understand the source dont set up pri vate rules Words must have that which is beyond patterns state ments must penetrate the barrier If your words are no more than clichs you fall into a sea of poison Xuefengs teaching this way can be called flavorless talk that chokes people What about On South Mountain theres a turtlenosed snake Here you must have the allpervasive eye to understand Beating the drum strumming the lute Two men of understanding meet Yunmen is able to harmonize  Changqing knows how to follow his vagaries The ancient song has no rhyme South Mountains turtlenosed snake Who knows this meaning Truly its Xuansha When Changqing replied as he did what was his meaning To get here you must be like lightning to reach If theres anything you cant clear away you cant reach his depths Its a pity that people mostly make intellectual interpretations of Changqings words They say As soon as something is heard in the hall this is losing ones life Some say Fundamentally theres nothing at all to say this kind of thing out of the blue makes people doubt People hear him say theres a turtlenosed snake on South Mountain and immediately doubt If you understand in such ways you have no contact you just go on living on the words Later a monk related this to Xuansha  Observe how in Xuanshas words there is a place where he manifests his being He said Why use South Mountain  If it hadnt been Xuansha it would have been very difficult to reply When Xuefeng speaks this way On South Mountain theres a turtlenosed snake tell me where is it To get here you must be a transcendent person only then will you be able to understand such talk An ancient said Xuansha the fisherman doesnt like South Mountain he likes the turtlenosed snake Then we get to Yunmen he threw his staff down in front of Xuefeng making a gesture of fright Yunmen has the ability to handle snakes and doesnt run afoul of the sharp point He strikes home in light and strikes home in darkness too As he helps people its always like doing a sword dance sometimes he flies onto peoples c eyebrows and eyelashes sometimes he flies three thousand miles away and snatches peoples heads His throwing down his staff and making a gesture of frightisnt this giving play to his spirit Doesnt he lose his life too Verse Elephant Bone Cliff is so high no one reaches it A thousand ten thousand search but cannot find Its not your realm Those who get there must be master snake handlers This is a spirit recognizing a spirit a thief recognizing a thief Why gather in crowds Still you must be of the same group to make it Changqing and Xuansha cant do anything Their crimes are listed on the same indictment They passed up the first move How many lose their lives A crime is not judged twice He drags in common people Yunmen knows Hes still just attained a little This old guy has just one eye The old guy is just being clever Again he searches the weeds Hes fallen in the weeds whats the use I strike South north east west no place to search Suddenly he thrusts out his staff And throws it down before Xuefeng its mouth wide open Even if it swallows a thousand ten thousand what is accomplished No one on earth can find it The gaping mouth is like a lightning flash Raise your eyebrows and you wont see Search all over the land for such a person and still its hard to find one Right now where is it Right now its hidden here on this mountain Wheres it gone Even the great Xuedou acts this way too Today I have been bitten Those who come one by one observe expedient methods Hes shot an arrow Xuedou shouted and said Look right where you are He draws his bow after the thief has gone Secondary tertiary Repeated words are not worth listening to Commentary Elephant Bone Cliff is so high no one reaches it  Those who get there must be master snake handlers Elephant Bone Cliff is Xuefengs mountain Still this turtlenosed snake is unavoidably hard to handle you must know how to handle it before you can do so Conversely if you dont know how to handle it youll be bitten by the snake Wuzu said With this turtlenosed snake you must have the abil ity not to get your hands or legs bitten When Xuedou says that they couldnt handle it people often say they couldnt do anything about it so Xuedou only praises Yunmen But this has nothing to do with it They dont know that there is no gain or loss in the ability of these three men its just that there is far and near Now I ask you where is it that Changqing and Xuansha couldnt manage ia How many lose their lives This praises Changqings saying In the hall today there certainly are people who lose their lives  To get here first you must be thoroughly versed in snake handling Xuedou says Yunmen knows  Again he searches the weeds Since Yunmen knew the meaning of Xuefengs saying On South Mountain theres a turtlenosed snake  therefore Again he searches through the weeds He says South north east west no place to search You tell me where the snake is Suddenly he thrusts out his staff All along the snake has been right here But dont go to the staff for sustenance Yunmen threw his staff down in front of Xuefeng with a gesture of fright thus he used his staff as the snake Once though he said  The staff has changed into a dragon and swal lowed the universe where are mountains rivers and earth to be found Just this one staffsometimes its a dragon sometimes its a snake Why is it like this Only when you get here will you know as an ancient said Mind revolves along with myriad phe nomena the turning point is truly mysterious The verse says He throws it down before Xuefeng its mouth open wide  The gaping mouth is like a lightning flash Xuedou has extra talent he picks up Yunmens poisonous snake and says this gaping mouth is like a flash of lightninghesitate and you lose your life  Raise your eyebrows and you wont see Where has it gone His verse finished Xuedou must go to a living place to help others he takes Xuefengs snake and picks it up and sports with it himself Indeed he kills and brings life in accord with the occasion Do you want to see He says Right now its hidden here on this mountain  Those who come one by one observe expedient meth ods Xuedou is still too subtle he doesnt say Use it right away but instead shouts and says Look right where you are Since ancient times how many people have picked up the snake and sported with it Tell me has the snake ever wounded anyone or not the Peak of Wonder Introduction Jewels are tested with fire and gold is tested with a stone a sword is tested with a hair and water is tested with a pole Story Once when Baofu and Changqing were walking in the mountains Baofu pointed and said i   b Right here is the peak of wonder  He raises a pile of bones on level ground Just avoid speaking of it Dig a hole and bury it deep Chang qing said Indeed it is What a pity If you dont have iron eyes you probably be confused Those with the same illness sympathize with each other Both are buried in the same pit Xuedou said What is the purpose of roaming the mountains together today Xuedou indeed diminishes peoples worth Heres another clouddwelling saint Later this dialogue was quoted to Jingqing Theres good theres bad Jingqing said If not for Changqing you would have seen skulls covering the fields Only those on the same road know The earth is so vast and desolate it kills people with sadness When the manservant sees the maidservant he takes care Even if Linji and Deshan appeared they too would have to take a beating Commentary Baofu Changqing and Jingqing were all heirs of Xuefeng these three attained alike realized alike saw alike heard alike picked up alike used alike Going in and out they parleyed back and forth one after the other As they were of the same lineage as soon as one raised something the others knew what it came down to In Xuefengs group it was these three who always engaged in questioning and answering When Baofu acted thus he wanted to test whether Changqing had eyes or not What a pity But what did he mean by this You cant always go on this way Rare are those who are completely free though there are those who seem so Xuedou said What is the purpose of roaming the mountains together today What does this refer to He also said Hundreds and thousands of years hence I dont say there will be none just that they will be few Xuedou knows how to point to himself This is like Huangbos saying I dont say there is no Chan just that there are no teachers Xuedou is also indeed strict in speaking thus This is called an added com ment it comes down on both sides yet doesnt remain on either side Later this was quoted to Jingqing He said If not for Chang qing you would have seen skulls covering the fields  A monk asked Zhaozhou What is the lone summit of the peak of wonder  In a scripture it says the monk MeghasrI always stayed on the lone summit of the peak of wonder he never came down from the mountain Sudhana went to see him and searched for seven days without finding him Then one day they met on a separate peak When he had seen him Meghasri explained for Sudhana that the world is a moment of thought and that the wisdom and illumina tion of all Buddhas is the door to truth that appears everywhere Given that Meghasri never came down from the mountain why did they meet on a separate peak You may say that Meghasri must have come down from the mountain yet the scripture says he never did that he was always on the solitary summit of the peak of wonder The lone summit of the peak of wonder Is the teaching of uniform equanimity Where theres no gain and no loss No affirmation and no negation There it stands alone revealed Therefore Sudhana couldnt see him When you get to the point of merging with nature its like the eye not seeing itself the ear not hearing itself the finger not feeling itself a sword not cutting itself fire not burning itself water not washing itself So it is said  The Buddhas have not appeared in the world nor is there any Nirvana They manifest such things as expedient means to rescue beings But tell me in the end how will you avoid Jingqing and Xuedou talking as they did Had they been unable to clap in unison then that would have been why the skulls of all the people on earth cover the fields Changqing comes up with this testimony and both Baofu and Changqing use it this way Afterwards Xuedou comes out with a verse more brilliant yet Verse On the lone summit of the peak of wonder weeds grow profusely You lose your body too The weeds are already several yards deep right where you stand Clearly it is brought upto be given to whom No one on earth knows A dry turd what is it good for You got your nostrils but lost your mouth If not for Changqing discerning the real point Wrong Watch the arrow Hes caught the thief without even realizing it Skulls would cover the ground but how many people would know They wont live again Theyre extremely numerous You got the nostrils but lost the mouth Commentary On the lone summit of the peak of wonder weeds grow profusely If you roll around in the weeds when will you ever have done Clearly it is brought upto be given to whom Where is the clarity This praises Baofu saying Right here is the summit of the peak of wonder  If not for Changqing discerning the real point  What truth did Changqing see that he could say So it is As for Skulls would cover the ground but how many people would know do you people know G uishan and Iron Grindstone Liu Introduction Stand on the summit of the highest peak and demons and outsid ers cannot know you walk on the bottom of the deepest sea and even the Buddhas eye cannot catch the sight of you Even if your eyes are like shooting stars and your intellect like lightning still you wont avoid being like the sacred tortoise dragging its tail Story Iron Grindstone Liu went to Guishan Surely itll be hard to stay there This old lady doesnt keep to her place Guishan said Old cow so youve come  Check Tai are you going The arrow is not shot to no purpose In China they beat the drum in Korea they dance The letting go was too fast the gathering in is too slow Guishan lay down The arrow struck home Where do you see Guishan Who realizes that in the faroff misty waves there is another more ex cellent realm of thought Liu immediately left Shes gone She saw the opportunity and acted Commentary The nun Iron Grindstone Liu was like sparks like lightning hesi tate and you lose your life In the path of Chan if you get to the most essential point where are there so many things This meet ing of adepts is like seeing horns on the other side of the wall and immediately knowing theres an ox there like seeing smoke on the other side of a mountain and immediately knowing theres a fire When pushed they move when pressed they turn about On my left flank five words will be written A Guishan monk me Would it be right then to call it a Guishan monk or would it be right to call it a buffalo When people these days are questioned about this they are stumped and cant explain Iron Grindstone Liu had studied for a long time her active edge was sharp and dangerous People called her Iron Grindstone Liu She built a hut a few miles from Guishan One day she went to see Guishan When he saw her he said Old cow so youve come She said  Tomorrow theres a communal feast on Mt Tai are you going Guishan lay down and Liu left Lookthrough out they seemed to be conversing but this is not Chan Can it be understood by calling it nothing Guishan is over six hundred miles from Mt Tai how did Liu want to have Guishan go to the feast What did she mean People now can be poked thrice and not turn their heads but this woman couldnt be fooled one bit By no means is this an emo tional view based on mundane truth like a clear mirror like a jewel in the hand when a foreigner comes a foreigner is reflected and when a native comes a native is reflected Its because she knows there is something transcendent that she acts like this Right now you are content to understand this as nothing Master Wuzu said Dont take something as nothing time and again nothing is reified into something In the GuiYang tradition this is called merg ing of perspectives As the grass stirs in the wind one compre hends the whole picturethis is called a bodyblock expression the meaning is conveyed but the words obstruct Verse Once riding an iron horse she entered the fortress An adept accustomed to battle Beyond the borders is the generals place Shes fully equipped The edict comes down reporting the six states are cleared A dog carries the amnesty in its mouth In the heart of the realm is the emperors place What about the sea being calm the rivers clear Still holding the golden whip she questions the returning traveler W hats the news Two people are supported by a single staff They call to each other going together and coming together In the depths of the night who will go along to walk the royal road Tell me why go Commentary Xuedous verses are universally considered the best of their kind Among the hundred verses this one is the most logical the most marvelously arrayed and clearly set out Once riding an iron horse she entered the fortress  This refers to Iron Grindstone Liu coming as she did to Guishan The edict comes down reporting that the six states are cleared This refers to the way Guishan questioned her Still holding the golden whip she questions the returning traveler This refers to Liu saying Tomorrow theres a feast on Mt  In the depths of the night who will go along to walk the royal road This refers to Guishan lying down and Liu leaving Xuedou has such ability where they hurry he eulogizes their hurrying and where they are easygoing he eulogizes their ease Standing on the summit of the highest peak Unknown to demons and outsiders Walking on the bottom of the deepest sea Unseen even by the Buddhas eyes The meaning of Xuedous verse is most excellent Had he not the same attainment the same realization how could he be capable of thisOnce riding an iron horse she entered the fortress  But say what meaning was realized A monk asked Fengxue When Guishan said Old cow so youve come what did he m ean Fengxue said In the depths of the white clouds the golden dragon leaps The monk asked When Iron Grindstone Liu said Tomorrow theres a communal feast on Mt Tai are you going what did she mean Fengxue said  In the heart of the blue waves the jade rabbit bolts  The monk asked When Guishan lay down what did he mean Fengxue said Old and worn out decrepit and lazy days without concern lying idly deep in sleep facing the green mountains  This is the same mean ing as Xuedous If your words do not startle the crowd you fall into the streams of the commonplace If you can distinguish initiate from noninitiate instantly and can decide between killing and enliven ing in a flash then you can occupy the ten directions and tower like a milehigh wall But do you know such a time exists Story The hermit of Lotus Blossom Peak held up his staff and showed it to his group saying Look He has one eye on his forehead Still this is a clich for people these days When the ancients got here why didnt they consent to stay here You cant drive stakes into space The hermit provisionally sets up a magic city There was no answer A thousand myriad extremely many Theyve attained a little though What a pity Swift falcons on a roost so he him self replied  Because they did not gain strength on the road If you discern this on the road youll still be struggling for half a months journey Even if you gain strength whats it good for How could there be none at all He also said In the end how is it Myriad people are sitting right here Among a myriad one or two will understand Again he answered himself  My staff across my shoulder I pay no heed to people I go straight into the myriad peaks Still he deserves a beating because he only sees one side If you see jowls on the back of his head dont go along with him Commentary Can you judge the hermit His feet still arent on the ground He lived in a hut on Lotus Blossom Peak on Mt Tiantai They would impart a turning word to repay their debt to the enlightened ones and transmit the stamp of the awakened mind As soon as he saw a monk coming the hermit would hold up his staff and say When the ancients got here why didnt they con sent to stay here For over twenty years no one could answer If you know his snare it isnt worth taking hold of Now tell me why did he ask this question for twenty years Since this is the action of a Chan master why did he just keep to one peg If you can see here naturally you wont be running in the dust of sense objects During the course of twenty years there were quite a few people who presented their views to the hermit trying all their clever devices Moreover though this matter is not in words if not for words it couldnt be distinguished As it is said There is basically no word for the Way but we use words to reveal the Way The ancient spoke a word for no other purpose than to see whether or not you know what is When did he ever lose the essential The ancient Shitou said  Hearing words understand the source dont set up private rules  When people these days bump into it they think thats enough When they come before an adept the adept uses the three essential sealssealing space sealing water sealing mudto test them If you dont meet such a person keep it to yourself for the time being Now I ask you the staff is something Chan monks ordinarily use why does the hermit say they didnt gain strength on the road Why does he say that when the ancients got here they didnt consent to stay In truth though gold dust is precious in the eyes it blinds When Shandao was laicized in the persecution of  he would show his staff to people and say All the Buddhas of the past are thus all the Buddhas of the future are thus all the Buddhas of the present are thus  ib One day Xuefeng held up his staff before his group and said  This one is just for people of medium and low faculties A monk came forward and asked If you should meet someone of the high est potential then what Xeufeng picked up his staff and left  A monk asked How would you do it  Yunmen hit him Whenever you study and question there arent so many things Outside you see mountains rivers and earth there within you see perception and cognition there above you see Buddhas to seek below you see beings to save you must simply spit them all out at once and afterwards fuse all into one at all times Then though you be on the tip of a hair its as broad as the universe though you be in a boiling cauldron or furnace coals its like being in the land of peace and happiness though you dwell amid jewels and treasures its like being in a thatch hut And tell me what place is he pointing to as his whereabouts Undeniably there are eyes in his words but his meaning is outside the words He gets up by himself falls down by himself he lets go by himself gathers up by himself Once when met a monk on the road he raised his staff and said Whats this The monk said I dont know Yanyang said You dont even recognize a staff Then he poked the ground with his staff saying Recognize this The monk said No Yanyang said You dont even recognize a hole in the ground Then he put the staff across his shoulder and said Understand The monk said No Yanyang said My staff across my shoulder I pay no heed to peopleI go straight into the myriad peaks When the ancients got here why didnt they agree to stay here Who confronting the situation Brings it up without deception Such a person is rare He destroys the lofty peaks Melts down the mysterious subtlety Even I dont know where hes gone Along with the white clouds and flowing streams Why did I say If you see jowls on the back of his head dont go along with him  As soon as you make a comparative judgment you make your living in the ghost cave of the mountain of dark ness If you can see all the way through and trust completely naturally no one can trap you or do anything to you When pushed or pressed you will kill or give life spontaneously Xuedou understood the hermits meaning when he said I go straight into the myriad peaks At that point he begins to make his verse If you want to know the point look at Xuedous verse Verse Dust and sand in his eyes dirt in his ears Blocked up with tons of it There are other such people He doesnt consent to stay in the myriad peaks With the lightning flash mind if you vainly toil tarrying in thought when you look to the left a thousand lives have gone by when you look to the right ten thousand eons Suddenly raising my eyebrows to lookwhere has he gone All along hes just been right here Have you cut off the hermits footsteps Though like this its still necessary to get to this realm to realize it Immediately he says Dust and sand in his eyes dirt in his ears This one line eulogizes the hermit of Lotus Blos som Peak When Chan practitioners get here they have nothing above to look to no personal selves below they are like simple tons Nanquan said Among people of the Way those like simple tons are hard to come by Chanyue wrote I often recall Nanquans fine words such simpletons are indeed rare Fadeng said Who knows the meaning of this It makes me think back to Nanquan Nanquan also said The seven hundred eminent monks at the fifth patriarchs place all understood Buddhism only workman Lu didnt understand Buddhism He just understood the Way and that is why he became the new patriarch Tell me how far apart are Buddhism and the Way Xuedou brought up this saying of Nanquans and said Sand cant get in their eyes water cant get in their ears if there are people who trust totally and can hold fast they arent deceived by others For them what a bunch of meaningless noises are the ver bal teachings of the Buddhas and patriarchs So I invite you to hang up your bowl and bag break your traveling staff and just become free wayfarers Xuedou also said  The polar mountain can be put in their eyes the water of the ocean can be put in their ears There are some people who accept others haggling discussions and the verbal teachings of the Buddhas and patriarchs like a dragon reaching water like a tiger taking to the mountains They must pick up their bowls and bags and put their staffs across their shoulders They too are free wayfarers  Among these three kinds of free wayfarers if you would choose one to be your teacher the correct choice is this kind of cast iron person Whether they encounter evils or wonders to them what they face is all like a dream They dont know there are the six senses they dont know there is sunrise and sunset But even if you get to this realm you must not cling to the cold ashes of a dead fire you must not plunge into the flood of darkness You still must have a way to turn around As in the ancient saying Don t cling to the greenness of the strange plants on the cold cliff If you obliterate the white clouds the source is not marvelous But what is being called the myriad peaks Hence this verse But tell me where does he go Does anyone know Suddenly raising my eyebrows to lookwhere has he gone Why doesnt Xuedou know where hes gone either where is it now If you can see youre studying with the hermit of Lotus Blossom Peak Story A monk asked Baizhang What is extraordinary Theres an echo in the words He flabbergasts people Though he has eyes hes never seen Baizhang said Sitting alone on the mountain His awesome majestic air extends over the whole land The one standing and the one sitting are both defeated The monk bowed A clever monk There still is such a person who wants to see such a thing Baizhang then hit him The imperative is not carried out vainly Commentary a He has the eye to face situations unconcerned with danger or death So it is said  How can you catch tiger cubs without entering a tigers lair Baizhang was like a tiger with wings Nor does this monk avoid life and death he dares to grab the tigers whiskers and ask what is extraordinary This monk too has eyes Baizhang immediately took up the burden with him and said Sitting alone on the mountain The monk bowed Chan practitioners must be able to discern the meaning before the question This monks bow was not the same as an ordinary bow he had to have eyes to do it Though they knew each other they acted like they didnt When the monk asked what was special and Baizhang told him sitting alone on the mountain the monk bowed and Baizhang hit him see how when they let go they both do so at once and when they gather back they wipe away the tracks and obliterate the traces But what did the monk mean by bowing If it was good why did Baizhang hit him If it was not good what was wrong Here you must be able to tell right from wrong distinguish ini tiate from outsider and stand on the summits of a thousand peaks to begin to understand The monks bow was like grabbing the tigers whiskers he was just contending for a pivotal position Anyone else wouldn t have been able to handle the monk The monk met mind with mind con veyed intention with intentionthat is why he bowed Nanquan said Last night at midnight Manjusri and Samantabhadra came up with views of the Buddha and the Dharma I gave them each a beating and sentenced them to be hemmed in by twin iron mountains  Then Zhaozhou said Who should take your beat ing Nanquan said Where was my fault Zhaozhou bowed Chan masters do not idly observe how the other takes action The moment they are in charge of the situation and bring it into play they are naturally lively But tell me what about when letting go Look at Xuedous verse Verse In the realm of the patriarchs gallops the heavenly colt Such a one is bom once in five hundred years Among myriad people theres one or a half The son takes up the fathers work Among expedients rolling out and rolling up are not the same path Already so before the words He came head on turning left and right Do you see where Baizhang helps people How laughablea man comes to grab the tigers whiskers Where theres a great reward there must be a valiant man The heavenly colt runs a thousand miles a day runs back and forth up and down gallops as if flying so it is called a heav enly colt He is well able to gallop only thus can we see how free he is This is because he attained Mazus great ability and great function If it turns it must go both ways And if it cant be turned whats the use Even great people must know something of changing with circumstances People these days just offer their true feelings and play into the hands of another What end will there be Xuedou says  How laughablea man comes to grab the tigers whiskers Baizhang was like a tigerhow laughable that this monk went to grab the tigers whiskers in the Autumn Wind Introduction Answering ten when one is asked understanding the whole when part is mentioned loosing the falcon on seeing the rabbit using the wind to fan the flame not sparing any effortleaving this aside for the moment how is it when entering the tigers lair Story A monk asked Yunmen  How is it when the tree withers and the leaves fall What season is this When the family breaks up the people perish when the people perish the family breaks up Yun men said The body exposed in the autumn wind He cuts nails and shears through iron Clean and naked bare and purified Walking with even steps through the blue sky Commentary If you can comprehend here you begin to see how Yunmen helped people Otherwise if not as before youll be calling a deer a horse you are blind and deaf Who arrives at this realm Do you think Yunmen answered the monks question or do you think he was harmonizing with him If you say he answered his question you are wrongly sticking to the zero point of the scale Since its not this way ultimately how is it If you can see all the way through Chan monks nostrils are not worth a pinch In general to uphold the Chan vehicle you must take up the burden with your entire being and not spare any effort you must stretch out in the tigers mouth and allow others to pull you back and forth and drag you down If youre not like this how will you be able to help people This monk posed a question that was indeed rigorous If you look at him in ordinary terms he just seems to be a monk involved in idle concerns If you go by the traditions of Chan monks when you go to his lifeline to look he undeniably has a subtle point But say when the tree withers and the leaves fall whose realm is this In Fenyangs eighteen questions this is called a question to test the host and also called a question using things Since the ques tion had an eye Yunmens answer too was straight to the point An ancient said To attain intimacy dont ask with a question If you really know someone you know the point as soon as its men tioned If you look to the vein of Yunmens words youve immedi ately gone wrong Yunmen liked to ride the thiefs horse to pursue the thief in this way Once a monk asked him What is that which is not within the reach of thought He said  Impossible for cognition to fathom This monk asked How is it when the tree withers and the leaves fall Yunmen said  The body exposed in the autumn wind  In his words he unfailingly seizes control of the essential bridge and doesnt let ordinary or holy through You must under stand how Yunmen raises one corner and illuminates the other three raises three corners and illuminates the other one If you seek in his three statements youre pulling an arrow out of the back of your head In a single statement of his three statements are always present There is spontaneous accord But which of the three state ments does Yunmen use to receive people Try to discern this Verse Since the question has the source Profoundly discerning oncoming winds the arrow is not shot in vain The answer too is in the same place Yunmen is like a bell waiting to be struck His efforts are not made at random Three statements should be distinguished Above between below First you must comprehend outside the three statements An arrow point flies far into the void On target Gone by The arrow flies a past the next country Over the great plainschilling wind blasts howling wailing Throughout the skies all over the earth Do you feel your hair standing on end Hes let go In the eternal skyintermittent misty rains The winds are great the waters vast Above your heads boundless vastness below your feet boundless vastness Havent you seen the traveler sitting so long at Shaolin who hasnt returned The Yellow River flows turbid from its source Tranquil up on Bear Ear Mountain a single gathering You can see whether your eyes are open or closed Living in a ghost cave Youre blind and deaf Who arrives at this realm Ill still knock out your gap teeth Commentary An ancient said When you hear words understand the source dont set up private rules The ancients words were not empty talk So it is said  To ask about this affair you must have some knowledge of right and wrong If you dont know noble from base behavior if you cant recognize pure and defiled if you let your self speak at random what will be the gain Whenever one speaks it must be like clamps like tongs it must have hooks and chains it must have unbroken continuity This monks question had the source meaning Yunmens answer was also thus Yunmen always taught people with three statements this is his ultimate pattern  Three statements should be distin guished Three statements are always present in each statement of Yunmens If you can distinguish them you penetrate beyond the three statements An arrow point flies far into the void He shot it so far you must look quickly to see it If you can see it clearly you can open out the universe in a single statement Is this mystery or marvel An ancient said The truth of things not hiddenit has always been revealed The monk asked How is it when the tree withers and the leaves fall Yunmen said The body exposed in the autumn wind Xuedous intent was just to create a single environment Whats in front of your eyes right now the whistling wind is either the southeast wind or the northwest wind If you go on interpreting it as Chan or the Way this has nothing to do with it Havent you seen the traveler sitting so long at Shaolin who hasnt returned Before he returned to India Bodhidharma sat facing a wall for nine years utterly silent But say is this the tree withers the leaves fall If here all past and present fools and sages sky earth and the whole world are all fused into one then you will see how Yunmen and Xuedou really helped people  Tranquil up on Bear Ear Mountain a single gathering Bear Ear Mountain is Shaolin Before and behind mountains are clus tered thickly by the thousands Where will you see Do you see where Xuedou helps people Even if you do this is still the sacred tortoise dragging its tail leaving traces Never Been Spoken Story Nanquan went to see Master Nirvana Nirvana asked Is there a truth the sages have never spoken The master should know It stands like a wall ten miles high Does he feel his teeth falling out Nanquan said There is Hes fallen into the weeds Even if he goes wrong his whole life you shouldnt speak this way to him Nanquan said I am just thus What about you Luckily he has a place to turn around With the long hes long with the short hes short He hides his body but reveals his shadow He acts totally dead There are thorns in the soft mud Though he acts like this how could he fool me Nanquan said I dont understand He can only act this way Lucky he doesn t understand Luckily this guy is just this way Nirvana said Ive already spoken too much for you He adds frost to snow Why a dragon s head but a snakes tail Commentary When you get here no need for its mind or its not mind or for not mind or not not mind Even when you havent a single eyebrow hair youve still attained just a little This Master Nirvana used to live at Baizhang he had the monks clear fields for him while he expounded the great doctrine for them At this time Nanquan had already seen Mazu but he was going around to various masters for absolute certainty He said Is there a truth the sages have never spoken Had it been me I would have covered my ears and left See this old guys scene of embarrassment I would have simply brought my staff down across his back to get him to feel Though it was like this tell me where is it spoken According to Nanquans view its not mind not Buddha not a thing its never been spoken What about you  Nanquan then said his I dont understand He said he didnt understand while actually he did understand this is not really not understanding If both were adepts they were like clear mirrors If you have eyes youll judge them clearly Verse Patriarchs and Buddhas never helped people Each guards his own territory If you keep even a single word in your mind you go to hell like an arrow shot Chan practitioners present and past run neck and neck Having worn out your sandals break your staff and hang up your bowl and bag When clear mirrors are set up the range of images differs Come smash the mirror and Ill meet with you One by one facing south to see the northern dipper Do you see me astride the Buddha hall going out through the mountain gate In Korea theyve gone up to the hall in China they havent beaten the drum The dipper handle is hanging down But theres no place to seek Too bad The cup falls to the ground the saucer shatters to pieces When you pick up the nose you lose the mouth After all its so so I strike Commentary Sakyamuni Buddha appeared in the world and in fortynine years never said a single word Now it fills the voluminous Canonhow can it not be speaking As Xiushan said The Buddhas have not appeared in the world fortynine years of talk Bodhidharma didnt come from India Shaolin has a wondrous secret Its also said The Buddhas have not ap peared in the world nor is there any teaching to be given to people I always say though I were to add a phrase sweet as honey when properly viewed its poison Chan practitioners present and past run neck and neck Ev erywhere they go they ask questions about is and is not about Buddhas and patriarchs about transcendence and accommoda tion Though they act like this if they havent arrived at this realm they cant do without this questioning ia When clear mirrors are set up the range of images differs  With just this one line you can distinguish clearly  The great teacher Shenxiu said The body is the tree of enlightenment the mind like a clear mirror When Xuedou talks this way is he inside or outside the gate Each of you has an ancient mirror All the myriad forms long short square roundeach and every one appears in it If you go to the longness or shortness to understand in the end youll never be able to find it This is why Xuedou said When clear mirrors are set up the range of images differs  Instead you must all face south and see the northern dipper When youre facing south why are you nevertheless to look at the northern dipper These two lines refer to Nirvanas confrontation Fearing people would misunderstand he turned around and picked it up himself saying  The dipper handle is hanging down right now before your eyes  Where else will you go to look for it  As soon as you pick up the nose you lose the mouth Xuedou has picked up the nose and lost the mouth Introduction When fish swim through the water is disturbed when birds fly by feathers fall Clearly discriminating host and guest penetratingly distinguishing initiate and outsider one is like a clear mirror like a bright pearl The sound is obvious the form is evident But why is it so Story A monk asked Dasui The conflagration at the end of an eon sweeps through and the universe is totally destroyed is This One destroyed or not What thing is  This One No one on earth can get hold of this phrase He scratches in advance anticipating the itch Dasui said It is destroyed An iron hammer head with no hole is thrown down in front of him Hes lost his nostrils Before he speaks hes already thoroughly exposed The monk said If so then this goes along with it Immeasurably great people are whirled around in the stream of words After all he misunder stands Dasui said It goes along with it The first arrow was still light the second arrow was deep Just this is what so many people cannot find When the water rises the boats ride high with a lot of clay the Buddha image is big If you say it goes along with it where is it I hit Commentary Master Dasui studied with more than sixty teachers Once he was keeper of the fire in Guishans community One day Guishan asked him You have been here several years yet you still dont know how to pose a question so I can see whats what with you Dasui said What would you have me ask Guishan said Since you dont understand ask what the Buddha is Dasui covered Gui shans mouth with his hand Only later did he become a public teacher A monk asked him The conflagration at the end of an eon sweeps through and the universe is totally destroyed Is This One destroyed or n ot This monk just came up with a question based on an idea in the scriptures Scriptures say there are eons of formation sub sistence destruction and emptiness when the age of cataclysm occurs the destruction reaches to the third meditation heaven Basically the monk did not know the point of this statement Tell me what is This One People often make intellectual interpretations and say it is the fundamental nature of beings If you say that it goes along with it where is it If you say it doesnt go along with it then what Havent you heard it said that to attain intimacy you should ask with a question Since the monk didnt understand what Dasui said he had this matter on his mind He took this question to Touzi who asked him where he came from The monk recounted his conversation with Dasui Touzi burned incense bowed and said Dasui is a Buddhahurry back to him  The monk returned but Dasui had already passed on Later a monk at court said of this Clearly there is no other truthwho says the southerner Huineng was approved The one phrase it goes along with it makes a monk run over a thousand mountains A cold cricket cries in the piled leaves by night a ghost bows to the lamp before a crypt The humming stops outside the lonely window he wanders back and forth unable to overcome his regret Later Xuedou used these lines in making his verse Right now you should not think it is destroyed and you should not think it is not destroyed In the end how will you understand Look quickly Verse In the light of the eonic fire he poses his question The monk still lingers within the double barrier A hundred layers a thousand levels How touchingfor a single phrase going along with that  All the monks in the world make this sort of judgment Its not even worth it for a thousand ten thousand sayings Whats hard about stopping him in his tracks Busily he traveled out and back alone ten thousand miles His active consciousness is very chaotic Hes just wearing out his sandals Commentary c Xuedou takes charge of the situation and comes out with his verse in his words theres a place where he manifests his being In the light of the eonic fire he poses his question The monk still lingers within the double barrier From the first the monks question was concerned with whether it is destroyed or not destroyedthis is the double barrier  How touch ingfor a single phrase going along with that  Busily he trav eled out and back alone ten thousand miles This refers to the monk taking the question to Touzi then returning again to Dasui this can be called being busy for ten thousand miles Story A monk asked Zhaozhou I hear youve seen Nanquan in person is that so A thousand hearings are not as good as one seeing A confrontation Everyone has a pair of eyebrows Zhaozhou said Zhen province produces big radishes He holds up the sky and supports the earth He cuts nails and shears through iron The arrow flies past the next country If you see jowls behind his head dont travel with him Commentary This monk too is one who has studied for a long time to be sure there s an eye in his question But he could not do anything to Zhaozhou an adept whose immediate reply was Zhen province produces big radishes This can be called flavorless talk that chokes people Old Zhaozhou is like a thief who steals in broad daylight As soon as you speak he plucks your eyes out Otherwise if you linger in thought holding back your potential you wont avoid losing your life In judging this story the wild sage Cheng called it asking about the east answering about the west He said that Zhaozhou didnt answer didnt climb into the trap If you understand this way how will you get it If you understand this way you havent seen it even in dreams moreover youre dragging Zhaozhou down Some say Zhen province has always produced big radishes as everyone knows Zhaozhou saw Nanquan and everyone knows this too Thats why when the monk still asked whether Zhaozhou had seen Nanquan Zhaozhou said Zhenzhou produces big rad ishes  But this has nothing to do with it Zhaozhou has his own road through the skies A monk asked Jiufeng I hear you saw Yanshou in person is this true Jiufeng said  Is the wheat in front of the mountain ripe yet This matches what Zhaozhou said to the monk both are like holeless iron hammerheads Zhaozhou is a free man If you question him carelessly he snatches your eyes out If you know what is youll chew it care fully and swallow it If you dont know what is youll be like swal lowing a date whole Verse Zhen province produces big radishes Everyone knows Each time its brought up its new All the Chan practitioners in the world seize upon this as a principle Nevertheless it isnt so Who has a use for these idle words this longwinded speech They only know it as extending from past to present Half open half closed In ancient times it wasnt so now it isnt so either How can they discern that the swan is white and the crow is black W hats long is long of itself whats short is short of itself those who can recognize this are rare Its none other Xuedou himself is wearing a fetters giving evidence of his crime He has taken Chan practitioners by the nose Commentary Zhen province produces big radishes  If you seize upon this as the ultimate principle youve already gone wrong People all know that this answer of Zhaozhous is an expression of the ultimate principle though in the end they dont know where the ultimate principle is Thats why Xuedou says All the Chan practitioners in the world seize upon this as a principle  They only know it as extending from past to present  How can they discern that the swan is white and the crow is black Though they know that people past and present have answered this way when have they ever been able to distin guish the expert from the naive Xuedou says to understand re ally you must discern the swans whiteness and the crows blackness in a flash Thief  He has taken Chan practitioners by the nose All the Buddhas of past present and future are thieves too the suc cessive generations of patriarchs are thieves too They were able to snatch peoples eyes As for the skill not to blunder I only ap prove Zhaozhou Zhen province produces big radishes  His Ringed Staff Introduction Move and a shadow appears notice and ice forms Yet if you dont move and dont notice you will not avoid entering a wild fox den If you can penetrate thoroughly trust completely without any blind ing obstruction youll be like a dragon finding water like a tiger taking to the mountains Let go and even rubble radiates light hold still and even real gold loses its color The ancients stories could not but be roundabout but tell me what were they discussing Story Magu carrying his ringed staff went to Changqing He circled the meditation seat thrice shook his staff once and stood there Cor rect Hes washing dirt in mud What talk is this A donkeytethering stake Xuedou added a word saying Wrong Magu also went to Nanquan circled the seat thrice shook his staff and stood there As before hes washing dirt in mud again he carries on But though the frog leaps it cant get out of the bas ket Nanquan said  Incorrect Incorrect Why not accept it He kills the man without blinking an eye What talk is this Xuedou added a word saying Wrong Magu then said Changqing said correct why do you say incor rect Where is the master When one kills one must see blood when one helps one should do ones utmost How many people has he deceived  This is what is turned about by the power of the wind in the end it breaks down After all Magu is trapped by Nanquan The people of old would stay if there was mutual agreement in a single word and would leave otherwise See how Magu went to Changqing circled the seat thrice shook his staff and stood there Changqing said Correct Correct To use the sword that kills the sword that gives life one must be a true adept Why does Xuedou say W rong Where is he wrong Changqing said correct where is he correct Xuedou seems to be sitting there reading the judgment Magu carrying this word correct  then went to see Nanquan As before he circled the seat thrice shook his staff and stood there Incorrect To use the sword that kills the sword that gives life one must be a true adept Xuedou says Wrong Changqing said correct Nanquan said incorrect are these the same or different If you attain understanding at Changqings saying you will not even be able to save yourself if you attain understanding at Nanquans saying you can be the teacher of Buddhas and patriarchs Even so Chan practitioners must accept it for themselves before they will under stand not just take other peoples verbal explanations If one is a thoroughly competent adept who has attained great liberation one must have a life apart One who has not forgotten mind and objects will certainly be stuck over these two sides If you want to understand clearly past and present and silence everyone in the world first you must clearly apprehend these two wrongs Xuedous verse later only deals with these two wrongs If you have blood under your skin you will naturally not go to the words and phrases to create interpretations you will not go to a donkeytethering stake to make up theories Some people say that Xuedou utters these two wrongs on behalf of Magu but what connection is there The librarian Qing said Holding his staff circling the seat correct and incorrect are both wrong The reality of it does not lie herein Have you not read how Yongjia came to Caoqi and saw the sixth patriarch He circled the seat thrice shook his staff and stood there This one did not say correct or incor rect both correct and incorrect are donkeytethering stakes Only Xuedou pronouncing two wrongs has thus attained something Magu said Changqing said correct why do you say incor rect Nanquan didnt spare any effort he indulged considerably and said Changqing is correct its you who are incorrect One might say Nanquan released a falcon on seeing a rabbit The matter of hair nails teeth skin flesh sinews bone marrow and brains all returns to earth Saliva tears pus and blood all return to water Warm breath returns to fire and movement returns to wind When these four elements separate where could this illusory body be When Magu circled the seat holding his staff already this was what is turned about by the power of wind and eventually breaks down When you get here you must be made of cast iron in order to realize it a The scholar Zhang Zhuo called on Chan Master Xitang and asked  Do the mountains rivers and earth exist or not A compe tent Chan teacher always wants to melt sticking points remove bonds and eliminate fixations for people one should not just hold to one side but be comprehensive See how Yangshan went to Zhongyi to thank him for ordina tion When Zongyi saw him coming he beat his hand on his chair and said Wa wa Yangshan then stood to the east then stood to the west then stood in the middle After that once he had finished giving thanks he retreated and stood there Zhongyi said Where did you get this concentration  Yangshan said I took it off the seal of Caoqi Zhongyi said Who did Caoqi receive with this concentra tion Yangshan said Yongjia Then Yangshan asked Zhongyi Where did you get this concentration Zhongyi said At Mazus place Isnt such conversation by people who understand the whole from the part who see the root and follow the branches Longya said Those who penetrate the study must pass be yond Buddhas and patriarchs Rivers and lakes do not intend to obstruct people its just that people now cant cross them so the rivers and lakes become barriers Though the Buddhas and patri archs do not intend to deceive people its just that people now cannot pass beyond them so Buddhas and patriarchs after all de ceive people and you cannot say they dont If one can pass be yond the Buddhas and patriarchs one surpasses them Still one must completely realize the intent of the Buddhas and patriarchs only then can one be equal to the transcendent people of old If you have not been able to pass through if you study the Buddhas and patriarchs youll never have any hope of attainment The monk also asked  How can I avoid being deceived by the Buddhas and patriarchs Longya said You must be enlightened your self When you get here you must be like this When you help people you should do your utmost for them when you kill people you must see their blood This is acting according to the imperative In heaven and on earth I am the sole honored one A pair of holeless hammerheads even the Great Compassionate One with a thousand hands cannot lift them If you take them away youll get a thrashing Then the waves are calm in the four seas No one in the world dares to move East west south north all have the same family style Recently there has been much rain The hundred rivers return to the ocean tide Clean and naked peace and tranquillity in ones own house is realized the sea being at rest the rivers are clear The standard of the ancient rod is lofty with twelve gates How does it compare to this one There is no eye on the staff Avoid making a living on the staff In each gate is a road empty and desolate It belies your everyday life If you look youll go blind Not desolate After all Luckily theres a place to turn around Already blindso I strike The adept should seek medicine without disease Once having died you wont come back to life again Why are you fast asleep all day long Why search through the heavens and grope over the earth Commentary This verse resembles the case of Deshan seeing Guishan first Xuedou adds two turning words piercing it through on one string then he produces his verse  This wrong and that wrong  It is important not to take them away Xuedou means that the wrong here and the wrong there should not be taken away youre mis taken if you take them away It is necessary to add this double wrong like this and thus at once you find The waves are calm in the four seas  The hundred rivers return to the ocean tide  How pure the wind how bright the moon If you gain understand ing at these two wrongs you will no longer have the slightest concern Mountains are mountains rivers are rivers what is long is itself long what is short is itself short one breeze in five days one rainfall in ten days That is why he said The waves are calm in the four seas  The hundred rivers return to the ocean tide The latter part eulogizes Magu carrying his staff  The stan dard of the ancient rod is lofty with twelve gates The people of old used a whip for a rod Chan monks use the staff as a rod The ancient rod is the staff the pure wind is higher than the twelve vermilion gates of the jewel lake of an ancient goddess If you can understand this twofold wrong  then your staff will emit light even the ancient rod cant be put to use In each gate there is a road empty and desolate Though there is a road it is just that its empty Even if you are an adept when you have no illness still you must seek a bit of medicine to take Elder Ding Stands Motionless Introduction The ten directions cut off a thousand eyes abruptly open when one saying cuts off all streams myriad impulses cease Are there any who will die together and be born together The issue is at hand but if you cannot clear it up please look at the ancients complications Story Elder Ding asked Linji What is the meaning of Buddhism So many people are at a loss when they get here There is still this Why is he so feebleminded Linji got off his seat grabbed Ding slapped him then pushed him away Today he caught him Hes very kind No one in the world can leap clear Ding stood there motionless Hes already fallen into the ghost cave Hes already stumbled past He cant avoid losing his nostrils A monk stand ing by said Elder Ding why dont you bow  On neutral ground there is one who can see through it all Ding gets his power When someone dies in the eastern house someone in the western house helps in the mourning Just as Ding bowed He uses diligence to make up for incompetence he suddenly was greatly enlightened Like finding a lamp in the dark like a pauper finding a jewel He adds error to error Tell me what did he see that he bowed Commentary See how he was directly leaving directly entering directly going directly comingthis is indeed the true school of Linji to have such dynamic function If you can go all the way through then you can overturn the sky and make it into earth attaining the use of the endowment yourself Elder Ding was such a man slapped by Linji as he bowed and rose he immediately understood the ultimate He was a northerner very simple and direct Subsequently he used the ability of Linji completely his sharpness unavoidably coming through One day on the road he met Yantou Xuefeng and Qinshan Yantou asked where he came from Ding said Linji Ding recounted this story Qinshan said Why did he not say Not a true person of no station  Ding grabbed him and said How far apart are a true person of no station and not a true person of no station Speak quickly  Qinshan did not speak his face turned pale  Also once as Ding was resting on a bridge he met three pro fessor monks One asked What is the meaning of the saying Where the river of Chan is deep you must plumb the very bot tom Ding said If not for you two Id have let him plumb the very bottom Observe such methods of his These are all the dynamic function of Linji Also look at Xuedous verse Verse Huangbos entire ability continues in his footsteps The Yellow River is muddy from the very source The son inherits the fathers work Brought forth why should it remain at ease Where is it What can be done about the fact that there is such a person Can someone without feet or hands attain that The great spirit lifted its hand without much ado It scares people to death Dont brag so much Striking once with a whisk I wont test any further And split apart Flower Mountains ten million layers Commentary Huangbos entire ability continues in his footsteps brought forth why should it remain at ease Only Linji alone continued in the footsteps of Huangbos great ability and great function Once it is brought forth it does not admit of any attempt to discuss it if you dally you fall right into the realm of ignorance The Surangama Sutra says Just as when I put my finger on it the ocean seal emits light if you arouse your minds even mo mentarily anxiety over the material world will come up first  The great spirit lifted its hand without much ado  And split apart Flower Mountains ten million layers The great spirit of the Yellow River had great powers with its hand it broke open Flower Mountain and let the water run through Elder Dings feel ing of doubt was like a massive mountain struck once by Linji at once he found it had shattered and dissolved Zifus Circle Introduction He does not discriminate east from west nor south from north morning to evening evening to morning but can you say he is asleep Sometimes he calls south north but is he mindful or mind less If you can pass through here for the first time you will know the ultimate and then you will know how the ancients were so or not so Tell me what time is this Story Chen Cao went to see Zifu When Zifu saw him coming he im mediately drew a circle This is a spirit recognizing a spirit a thief recognizing a thief If he were not relaxed and at ease how could he discern this fellow This old thief Zifu thereupon closed the door A thief does not break into a poor mans house He has already entered the others cage Xuedou said Chen Cao has just one eye Xuedou has an eye on his forehead But what does he mean He should give him another circle Chen Cao has a dragons head but a snakes tail he should have given Zifu such a reply that he would have had no gate to advance through and no road to retreat upon But what further pressure could he bring to bear Commentary Ministry president Chen Cao was a contemporary of Pei Xiu and Li Ao Whenever he saw a monk come he would first invite him to a meal and would give him three hundred cash wishing thereby to test the monk What is the meaning of the teachings Chen was speechless Yunmen said I hear youve read the Lotus Sutra is this true Chen said it was A real monk abandons scriptures and treatises to enter a Chan com munity and can do nothing even after ten or twenty years so how could you ministry president be able to understand Chen bowed and apologized Also one day when Chen was up in a tower with a group of officials they saw several monks coming The monks raised their heads One day he went to see Zifu who drew a circle on seeing him approach Zifu was an adept in the GuiYang line and always liked to use objects to deal with people This kind of story is called discerning the target without words concealing ability within a phrase Xuedou says Chen Cao has just one eye Xuedou may be said to have the eye on the fore head But what does he mean Zifu should have produced another circle but if he always acted like this how could a Chan practitio ner benefit others Verse Round and round the jewel turns ringing like jade He tries to stir the Yellow River with a three foot pole Made of cast iron Horses carry it asses bear it load it on an iron ship Why do you need so many for What limit is there If one is a real unconcerned traveler one has no use for it But you must be a traveler without concern before you will get it When fishing for a tortoise he lets down a cagetrap If it is a frog what is the use of it Whats to be done about prawns mussels snails and oysters It is necessary to hook a tortoise No Chan practitioner in the world can jump out All are buried in the same pit Can you manage to jump out yourself c Commentary Round and round the jewel turns ringing like jade  Horses carry it asses bear it load it on an iron ship The beginning of Xuedous poem just eulogizes the circle If you can merge with it youll be like a tiger with horns This bit requires you to break through your limitations to end mental machinations discard gain and loss right and wrong all at once do not make your under standing in terms of principle anymore and do not understand it as a mysterious wonder Ultimately how to understand This must be carried by horses borne by asses loaded on an iron ship Anyplace else it cannot be imparted it must be shared with an unconcerned traveler of sea and mountain Here you must not be affected by things or nothing by unpleasant feel ings or pleasing situations or by Buddhas or patriarchs only then can you take it up properly If there is any Chan to seek any mea sure of profane or holy feelings you will surely not be able to fully attain mastery In fishing for tortoises only a cage will do That is why Fengxue said Used to fishing for whales I scour the ocean but am disap pointed by a frog crawling in the mud He also said O great tortoise do not carry away the three mountains I want to walk on the summit of the isle of immortals Xuedou also said No Chan practitioners in the world can leap out If one is a great tortoise one will not entertain the view of a Chan practitioner if one is a Chan practitioner one will not entertain the view of a great tortoise L Story Yangshan asked a monk Where have you just come from  Ev eryone in the world is the same Still it is necessary to ask This is using the wind to fan the fire He will inevitably construe it in the ordinary way The monk said Mt  A truthful person is hard to find Yangshan said  Did you visit Five Elders Peak He naturally swings his arms as he walks How could he have ever passed it by The monk said I didnt get there Take a step Honest speech is better than a red face He seems to be at a loss Yangshan said You never visited the mountain at all Too much ado What is the old guys hurry Yunmen said These words were all because of com passion thus they had a conversation in the weeds  The sword that kills the sword that gives life Two three If you want to know the mountain road you must be one who travels on it Commentary a The point of testing people is to know them intimately as soon as they speak An ancient said Immeasurably great people are turned about in the stream of speech If you are one who has the eye on the forehead as soon as it is being brought up you know the point See their question and answer each is distinctly clear Why did Yunmen say these words were all for compassion so they had a conversation in the weeds When the ancients got here they were like a clear mirror reflecting whatever comes just as it is nothing could get past their scrutiny How was it that there was a conversation in the weeds because of compassion This monk had come from Mt Lu why did Yangshan say he had never visited the mountain One day Guishan asked Yangshan When there are monks com ing from various places what do you use to test them Yangshan said he had a way and Guishan asked him to show it When he said  Did you get to Five Elders Peak if that monk had been a real man he would simply have said Disaster In stead he said I didnt get there Since the monk was not an adept why did Yangshan not act according to the rule so as to avoid the many complications that subsequently appeared Instead he said You never visited the mountain That is why Yunmen said These words were all because of compassion thus they had a con versation in the weeds Were it talk outside the weeds it would not be like this Verse Leaving the weeds entering the weeds Above and below vast expanse Half open half closed He is so and I am so too Who knows how to seek them out He puts another head on top of his head Red sun clear and bright Its broken through As soon as you lift your eyes you miss it Looking to the left there are no flaws Blind As before theres nothing the matter He traveled so swiftly Ten years he couldnt return And forgot the road by which he came Better not act so lost Commentary Leaving the weeds entering the weeds  Who knows how to seek them out Xuedou after all knows where they are when he gets there he upholds with one hand and pushed down with the other White clouds layer upon layer  Red sun clear and bright  This b is much like Grasses in profusion mist overhanging At this point there is nothing at all profane or holy The whole world has never concealed It each particular cannot cover It This is called the realm of no mind when cold it doesnt feel cold and when hot it doesnt feel hotthe whole thing is one great door of libera tion Looking to the left there are no flaws  Looking to the right already old Master Lazy Can dwelt in seclusion in a stone grotto on Mt The emissary went to his grotto and made the announce ment The emperor has summoned you rise and give thanks for his favor Just then Can poked into his oxdung fire took out a yam and ate it his nose ran dripping from his chin The emissary laughed and said I suggest you wipe off that snot Can said What leisure do I have to wipe snot for a worldly man After all he never went to the capital The emissary returned and reported this Suzong praised him highly Someone so pure and calm so clear and direct as this is not at the disposal of others he just holds still as though made of cast iron It is just like the case of Shandao who after being laicized never again became a monk people called him the stone grotto worker When he treaded the pestle he forgot the movement of his feet A monk asked Linji What is the meaning of the stone grotto workers forgetting the movement of his feet Linji said Sunken in a deep pit Fayans verse on Perfect Nature reads When reason is exhausted feelings and thoughts are forgotten How could there be any adequate comparison Wherever I go theres the frosty nights moon It falls as it may into the valley ahead The fruits ripe they are heavy with monkeys The mountains go on so long it seems Ive lost my way As I look up there is some light remaining Actually this is west of my dwelling place Xuedou said  Have you not seen the man of Cold Mountain  He traveled so swiftly  For ten years he couldnt return  And forgot the road by which he came In one of the Cold Mountain Man s poems it says If you want a place to rest your body  You can preserve it long on Cold Mountain The gentle wind blows in the dense pines  Heard from nearby the sound is even better For ten years he couldnt return  And forgot the road by which he came Yongjia also said  Mind is the sense phenomena the ob jects both are like flaws in a mirror When the defilement of the flaws is gone only then does the light appear when mind and phenomena are both forgotten nature is identical to reality When you get here be like a simpleton and you will see this story Manjusrl and Wuzhuo Introduction Determining dragons and snakes distinguishing jewels and stones separating the initiate and the naive to settle all uncer tainty if you havent an eye on your forehead and a talisman at your side time and again you will miss the point Right now see ing and hearing are not obscured sound and form are purely real Tell me is it black is it white is it crooked is it straight Why should he hoist it onto his eyebrows There is nothing outside the great vastness why is there nevertheless a south Manjusrl said How is Buddhism faring in the south If he asked someone else a disaster would happen It still lingers on his teeth and lips Wuzhuo said Monks of the last age have little regard for discipline A truthful person is hard to find Manjusrl said  How large are the congregations At that moment I would immediately give him a shout With one nudge he pushes him over Wuzhuo said Some three hundred some live hundred They are all wild fox spirits After all hes let slip Wuzhuo asked Manjusrl How is Buddhism faring here He asks back he turns the spear around and comes back with it Manjusrl said Ordinary people and sages dwell together dragons and snakes intermingle Hes suffered quite a loss In fact hes frantic Wuzhuo said  How large are the congre gations Manjusrl said In front three by three in back three by three Tell me how many are they Even the Great Com passionate One with a thousand hands could not count them all Commentary When Wuzhuo was visiting Mt Wutai he came to a wild isolated place There Manjusri produced a temple to take him in for the night He asked where he came from and Wuzhuo said the south Manjusri said What do they usually use to drink tea Wuzhuo was speechless Finally he left and Manjusri had a servant boy see him to the gate When they got to the gate Wuzhuo asked the boy Just now he said In front three by three in back three by three how many is this The boy said O Worthy Wuzhuo said Yes The boy said How many is this Wuzhuo also asked what temple this was The boy pointed beyond the statue of the thunderbolt bearer when Wuzhuo turned his head the magical temple and the boy had vanishedit was just an empty valley Later that place was called the Thunderbolt Cave A monk asked Fengxue What is the master of Wutai He said One statement did not settle Wuzhuos question to this day he is still a monk who sleeps in the fields If you want to penetrate the peaceful equanimity of actual truth so that your feet tread on the real earth get attainment at Wuzhuos words then naturally you may stay in a boiling caul dron or in the coals of a furnace without feeling hot and may stay on ice without feeling cold If you want to go through to use solitary sternness like an adamantine diamond sword get attainment at Manjusris words then naturally water cannot wet wind cannot penetrate Some say Wuzhuos answers were wrong while in Manjusris answers there is both snake and dragon both ordinary and sage What bearing does this have on it Can you clearly discern three by three in front three by three in back The first arrow was still light the second arrow went deep Tell me how many is this If you can pass through here then a thousand or ten thousand statements are only one statement If at this one statement you can cut off and hold still in the next moment you will reach this realm Verse The thousand peaks twist and turn the color of indigo Who says Manjusri was conversing with him Even if it were Samantabhadra I wouldnt pay any attention Hes already stumbled past Its laughable  How many the people on Wutai What is he laughing at Its already there before saying it In front three by three in back three by three Please observe it right where you are There are thorns in the soft mud The tea bowl falls to the ground the saucer breaks in seven pieces Commentary The thousand peaks twist and turn blue as indigo  Who says Manjusri was conversing with him  Some say Xuedou is just re iterating it without versifying it It is like when a monk asked Fayan What is a drop of water from the source of the Chan stream Fayan said A drop of water from the source of the Chan stream And a monk asked Huijiao  How does fundamental purity give rise to mountains rivers and earth Huijiao said  How does fun damental purity give rise to mountains rivers and earth You cannot say either that these are just repetitions Mingzhao also versified the meaning of this with the ability to cover heaven and earth Unable to open the enlightened eye at his words Wuzhuo turned and saw only the blue mountain crags Extending throughout the world the beautiful temple refers to the magical temple nestled in the weeds This is what is called having ability to carry out both provisional and real together The Manjusri filling the eyes is talking if you dont know how to open the enlightened eye at his words when you turn your head youll only see the blue mountain crags At such a time could you call it the realm of Manjusri Samantabhadra or Avalokitesvara In es sence it is not this principle Xuedou just changes Mingzhaos us age instead he has a needle and thread Ten thousand peaks twist and turn blue as indigo He does not damage the point or hurt his hand Within the phrase there is the provisional there is the real there is principle there is phenomena Who says Manjusri was conversing with him They talked all night but he didnt know it was Manjusri Later Wuzhuo stayed on Mt Every time Manjusri appeared over the rice pot Wuzhuo hit him with the ladle Still this is drawing the bow after the thief is gone This time as soon as he said How is Buddhism faring in the south he should have hit him on the spine then he would have gotten somewhere  Its laughable How many the people on Wutai There is a sword in Xuedous laughter If you can understand what hes laugh ing about you will see the saying In front three by three in back three by three mb On return ing when he got to the gate Today one day He has only fallen into the weeds at first he was falling into the weeds later he was still falling into the weeds the head monk asked Where have you been He still wants to try the old guy Hes suffered quite a loss Had he gone anywhere he couldnt avoid falling into the weeds They drag each other into a pit of fire Changsha said First I went pursuing the fragrant grasses then I returned following the falling flowers Hes let slip quite a bit All along hes just been sitting in a forest of thorns The monk said  How very much like the sense of springtime He comes following along adding error to error one hand holds up one hand presses down Changsha said It is even cooler than the autumn dew dripping on the lo tuses He adds mud to dirt The first arrow was light the second arrow went deep What end will there ever be Xuedou added Thanks for your reply A bunch of people playing with a mud ball The three have their crimes listed on the same indictment Commentary Changsha was a spiritual heir of Nanquan a contemporary of Zhaozhou and Zihu if anyone asked about scrip ture he would explain scripture if someone wanted a verse he would produce a verse Yangshan was usually considered foremost in intellect Once as he was enjoying the moon along with Changsha he pointed at the moon and said Everyone has this its just that they cant use it Changsha said Quite true  Hence people later called Changsha The Tiger  One day as Changsha returned from a stroll in the mountains the head monk one of his disciples asked Where have you been Changsha said Roaming in the mountains The monk asked Where did you g o Changsha said First I went following the fragrant grasses then I returned pursuing the falling flowers Only one who occupies the universe can be like this The ancients in their comings and goings never failed to be mindful of this matter See how the host and guest shift positions together con fronting the situation directly neither defers to the other Since he was roaming in the mountains why did the monk ask where he went Had he been one of todays Chan followers he would have said I came to the inn on Mt This too falls on both sides but ultimately does not remain on either side Once a scholar Zhang Zhuo having read the Sutra o f the Thousand Names o f the Buddha asked Of the hundreds and thousands of Buddhas I have only heard their names what lands do they dwell in and do they teach or not Verse The earth is clear of dust Open up the doors and windowswho is under the eaves None can miss this The world is at peace Whose eyes do not open One must radiate great light from the forehead before this is possible Why scatter dirt and sand First he went following the fragrant grasses Hes slipped quite a bit Its not just one instance of falling into the weeds Luckily it happens he already said this before Then he returned pursuing the falling flowers Everywhere is completely real Luckily he came back Under his feet the mud is three feet deep A weary crane alights on an evergreen tree Accompanying him left and right he adds a phrase Still there are so many idle concerns A mad monkey cries on an ancient terrace It is impossible either to add a phrase or to take one away Changshas boundless meaning I strike What does the final phrase say Bury them all in one pit Hes fallen into a ghost cave Tch A man in the weeds This is drawing the bow after the thief is gone At this point mental machinations must come to an end and conscious knowledge forgotten so that you have no leaking at all over the mountains rivers earth plants people and animals If you are not thus the ancients called that still remaining in an aesthetic realm You must further realize that there is a time when the whole thing is brought up the single opening upward only then can you sit in peace If you can pass through then as before mountains are mountains rivers are riv ers each abides in its own state each occupies its own body You will be as though blind The cock crows in the early morning Sadly I see as I rise how worn out I am I havent a kilt or a shirt Just the semblance of a robe My loincloth has no seat my pants no opening On my head are three or five pecks of grey ashes If one can truly reach this realm whose eyes would not open Though you go through upsets and spills all places are this realm all places are this time The ten directions are without walls the four quarters without gates That is why he said First I went following the fragrant grasses then I returned pursuing the fall ing flowers Skillful indeed Xuedou just adds a phrase to his left and a phrase to his right just like a poem A weary crane alights on an evergreen tree  A mad monkey cries on an ancient terrace  When Xuedou has drawn it out this far he realizes how he has indulged himself suddenly he says Changshas boundless meaning  Tch This was like having a dream but suddenly awakening Changshas bound less meaning dig out the ground and bury it deeper Theres Nothing in the World Introduction Its futile to linger in thought over action like a lightning bolt when thunder fills the sky you will hardly have time to cover your ears To unfurl the red flag of victory over your head whirl twin swords behind your earsif not for a discerning eye and a familiar hand how could anyone succeed Some people lower their heads and linger in thought trying to figure it out with their in tellect they hardly realize they are seeing countless ghosts in front of their skulls Story Panshan said There is nothing in the world Once the arrow has left the bowstring it has no power to come back The moons bright ness shines revealing the night traveler One who knows the law fears it He ought to have been hit before he finished talk ing where can mind be found Best not fool people Its not worth bringing up again Examine for yourself He himself had one succes sor Puhua When Panshan was about to pass on he said to his group Is there anyone who can depict my true likeness They all drew likenesses and presented them but Panshan scolded ev ery one Puhua came forth and said I can depict it Panshan said Why not show m e Puhua turned a somersault and left Pan shan said Later on this guy will appear crazy to teach others One day he said There is nothing in the world where can mind be found The polar star does not move it is quiet and still with no tracks Once it is presented face to face there is nothing else Xuedou takes up two lines and eulogizes them this is raw gold a jewel in the rough Have you not heard it said that curing illness does not take a donkey load of medicine Just because he was wearing fetters giving evidence of his crime An ancient said When you hear mention of the statement beyond sound do not seek it in your mind What did he mean Just like a rushing stream crossing a sword thunder peals a comet flies  if you dally and seek it in thought even though a thousand Buddhas appeared in the world you would grope around without finding But if you have deeply entered the inner sanctum pierced the bone to the marrow seen all the way through then Panshan will have suffered a loss If you are muddy and wet revolving in a pile of sound and form you have still never seen Panshan even in a dream Let go naturally there is neither going nor abiding in essence If here you say there is neither Buddha nor Dharma still you have gone into a ghost cave The ancients called this the deep pit of liberation Originally it was a good cause but it brings on a bad result That is why it is said that an uncontrived unconcerned person is still oppressed by golden chains Still you must have penetrated all the way to the bottom before you will realize it If you can say what cannot be said do what cannot be done this is called the turning point There is nothing in the world where can mind be found If you make an intellectual interpreta tion you will just die at his words See for yourself I strike and say What is this The white clouds form a canopy Adding a head to a head A thousand layers myriad layers The flowing spring makes a lute Hear it They come along together Each hearing is enough to lament One tune two tunes no one understands It is not in A or B not D or E He is going by a side road All notes and tones are distinctly clear Take whats yours and go When you listen you go deaf When the rain has passed the autumn water is deep in the evening pond The thunder is so swift theres no time to cover the ears After all hes muddy and wet Where is he Immediately I strike Commentary There is nothing in the world  Where can mind be found  Xuedou makes a verse that resembles the Flower Ornament Cosmos Xuedou drapes two phrases around Panshan saying The white clouds form a canopy  The flowing spring makes a lute When Su Dongpo the imperial scholar saw Zhaojiao he wrote The sound of the valley stream is the eternal tongue Are not the colors of the mountains the pure body Last night eightyfour thousand verses How could I quote them to others another day Xuedou borrows the flowing spring to make a vast tongue so he says One tune two tunes no one understands Jiufeng said Do you know life The flowing spring is life profound stillness is the body Thousands of ripples arising at once is the way of Manjusri one continuous clear sky is the realm of Samantabhadra   The flowing spring makes a lute One tune two tunes no one understands the harmony of this tune requires you to be a connoisseur before you can appreciate it If you are not such a person it is useless to take the trouble to incline an ear to it If you see after the indications are distinct you fall into conceptualization Xuedou is very compassionate and goes on to say to you that it is like When the rain has passed the autumn water is deep in the evening pond  This verse has been discussed and judged by some one who praised Xuedou for having the talent of an imperial scholar The rain passed the autumn water is deep in the evening pond Still you must look quickly if you tarry in doubt you will look without seeing If we discuss the sudden it doesnt leave a hint of a trace a thousand sages cannot find it To a quick person one word to a quick horse one stroke of the whip Story Fengxue said in a lecture at the government headquarters in Ying prefecture The Chan mind seal is formed like the workings of the iron ox Ten thousand people cannot budge it Where is the impenetrable difficulty The seal of the three essentials opens without running afoul of the point when taken away the impression remains when left there the impression is ruined Immediately I strike But if neither removed nor left there is sealing right or is not sealing right Everyone in the world appears and disappears The design is already showing But I ask that you turn over the meditation seat and disperse the assembly with shouts A certain elder Lupi then came forth and said I have the workings of the iron ox Nevertheless hes unusual please do not im press the seal  Fengxue said Accustomed to scouring the oceans fishing for whales I re gret to find instead a frog crawling in the mud Like a falcon catching a pigeon The jewel net extends throughout space The wonder horse runs a thousand miles Lupi stood there thinking What a pity Still theres a place for him to come forth what a pity to let it go Fengxue shouted and said Elder why do you not speak further He captures the flag and steals the drum The boiling turmoil has come Lupi hesitated Three times he has died A double case Fengxue hit him with his whisk Well struck This order requires such a person to carry it out Fengxue said Do you still remember the words Try to quote them What is the need He adds frost to snow As Lupi was about to speak Once having died he wont come to life again He runs afoul of Fengxue Fengxue hit him again with the whisk The governor said  The Buddhist law and the royal law are the same Clearly After all theyve been seen through by a bystander Fengxue said What principle have you seen A good rejoinder he turns the spear around and comes back with it The governor said When you do not settle what is to be settled you bring on disorder Still you must realize the bystander has eyes When someone in the eastern house dies someone of the western house helps in the mourning Fengxue thereupon stepped down from his seat He adds error to error Seeing the situation he adjusts Now the task of study is completed Commentary Fengxue was an adept in the Linji line When Linji was in Huang bos community once as he was planting pine trees Huangbo said to him Why plant so many pine trees here deep in the moun tains Linji said For one thing to provide scenery for the mon astery second to make a signpost for people of later generations Then he hoed the ground Huangbo said With you my school will flourish in the world Dagui Zhe said Linji in his way seemed to invite trouble in a peaceful area nevertheless only when immutable in the face of danger can one be called a real man When Huangbo said W ith you my school will flourish in the world he seemed to be so fond of his child that he was unaware of being unseemly As Linji entered the hall the head monks of both halls simultaneously shouted A monk asked Linji Are there guest and host Linji said Guest and host are evi dent  Fengxue asked about the meaning of this Xuefeng said In the past I went with Yantou and Qinshan to see Linji on the way we heard he had already passed on If you want to under stand his talk about guest and host you should visit adepts in the stream of his school b One day he finally saw Nanyuan  Once he saw Jingqing who asked him Where have you come from  Fengxue said From the east Jingqing said And did you cross the little river Fengxue said  The great ship sails alone through the sky there are no little rivers to cross  Jingqing said Birds cannot fly across a mirror lake and a picture mountain have you not merely overheard anothers remark Fengxue said Even the sea fears the power of a warship sails flying through the sky it crosses the five lakes  Fengxue said If I leave I lose  Then he went out when he got to the teaching hall he said to himself Big man the case is not yet finished how can you quit Then he went back to the abbots room  Fengxue said Xuedou actually lies east of Baogai Jingqing said  If you dont chase the lost goat crazy interpretations cease Instead you come here and recite poems Fengxue said When you meet a swordsman on the road you should show your sword do not offer poetry to one who is not a poet Jingqing said Put the poetry away now and try to use your sword a little Fengxue said A decapitated man carried the sword away Jingqing said You not only violate the method of the teaching you also show your own fatheadedness Fengxue said  Unless I violate the method J The Workings of the Iron Ox of teaching how could I understand the mind of the ancient Bud dhas Fengxue said Again you grant your allowance now what do you have Jingqing said  This monk cannot distinguish beans from wheat I have only heard of ending without finishing how can you finish by forcing an end Fengxue said  The immense billows rise a thousand fathoms the clear waves are not other than water Jingqing said When one phrase cuts off the flow myriad impulses cease Fengxue thereupon bowed Now sit and have tea When Fengxue first came to Nanyuan he entered the door without bowing Nanyuan said When you enter the door you should discern the host Fengxue said I ask the teacher to make a definite distinction Nanyuan slapped his knee with his left hand Nanyuan slapped his knee with his right hand Nanyuan raised his left hand and said This one I concede to you Then he raised his right hand and said  But what about this one Fengxue said Blind Nanyuan then raised his staff Fengxue said What are you doing  See how an excellent student is naturally sharp Even Nanyuan couldnt handle him The next day Nanyuan just posed an ordi nary question He worked as the gardener in Nanyuans community One day Nanyuan came to the garden and asked How do they assess the staff in the south He said  They make a special assessment How do they assess it here Nanyuan raised his staff and said Under the staff acceptance of birthlessness facing the situation without deferring to a teacher  At this Fengxue was greatly enlightened At this time the five dynasties were divided and at war The governor of Ying prefecture invited Fengxue to pass the summer there The school of Linji flourished at this time Whenever he questioned and answered or gave out pointers invariably his words were sharp and fresh colorful and ornate always with a point One day the governor requested Fengxue to teach the assem bly He said The Chan mind seal is formed like the workings of the iron ox Removed the impression remains left the impres sion is ruined But if you neither take it away nor keep it there is it right to use the seal or n ot Why is it not like the workings of a stone man or a wooden horse only like the workings of an iron ox There is no way for you to move it As soon as you go the seal remains as soon as you stop the seal is broken causing you to shatter into fragments But if you neither go nor stay should you use the seal or not See how he gives out indications you might say there is bait on the hook Elder Lupi who was in the audience was also an adept in the Linji line I have the workings of an iron ox I ask you not to impress the seal Fengxue was an adept he immediately replied Accustomed to scouring the oceans fishing for whales I regret to find instead a frog crawling in the mud And there is an echo in the words Yunmen said  Trailing a hook in the four seas just fishing for a terrible dragon the mysterious device beyond con vention is to seek out those who understand the self In the ocean twelve buffalo carcasses are used as bait for the hooks instead he has just snagged a frog But there is nothing mysterious or wonderful in these words and neither is there any rationalization An ancient said It is easy to see in the phenom ena if you try to figure it out in your mind you will lose contact Seeing it if you dont take it it will be hard to find again even in a thousand years What a pity That is why it is said Even if you can explain a thousand scrip tures and commentaries it is hard to utter a statement appropri ate to the moment The fact is that Lupi was searching for a good saying to an swer Fengxue he didnt want to carry out the order and suffered Fengxues unilateral use of the ability to take over He was unre mittingly pressed back and simply couldnt do anything As a prov erb says When an army is defeated it cant be swept up with a straw broom In the very beginning it is still necessary to seek a tactic to oppose the adversary but if you wait till youve come up with one your head will have fallen to the ground The governor too had studied a long time with Fengxue he knew to say The Buddhist law and the royal law are the same Fengxue said What have you seen He knew how to explain the Dharma according to the situation if it did not ac cord with the situation it would just be false talk He thereupon left the seat Verse Having caught Lupi he makes him mount the iron ox Among myriad people he still wants to show his skill The general of a beaten army neednt be decapitated a second time The spear and armor of the three profundities have never been easily opposed The one whose move it is is confused He accepts disaster as if receiving good fortune and accepts submission as if encountering opposition By the castle of the King of Chu the tidal water What tidal water are you talking about Vastly extensive it fills heaven and earth Even were it the four seas he would still reverse their flow Shouting once he caused its flow to turn back This one shout not only cuts off your tongue oh it startles the iron ox into a run and frightens the colossus to death Commentary mb Xuedou knew Fengxue to have such a style so he eulogized him by saying Having caught Lupi he mounts him on the iron ox  The spear and armor of the three profundities have never been easily opposed  In the Linji tradition there are three profundities and three essentials within any one statement there must be in herent three profundities in one profundity there must be inherent three essentials Expedients do not go against the ability to cut off the streams The monk asked What is the tertiary statement Linji said Just observe the playing of the puppet on the stage the pulling of the strings depends on the person behind the scenes In one statement of Fengxue he is immediately equipped with the spear and armor of the three profundities fully equipped he is not easy to oppose Were he not so how could he have handled Lupi Finally Xuedou wants to bring out the active edge of the Linji line Introduction One who can take action on the road is like a tiger in the moun tains one immersed in worldly understanding is like a monkey in a cage If you want to know the meaning of the Buddha nature observe time and conditions If you want to smelt pure gold that has been refined a hundred times you need the forge and bellows of a master Tell me when the great function appears what can be used to test it Story A monk asked Yunmen What is the pure body of reality He sees the sixteenfoot gold body of the Buddha in a heap of dust Mottled and mixed up what is it Yunmen said A flowering hedge If the point of the question is not real the answer comes across crude The bent does not hide the straight The monk asked What is it like when one goes on just so Yunmen said A goldenhaired lion He is both praising and cen suring two faces one die He meets error with errorwhat is go ing on in his mind Commentary Do you know the point of these questions and answers If you do the two speakers are alike without a single tongue If you dont you wont avoid being fatheaded Yunmen was not the same as others Some people say he was answering at random but if you understand it this way then tell me where Yunmen is This was a household affair dont try to figure it out from outside  He speaks immediately where life springs forth if you try to deliberate and seek it in thought immediately you have fallen into the secondary Yongjia said When the body of reality awakens fully there is not a single thing the inherent nature of the original source is the natural real Buddha  Yunmen tested this monk the monk was also a member of his household and was a longtime student He knew the business of the household so he went on to say What is it like to go on just so Yunmen said A goldenhaired lion But tell me is this agree ing or not Is this praising or censuring Yantou said If you en gage in battle each individual stands in a pivotal position It is also said Study the living word not the dead word If you under stand the living word you will never forget if you understand at the dead word you will be unable to save yourself  Another monk asked Yunmen Is it true that the Buddha Dharma is like the moon in the water Yunmen said  There is no way through the clear waves The monk went on  How did you manage Yunmen said Where does this second question come from  The monk said How is it when going on just so Yunmen said Further complications block the mountain path  You must realize that this matter is not in words like sparks like lightning whether you reach it or not you still will not avoid losing your life Verse A flowering hedge Dont be fatheaded He still talks about principle  Then just be so  How pointless Take whats coming to you and get out Clearly You should not mistakenly blame Yunmen A golden haired lioneveryone look He lets out one or a half Still they are dogs Yunmen is also a man from the land of thieves escorting a thief Commentary Xuedou sizes up the audience to give his order making the harpstrings vibrate he distinguishes the tune With each phrase he continues the judgment This verse is not at variance with the form for quoting the ancients In the water there is no moon the moon is in the sky This is like the marks being on the balance arm not on the scale pan But tell me which is the balance If you can discern it clearly you will not turn away from Xuedou When that ancient got to this point he was indeed compas sionate Its not here its over there But tell me what place is that over there This finishes the eulogiz ing of the first statements afterward he versifies the monks say ing What is it like when one goes on just so Xuedou says this monk still has no point Tell me is this meeting in light or meet ing in darkness A goldenhaired lion everyone look Do you see the goldenhaired lion Introduction ia Cease and desist then an iron tree blooms with flowers But tell me where is his error Story Talking with Nanquan Officer Lu Xuan said Master Sengzhao said Heaven and earth and I have the same root myriad things and I are one body This is quite marvelous Hes living in a ghost cave A picture of a cake cannot satisfy hunger This is also haggling in the weeds Nanquan pointed to a flower in the gar den For scriptures there are teachers of scriptures for treatises there are teachers of treatisesits no business of a Chan monk A powerful man in that instance would have uttered a pivotal word and not only cut off Nanquan but thereby caused all the Chan practitioners to show some en ergy He called to the officer and said People these days see this flower as a dream When the embroidered ducks are done you may look at them but do not give the golden needle away to any one Dont talk in your sleep You have drawn the golden oriole down from the willow branch Commentary Officer Lu Xuan studied for a long time with Nanquan When he was young he was fond of Taoist literature Later as he was copying the old translation of the Vimalakirti Sutra he had an enlightenment Therefore he compiled Buddhist sutras and composed four discourses What Taoism says is that heaven and earth are great and so are we we are alike born in emptiness Taoism just discusses equal izing things Sengzhao said that nature all returns to self Have you not seen how his discourse says  The ultimate person is empty without form yet none of the myriad things are not ones own doing Only a sage Though there are spirits and humans the wise and the sage and each is distinct yet all have one nature and one substance An ancient said The whole world is just oneself when cold it is cold everywhere when hot it is hot everywhere In terms of exist ence all exists in terms of nonexistence nothing exists When affirmed all is when denied all is not Fayan said It It It I I I south north east west everything is all right All right or not only for me there is nothing not all right Thus it was said In the universe I alone am honorable Later he composed the Merging o f Difference and Unity which also does not go beyond this meaning Which body do they have in common How could there be such a thing If you say the mean ing of the doctrines is ultimate why did Buddha raise the flower why did Bodhidharma come from India It is also like one in a dream though he wants to awaken he cannot called by another he awakens If Nanquans eye were not true he would surely have been befuddled by Lu If the action of your eyes is alive you will experience it like the most superb savor if you are dead you will turn it into poison When you get here you must understand on your own Have you not heard it said The single transcending road has not been transmitted by the sages students toil over forms like monkeys grasping at reflections Verse Seeing hearing awareness knowledge these are not one and the same In the multitude of forms there is not a single thing Eye ear nose tongue body and mind are all at once a hammerhead without a hole Mountains and rivers are not seen in a mirror What is long is itself long what is short is itself short green is green yellow is yellow Where do you see them The frosty skys moon sets the night nearly half over He has led you into the weeds The world has never concealed it I only fear you will go sit in a ghost cave With whom will it cast an image cold in the clear pool Is there anyone If they did not sleep on the same bed how could they know the cover is worn out Someone who is sad should not speak of it to another who is sad the sad speaking to the sad saddens them to death Commentary Nanquans little sleep talk Xuedous big sleep talk though they are dreaming they are having a good dream At first there was talk of one bodyhere he says they are not the same Seeing hearing awareness knowledge are not one and the sameMoun tains and rivers are not seen in a mirror  If you say they are seen in a mirror and only then understood then they are not apart from the mirror Mountains rivers earth plants trees forests do not use a mirror to observe them If you use a mirror to observe then you create a dichotomy Just let mountains be mountains and rivers be riversEach thing abides in its normal state the forms of the world always remain  Mountains and rivers are not seen in a mirror Then tell me where can you see them When you get here turn to  The frosty skys moon sets the night nearly half over this side he has cleared up for you that side you must cross by yourself But do you realize Xuedou uses his own thing to help others With whom will it cast an image cold in the clear pool Do you think it is reflected itself or is it reflected together with someone It is necessary to cut off mental activity and cut off understanding before finally reaching this realm Right now we dont need a clear pool and we dont have to wait for the moon to set in the frosty sky Right now how is it c One Who Has Died the Great Death Introduction Where affirmation and negation are mixed even sages cannot know when opposition and accord go vertically and horizontally even Buddhas cannot know Such a one walks on thin ice runs on a swords edge is like the unicorns horn like a lotus in fire When seeing someone beyond comparison this one knows they are on the same path Who is an expert Story Zhaozhou asked Touzi How is it when one who has died the great death returns to life There is such a thing A thief doesnt strike a poor household When one is accustomed to acting as guest one has a feel for guests Touzi said  Dont go by night go there in daylight Seeing a cage he makes a cage This is a thief recog nizing a thief If he wasnt lying on the same bed how could he know the coverlet is worn Commentary Zhaozhou asked Touzi how it is when one who has undergone the great death returns to life Touzi replied that one should not go by night but in daylight Tell me what time is this A flute with no holes strikes a feltpounding board This is called a question to test the host or an intentional question All over they praised Touzi and Zhaozhou for outstanding eloquence One day Touzi set out tea for Zhaozhou Touzi himself passed him some steamed cakes but Zhaozhou paid no attention Touzi had a servant give Zhaozhou the cakes Zhaozhou bowed to the servant thrice See how he always went right to the root to uphold this fundamental thing for the benefit of others When Zhaozhou asked  How is it when one who had died the great death returns to life Touzi immediately said  Dont go by night go there in daylight Direct as sparks struck from stone like a flash of lightning One who has died the great death has no Buddhist doctrines and theories no mysteries and marvels no gain and loss no right and wrong no long and short When one gets here one just lets it rest this way An ancient said of this On the level ground the dead are countless only those who can pass through thorns are adepts One must pass even beyond the Other Side to attain Even so for people today it is already difficult to get to the realm of the great death Master Zhe called this vision that is not purified Wuzu called it failure to cut off the root of life One must die the great death once then return to life Yongguang said If you miss at the point of their words youre a thou sand miles from home In fact you must let go over a cliff trust yourself and accept the experience Afterward you return to life He just showed the little bit before the eyes So an ancient said If you want to attain intimacy dont ask with a question The question is in the answer and the answer is in the question It would have been difficult for anyone but Touzi to reply to Zhaozhous question But since Touzi is an expert as soon as its raised he knows the ultimate point Verse In life theres an eye still its the same as death The two dont know of each other Back and forth coming and going Having met try to give a testwhats the harm I too want to question him Even the ancient Buddhas they say have never arrived Luckily they had companions None of the sages have transmitted it I dont know either I dont know who can scatter dust and sand There is quite a bit of this right now It gets in your eyes whether theyre open or closed When you bring it up this way what does it come down to Commentary In life theres an eyestill its the same as death Xuedou knows what is so he can dare to make up verses An ancient said He studies the living word not the dead word Xuedou says that to have eyes in life is still to be just the same as dead Has he ever died To have eyes within death is to be the same as alive An ancient said Utterly kill the dead and then you will see the liv ing enliven the dead and you will see the dead b Though Zhaozhou is alive he intentionally made up a dead ques tion to test Touzi It was like taking a substance that vitiates the virtue of a medicine in order to test him Afterwards he praises Touzi Even the ancient Buddhas they say have never arrived Even the ancient Buddhas never got to where one who had died the great death returns to lifenor have the Chan teachers ever gotten there Even Sakyamuni and Bodhidharma would have to study again before they got it So Xuedou said I only grant that the old foreigner knows I dont allow that he understands Xuedou says I dont know who can scatter dust and sand A monk asked Changqing What is the eye of a teacher Changqing said Such a one has a vow not to scatter sand Baofu said  Dont scatter any more of it  All over teachers sit on fancy seats using blows and shouts raising their whisks knocking on the seat ex hibiting spiritual powers and acting as mastersall of this is scat tering sand Tell me how can this be avoided Introduction Bringing it out unique and alone is still dripping muddy water Knocking and resounding occurring together is a silver mountain an iron wall If you describe and discuss you see ghosts in front of your skull If you seek in thought you sit under the black moun tain The bright sun lights up the sky the pure wind circles the earth Tell me have the ancients any riddles Story When Layman Pang took leave of Yaoshan This old guy is act ing strange Yaoshan had ten Chan students to escort him to the gate What realm is this Only a Chan practitioner who knows the whole thing could do this Pang pointed to the snow in the air and said Good snowflakes they dont fall elsewhere He makes waves where theres no wind The pointing finger has eyes He comes on following after After all he climbed onto the hook Pang slapped him As it turns out the thief Quan pulled in ransacked his house Quan said Even a layman shouldnt be so coarse Pang said Though you call yourself a Chan student the king of death wont let you go The second ladleful of foul water has been poured over him Why only the king of death I wouldnt let him go either Quan said How about you His coarse mind hasnt changed Again hes asking for a beating From start to finish the monk is at a loss Pang slapped him again After all he adds frost to snow Having taken a beating reveal the truth and said You see as though blind speak as though mute He has another conciliatory statement Also he reads the verdict for him Xuedou added When Pang first spoke I d just have hit him with a snowball Xuedou is right but he draws his bow after the thief is gone Nonetheless Id like to see a direct confrontation Xuedou has fallen into the ghost cave Commentary Layman Pang studied with Mazu and Shitou and composed verses of awakening at both places My everyday affairs are no different Only I myself naturally harmonize No place is grasped or rejected Nowhere do I go for or against Who considers crimson and purple honorable The green mountains havent a speck of dust Spiritual powers wondrous functions Hauling water carrying firewood The directions a common gathering Everyone studies noncontrivance This is where Buddhas are chosen Minds empty they return successful After he had been with Yaoshan for a while he went to take leave Yaoshan held him in highest esteem so he had ten students see him off It hap pened to be snowing at the time Pang pointed nt the snow and said Good snowflakesthey dont fall elsewhere When the stu dent Quan asked Where do they fall Pang slapped him Since Quan was unable to carry out the order Pang had him carry out one half Though the order was put into effect when Quan re sponded this way it was not that he didnt know what Pang was getting at They each had a point in their activity but their roll ing up and rolling out were not the same Even so in some re spects he didnt come up to Pang Thus he fell into his trap and found it difficult to get out of Pangs range After Pang had hit him he went on to explain You see as if blind talk as if mute Xuedou said that in Quans place he would have hit him with a snowball as soon as he spoke Xuedou thus intended not to turn his back on the question its just that his action was tardy Librarian Qing said Pangs mind is like a bolt of lightning If we waited for you to grab a snowball how long would it take Verse The snowball hits the snowball hits Its not worth the trouble to bring it forth Overhead vastness underfoot vastness Old Pangs ability cannot grasp it Again and again there are people who dont know this I only fear its not so Gods and humans do not know themselves In eyes in ears absolutely clean You see as if blind speak as if mute Absolutely clean Even Bodhidharma would find it hard to discern  Old Pangs ability cannot grasp it Xuedou wanted to walk on Pangs head The ancients used snow to represent uniformity Xuedou meant that if he had hit him with a snowball then no matter what abilities Pang had it wouldve been hard for him to handle Xuedou praises his own hitting not knowing where hes lost his profit Gods and humans do not know themselves  In eyes in ears absolutely clean In the eyes is snow in the ears is snow toojust at that moment they are dwelling in uniformity This is also called the realm of Samantabhadra Yunmen said Even having no trouble in the world is still an expression of transition When you dont see a single form this is half the issue If you want the whole issue first you must know there is a single road beyond when you get here your great function must be manifest with no gap and you are not at the mercy of others  An ancient said An appropriate statement is a stake on which to tether a donkey for myriad eons Whats the use At this point Xuedou has finished the verse Even the thousand sages cannot judge the ability to capture tigers and rhinos Without any further traces of obstruc tion the whole potential appears everywhere equally If you want to understand the hammer and tongs of transcendence you need the forge and bellows of an adept Since ancient times has there ever been such a family style Story A monk asked Dongshan When cold and heat come how can we avoid them  Its not this season Where are you Dongshan said Why not go where there is no cold or heat No one can find it He hides his body but reveals his shadow A con man sells a bogus city of sil ver The monk said Where is there no cold or heat Dongshan swindles everyone The monk rolls along following him As soon as Dongshan let down his hook the monk climbed onto it Dongshan said When its cold it chills you thoroughly when its hot it heats you thoroughly The real does not conceal the false the crooked does not hide the straight Looking out over the cliff he sees tigers and rhinosthis is indeed an occasion to be sad Dongshan overturns the ocean and kicks over the polar moun tain Tell me where is Dongshans trap If you can clearly discern this for the first time you will know how the five ranks of the Dongshan tradition interchanging absolute and relative handle people in an extraordinary way indeed When you reach this tran scendental realm youll be able to be thus without needing any arrangements and youll spontaneously accord perfectly Thus it is said In the middle of the first night before the moon shines No wonder when they meet they dont recognize each other Each is hidden still embracing the aversion of former days The absolute within the relative At dawn an old woman encounters an ancient mirror Clearly she sees her facetheres no other reality Within nothingness is a road out of the dust If you can avoid violating the present taboo name Youll surpass the eloquent ones of yore When two swords cross no need to withdraw An expert is like a lotus in fire Clearly having a spirit to reach the heavens Arrival in both at once Who dares to associate with one in neither being nor nonbeing Everyone wants to get out of the ordinary flow But this one after all returns to sit in the ashes Fushan Yuan considers this story as being in the pattern of the five ranks If you understand one the rest are naturally easy to understand Yantou said Its like a gourd on water push it and it rolls over without any effort When the monk said Where is there no cold or heat and Dongshan said When its cold it chills you thoroughly when its hot it heats you thor oughly this was the relative within the absolute This is recorded in detail in the records of the CaoDong school Some say I like no cold or heat very much What grasp do they have on the matter An ancient said If you run on a swords edge youre fast If you see in emotion or intellect youre slow A monk asked Cuiwei What is the meaning of Chan Cuiwei said Ill tell you when no one comes then went into the garden The monk said Theres no one here please tell me  Cuiwei pointed to the bamboo and said  This stalk is so tall that stalk so short Suddenly the monk was greatly enlightened Xuedou uses the affairs of their house to make his verse Where is there not complete communion Once the imperial edict is on its way the nobles get out of the road Why must absolute and relative be in an arrangement If you do arrange them where will you have Today How will you avoid becoming involved in dualism When the wind blows the grasses bend where water runs streams form The ancient crystal palace reflects the bright moon Round and full Just dont grasp the reflection and dont run right in The sly hound of Han vainly runs up the stairs Stumbled past Ill hit him and say you are a fellow student of this monk Commentary c In the CaoDong tradition there is appearing in the world and not appearing in the world there is extending a hand and not extend ing a hand If you dont appear in the world your eyes gaze at the cloudy skies If you appear in the world your head and face are covered with ashes and dirt Eyes gazing at the cloudy skies is on top of a tenmile peak head and face covered with ashes and dirt is the business of extending a hand Sometimes head and face cov ered with ashes and dirt is on top of a tenmile peak sometimes on top of a tenmile peak is head and face covered with ashes and dirt In reality going into inhabited areas to extend a hand and standing alone on a solitary peak are the same Returning to the source and comprehending essence is not different from knowledge of differentiation Thus Xuedou says He extends a hand but still its the same as a tenmile cliff Theres simply no place for you to cling Why must absolute and relative be in an arrangement  When it comes time to function they are naturally like this its not a matter of arrangement This refers to Dongshans answer Then he says  The ancient crystal palace reflects the bright moon  The sly hound of Han vainly runs up the stairs This re fers to the monk running after Dongshans words In the CaoDong tradition they have the stone woman the wood horse the bottom less basket the nightshining pearl the dead snake and so on eighteen kinds of symbols of the absolute When Dongshan answered Why not go where there is no cold or heat this was like the moon shining in the ancient crys tal palace seeming to have a round reflection The monk asked Where is there no cold or heat This is like the hound of Han chasing a clod of dirt he runs frantically up the stairs to catch the moons reflection Dongshan said When its cold it chills you thor oughly when its hot it heats you thoroughly This monk was like the hound of Han chasing a clod running up the stairs but then not seeing the light of the moon The hound of Han was a swift black dog belonging to the Han clan the only one who could catch the wily rabbits in the moun tains Xuedou uses this as a comparison for this monk What about youdo you know where Dongshan helped people What rabbits are you looking for to Beat the Drum Story Heshan said Cultivating study is called learning ending study is called nearness No Chan practitioner can leap clear of this An iron hammerhead with no hole An iron spike Going beyond these two is real going beyond What are you doing with one eye on your forehead A monk asked What is real going beyond Theres an iron spike Heshan said Knowing how to beat the drum An iron spike iron brambles Hard hard The monk asked What is the real truth What will he say Theres another iron spike Heshan said Knowing how to beat the drum An iron spike iron brambles Hard hard The monk asked  I don t i ia ask about mind is Buddha what about not mind not Buddha This garbage heap The three sections are not the same Theres another iron bramble Heshan said Knowing how to beat the drum The monk asked How do you receive a transcendent person What will he say This monk will encounter a fourth ladleful of his foul water Theres another iron spike Heshan said Know ing how to beat the drum An iron spike iron brambles Going beyond these two is real going beyond  This saying comes from the Jewel Treasury Treatise To study till there is nothing to study is called ending study Yongjia said Years ago I accumulated learning consulted the commentaries and searched scriptures and treatises Once ones cultivation of studies is com pleted and exhausted one is called a nondoing free wayfarer be yond study When one reaches the point of ending study only then is one near the Way When one manages to go beyond these two aspects of study this is called real going beyond The monk too was undeniably bright and quick so he picked up on these words to question Heshan Heshan said Knowing how to beat the drum This is called flavorless speech If you want to understand this story you must be a transcendent person Only then will you see that these words have nothing to do with reason nor is there anything about them to discuss The nonduality of the real and mundane is the highest meaning of the holy truths Then the monk asked  I dont ask about mind is Buddha  what about not mind not Buddha  Mind is Buddha is easy to seek but when you come to not mind not Buddha its hard and few people arrive These four sayings are generally considered a message from the source they are called Heshans four drumbeats A monk asked Jingguo  How is it when a crane perches on a lone pine Jingguo said Underfoot an embarrassing situation He also asked  How is it when snow covers the thousand moun tains Baofu asked a monk What Buddha is the one in the temple The monk said  Try to decide for sure Baofu said Its Sakyamuni The monk said Better not deceive people Baofu said Its you who are deceiving me Heshans story is also like Xuefengs four ignoramuses All these were classical Chan masters Each produces profound and marvelous teachings and devices to communicate with people Verse One hauls rock In the heart of the realm the emperor commands A leper drags along his companions A transcendent person comes this way A second moves earth Beyond the borders the general gives orders Those with the same illness sympathize with each other To shoot the bolt requires a tenton crossbow It is not to be lightly answered How could it be used for a dead frog Old master Xuefeng rolled balls Theres another one whos come this way He had a holeless iron hammerhead Who doesnt know How could this equal Heshans knowing how to beat the drum An iron spike One son has attained intimately  Knowing How to Beat the Drum I report for you to know Even Xuedou himself hasnt seen it even in a dream Hes adding frost to snow Do you know Dont be careless The sweet is sweet the bitter is bitter Thanks for the answer Xuedou wrongly adds a footnotehe should get a thrashing Has he ever been beaten As before vast darkness Commentary One day Guizong had his group haul rock  Whenever a newcomer arrived Muping would first have him move three loads of earth East Mountain Road is narrow West Mountain is low Newcomers must not refuse three loads of mud Alas youve been traversing the roads so long Its so clear but you dont recognize it and get lost Later a monk asked Muping I dont ask about what is included in the three loads what about whats outside the three loads Muping said The iron wheel emperor commands in his realm The monk was speechless Muping hit him This is why Xuedou said One hauls rocks  A second moves earth  To shoot the bolt requires a tenton crossbow Xuedou uses a tentonpull crossbow to explain this case he wants you to see how Heshan helped people You use this crossbow for a fierce dragon or tiger not for a tiny bird or a little mouse A tenton crossbow does not shoot its bolt at a rat Old master Xuefeng rolled balls One day Xuefeng saw Xuansha coming and rolled three wooden balls together Xuansha made a smashing gesture Xuefeng deeply approved Though these stories are instances of the great functioning of the whole capacity none equals Heshans knowing how to beat the drum If you dont want carelessly to confuse things The sweet is sweet the bitter is bit ter Though Xuedou picked it up and played with it like this in the end he himself cant leap clear of Heshan either Introduction When he must speak he speaksin all the world there is no match for him When he should act he actshis whole capacity does not defer It is like sparks struck from stone like a flash of lightning like a raging fire fanned by the wind like a rushing torrent crossing a sword edge When he lifts up the hammer and tongs of transcen dence you wont avoid losing your point and becoming tonguetied Story A monk asked Zhaozhou Myriad things return to onewhere does the one return He challenges the old guy Piled in moun tains heaped in ranges He should avoid living in a ghost cave Zhaozhou said When I was in Qingzhou I made a cloth shirt It weighed seven pounds After all Zhaozhou goes freely in all di rections drawing a net that reaches through the sky But do you see Zhaozhou Do you know where Zhaozhou is If you can see here youll be one with the universe Where water goes a channel forms when the wind blows the grass bends Naturally where water goes a channel forms The essential point of Buddhism is not a matter of verbose speech A monk asked Zhaozhou Myriad things return to one Where does the one return Yet Zhaozhou answered by saying When I was in Qingzhou I made a cloth shirt It weighed seven pounds If you go to the words to discern you are mistakenly abiding by the zero point of the scale If you dont discern at the words what about the fact that he nevertheless did speak thus This story though hard to see yet is easy to understand though easy to un derstand its still hard to see Insofar as its hard its like a silver mountain or an iron wall insofar as its easy you are directly aware Theres nowhere for your calculations of right and wrong If you cant turn wherever you set foot on the road you get stuck But did Zhaozhou discuss Buddhism or not If you say he did when has he ever spoken of mind or nature of mystery or marvel If you say he didnt have the meaning of Buddhism when has he ever turned his back on anyones question A monk asked Muping What is the meaning of Buddhism Muping said This winter melon is so big Also a monk asked an ancient Deep in the mountains on an overhanging cliff in a re mote inaccessible uninhabited place is there any Buddhism  The monk asked What is the Bud dhism deep in the mountains The ancient said  The large rocks are large the small ones are small Look at such stories where are the obscurities Xuedou knows what they come down to so he opens up a road of meaning and comes out with a verse for you Verse He wraps everything up and presses the ancient awl Whats the need to press the old guy They push and push backto where How many people know the weight of the sevenpound shirt A second try is worthless one can only frown Zhaozhou is one up Right now I throw it down into West Lake Only with the ability of Xuedou could this be done One son attains intimately Commentary Of Fenyangs eighteen questions this one is called a wrappingup question Xuedou says He wraps everything up and presses the ancient awl  He wraps everything up into unity This monk want ed to press Zhaozhou but Zhaozhou was an adept He had a way to come forth where it was impossible to turn daring to open his big mouth he immediately said When I was in Qingzhou I made a cloth shirt It weighed seven pounds Xuedou says How many people know the weight of the sevenpound shirt  Right now I throw it down into West Lake Myriad things return to one but he doesnt even need the one Since he doesnt need the sevenpound cloth shirt either all at once he throws it down into West Lake When Xuedou lived on Dongtings green peak there was a West Lake nearby The pure wind of unburdeningto whom should it be im parted This refers to Zhaozhous saying  If youre coming from the north Ill load up for you If youre coming from the south Ill unload for you Even if youre coming from Xuefeng or Yunju youre still carrying a board Xuedou says  To whom can a pure wind like this be imparted Loading up means speaking to you of mind and nature of mysteries and marvels of all sorts of expedi ent methods Some people carried a load of Chan to Zhaozhou but when they got there they couldnt use it at all We say of this After awakening its the same as before awakening People these days all make unconcern an understanding Even before the Buddha appeared in the world before Bodhidharma came to China it could not have been other wise Whats the use of the Buddha appearing in the world You must have greatly penetrated and greatly awakened then as before mountains are mountains rivers are rivers and all things are perfectly manifest As Longya said  To study the Way first you must have a basis of enlightenment Its like a boat racethough you relax on idle ground as before you can only rest after winning As for this story of Zhaozhous seven pound shirt see how this ancient talks this way like gold and jade Me talking like this you listening like thisall this is loading up So what is unload ing The Sound of Raindrops Introduction With a single stroke the teacher completes the student who then passes beyond ordinary and holy The slightest word can break things up untying what is bound and releasing what is stuck As if walking on thin ice or running over sword blades one sits in the heaps of sound and form and walks on top of sound and form For the moment I leave aside wondrous functioning in all directions How is it when one leaves that very instant Story Jingqing asked a monk What is that sound outside the door The monk said The sound of raindrops Undeniably truthful Its good news too Jingqing said People are backwardsthey lose themselves and pursue things Somethings come up Hes used to getting his way He rakes the monk in This takes real ability like his The monk said What about you As it turns out the monk suffers a defeat Hes turned the spear around it will be hard to stand up to it Jingqing said I have reached not losing myself The monk said What is the meaning of reaching not losing oneself  He challenges the old guy pressing him relentlessly His first arrow was still light the second arrow is deep Jingqing said It may be easy to free oneself but to say the whole thing is surely difficult Provisions to nourish a child Though its so where have Deshan and Linji gone If he doesnt call it the sound of raindrops what sound should he call it When the ancients imparted their teaching with one device one object they wanted to guide people One day Jingqing asked a monk What sound is that outside the door The monk said The sound of quail Jingqing said  If you want to avoid uninterrupted hell dont slander the true teach ing of the Buddha If you can penetrate here nothing can block your independence within sound and form If you cant you are constrained by sound and form In other places this is called tempering words If it were tem pering it would only amount to mental activity This is called penetrating sound and form clarifying the eye of the Way clarifying sound and form clarifying the mind source clarifying forgetting feelings clarify ing exposition How little they realize that Jingqing has the skill to help people He is so brave he isnt bound by a single device or a single perspective How could Jingqing not have known that it was the sound of raindrops Why was it still worth asking You must realize that the ancient was probing to examine the monk The monk too pressed back well saying What about you What happened then was that Jingqing went into the muddy water to say I have reached not losing myself The reason was that the monk was losing himself pursuing things Why should Jingqing lose him self too You must realize that Jingqing had a place to get free within the phrase he used to test the monk Theres provisional and true letting go and gathering in killing and enlivening catching and releasing If you say hes ever let the streams enter You stick your head into a bowl of glue If you dont call it the sound of raindrops what sound will you call it As before you still dont understand How often Ive asked you Give me back my holeless iron hammerhead Understanding or not understanding Cut off both ends The two are not separate Its not on these two sides On south mountain on north mountain more and more downpour Above our heads under our feet If you call it the sound of raindrops youre blind if you dont call it the sound of raindrops what sound will you call it Here you must tread the ground of reality Commentary a An empty hall the sound of raindrops  If you call it the sound of raindrops this is losing yourself and pursuing things if you dont call it the sound o f rain drops how will you turn things around So an ancient said If your view equals your teacher you have less than half the teachers merit Only if your view goes beyond your teacher are you fit to receive and carry on the transmission And as Nanyuan said With ac ceptance of birthlessness under the staff one faces situations with out deferring to a teacher   If you say hes ever let the streams enter  As before you still dont understand In the teachings it says First in the midst of hearing Avalokitesvara let the streams enter but was mindless of what was there Since what came in was quiescent the forms of motion and stillness did not arise If you say its the sound of raindrops its not right but if you say its not the sound of rain drops its not right either If you say he lets the streams of sound and form enter thats not right either If you call it sound and form as before you dont understand his meaning It is compared to pointing to the moon the pointing finger is not the moon Un derstanding or not understanding   On south mountain on north mountain more and more downpour Introduction What does the sky say The four seasons go on there What does the earth say Where the four sea sons go on one can see the essence where the myriad things are born one can see the action But say where can you see a Chan practitioner Detached from speech and action can you still discern Story A monk asked Yunmen What is the body of reality So many people have doubts about this Even sages cant leap out Hes indulged quite a bit Yunmen said Six do not take it in He cuts nails and shears through iron An eight cornered mortar flies through the air The sacred tortoise is dragging its tail Commentary ib Yunmen said Six do not take it in This is indeed hard to attain even if you reach it before the first indications are distinct this is already the secondary If you understand after the first indica tions arise youve fallen into the tertiary If you go to the words to discern you will search without finding But ultimately what do you take as the body of reality Those who are adepts immediately get up and go as soon as they hear it raised Taiyuan Fu was originally a professor One day when he lec tured he spoke of the body of reality saying Vertically it reaches through the three times horizontally it extends through the ten directions There was a Channist in the audience who let out a laugh when he heard this Please explain The Channist said Pro fessor you only talk about the extent of the body of realityyou dont see the body of reality Fu said What would be right The Channist said You should temporarily stop lecturing and sit in a quiet room you will have to see it for yourself  Fu did as he said and sat quietly all night Suddenly he heard the bell for the fifth watch all at once he was greatly enlightened So he went and knocked on the Channists door saying Ive un derstood The Channist said  Try to tell me Fu said From now on Ill no longer twist these nostrils born of my parents Also in the scriptures it says  The Buddhas true body of real ity is like space These sixes all arise from the body of reality so the six faculties cannot take it in Moreover they drag down Yunmen If you want to see then see theres no place for your attempts to rationalize So in every statement there must be three statements And he does not turn his back on your questions responding to the time adapting to the situation with one word one phrase one dot one line he indeed has a way to express himself Is this the patriarchs Verse One two three four five six Go all the way through then start again at the beginning For every drop for water a drop of ice Why expend so much effort Even Bodhidharma cant count up to it Even in three lives sixty eons Has Bodhidharma ever even dreamed of it Why do you deliberately transgress in spite of knowing At Shaolin he deceptively said he passed it on to Shenguang When one person transmits a falsehood ten thousand people transmit it as truth It was already wrong from the start Then he rolled up his robe and said he was returning to India This at last is great peace Where is he right now He comes back by night to stay here He pokes out your eyes This is raising waves where theres no wind Is this the body of reality or the body of the Buddha Ill give you a thrashing Commentary c Xuedou is well able to show his eye where there is no seam or crack and come out with a verse to make people see Yunmen said Six do not take it in Why does Xuedou nevertheless say One two three four five six That is why it is said I only allow that the old foreigner knows not that he understands Only as a descendant of Yimmen could Xuedou do this Only if you can penetrate through will you know that the Way is not in words and phrases Otherwise you wont avoid making up intellectual interpretations Wuzu said Sakyamuni Buddha was a lowdown hired worker The oak trees in the yard one two three four five If you can man age to see truly at Yunmens words youll reach this realm instantly At Shaolin he deceptively said he passed it on to Shenguang  Shenguang was the second patriarch Later he said Bodhidharma had returned to India He had been buried at the foot of Bear Ear Mountain but an ambassador returned from the West saw Bodhidharma in the mountains returning to India with one shoe in hand When this was reported to the emperor Bodhidharmas tomb was opened and all that was left was a single shoe Xuedou says How can this matter really be imparted Since there is no imparting it Bodhidharma rolled up his robe and said he was returning to India You must be able to comprehend before you can enter and act India is vast with no place to look for him  He comes back by night to stay here Tell me where is he right now Striking Story When Minister Wang entered Zhaoqing they were making tea theres bound to be something extraordi nary Can you stand idly by Everyone set one eye on them Wang has invited trouble At the time Elder Lang was holding the kettle for Mingzhao Lang doesnt know how to make tea so he drags in someone else Lang turned the kettle over Seeing this the minister asked him Whats under the tea stove As it turns out its trouble Lang said  The spirit who holds up stoves A f ter all he runs into Wangs arrow Nonetheless hes extraordi nary The minister said If its the spirit who holds up stoves why then did you turn over the kettle Why doesnt he give some real provisions Somethings happened Lang said Serve as an official for a thousand days lose it in a single morning A mis taken indication There are many phony Chan followers The minister immediately left I allow that he has one eye Mingzhao said Elder Lang youve eaten Zhaoqing food but still you go beyond the river mak ing noise gathering charred wood I would go on to thrash him This master has only one eye Still it takes a cleareyed person to examine thoroughly Lang said What about you He presses himand he deserves to be pressed He was able to speak half He draws his bow after the thief is gone The lot of them are ras calsamong them Xuedou is the standout Commentary a  If you want to know the meaning of the Buddha nature observe the conditions of the times Minister Wang was in charge of Quan province He had studied at Zhaoqing for a long time One day he went into the monastery while Elder Lang was making tea and Lang turned over the tea kettle Nevertheless his start and finish contradicted each other so he lost the source meaning and blundered with the sharp point cutting his own hand Not only did he wrong himself he also offended the other If you discuss this matter though its not in words nevertheless you must discern whats alive in words So it is said Study the living word not the dead word When Elder Lang talked this way he was like a mad dog chas ing a dirt clod The minister left immediately appearing to disap prove of him Mingzhao said Elder Lang youve eaten Zhaoqing food but still you go beyond the river making noise gathering charred wood This charred wood is sticks burnt by wild fire Mingzhao used this to illustrate how Lang didnt go to the correct place to walk but instead ran off outside So it is said A good dog bites with out showing its teeth Guishan Zhe said Minister Wang was like Xiangru carrying off the jew elin fact his sideburns are sticking out from under his hat Since Mingzhao couldnt restrain himself it was difficult for him to do what was proper Had I been Elder Lang as soon as I saw the minister go I would have put down the tea kettle and laughed If you see it but dont grab it its hard to meet with it even in a thousand years  Baoshou asked Nail Cutter Hu For a long time Ive heard of Nail Cutter Huarent you he Hu said I am Baoshou said Can you drive nails into space Hu said I invite you to come smash it Baoshou then hit him Hu did not agree so Baoshou said Some day a talkative teacher will clarify this for you  Later Hu saw Zhaozhou and related this incident  At this Hu had an awakening When Master Mi Hu returned from his travels an old adept asked him A piece of rope on a moonlit night people call a snake What do you call it when you see the Buddha Mi Hu said  If there is something seen its the same as an ordinary being  The old adept said This is a peach pit that sprouts once in a thousand years National Teacher Huizhong asked an imperial attendant monk I hear tell that you have explained the Consideration o f Benefit Scripture is this true  The monk said it was Huizhong said One must first understand the Buddhas meaning to be fit to explain the scriptures The monk said If I didnt understand the mean ing how could I dare say Id explained a scripture Huizhong then had a servant bring a bowl of water seven grains of rice and one chopstick At the end Xuedou turns around and says At the time I would have kicked over the stove Though Mingzhao was such he never equaled Xuedou What time and season was it for them Their action naturally stands out in the present and shines through the ages they had a place of living liberation Verse Wang poses a question like creating a wind His arrow was not shot in vain He happens to be artful yet quintessential Langs responsive action was not skillful What end is there of people playing with mud A square peg in a round hole Indeed he ran into an adept How lamentable the loneeyed dragon Didnt display his teeth and claws He had no teeth and claws to display What teeth and claws are you talking about Dont cheat them Teeth and claws open See If you have such ability kick over the stove Producing clouds and thunder Everyone in the world takes a thrashing at once All the Chan monks in the world have no place to put themselves Commentary Wang poses a question like creating a wind  Langs response was not skillful The ministers question was like swinging an axe creating a wind This comes from Zhuangzi a man was plas tering a wall and a bit of plaster splashed onto the tip of his nose The axeman swung his axe so fast he created a wind and removed the plaster without cutting the mans nose The man stood there without losing his composure This is what is called wondrous skill on the part of both Though Elder Land did re spond to the ministers actions his words were unskillful that is why Xuedou said Wang poses a question like creating a wind  Langs response was not skillful How lamentable the loneeyed dragon  Didnt display his teeth and claws Mingzhaos speaking was indeed very outstanding yet he didnt have the teeth and claws to grasp the clouds and hold onto the fog The bystander Xuedou didnt approve unable to restrain himself he showed some energy in behalf of Mingzhao He versifies his own statement about kicking over the tea stove  Teeth and claws open  Producing clouds and thunder  How many times Ive gone through the waves of adverse currents  The sayings of Elder Lang and Mingzhao seem dead If you want to see the living place just look at Xuedou kick ing over the stove  The Golden Fish That Has Passed through the Net Introduction Piercing penetrating one takes the drum and captures the flag Fortified entrenched one inspects the front and oversees the rear Even one who sits on the tigers head and takes the tigers tail is not yet an adept Though an ox head disappears and a horse head returns this too is not yet extraordinary But say how is it when one who has passed beyond measurement comes Story Sansheng asked Xuefeng What does the golden fish that has passed through the net use for food Free in all ways This ques tion is very lofty You must just know for yourselfthen what need is there to ask any further Xuefeng said Ill tell you when you come out of the net He diminishes the other mans reputa tion quite a bit An expert Chan teacher is naturally indepen dent Sansheng said The teacher of fifteen hundred people and you dont even know a saying The sudden peal of thunder re ally startles the crowd  Its not a matter of victory and defeat But what is the eye these two adepts have Sansheng received the secret from Linji He traveled all over and was treated as an eminent guest He doesnt touch on noumenon or Buddhist doctrine instead he asks What does the golden fish thats passed through the net use for food What did he mean Since the golden fish thats passed through the net ordinarily does not eat the tasty food of others what does it use for food You must be beyond categories and classifications you must have attained use of the great function you must have the eye on the foreheadonly then can you be called a golden fish that has passed through the net Still being an adept Xuefeng cant but diminish the others reputation by saying Ill tell you when you come out of the net  See how the two of them held fast to their territories tower ing like gigantic walls With this one sentence of Xuefengs any one but Sansheng would have been unable to go on If you form your understanding in terms of victory and defeat you havent seen Xuefeng even in a dream Look at these two initially both were solitary and strict in the end both were dead and decrepit But say was there still gain and loss victory and defeat Sansheng was the temple keeper for Linji When Linji was about to pass on he said After Im gone dont destroy my trea sury of vision of truth Sansheng came forward and said  How dare we destroy your treasury of vision of truth Linji said What will you do when people ask questions Sansheng shouted Linji said Who would have known that my treasury of vision of truth would die out in this blind donkey Sansheng bowed Since he was a true heir of Linji he dared to respond like this Xuedou just versifies the golden fish that has passed through the net revealing where these adepts saw each other Verse The golden fish that has passed through the net A thousand soldiers are easy to get but one general is hard to find Even the sages cant do anything about it Stop saying it tarries in the water It stands beyond the clouds leaping with life This still isnt the extraordinary part Let it come outwhats to prevent it It flourishes its mane and wags its tail Who can presume to discern the whole A clever trick coming on with a boast yet it undeniably startles the crowd When a thousandfoot whale spouts vast waves fly Its gone over to the other side indeed outstanding swallowing everyone in the world in one gulp At a single thunderclap the pure wind gusts Having eyes and ears but being as if blind and deaf Who is not frightened The pure wind gusts Among gods and humans how many know Why scatter dust and sand  Commentary The golden fish that has passed through the net  Stop saying it tarries in the water Wuzu said this couplet alone completes the verse Since its the golden fish that has passed through the net how could it linger in the water It must be where the vast swelling floods of white foamy waves tower up to the skies But during the twentyfour hours of the day what does it use for food Xuedou said  This matter is picked up and used according to ones capacity When something like the golden fish flourishes its mane and wags its tail  it does in fact shake heaven and earth When a thousandfoot whale spouts vast waves fly This re fers to Sansheng saying The teacher of fifteen hundred people and you dont even know a saying He was like a whale spouting giant waves The pure wind gusts  Among gods and humans how many know When the pure wind arises how many can there be among humans and celestials who will know if you havent entered the gate of great liberation and attained great freedom of action how can you measure the en lightened or be a mirror and guide to enlightenment When tak ing charge of a situation directly whether going along or against vertically or horizontally how will you be able to speak a phrase to express yourself Story A monk asked Yunmen What is every atom samadhi All the Chan practitioners in the world make their nests here His mouth is full of frost Why is he scattering sand and dirt Yunmen said Rice in the bowl water in the bucket A cloth bag filled with awls Gold dust and sand intermingled He adds error to error Inside the palace they dont ask about the capital Commentary Can you settle this properly If you can youve got Yunmen by the nose If not Yunmen has you by the nose Yunmen has say ings that cut through iron In this one statement three statements are present Verse Rice in the bowl water in the bucket Its obvious Why scatter sand and dirt You must wash your mouth out for three years before youll get it The talkative teacher can hardly open his mouth He draws in his tongue Those who know the law fear it Why then bring it up this way Northern dipper southern startheir positions are not different Why call east west Standing sitting still and solemn W hats long is the long reality body whats short is the short reality body Foaming waves flooding the skies arise on level ground Guest and host interchange Suddenly theyre on top of your headthen what will you do Commentary In his earlier verse on Yunmens appropriate statement Xuedou said An appropriate statement  He wedges a stake into the iron hammerhead with no hole In his later verse on apart from all permutations of assertion and denial he says Zhizangs head is white Baizhangs head is black even clear eyed Chan practitioners cannot understand If you can penetrate these stories you will see this present verse Xuedou says right off  Rice in the bowl water in the bucket Theres an echo in his words he shows his capacity in the line The talkative teacher can hardly open his mouth With this he adds footnotes for you If you demand conceptualization of myste rious and marvelous principles it will be even harder to speak At first he holds fast then fearing theres someone with eyes whod see through him he had to forego the primary and bend down to open it up for beginners coming out with a verse to have people see As before the northern dipper is in the north and the southern star is in the south Thus he says Northern dipper south ern startheir positions are not different Foaming waves flooding the skies arise on level ground  When waves suddenly arise on level ground what will you do If you catch sight of it in phenomena its easy if you seek it in your conceptual faculty youll never find it This line is like an iron spike it cant be pulled out and you cant get your teeth into it If you try to discuss it though you wish to understand you wont understand though you wish to stop you wont stop randomly displaying your load of ignorance This is precisely Each and every one is a rich mans son with no britches  A poem by Hanshan says The sun comes up over the cliff but still its dark The mist melts away but the valley is still dim Introduction As soon as there is affirmation and denial you lose your mind in confusion At this point if you intellectualize at all you are still stuck in verbal izations Even if you arrive immediately at the point of soli tary liberation you still are ten thousand miles from home Can you reach it If not just comprehend this issue at hand Story When Xuefeng was living in a hut two monks came to pay re spects Seeing them coming Xuefeng pushed open the door popped out and said What is it Ghost eyes A flute with no holes He raises a his head wearing horns A monk also said What is it A mud ball A feltpounding board The arrow points meet Xuefeng low ered his head and went back inside There are thorns in the soft mud He is like a dragon without feet like a snake with horns This is the hardest of all to handle Later the monk came to Yantou He must ask before he can understand Only one on the same path would know Yantou asked Where are you coming from It takes an adept to do this If Yantou werent Xuefengs peer he might have let him go The monk said Lingnan What news does he bring He must convey the news He mustnt say he didn t go there The monk said Yes A truthful man is hard to find Yan tou said What did he say He should have hit the monk right off hes lost control The monk said He said nothing he lowered his head and went back inside Again he suffers defeat But tell me what is he Yantou said Alas Too bad I didnt tell him the last word before had I told him no one on earth could do anything to Xuefeng A leper drags along a companion Not necessarily Even the polar mountain would be shattered to bits But say where is his trap At the end of the summer the monk again brought up this story to ask for more instruction When the real thief has already been gone for quite a while he draws his bow Yantou said Why didnt you ask before You should turn over his mediation seat The opportunitys passed The monk said I didnt dare to be casual This staff was originally for the monk to be beaten with An imprisoned man increases in wisdom He al most couldnt explain Commentary Whoever would uphold Chan teaching must discern how to take charge of the situation must know when to advance and retreat what is right and wrong when to kill and give life capture and release If ones eyes suddenly blur and go sightless everywhere one goes one questions when questioned and answers when an swered scarcely realizing one is under the control of others One question one answer one capture one releaseright up till today this case has been impenetrable and inexplicable for every one Later due to a persecution of Buddhism Yantou became a ferryman by the shores of a lake On each shore he hung a board anyone who wanted to cross would knock on the board Yantou would call out Which side are you crossing to Then he would come rowing out from among the reeds Xuefeng returned to Lingnan and lived in a hut These monks were longtime students But these monks were unusual too just saying What is it Xuefeng low ered his head and went back inside This is frequently called word less understanding These monks couldnt grasp this Some say that having been questioned by the monks Xuefeng was in fact speechless and so he went back inside They dont know that there is something deadly poisonous in Xuefengs intention Though Xuefeng gained the advantage nevertheless while he hid his body he revealed his shadow Later one monk left Xuefeng and took this story to Yantou to have him settle it If you want to see Xuefeng you should quickly look at this last question Harbor ing a bellyful of doubt he really thought Xuefeng didnt understand At the end of the summer he brought up the story again and asked Yantou about it Yantou said Why didnt you ask earlier The old fellow was crafty If you want to know the last word just this is it Yantou was indeed generous Xuefeng was the cook in Deshans group One day the noon meal was late Deshan went down into the teaching hall with his bowl Xuefeng said  The signal for the meal hasnt been given yetwhere are you going with your bowl Deshan lowered his head and went back to his room without saying anything The next day Deshan lectured in a manner different from usual Yantou clapped and laughed say ing Happily the old guy does understand the last word After this no one on earth will be able to do anything to him Neverthe less hes only got three years When Xuefeng saw Deshan speechless in this story he thought he had gained the advantage He still didnt know that he had run into a bandit Since he had met a bandit later Xuefeng too knew how to be a bandit So an ancient said At the last word one finally reaches the impenetrable barrier They have misunderstood he taught Cleareyed folk have no cliches to nest in As for this last word even if youve personally seen the Chan patriarchs you still wont be able to understand it rationally When Deshans meal was late he picked up his bowl himself and went down into the teaching hall Yantou said Even the great Deshan doesnt understand the last word Xuedou picked this out and said Ive heard that a loneeyed dragon has only one eye all along You certainly didnt know Deshan was a toothless tiger If it hadnt been for Yantou seeing through him how could we know that yesterday and today are not the same Do you want to under stand the last word I only allow that the old foreigner knows not that the old foreigner understands Chan stories from ancient times till now have been extremely diverse like a forest of brambles If you can penetrate no one on earth can do anything to you and all the Buddhas of past present and future defer to you Verse The last word Its already present before anything is said You might think its real If you look right at it youll go blind Is spoken for you The tongue falls to the ground It cant be spoken It has a head but no tail a tail but no head The time of light and dark pair by pair Complicated old fellow Like an ox without horns like a tiger with horns This one and that one are this way Born of the same lineage they share the knowledge What clan is this I too am this way yet others are not I only allow that the old foreigner knows not that the old foreigner understands South north east west let us return Xuedous gathered everyone in His trail is still following the fivecolored thread I ask you for a staff And in the depths of the night together look at the snow on the thousand crags Theres still half a months journey Let the world be covered with snow filling everywhere there is no one who understands You too are just blind people Do you know the last word I hit Commentary The last word is spoken for you When Xuedou made up his verse on this last word he intentionally went to extremes going down into the weeds to help people If you want to see all the way through this is still not enough Daring to say even more Xuedou opened his big mouth and said The time of light and dark pair by pair to open a road for you and also finish it off for you in one line Then at the end he provided even more explanations for you Zhaoqing asked Luoshan When Yantou says Ho so not so not so what is his meaning Luoshan called out Great Mas ter and Zhaoqing responded Luoshan said Both light and both dark Zhaoqing bowed in thanks and left Three days later he questioned Luoshan again Luoshan said Ive already told you the whole thing Zhaoqing said Please light the way Luoshan told him to ask what he had doubts about Zhaoqing said What is both light and both dark  Luoshan said  Born the same and dying the same Zhaoqing then bowed in thanks and left Later a monk asked Zhaoqing How is it when being born the same and dying the same Zhaoqing said Shut your dog mouth  The monk said Just try to eat with your mouth shut The monk then came to ask Luoshan the same question Luoshan said Like an ox without horns The monk said  Then how about being born the same but not dying the same Luoshan said Like a tiger with horns The last word is precisely this truth A monk in Luoshans group used this idea to put a question to Zhaoqing If I spoke a phrase on the eastern continent they would know it on the western continent too If I spoke a phrase in heaven they would also know it on earth All minds know each other all eyes perceive each other  Born of the same lineage theyre still easy to see Not dying in the same lineage theyre utterly separate and not even the Bud dha or Bodhidharma can find them South north east west let us return Theres something of a good world And in the depths of the night together look at the snow on the thousand crags Tell me is this both light and both dark or is it born of the same lineage or is it dying in the same lineage Story A monk asked Zhaozhou Long have I heard of the stone bridge of Zhaozhou but now that Ive come here I only see a simple log bridge Heres another one who comes to grab the tigers whiskers This is the proper business of Chan practitioners Zhaozhou said You only see the log bridge not the stone bridge Zhaozhou is accus tomed to getting the advantage Hes selling off his body The monk asked What is the stone bridge Hes climbed onto the hook after all Zhaozhou said It lets asses cross it lets horses cross In fact all the people in the world have no place to breathe once dead they dont come back to life again Commentary In the state of Zhaozhou theres a stone bridge built in ancient times famed throughout the country Intentionally downgrading Zhaozhou this monk questioned him by saying Long have I heard of the stone bridge of Zhaozhou but now that Ive come here I only see a simple log bridge Zhaozhou immediately said You only see the log bridge not the stone bridge based on the question This seems like ordinary conversation but Zhaozhou used it to hook him The monk after all climbed onto the hook he followed up behind and asked What is the stone bridge Zhaozhou said It lets asses cross it lets horses cross  Inevitably Zhaozhou natu rally has a place to come forth in his words One day Zhaozhou was with the head monk looking at the stone bridge he asked Who built this The monk said Li Ying did Zhaozhou said Where did he start The monk had no re ply Zhaozhou said Youre always talking about the stone bridge but when asked about where it started you dont even know Once when Zhaozhou was sweeping the floor a monk asked You are enlightenedwhy is there dust  Zhaozhou said The great way runs to the capital  Zhaozhou was always using such devices he would go to the peace of ordinary reality to help people He never cut his hand on the sharp point naturally he was solitary and strict using these devices most wondrously Verse He doesnt set up the solitary in that his way is lofty The words are still in our ears This is due to his own provisions Entering the ocean he must hook a giant tortoise He occupies the essential crossing and doesnt let profane or holy pass Shrimps or clams snails or oysters arent worth asking about People of power dont come by twos and threes His contemporary Guanxi is worth a laugh Theres been another such man whos come this way with such ability to use active devices Though he was able to say whistling arrow  his effort was in vain He looks alike but isnt really the same Commentary He doesnt set up the solitary in that his way is lofty Xuedou is praising Zhaozhous usual way of helping people He doesnt es tablish mysteries or marvels doesnt set up the solitary He isnt like those who say that only breaking up space shattering the polar mountain producing dust on the ocean floor and pounding waves on the polar mountain can be called the Way of Chan Thus Xuedou says his way is lofty in that he doesnt set up the solitary Others may tower like gigantic walls to display the extraordinary effects of Buddhism but though theyre solitary and lofty this is not as good as not setting up the solitary and simply acting ordi nary naturally turning smoothly When capacity goes beyond the solitary only then do we see profound wonders Thus Xuedou says Entering the ocean he must hook a giant tortoise Observe Zhaozhou He doesnt hook shrimps or clams snails or oystershe only hooks giant tortoises This line is used to illustrate a story His contemporary Guanxi is worth a laugh A monk asked Guanxi Ive long heard of Guanxi  now that Ive come here I only see a flax soaking pool Guanxi said You just see the flax soaking pool not the pouring moun tain stream The monk said What is the pouring mountain stream Guanxi said Swift as a whistling arrow A monk asked Huanglong Ive long heard of Huanglong Yel low Dragon but now that Ive come here I only see a red striped snake Huanglong said You only see the red striped snake not the yellow dragon The monk said What is the yellow dragon Huanglong said Slithering along The monk said What about when it suddenly encounters a dragoneating bird Huanglong said Difficult to stay alive The monk said If so itll be eaten by the bird Huanglong said Thanks for feeding m e These are both cases of setting up the solitary They did not equal Zhaozhous ordinary action Thus Xuedou says Though he was able to say whistling arrow his effort was in vain Leaving Guanxi and Huanglong aside for the moment how will you understand when Zhaozhou says It lets asses cross it lets horses cross Try to do it Introduction The whole world does not hide itthe entire capacity stands alone revealed Encountering situations without getting stuck with ev ery move adepts have the ability to come forth With no partiality in their statements everywhere they have the intent to kill people But in the end where did the ancients rest Story Once when Mazu and Baizhang were walking they saw some wild ducks fly by Two people in the weeds rolling around in the weeds Why suddenly notice Mazu asked Whats that You should know Teacher This old fellow doesnt even know his nostrils Baizhang said Wild ducks Hes already been taken in tow The second ladleful of foul water will be even more poisonous Mazu said Where have they gone His first arrow was still light the second goes deep A second enticing peck Here too one should know for oneself Baizhang said Flown away He just rolls along behind Mazu The nose born of his parents is in the hands of another Mazu turned the spear around and twisted Baizhangs nose around Baizhang cried out in pain Its right here Can it be called wild ducks Are you conscious of pain Mazu said When have they ever flown away Better not deceive people All along this old fellow has been living in a ghost cave Commentary If you observe with the true eye unexpectedly its Baizhang who has the correct basis while Mazu is creating waves where theres no wind If you want to be teacher of Buddhas and patriarchs then study Baizhang if you want to be unable to save even your self then study Mazu See how those ancients were never absent from Here twentyfour hours a day He became a dedi cated disciple of Mazu and served as his attendant for twenty years But these days some say Where there is fundamentally no enlightenment they construct the gate of enlightenment setting this matter up  If you view it in this way you are like a flea on a lions body feeding on the lions flesh An ancient said If the source is not deep the flow is not long if the wisdom is not great the vision is not far reaching If you think enlightenment is a con struct how could Buddhism have come down to the present Once when Mazu and Baizhang were walking they saw some wild ducks fly by How could Mazu not have known they were wild ducks Why did he nevertheless ask like this When Baizhang merely ran after him Mazu then twisted his nose Baizhang cried out in pain and Mazu said When have they ever flown away At this Baizhang had insight But these days some people misunderstand as soon as theyre questioned they make a cry of pain They cant leap out When Chan teachers help people they must make them pen etrate You see Baizhang didnt understand he didnt avoid cut ting his hand on the point Mazu just wanted to make him understand this matter Observe how Mazu and Baizhang acted though they seem radiant and spiritual yet they dont remain in radiance and spiri tuality Baizhang cried out in pain if you see it as such the whole world doesnt hide it and it is perfectly manifest everywhere Thus it is said Penetrate one point and you penetrate myriad points all at once When Mazu went into the hall the next day as soon as the congregation had assembled Baizhang came forward and rolled up the bowing mat Mazu then left his seat and went back to his room Afterwards he asked Baizhang I had just gone up in the hall and had not yet lectured why did you roll up the mat right away Baizhang said Yesterday I had my nose twisted by you and it hurt  Mazu said Where were you keeping your mind yes terday Baizhang said  Today the nose no longer hurts Mazu said You have deep knowledge of the matter of Today Baizhang then bowed and returned to the attendants quarters crying An other attendant asked why he was crying he said Go ask the teacher The attendant went to ask Mazu Mazu said Go ask Baizhang When the attendant returned to ask Baizhang Bai zhang laughed The attendant said You were just cryingnow why are you laughing Baizhang said Before I was crying now Im laughing Observe Baizhang after enlightenment turning smoothly he cant be trapped hes sparkling clear on all sides Theyre extremely numerous Mazu saw them coming and had a conversation What end is there to creating complications What did they say Mazu alone recognizes the outstanding one He told all about the scene of the clouds on the mountains and the moon over the sea The ladle handle of the eastern house is long the ladle handle of the western house is short Who knows how many complications he created Still not understanding Baizhang said theyd flown away Dont say he didnt know how to speak Where did they fly off to He wanted to fly away He was in anothers grip Dont make a wild duck cry Heavens Who knows where they went to Commentary Xuedou makes his verse directly saying Wild ducks  Who knows where they are How many are there Mazu saw them coming and had a conversation  This refers to Mazu asking Baizhang What is that and Baizhang saying Wild ducks He told all about the scene of the clouds on the mountains and the moon over the sea This refers to Mazu again asking Where have they gone Mazus intent for Baizhang was to reveal every thing spontaneously  This is where Xuedou turns himself How will you speak If you make a cry of pain youre wrong if you dont make a cry of pain then how do you understand Though Xuedou versifies most wondrously no matter what he does he cant leap out either Introduction Having penetrated beyond birth and death one sets devices in motion perfectly at ease one shears through iron and cuts nails wherever one goes one covers the universe Tell me whose behav ior is this Story Yunmen asked a monk Where did you come here from  Dont say Xichan Dont say east west north or south The monk said Xichan As it turns out hes too literal At that moment the monk should have given him some of his own provisions Yunmen said What is being said at Xichan these days Xichan was like you teacher talking in your sleep The monk extended both hands Hes been defeated He took in a thief and got his house ransacked This will inevitably cause people to doubt Yunmen slapped him He acts according to the imperative The monk should be hit The monk is being given an excellent mount but he doesnt know how to ride it The monk was speech less Yunmen hit him Dont let him go Yunmen said What is being said at Xichan these days This too is just ordinary conversation The monk was speechless so Yunmen hit him Looksince Yunmen is an adept whenever he takes a step he knows where the step comes down He knows how to observe in front and take notice behind not losing his way This monk only knows how to look ahead hes unable to observe behind Verse At once he takes the tigers head and the tigers tail The sword that kills the sword that gives life A thousand soldiers are easy to get but one general is hard to find His stern majesty extends everywhere I ask back  Didnt you know how dangerous it w as You shouldnt blindly fetter and beat them After all Xuedou himself doesnt know You are about to get hit yourself Xuedou says I leave off Had he not left off then what Everyone on earth loses out all at once I hit the meditation seat once Commentary Xuedous verse on this story is easy to understand its overall in tent is to praise the sharp point of Yunmens ability Thus he says At once he takes the tigers head and the tigers tail  An ancient said Occupy the tigers head take the tigers tail and then at the first statement youll understand the source meaning Xuedou just settles the case on the basis of the facts He likes the way Yunmen is able to occupy the tigers head and also take the tigers tail When the monk extended his hands and Yunmen hit him this was occupying the tigers head When Yunmen extended his hands and the monk was speechless so that Yunmen hit him again this was taking the tigers tail When head and tail are taken to gether the eye is like a shooting star Yunmen is naturally like lightning in fact  His stern maj esty extends everywhere The wind whistles all over the world I ask back Didnt you know how dangerous it was  Un avoidably there was danger Xuedou says I leave off But say right now as I dont leave off then what Everyone in the world will have to take a beating Chan followers these days all say that when Yunmen extend ed his hands the monk should have repaid him with some of his own provisions This seems correct but in reality it isnt Yunmen cant just get you to stop this way onlythere must be something else besides In contact with the flow in control of things one assumes responsi bility directly As for cutting off confusion instantaneously or tow ering like a gigantic wall where one sits on the tigers head and takes the tigers tail this I leave aside for the moment Story a Daowu and Jianyuan went to make a condolence call Jianyuan hit the coffin and said Alive or dead What is he saying He sure isnt alert He is lingering in duality Daowu said I wont say alive and I wont say dead When a dragon howls fog ap pears when a tiger roars wind rises He buys the hat to fit the head As it turns out he misunderstands Daowu said I wont say I wont say  He pours foul water right on Jianyuans head The first arrow was still light the second arrow goes deep On the way back Jianyuan said Tell me right away or Ill hit you Now hes getting somewhere Its rare to meet an adept you often encounter people who cling to fixed points of reference Idiots like this go to hell like a shot Daowu said You may hit me but I wont say He must repeat this again and again This old guys whole body is covered with muddy water His original attitude is unchanging Jianyuan then hit him A good whack There have always been people who have received unjust beat ings Later Daowu passed on He doesnt know whether hes right or wrongif hes right that would be amazing Shishuang said I wont say alive and I wont say dead Yet there have always been people who have this kind of food and drink Jianyuan said Why wont you say Though his words are the same his intent is different Is this the same as his asking before or different Shishuang said I wont say I wont say Throughout the universe If the waves of Chan were alike innumerable ordinary people would get bogged down At these words Jianyuan had an insight Better not fool me One day Jianyuan took a hoe into the teaching hall and walked back and forth He has found life within death He should show some life for his late teacher Too bad he was not so careful at first Why gather in crowds Xuedou added a comment Heavens heavens Too latehe draws the bow after the thief is gone What has the late teacher ever said to you All along this fellow has been unable to get himself out Taiyuan Fu said The late teachers relics are still present Does everyone see Theyre like a flash of light ning What worn out straw sandals are these Fu has realized a little bit Commentary Daowu and Jianyuan went to a house to make a condolence call Jianyuan hit the coffin and said Alive or dead Daowu said I wont say alive and I wont say dead If you can immediately penetrate at these lines if at these words you immediately know the point then this is the key to penetrating beyond life and death Observe how these ancients were always mindful of this mat ter whatever they were doing As soon as they got to the house to ib offer condolences Jianyuan hit the coffin and asked Daowu Alive or dead Without stirring a bit Daowu replied I wont say alive I wont say dead Jianyuan was face to face with it but he stumbled past running after the other mans words going on to say Why wont you say Daowu said I wont say I wont say Daowu could be said to have compassionately met an error with an error This is what is called a good intention not getting a good reward Even so Daowu won the point Daowu was dripping with blood like this to help him but Jianyuan was unseeing After being hit Daowu told Jianyuan You should go away for a while if the monastery director finds out he may make trouble for you Extremely kind Daowu secretly sent Jianyuan away Later Jianyuan came to a small temple where he heard a work man reciting the Avalokitesvara scripture where it says To those who would attain salvation as monks he appears as a monk to teach them If you understand this way how will you attain tranquillity If you walk the real earth you arent even a hairs breadth away Once seven women sages were walking through a cremation ground One pointed to a corpse and asked the others The corpse is here where is the person The eldest sister said What But how many are like this Maybe one out of ten thousand Shishuang too said I wont say alive and I wont say dead One day Jianyuan took a hoe into the teaching hall and walked back and forth He intended to display his insight Sure enough Shishuang asked him What are you doing Jianyuan said Look ing for relics of the late teacher  Shishuang then cut off his foot steps saying Immense waves spread far and wide foaming billows flood the skieswhat relics of the late master are you looking for  Since Jianyuan was looking for relics of the late teacher why did Shishuang nevertheless talk to him this way At this point if you can comprehend the words I wont say alive I wont say dead then you will know that the entire capacity is put to use through out If you make up rationalizations hesitate and ponder then it will be impossible to see Daowus skull bone was golden when struck it sounded like metal Xuedou commented  Heavens heavens His mean ing comes down on both sides Havent you heard it said that if you penetrate one point you penetrate myriad points at once If you can penetrate I wont say I wont say then you silence everyone on earth If not you must study for yourself and awaken yourself Verse Rabbits and horses have horns Oxen and rams have no horns What pattern is forming  Nary a hair nary a wisp  In the heavens and on earth I alone am the honored one Where will you search Like mountains like peaks Where are they Waves arising on level ground They clog your nostrils The golden relics still exist right now Cutting off tongues choking throats I put them to one side I only fear there wont be anyone who can recognize them With foaming waves flooding the skies where can they be put They cant be put in your eyes or ears Theres no place to put them After all But as it turns out hes sunk in a deep pit Even Bodhidharma on his way back West has lost them Ill hit saying Then why are they here Commentary Xuedou knows how to add footnotes exceptionally well He is a descendant of Yunmen with the ability to include three state ments in each statement He produces the most crucial and essential point in verse immediately saying Rabbits and horses have horns  Oxen and rams have no horns Why do rabbits and horses have horns Why have oxen and rams no horns Only if you can penetrate the preceding story will you realize Xue dou has a way to help people Some mistakenly say Not saying is saying no statement is a statement Though rabbits and horses have no horns Xuedou says they do though oxen and rams have horns Xuedou says they dont But this has nothing to do with it They dont know that the ancients myriad changes manifesting such spiritual powers were just to break up your psychic ghost cave If you can pen etrate through its not even worth using the word understand Rabbits and horses have horns  Oxen and rams have no horns N ary a hair nary a wisp  Like mountains like peaks These four lines are like a wishfulfilling jewel Xuedou has spit it out whole right in front of you The last part of the verse is all settling the case according to the facts  The golden relics still exist right now  With foaming waves flooding the skies where can they be put This versifies the statements of Shishuang and Taiyuan Fu Why is there no place to put them Even Bodhidharma on his way back West has lost them The sacred tortoise is dragging its tailthis is where Xuedou turns around to help people An ancient said Just study the living word not the dead word Since the relics are lost why is that bunch still struggling over them One Arrow Smashes Three Barriers Introduction Buddhas have never appeared in the worldthere is no doctrine to be given to people The Chan founder never came from India he never passed on the mind transmission Since people now do not understand they frantically search outside themselves They still dont know that the one great matter right where they are can not be grasped even by the sages Right now where do seeing and not seeing hearing and not hearing speaking and not speaking knowing and not knowing come from If you cannot apprehend clearly then try to understand inside the cave of complications Story Chan student Liang asked Qinshan How is it when a single ar rowhead penetrates three barriers Danger Undeniably extraor dinary a fierce general Qinshan said Bring out the lord within the barriers He comes on directly He wants everyone to know Zhu is high Mt An is low Liang said So then knowing my fault I must change He sees the opportunity and acts When the wind blows the grass bends Liang said A well shot arrow doesnt hit any where and set off So he is trying to change his plea He strikes with his second blow but Qinshan feels no pain Qin shan said Come here a minute Summoning is easy dispatch ing is hard What good is someone who turns when called Liang turned his head Qinshan held him and said Leaving aside for the moment a single arrowhead penetrating three barriers lets see you shoot an ar row He lies down in the tigers mouth Waves against the cur rent Having seen ones duty but not doing it is lack of courage Liang hesitated Id hit saying Too bad Qinshan hit him seven times and said Ill allow as this fellow will be doubting for thirty years The im perative must be so Theres a beginning theres an end Qinshan is correct at the beginning and correct at the end Its Qinshan who should receive this beating Commentary Liang was undeniably a battletested general In Qinshans hand he turned to the left and revolved to the right bringing down his whip and flashing his stirrups In the end what a pityhis bow is broken his arrows are used up Even so General Li Guang had a glorious reputation but was never enfeoffed so it was useless Taking charge of a situation one brings it up face to face face to face taking charge of the situation is swift Throughout there is no falling into being and nonbeing or gain and loss This is called mysterious activity This monk too was a brave spirited Chan monk he posed a question that really startles the crowd How is it when a single arrow penetrates three barriers Qinshans re ply meant For the moment leave aside your shooting through try to bring out the lord within the barriers Liangs saying So then knowing my fault I must change was undeniably extraordi nary Finally Liang just said A wellshot arrow doesnt hit any where and turned to leave As soon as he saw him talking this way Qinshan immediately called out to him Come here a minute After all Liang couldnt hold fast he turned his head Qinshan held him and said Leaving aside for the moment a single arrow penetrating three barriers lets see you shoot an arrow When Liang hesitated Qinshan struck him seven times After this he went on to pronounce a curse on Liang saying Ill allow this fel low will be doubting for thirty years Chang followers these days all say Why didnt he hit him eight times or six times Why just seven times Or else why didnt he hit him immediately as he was asking him to try to shoot This may seem right but really isnt For this story you must not cherish the least bit of rationalizing calculation in your mind you must pass beyond the words Only then will you be able to have a way to penetrate the three barriers at a single statement and to shoot an arrow At that time if the monk had been a real man Qinshan would have been in great danger too But tell me ultimately who is the lord within the barriers Verse I bring out the lord within the barriers for you You who would shoot an arrow dont be careless Once dead one doesnt come back to life Very obscure Gone by Take an eye and the ears go deaf In the left eye half a pound He lets his move go On the left not advancing on the right not retreating Let go an ear and the eyes both go blind In the right eye eight ounces He finds only one road Advance and you fall into a pit retreat and a ferocious tiger bites you I can admire a single arrow point penetrating three barriers How is it when the entire capacity comes forth this way What is he saying The barriers have been smashed the barriers have fallen The trail of the arrow is truly clear You dont see A great adept is the primordial ancestor of mind With one line he cuts off the flow and puts myriad impulses to rest Before heaven and earth and the world existed where would you live Commentary c Several lines of this verse draw on a verse of Guizong In Chan this is called talk of the source message and Guizong was given the name Return to the Source Later Tongan heard of this story and said Mr Liang was well able to shoot arrows but he didnt know how to hit the tar get A monk asked How can one hit the target Tongan said Who is the lord within the barriers Later a monk cited this to Qinshan Qinshan said Even if Mr Although he is right Dongan is not goodhearted Xuedou says I bring out the lord within the barriers for you Open your eyes and you can see close your eyes and you can see too With form without formall is cut into three You who would shoot an arrow dont be careless If you are able to shoot well you wont be careless Take an eye and the ears go deaf  Let go an ear and the eyes both go blind When an eye is taken why do the ears then go deaf When an ear is let go why do the eyes then go blind You can penetrate these words only if you have no grasping and rejec tion if you grasp and reject it will be impossible to see  I can admire a single arrow point penetrating three barri ers  The trail of the arrow is truly clear Liang asked How is it when a single arrow point penetrates three barriers Qinshan said Bring out the lord within the barriers These statements and everything down to Tongans case at the end are all the trail of the arrow In the end how is it You dont see  Xuansha had words for this  A great adept is the primordial ancestor of mind  It is commonplace to take mind as the ultimate principle of Chan here though why is the great adept still the ancestor of this mind even before the universe was born If you can thoroughly understand this time only then will you be able to recognize the lord within the barriers  The trail of the arrow is truly clear If you want to hit the target there clearly is a trail behind the arrow But what is the trail behind the arrow Before youll understand you must apply concentrated mental effort on your own A great adept is the primordial ancestor of mind Xuansha often taught his disciples this This is from a verse of Guizongs which Xuedou wrongly attributes to Xuansha Students of today who take this mind as the original source can study till kingdom come and still never understand For one who is a great adept even mind is still just the descendant Before the universe is already the sec ondary at just such a time what is before the universe Introduction i i a Before you penetrate it seems like a silver mountain an iron wall Once you have penetrated all along it was your self that was the silver mountain the iron wall  If on the other hand you are not yet thus observe the look of an ancient Story A monk asked Zhaozhou The supreme Way has no difficulties just avoid discrimination What is not discriminating So many people cannot swallow these iron brambles There are many people who have doubts about this A mouthful of frost Zhaozhou said In the whole universe I alone am the honored one He heaps up a pile of bones on level ground A talisman hard as cast iron The monk said  This is still discrimination As it turns out hes rolled along after Zhaozhou He challenges the old fellow Zhaozhou said Stupid oaf His eyes open wide his mouth is agape Commentary The monk questioned Zhaozhou about the saying  The supreme Way has no difficultiesjust avoid discrimination There are quite a few people who misunderstand If you understand this way you wont even see it in a dream in ten thousand years Zhaozhou often used this saying to question people this monk turned around and used it to question him If you look in the words this monk does after all startle heaven and shake the earth If it is not in the words then what Study for thirty more years You must be able to turn this little key before it will open To grab the tigers whiskers you need your own abilities Heedless of the mortal danger the monk dared to grab the tigers whiskers and said  This is still discrimination Zhaozhou immediately blocked him by saying Stupid oaf Where is the dis crimination Had the monk asked anyone else he would have seen him flustered and confused Zhaozhou moved where it was impossible to move turned where it was impossible to turn If you can pass through all kinds of vicious words and mundane nonsense are exquisite when you get to the real point then you see Zhaozhous naked heart Where is the discrimination The eye of Chan teachers must be thus like the golden winged bird parting the ocean waters to seize a dragon directly and swallow it Verse Deep as the ocean What measure is this The abyssal source is impossible to fathom There is still a half yet unattained Firm as a mountain b A mosquito sports in the fierce wind in the sky There are some like this After all he didnt assess his strength he certainly didnt measure himself An ant tries to shake an iron pillar Theres no different dirt in the same hole Hes out of touch Youre a fellow student with him Discrimination Carrying water to sell at the river What is he saying Zhaozhou is here A cloth drum under the eaves It is already there before anything is said Theyre buried in the same pit extremely numerous  Commentary Xuedou explains Zhaozhous two lines in the story by saying  Deep as the ocean  Firm as a mountain The monk said  This is still discrimination so Xuedou says that this monk is like a mosquito playing in a gale like an ant trying to shake an iron pillar Xuedou praises this monks bravery Where is the discrimination Isnt this a fierce wind an iron pillar Discrimination  A cloth drum under the eaves At the end Xuedou picks this up to bring you to life If you recognize it clearly you are carrying the whole thing yourself If you want intimate understanding dont use a question to ask  That is why the cloth drum under the eaves  Story A monk asked Zhaozhou The supreme Way has no difficulties just avoid discrimination isnt this a clich for people today A double case This too is a point that makes people doubt Hes tread ing on a scale beam hard as iron Theres still this Dont judge others based on yourself Zhaozhou said Once someone asked me and I simply couldnt explain for five years Honest speech is better than a red face A monkey eats a caterpillar a mosquito bites an iron ox Commentary Zhaozhou usually didnt hit or shout his action went beyond hit ting and shouting This monks question was also very special it would have been hard for anyone but Zhaozhou to answer Since Zhaozhou was an adept he just said Once someone asked me and I simply couldnt explain for five years The question was like a huge wall and the answer didnt make light of it When Wayfarer Zong was the scribe in Xuedous community Xuedou had him contemplate The supreme way has no difficulties just avoid discrimination Thereby Zong had an awakening  Zong said Animal animal Later he lived in seclusion Whenever he went to teach he wrapped his straw sandals and his scriptures in his vestment Since this story is one question i ic and one answer clear and perfectly obvious why did Zhaozhou say he couldnt explain And tell me is this a clich for people today or not Did Zhaozhou answer him inside or outside the nest of cliches You must realize that this matter isnt in words One who penetrates the bone and marrow whose trust is thoroughgoing will be like a dragon in water like a tiger in the mountains Verse The elephant king trumpets Noblest of the noble riches of the rich Who isnt awed All the beasts brains burst A good route to enter by Flavorless talk When were reviling each other you may lock jaws with me Its like an iron spike where is there to bite into He couldnt explain for five years and more carrying all China in a single leaf boat far in the distant flats waves are rising who knows there is another better realm of thought Chokes people off What are you saying South north east west Is there In the heavens on earth Heavens heavens The raven flies the rabbit runs Commentary Zhaozhou said Once someone asked me and I simply couldnt explain for five years  This is like an elephant trumpeting a lion roaring flavorless talk choking people off South north east west  The raven flies the rabbit runs If Xuedou didnt have the last lines where else would he have come from Since the raven flies and the rabbit runs tell me where do Zhaozhou Xuedou and I end up Introduction He includes the heavens and encompasses the earth going be yond holy and profane He points out the ineffable mind of Nir vana in the midst of all things and decisively establishes the lifeline of Chan practitioners in the midst of trials and tribulations Tell me endowed with whose power can one get to be this way Story A monk asked Zhaozhou The supreme Way has no difficulties just avoid discrimination  Again its hauled out What is he say ing A triple case As soon as there are words spoken this is discrimination So how do you help people Zhaozhou said Why dont you quote this saying in full The thief is a small man but his wisdom surpasses a lords Zhaozhou is a thief who steals in broad daylight Hes riding the bandits horse in pursuit of the bandit The monk said I only remember up to here Two people playing with mud The monk has met a robber The supreme Way has no difficultiesjust avoid discrimination  In the end its up to this old fellow The supreme Way has no difficultiesjust avoid discrimination is like a spark like light ning Capturing and releasing killing and giving lifehe has such free mastery All agree Zhaozhou has eloquence beyond the com mon crowd ia Zhaozhou often taught with this saying Someone else would have been unable to handle this monk but Zhaozhou was an adept he immediately said Why not quote this saying in full The monk too knew how to turn around and show his mettle he said I only remember up to here It seems just like an arrangement Zhaozhou answered directly not needing any calculations An ancient said of this Continuity is indeed difficult Zhaozhou distinguished dragons from snakes and differentiated right from wrong after all a true adept He snatched the monks eyes away without running afoul of his sharp point Its wrong to say either that he made a statement or didnt make a statement nor will it do to say he neither made nor didnt make a statement If one discusses this matter it is like sparks like lightning Only if you look quickly can you see it If you vacillate you wont avoid losing your life Verse Water poured on cannot wet What are you saying Too deep and remote What is there to discuss Wind blowing cannot penetrate Like space Hard impervious Address your plea to the sky The tiger prowls the dragon walks Ghosts howl spirits wail When the wind blows the grasses bend Are you not a fellow student of theirs His head is three feet longI wonder who it is Standing on one foot he answers back without speaking He draws back his head and lets his move go Mountain sprite He shouldnt be let go so I strike Commentary Water poured on cannot wet  Wind blowing cannot penetrate  The tiger prowls the dragon walks  Ghosts howl spirits wail Theres no place for you to chew on These four lines refer to Zhaozhous answer which is indeed like a dragon galloping a ti ger charging This monk just got an embarrassment Not only this monk even the ghosts howl the spirits wail Its like when the wind blows the grasses bow Of the final two lines it could be said One son has intimately understood His head is three feet longI wonder who it is  Standing on one foot he answers back without speaking A monk asked an ancient What is the Buddha The ancient said The head is three feet long the neck two inches long Xuedou draws on this to use in the verse Do you people recognize him Not even I know him All at once Xuedou has fully depicted Zhaozhou The real one has always been withinall of you must investigate care fully and try to see it The Staff Changes into a Dragon Introduction Buddhas and sentient beingsfundamentally theres no difference between them Mountains rivers and oneselfhow could there be any distinction Why then is it all divided into two sides If you dont let go the whole earth isnt worth grasping But what is the place to set words turning Story Yunmen showed his staff to the assembly and said He transforms according to the occasion The sword that kills the sword that brings life Hes snatched your eyes away  The staff has changed into a dragon and swal lowed the universe No Chan practitioners can preserve their lives Where will you settle and live Moun tains rivers the whole earthwhere are they to be found In the ten directions there are no walls on the four sides there are no gates East west south north the four intermediate points above below What about this Commentary The staff has changed into a dragon and swallowed the universe Where are the mountains rivers and earth to be found If you say they exist you are blind if you say they dont exist you are dead Do you see where Yunmen helped people Bring the staff back to me People these days do not understand Yunmens solitary rev elation Instead they say he went to form to explain mind relied on things to reveal principle But the Buddha couldnt have been ignorant of this theory as he taught the Dharma for fortynine years why then did he also need to hold up the flower for Kasyapas smile The old fellow then caused confusion by saying I have the treasury of vision of truth the ineffable mind of Nirvanathese I pass on to Kasyapa Why was there still a need for the specially transmitted mind seal Given that you are Chan students do you understand this specially transmitted mind If there is a single thing in your heart then mountains riv ers the whole earth appear in profusion before you if there isnt anything in your heart then outside there is nothing at all How can you talk about principle and knowledge fusing about world and mind merging Whats the reason When one is understood all are understood when one is clear all are clear How can you talk about revealing mind in form demonstrating prin ciple by phenomena If you can know this atom you can know the staff As soon as Yunmen picks up his staff we immediately see his unconfined marvelous activity Bajiao said If you have a staff Ill give you a staff if you have no staff Ill take your staff away Yongjia said  This is not an empty exhibition of form it is the actual traces of the Buddhas precious staff Long ago in the time of Dlpankara Buddha the future Bud dha spread his hair to cover some mud for that Buddha Dipankara said A temple should be built here An elder present thereupon set up a blade of grass there and said The temple has been built  Tell me receive what rightly Should you clap your hands Verse The staff swallows the universe  What is he saying The staff is used only for beating dogs He vainly talks of peach blossoms floating on the rushing waves Open the passage to the beyond and all the sages will stand downwind Its not a matter of grasping clouds and fog Being able to say it thousands of times isnt as good as catching it once For those with tails burnt off its not a matter of grasping clouds and fog On all sidesI just observe Its just a stick of dry firewood Why should the exhausted ones necessarily lose their courage and spirit Everyones temper is like a kings One simply must be completely free  Leftover soup spoiled food Its about to reach your head  With seventytwo blows Im letting you off easy Ive never carried out this imperative but if you are going to act according to the imperative its lucky you found me Even with one hundred fifty its hard to forgive you A just order must be carried out How could it only be this many Even if he gave three thousand blows in the morning and eight hundred in the evening what good would it do Xuedou suddenly picked up his staff and came down from his seat All at once the assembly scattered and fled Why does Xuedou have a dragons head but a snakes tail Commentary Ynnmen helps people by a circuitous path Xuedou helps people by a direct shortcut Thats why Xuedou discards the transforma tion into a dragon he doesnt need such talk just the staff swal lows the universe Xuedous intent is to have people avoid fanciful interpretations He goes on to say He vainly talks of peach blos soms floating on the rushing waves Theres no further need for changing into a dragon At the Gate of Yu theres a three level rapids every year in the third month when the peach blossoms bloom and the waves rise the fish who can go against the current and leap past the rapids change into dragons Xuedou says that even if they change into dragons this too is still vain talk For those with tails burnt off its not a matter of grasping clouds and fog When fish pass through the Gate of Yu a celestial fire burns their tails they grab the clouds and fog and depart Xuedou means that though they change into dragons it still isnt a matter of grabbing clouds and fog Why should the exhausted ones necessarily lose their courage and spirit A scripture com mentary says Even bodhisattvas who have built up practice gasp for breath at the gate of Y u  This means that the realm of the cosmic unity is not something mastered by small virtue or small knowledge Its like the fish trying to pass through the Gate of Yu where those who cannot pass through fail and fall back lying in the shoals of stagnant water exhausted and gasping Xuedou means that once they fail and fall back they always lose their courage and spirit  I have picked it up  Do you hear or not Again he adds footnotes all at once hes swept it clean for you With seventytwo blows Im still letting you off easy  Even with a hundred fifty its hard to forgive you Xuedou has discarded the heavy for the light for your sake An ancient said Seventytwo blows turns into one hundred fifty These days people misun derstand and just calculate numerically and say It should be seventyfive blows why is it instead just seventytwo blows  They still dont realize that the ancients meaning was outside the words Thus it is said  This matter is not in words Xuedou drew on this to use in order to avoid people later on trying to rationalize Even if youre truly free you still rightly deserve seventytwo blows this is still letting you off easy If youre not free like this at all it would be hard to let you go with one hundred fifty Nevertheless there wasnt even one with blood under his skin Introduction b To set up the banner of the teaching and establish its fundamental message is a matter for a genuine master To judge dragons and snakes and distinguish initiate from naive one must be an accomplished teacher As for discussing killing and giving life on the edge of a sword discerning what is appropriate for the moment with a staff this I leave aside for the moment just tell me in one phrase how you will assess the matter of occupying the heartland singlehandedly Story Fengxue said He rouses clouds and brings rain He wants to be host and be guest If you set up a single atom  I am king of the teaching autonomous master of the teaching Clusters of flowers clusters of brocade the nation flourishes This is not the busi ness of his house if you do not set up a single atom He sweeps away the tracks and obliterates the traces having lost the eyes the nostrils are gone too the nation perishes Everywhere light shines What is the use of the nation This is entirely the business of his house Xuedou raised his staff and said One must stand like a milehigh wall to accomplish this Bodhidharma is here Are there any Chan practitioners who will live together and die together Return the story to me If you do I admit you are free If not you get hit three thousand times in the morning eight hundred times in the evening Commentary If you set up a single atom the nation flourishes if you dont set up a single atom the nation perishes When you get here your great function must become manifest before youll understand That is why Fengxue said Even if you can grasp it before it is spoken of still this is remaining in the shell wandering in limita tion even if you thoroughly penetrate it at a single phrase you still wont avoid insane views on the way Fengxue was an adept in the line of Linji he directly used his own provisions If you set up a single atom the nation flourishes and the old peasants frown The meaning lies in the fact that to i c establish a nation and stabilize the country it is necessary to rely on crafty ministers and valiant generals after that the unicorn appears the phoenix soarsthese are the auspicious symbols of the halcyon How could the people of threefamily villages know there are such things When you do not set up a single atom the nation perishes the wind blows chill why do the old peasants come out and sing hallelujah Just because the nation has perished there is no more Buddha nor sentient beings no affirmation no negation no good no badit is beyond sound and echo track or trace That is why it is said  Though gold dust is precious in the eye it ob structs vision And it is said Gold dust is a cataract on the eye the jewel in ones clothes is the defilement of the Dharma When even ones own spirit is not esteemed who are the Buddhas and patriarchs Piercing and penetrating spiritual powers and their wondrous action would not be considered exceptional when one gets here with the patch robe over the head myriad concerns ceaseat this time one does not understand anything at all If one were to speak any more of mind of nature of the profound of the wondrous it would not be any use at all One has ones own mountain spirit realm Nanquan said The seven hundred eminent monks at Huangmei all understood Buddhism they did not inherit the patriarchy Only workman Lu didnt understand Buddhismso he became the patriarch He also said  The Buddhas of all times do not know what is cats and oxen know what is The old peasants either frown or sing but tell me how you will understand And what eye do they possess that they are like this You should know that in front of the old peasants gates no ordinances are posted Xuedou having raised both sides finally lifts up his staff and says Are there any Chan practitioners who will live together and die together  Had there been someone who could come forth and make a statement alternately acting as guest and host that one would have avoided this old fellow Xuedous pointing to him self in the end Verse The old peasants may frown There is someone three thousand miles away Delicious food is not for a satisfied man to eat But for now I hope the nation establishes a sturdy foundation Everyone knows the song of peace When you want to go go when you want to stay stay The whole world is one gate of liberation How will you establish it Crafty ministers valiant generalswhere are they now Are there any The land is broad the people few and rarely is anyone met with But do not point to yourself Myriad miles pure wind one only knows for oneself Who will you have sweep the ground He cuts down the long and adds to the short abandons the heavy and goes along with the light  Crafty ministers valiant gener alswhere are they now In one gulp he has swallowed everyone completely That is why I say that the land is broad the people few and rarely is anyone met with Are there any who know Come forth and be buried in the same pit Myriad miles pure wind one only knows for oneself This is where Xuedou points to himself Introduction By means of the knowledge that has no teacher one produces the marvelous function of nondoing by means of unconditional com passion one acts unasked as an excellent friend In one statement there is killing there is giving life in one act there is releasing there is capturing Tell me who has ever been thus Story Yunmen said Within heaven and earth The land is broad the people few The six directions cannot contain it through space and time there is a jew el Where is it Light is produced Check Pick up a lamp and go into the Buddha hall It still can be discussed take the triple gate and bring it on the lamp Yunmen is right but undeniably difficult to understand This seems to be getting somewhere but if you examine thoroughly you will not avoid the odor of dung Commentary ia Yunmen says Within heaven and earth through space and time there is a jewel hidden in the mountain of form Does Yunmen intend this as a fishing pole or a lamp These lines are paraphrased from Sengzhaos Jewel Treasury Yunmen used them to teach The main idea is How can you conceal a priceless jewel in the psycho physical elements The Jewel Treasury Treatise is in accord with Chan teaching Quoting it Jingqing asked Caoshan How is it when there is ultimately no body in the empty noumenon  Cao shan said Noumenon is thus what about phenomena Jingqing said As is noumenon so are phenomena Caoshan said You can fool me but what about the eyes of the sages Jingqing said Without the eyes of the sages how could you know it is not so Caoshan said Officially not even a needle is admitted privately even a cart and horse can pass  So it was said Within heaven and earth in space and time there is a jewel hidden in the mountain of form The intent of this is to show that everyone is fully endowed each individual is complete Yunmen thus brought it up to show his group it is to tally obvioushe couldnt go on and add interpretations for you like a professor But he is compassionate and adds a footnote for you  Pick up a lamp and go into the Buddha hall bring the triple gate on the lamp Now tell me what does Yunmen mean by this An ancient said The true nature of ignorance is identical to the nature of Buddhahood the empty body of illusion is identical to the body of reality It is also said See the Buddha mind right in the ordinary mind The mountain of form is the bodymind Within there is a jewel hidden in the mountain of form That is why it is said All Buddhas are in the mind the deluded seek outside Though they have a precious jewel within they do not know it and they let it rest there all their lives It is also said The Buddha nature clearly manifests but people dwelling on form cannot see it If one real izes that people have no self how does ones own face differ from the Buddhas face Therefore they cannot set it in motion and cannot bring it out in action  Pick up a lamp and head into the Buddha hall as a matter of ordinary sense this can be fathomed but what about bring the triple gate on the lamp Yunmen has broken up emotional dis crimination intellectual ideas gain loss affirmation and nega tion all at once for you Xuedou has said I like the fresh devices of Yunmen all his life he removed fixations and hangups for people He also said I do not know how many sit on the chair of rank but the sharp sword cutting away causes others admiration When he said Pick up a lamp and go into the Buddha hall this has already cut off completely yet bring the triple gate on the lamp If you discuss this matter it is like sparks like light ning Yunmen said If you would attain just seek a way of entry Buddhas numerous as atoms are under your feet and the three treasuries of holy teachings are on your tongues but this is not as good as being enlightened Do not think falsely sky is sky earth is earth mountains are mountains rivers are rivers monks are monks lay people are lay people It is hung on a wall for nine years Bodhidharma did not dare to look at it straight on If any Chan practitioners want to see it now I will hit them right on the spine with my staff See how these true teachers of Chan never use any actual doctrine to tie people up Set your eyes on high Why look A black dragon admires a gem On the ancient bank who holds the fishing pole Alone quite alone stolid quite stolid He draws his bow after the bandit is gone If you see jowls on the back of someones head dont have anything to do with him Clouds roll on Cut them off A hundred layers a thousand levels A greasy hat a stinking shirt The water vast and boundless Left and right it goes blocking in front and surrounding in back The white flowers in the moonlight you must see for yourself When you see them youll go blind If you can comprehend Yunmens words you will see Xuedous last statement Commentary If you can comprehend Yunmens words then you will see how Xuedou helps people He goes to the last two phrases of Yunmens address and there gives you a footnote saying Look look If you thereupon make raising your eyebrows and glinting your eyes your understanding you are out of touch It is not captured in writings The nature of the mind has no defilement it is inherently complete Just get rid of delusive clingings and merge with the Buddha that is as is If you just raise your brows and glint and sit there forever how will you be able to transcend the senses Yunmen is as though on an ancient bank holding a fishing pole the clouds roll the water is boundless The bright moon reflects white flowers white flowers reflect the bright moon At this moment whose realm is this  If you can perceive it immediately and directly the former and the latter phrases are just like one phrase Nanquan Kills a Cat Introduction Right where the road of ideation cannot reach is good to bring to attention where verbal explanation cannot reach you must set your eyes on it quickly If your thunder peals and comets fly then you can overturn lakes and topple mountains Is there anyone in the crowd who can manage this Story At Nanquans place one day the monks of the east and west halls were arguing over a cat Its not just today that theyre haggling This is a case of degeneracy When Nanquan saw this he held up the cat and said If you can speak I wont kill it When the true imperative goes into effect the ten directions are subdued This old fellow has the capability to distinguish dragons from snakes No one replied What a pity to let it go Phony Chan followers are most plentiful Nanquan cut the cat in two If he hadnt acted thus they would all be playing with mud He draws the bow after the brig and is gone What was his inner meaning But actually these bear no relation to it at all Had he not held it up would you still spin out all sorts of rationalizations You still don t know that this ancient had the eye to settle heaven and earth and he had the sword to settle heaven and earth Now you tell me after all who was it that killed the cat This is why I say when the true imperative goes into effect the ten directions are subdued Stick your head out beyond the heavens and look The fact is that he really did not kill This matter is clearly known it is so obvious It is not to be found in emotions or opinions if you go on searching in emotions and opinions you turn against Nanquan Just see it right on the knifes edge Being is all right nonbeing is all right nei ther being nor nonbeing is all right too Hence the ancient saying At an impasse change change and you get through People nowa days do not know how to change and get through they only go running to words When Nanquan held up the cat in this way he couldnt have been telling people they should be able to say some thing he just wanted people to attain on their own each act on their own and know for themselves If you do not understand it this way after all you will grope without finding it Verse In both halls they are phony Chan followers Familiar words come from a familiar speaker He has said it all in one statement He settles the case according to the facts Stirring up smoke and dust they are helpless Look what settlement will you make A completely obvious case He uses the fine diamond sword to cut mud With one stroke of the knife he cuts in two letting the pieces be lopsided as they may He cant be let go so I strike Commentary  In both halls they are phony Chan followers Xuedou does not die at the phrase and also does not acknowledge anything halfbaked He has a place to turn so he says Stirring up smoke and dust they are helpless Xuedou and Nanquan walk hand in hand in one statement he has said it all The leaders of the two halls have no place to rest their heads everywhere they go they just stir up smoke and dust unable to accomplish anything So Xuedou said Fortunately there is Nanquan who is able to bring up the imperative  With one stroke of the knife he cuts in two letting the pieces be lopsided as they may  He directly cuts in two with one knife without further con cern about unevenness But tell me what imperative is Nanquan going by Nanquan Questions Zhaozhou Story Nanquan told Zhaozhou the preceding story to question him Only one on the same road would know Zhaozhou immediately took off his sandals placed them on his head and left He does not avoid trailing mud and dripping water Nanquan said  Had you been here you could have saved the cat Singing and clapping they accompany each other those who know the tune are few He adds error to error Commentary Zhaozhou was Nanquans true heir when Nanquan spoke of the head Zhaozhou understood the tail when it is brought up he immediately knows where it comes down In the evening Nanquan told Zhaozhou the preceding story and asked him about it Zhaozhou was an old adept he immedi ately took off his sandals put them on his head and left Nanquan said Had you been here you could have saved the cat But tell me was it really like this or not Even a thousand sages could not deflect him a bit You must bring forth your own family treasure only then will you see the great function of the total capacity He is saying I am king of the Dharma free in all things Many misunderstand and say that Zhaozhou temporarily made his sandals into the cat They still dont know that the ancient s meaning was like the universal cover of the sky like the universal support of the earth That father and son harmonized with each other their minds met Students these days do not know the turning point of the ancients and they vainly go the road to ideation to figure them out If you want to see just go to the turning points of Nanquan and Zhaozhou and you will see them well Verse The case completed he questions Zhaozhou The words are still in our ears No use to cut any more He hangs a medicine bag on the back of a hearse In the capital city hes free to wander at leisure He picks the plants as they come to hand I cannot but let you go on thus His sandals he wears on his headno one understands Yet theres one or a half This is a special style Its met in the light and met in darkness too Returning to his native village then he rests But tell me where is the fault Its just that you are raising waves where there is no wind They let each other off I only fear you will not be thus if so its quite unusual Commentary The case completed he questions Zhaozhou The librarian Qing said It is like a man settling a case eight strokes of the cane is eight strokes thirteen is thirteen Already he has settled it com pletely yet he brings it up to ask Zhaozhou  Zhaozhou was his disciple and understood Nanquans mean ing But tell me right now how will you understand Returning to his native village then he rests Where is his native village If he didnt understand he surely wouldnt speak this way I strike immediately An Outsider Questions the Buddha Introduction Appearing without form filling the ten directions of space ex panding everywhere equally responding without mind extend ing over lands and seas without trouble understanding the whole when a part is raised judging grains and ounces at the glance of an eye Even if blows of the staff fall like rain and shouts are like thunder pealing you still have not filled the footsteps of a tran scendent person Story An outsider asked the Buddha I do not ask about the spoken or the unspoken Though he is not a member of the household still he has a bit of a fragrant air Twin swords fly through space Dont slander the Buddha his voice is thunderous He is trying to repair a pot with cold iron The Bud dha said Like a good horse he goes as soon as he sees the shadow of the whip Tell me what do you call the shadow of the whip Striking with my whisk I say that on the staff there is an eye bright as the sun If you want to know if it is real gold see it through fire Having gotten a mouth eat Commentary Were this matter in words does not the Buddhist canon contain words Some say it is right just not to speak Then what would have been the use of the Chan founder coming from India Luckily none of this has any connection how could you ever manage to find it by groping around This matter really isnt in words yet is not apart from words If you make the slight est attempt to assess you are a myriad miles away See how after that outsider had intuitively awakened only then did he realize it was neither here nor there neither in affirmation nor in negation But tell me what is this Tianyi Yihuai composed this verse Though the sharp sword is in its scabbard its light is cold Outsiders and celestial demons all are helpless When Daochang was studying with Fayan Fayan had him con template this story One day Fayan asked him What story are you contemplating Daochang said The outsider questioning the Buddha Fayan said Quote it As Daochang began to speak Fayan said Stop Later in teaching he said I have three secrets have tea take care and rest If you still try to think any more about them I know you are still not through Cuiyan Zhen cited this story and said In the six directions and nine states blue yellow red and white intermingle The outsider knew the four Vedas and thought he was omni scient everywhere he went he drew people into debate He posed a question hoping to cut off the Buddhas tongue The Buddha did not expend any energy yet the outsider was immediately awak ened He said The Buddhas great kindness and compassion have opened up the clouds of my confusion and allowed me to gain en try But what is the Buddhas great kindness and compassion The Buddhas single eye sees through past present and future the outsiders twin eyes penetrate the Indian continent The outsider had the supreme jewel hidden within The Buddha kindly lifted it on high for him But after all what did the outsider realize It was like chasing a dog toward a fence If you cast away judgment and comparison and affirmation and negation all at once your emotions ended and your views gone it will naturally become thoroughly obvious After the outsider had left Ananda asked the Buddha what he had realized to say that he had gained entry The Buddha said Like a good horse he goes as soon as he sees the shadow of the whip Since then everywhere it has been said that at this point even he was blown by the wind into a different tune Where is the shadow of the Buddhas whip Where is the seeing of the shadow of the whip Xuedou said False and true are not sepa rate the fault comes from the shadow of the whip Zhenru said Anandas gold bell is rung twice and everyone hears it together Even so it is much like two dragons fighting for a jewel If it doesnt fall into being it will surely fall into nonbeing if it doesnt go east it will go west The left eye is half a pound the right eye eight ounces A clear mirror is suddenly set on a stand But do you see the Buddha One push and it turns Broken shattered And immediately distinguishes beautiful and ugly The whole world is the door of liberation But do you see the Buddha Beautiful and ugly distinct the clouds of illusion open He lets out a pathway I allow as you have a place to turn around but nevertheless youre just an outsider In the gate of compassion where is any dust produced Retreat Bodhidharmas here Thus I think of a good horse seeing the whips shadow But tell me where is the shadow of the whip where is the good horse Gone a thousand miles in pursuit of the wind I call him back Riding on the Buddha hall I go out the main gate If he turns around he goes wrong He shouldnt be let go so I strike Calling if I get him to return Id snap my fingers thrice He neither reaches the village nor gets to the shop With your staff broken where will you go The sound of Xuedous thunder is great but there is no rain at all Commentary The wheel of potential has not turned  If it turns it will surely go two ways  The potential is the spiritual potential of the sages the wheel is the original lifeline of all people Xuedou said  The spiritual potential of the sages is not easily approached dragon children born of dragons do not be irresolute Zhaozhou stole a gem worth many cities the king of Qin and Xiangru both lose their lives  After all the outsider was able to hold still and be the master he didnt move at all How so He said he didnt ask about the spoken or the unspoken Is this not where the potential is whole The Buddha knew how to observe the wind to set the sail how to give medicine in accord with the disease so he remained silent The entire potential uplifted the outsider merged with it com pletely his wheel of potential then turned freely and smoothly It turned neither toward being nor toward nonbeing it did not fall into gain or loss was not bound by the ordinary or the holyboth sides were cut off at once Many people nowadays fall into nonbeing or else they fall into being they only remain within being and nonbeing running either way Xuedou says A clear mirror is suddenly set on a stand  And immediately distinguishes beautiful and ugly This has never moved it just calls for silence like a clear mirror on a stand myriad forms cannot avoid their appearance Where is the outsiders point of entry Here you must seek on your own investigate on your own awaken on your own understand on your own Beautiful and ugly distinct the clouds of illusion open  In the gate of compassion where is any dust produced The whole world is the gate of compassion This also is an open door  So I think of a good horse seeing the shadow of the whip  Gone a thousand miles in pursuit of the wind I call him back  A windchasing horse seeing the shadow of a whip immediately goes a thousand miles if you make it return it returns Calling if I get him to return Id snap my fingers thrice is this criticism or is it scattering sand Introduction Meeting the situation head on setting a pitfall for a tiger attack ing from front and side laying out strategy to capture a bandit adapting in light adapting in darkness letting both go gather ing both in knowing how to play with a dead snake all this is a matter for an adept Story Yantou asked a monk Where do you come from  Hes defeated before he even speaks Yantous boring into a skullbone If you want to know where hes coming from its not hard The monk said From the western capital Yan tou said After the rebel Huangchao had gone did you get his sword Yantou has never been a petty thief He doesnt fear los ing his head so he asks such a question courageous indeed The monk said  I got it Hes defeated He doesnt know where to turn This is a pitfall to catch a tiger What is going on in his mind The monk said Your head has fallen He only sees the sharpness of the awl not the squareness of the chisel What good or bad does he know No one can find out where his head has fallen Later that monk went to Xuefeng As before hes fatheaded and stupid He is defeated time and again Xuefeng asked Where did you come from  He cant but tell where he comes from but still Xuefeng wants to try him The monk said From Yantou Xuefeng said What did he say If he can recite it he wont avoid getting hit The monk recounted the preceding story Right then he should be driven out Xuefeng hit him thirty blows with his staff and drove him out Though it is true he cuts nails and shears through iron why does he only strike thirty blows This is not yet the real thing  Three thousand blows in the morning eight hun dred blows in the evening Were Xuefeng not a fellow student with Yantou how could he discern the point This monks eyes were like comets yet he was still thoroughly exposed by Yan tou and pierced all the way through on a single string At that time had he had a little eye power he would have been able to get a glimpse This story has a knotty complication in it Though this matter has neither gain nor loss the gain and loss are tremendous though there is no discrimination when you get here after all you must have the eyes to discriminate How is it when a student wants to take the masters head with a sharp sword Deshan stretched out his neck and said K aa Longya said Your head has fallen Deshan went to his room  At these words Longya was greatly awakened subsequently he made a gesture of repentance to Deshan Deshan went to his room thus in darkness was most wonderful Yantou laughs in his laugh there is poison anyone who could discern it could travel freely throughout the world If this monk had been able to pick it out at that moment he would have escaped criticism for all time Observe Xuefeng being a colleague of Yantou he immediately knew what he was getting at This is the method of taking an adept Chan practi tioner by the nose to help the person he doesnt do anything more for him but make him awaken on his own After all they must have a place to manifest When Yantou said After Huangchao had gone did you get his sword tell me what could be said here to avoid his laughter and to avoid Xuefengs brandishing his staff and driving him out Here it is difficult to understand if you have not personally experienced awakening in the final analysis you will not be able to pass be yond birth and death no matter how glib you may be I always teach people to observe the pivot of this action if you try to assess it you are far away Have you not seen how Touzi asked a monk  Did you get Huangchaos sword after hed gone The monk i Touzi said For thirty years I have been handling horses but today Ive been kicked by a mule Observe that monk he too was undeniably an adeptneither did he say he had it nor did he say he didnt have it he was as if an ocean away from the monk from the western capital Zhenru brought this up and said Of those ancients one acted as the head the other as the tail for sure  Verse After Huangchaos passing he had picked up the sword This is just a tin knife The great laughter after all needs an adept to understand it How could anyone else be free Thirty blows of the mountain cane is still light punishment Born of the same lineage they die of the same lineage Three thousand in the morning eight hundred in the evening When someone in the eastern house dies someone of the western house helps in the mourning It is regrettable not to have been careful in the very beginning Commentary After Huangchaos passing he had picked up the sword  The great laughter needs an adept to understand it Xuedou immedi ately refers to the monk and Yantous laughter This bit cannot be grasped by anyone in the world But what was he laughing at In this laughter there is the provisional and the true there is illumination and function there is killing and giving life  Thirty blows of the mountain cane is still light punishment This refers to the monk coming to Xuefeng the monk was crude as before so Xuefeng acted as was imperative and drove him out with a thrashing But tell me why did he act like this To take advantage is to lose the advantage Expounds a Scripture Story ib Emperor Wu requested the great adept Fu to expand the Dia mond Cutter Scripture This is not unheard of in fish markets and wineshops but it is inappro priate in the school of patchrobed monks This old guy Fu is sup posedly so venerable and great yet he acts like this Fu shook the lectern once then got down from the seat Hes like a comet burst ing out then disappearing He seems right but isnt really He doesnt bother to create any complications Emperor Wu was as tonished Hes been fooled two or three times Fu too makes him unable to get a grasp Master Zhi asked Does your majesty un derstand He sides with principle not emotion The elbow does not bend outwards He too should be beaten The emperor said No Master Zhi said Great Adept Fu has expounded the scripture He too should be driven from the coun try They are two people in the same pit where the dirt is no different Commentary After Wu became emperor he made new commentaries on the Confucian classics and gave lectures He was also devoted to Taoism and was most filial One day he thought of attaining the transmundane teaching as an act of piety he abandoned Taoism and took up Buddhism He received precepts from Master Louyue he put on Buddhist vestments and personally expounded the Light Emit ting Wisdom Scripture At the time the great Master Zhi was confined in prison on the pretext that he manifested wonders and confused people Zhi then reproduced his body and wandered around teaching in the city The emperor found out about this and was inspired He re spected Zhi very much Time and again Master Zhi practiced pro tective concealment his disappearances and appearances were incomprehensible At that time there was a great adept living on a mountain he had planted two trees and called them the Twin Trees and called himself the future great adept Shanhui One day he composed a letter and had a disciple present it to the emperor The court didnt accept it because he had neglected the formalities of a subject in respect to the ruler When Shanhui the great adept Fu was going into the capital city to sell fish the Emperor Wu had just requested Master Zhi to expound the Diamond Cutter Scripture Zhi said I cannot expound it but in the marketplace there is a great adept named Fu who can The emperor then had him summoned to the inner palace Once Fu had arrived he mounted the lecturing seat shook the lectern once then got down Zhi said The great adept has expounded the scrip ture This too is one person acting as the head and one acting as the tail Though it is a dead snake if you know how to handle it itll come to life Since he was expounding the scripture why did he not make the general distinction into two aspects just as ordinary professors do   The substance of the diamond is hard so nothing can destroy it because of its sharp function it can cut through everything  Explaining like this could be called expound ing the scripture It was only appropriate that he should be subject to Master Zhis ignorance of good and bad in saying The great adept has ex pounded the scripture Indeed he had a good intent but didnt get a good response It was like a cup of fine wine being diluted with water by Master Zhi like a bowl of soup being polluted by Zhi with a piece of rat dropping But tell me granted that this is not expounding the scripture ultimately what can you call it Verse He does not rest this body by the Twin Trees c Its just because he cant hold still How could it be possible to hide a sharp awl inside a bag Instead he stirs up dust in the land of Liang Had he not entered the weeds how could we see the point Where there is no style there is still style At that time were it not for old Master Zhi One does not need capital to be a thief There is a leper dragging a companion along He too would have been hastily leaving the country His crime should be listed on the same indictment so I strike Commentary He does not rest this body by the Twin Trees  Instead he stirs up dust in the land of Liang Great adept Fu and Bodhidharma met the Emperor Wu in the same way The Emperor Wu mentioned this to Master Zhi and asked him about it Zhi said  This is the great being Avalokitesvara transmitting the seal of the Buddha mind  The emperor felt regret and sent an emissary to get Bodhi dharma Zhi said Dont tell me youre going to send an emissary to get him even if everyone in the country went he would not return That is why Xuedou says At that time if not for Master Zhi he too would have been hastily leaving the country At the time had it not been for Zhi exerting energy on behalf of Fu he too would surely have been driven out of the country Since Zhi wa so talkative Emperor Wu after all was fooled by him Xuedous intent is to say there is no need for him to come to the land of Liang to expound the scripture and shake the lectern Thats why he says Why doesnt he rest by the Twin Trees eat ing gruel and rice passing the time according to his means In stead he comes to the land of Liang and comments in this way shaking the lectern once he gets right down from the seat This is where he stirs up dust If you want the marvelous look at the cloudy skies above you do not see that there is any Buddha below you do not see that there are any sentient beings If you discuss the matter of appear ing in the world you cannot avoid ashes on your head and dirt on your face taking the nonexistent and making it exist taking the existent and making it not exist taking right and making it wrong taking coarse and making it fine presenting it sideways and us ing it upside down in the fish markets and wineshops making everyone understand this matter If you do not let go in this way no one will ever understand Great Adept Fu was already drag ging in muddy water fortunately he had a sympathizer If not for Master Zhi he would probably have been driven out of the coun try But tell me where is he now Introduction Overthrowing the polar star and reversing the earthly axis cap turing tigers and rhinos distinguishing dragons from snakesone must be lively and active before one can match phrase for phrase and correspond act to act But who has ever been able to be thus Story Yangshan asked Sansheng Whats your name Name and re ality take each other away He brings in a thief who will ransack his house Sansheng said Hug He cuts off his tongue takes his flag and steals his drum Yangshan said  Hug Thats me Sansheng said My name is Huiran He steals in the bustling marketplace That one and this one keep to their places Yangshan laughed It can be said that this is the season he spreads flowers on brocade No one in the world knows the point Because the land is broad the people few and rarely is anyone met with This is like Yantous laugh but it is not Yantou s laugh Both are laughs so why are they two Let those with eyes decide Commentary Sansheng was an adept in the Linji line Later he left Linji and traveled around everywhere he was treated as a distin guished guest My tasks as abbot are many Later he came to Yangshan who admired his outstanding acu ity and accorded him the position of assembly leader One day an oflicial came to call on Yangshan All the people of the community made comments but none accorded with Yangshans idea At that time Sansheng was sick and staying in the infirmary Yangshan had his attendant take these words and ask him about them Sansheng said The master has a problem Yangshan had his attendant ask W hats the problem Sansheng said A second offense is not permitted Yangshan deeply approved of this Baizhang had in the past given his meditation brace and cush ion to Huangbo and his staff and whisk to Guishan Guishan later gave these to Yangshan Since Yangshan greatly approved of Sansheng when Sansheng was leaving Yangshan wanted to give him his staff and whisk Sansheng said I already have a teacher When Yangshan asked him about it it turned out he was an heir of Linji When Yangshan asked Sansheng What is your name he couldnt have but known his name why did he still ask The rea son is that an adept wants to test people to know them thoroughly He just seemed to be casually asking his name speaking no fur ther judgment Why did Sansheng not say Huiran but instead said Hug See how one with the eye is naturally unusual His meaning was beyond Yangshans words These words do not fall within the scope of common sense they are difficult to grasp The methods of such a person can bring people to life that is why it is said He studies the living word not the dead world If they followed ordinary sense they couldnt set people at rest See how those ancients kept their minds on the Way like this Once they were completely enlight ened when they used it after all they appeared the same as unenlightened people Sansheng knew where Yangshan was at so he said My name is Hug Yangshan wanted to take in Sansheng but Sansheng took him in Yangshan was only able to counterattack with I am Hug  This is where he let go Sansheng said My name is Huiran This too is letting go Yangshan laughed there was both provisional and true both illumination and function This laugh was not the same as Yantous in Yantous laugh there was poison but in this laugh the pure wind blows chill for all eternity Crystal clear in every respect I thought there really was such a thing To ride a tiger always requires absolute competence If you havent the eye on the forehead and a talisman under your arm how could you get here You may mount but I only fear you wont be able to dismount If you are not such a person how could you understand such a thing His laughter ended I dont know where hes gone Even if you seek throughout the country for such a person one would be hard to find His words are still in our ears For ever and ever there is the pure wind It is only fitting to stir forever the wind of lament Right now where is it Since it is great laughter why does it stir the wind of lament The whole earth is flooded with darkness Commentary Both take in both let gohow do you find the source Letting go alternately they act as guest and host Yangshan says What is your name Sansheng says  My name is Hug Yangshan says I am Hug  Sansheng says I am Huiran This is both taking in when taking in everyone takes in when letting go everyone lets go Xuedou has all at once completely versified it What he means to say is that if we dont let go and take in if we dont interchange then you are you and I am I An ancient said If you stand I sit if you sit I stand If we both sit or both stand at the same time w ell both be blind This is both taking in both releasing which can be considered the fundamental essential To ride a tiger always requires absolute competence When you have such a lofty manner the highest essential of active po tential when you want to ride you ride when you want to dis mount you dismount You can sit on the tigers head and also hold the tigers tail Sansheng and Yangshan both had this style His laughter ended I dont know where hes gone Tell me what did he laugh at Why does Xuedou say in the end It is only fitting to stir forever the wind of lament This is death without mourning all at once he has finished adding explanations for you but yet no one in the world can bite in and they do not know the final point Even I do not know the final point do you c Nanquans Circle Introduction There is no place to get your teeth into the mind seal of Chan is formed like the works of the iron ox Having passed through the forest of thorns a Chan practitioner is like a snowflake in a redhot furnace Story Nanquan Guizong and Magu went together to pay respects to National Teacher Huizhong When they got halfway there Among three people traveling together there must be a teacher of mine  What is so special  He rouses waves where theres no wind Still he wants people to know He casts off a boat thats foundered on solid ground Without posing a test how could one discern the truth Guizong sat inside the circle When one strikes the cymbal his compan ions join in Magu curtseyed When one strikes the drum all three prove able Nanquan said Then lets not go on The one who can extricate himself halfway along is good He should have slapped him then Brash Commentary At that time Mazus teaching was flourishing in Jiangxi Shitous way was current in Hunan and National Teacher Huizhongs way was influencing Changan The latter had seen the sixth patriarch all who had high aspirations wanted to study with him These threeNanquan Guizong and Maguwanted to go pay respects to the National Teacher on the way they enacted this scenario of defeat Nanquan said Then lets not go Since they had each been able to speak why did he say he wouldnt go That is why Ciming said If you want to restrain him just grab the rein and yank Hit and he turns like pushing down a gourd on water Many say that Nanquan speaks words of disagreement but they dont know that in this matter when you get to the ultimate point it is necessary to leave the mud get out of the water remove all fixations The ancients could turn and shift well at this point they could not be otherwisethere must be killing and giving life See how one sat in the circle and one curtseyed That too was very good He too goes on like this His whole idea in saying this was that he wanted to test Nanquan Nanquan always said As soon as you call it thus it has already changed Nanquan Guizong and Maguafter all they were people of one house One holds one releases one kills one enlivens undeniably theyre unusual Verse Youjis arrow shoots the monkey Who dares to advance on the road ahead Whenever he hits he is marvelous he hits the mark before he shoots Circling the tree how exceedingly direct Without attaining mastery how could one presume to be thus North south east westone family style They have already been going around for a long time A thousand and ten thousand Most plentiful A pack of foxy devils What about Nanquan Who has ever hit the mark One or a half Even one would still be no use Calling them together he beckons Come lets go back A bunch of people playing with mud Better to have gone back then they would have gotten somewhere He stops climbing the road of Caoqi Level off the lowest place and theres extra view the highest place and theres not enough The road of Caoqi is level why stop climbing Not only Nanquan extricates himself halfway along Xuedou does too Even a good thing is not as good as nothing Xuedou too suffers from this kind of illness and pain Commentary Youjis arrow shoots the monkey  Circling the tree how exceed ingly direct Youji was an archer of ancient times Once when a king went hunting he saw a white monkey and had someone shoot at it The monkey grabbed the arrow and played with it The king had all his courtiers shoot at it but none could hit it The king then asked who could shoot it and they recommended the master archer Youji Ordered to shoot as Youji drew his bow the monkey hugged the tree and howled pitifully the monkey went around the tree to avoid the arrow shot but the arrow also circled the tree and struck the monkey dead This was a supernatural arrow Why does Xuedou say it was exceedingly direct Had it been too direct it wouldnt have hit since it went around the tree why does Xuedou say it was exceedingly direct Xuedou borrows the idea and uses it well Some say that circling the tree is the circle they do not know the import of the words they do not know where the directness is These three men are on different roads but re turn to the same place They are uniformly and equally exceed ingly direct A hundred rivers flow sepa rately but return alike to the ocean That is why Nanquan said Then lets not go If you look at this with the true eye of Chan this is just giving play to the spirit but if you call it giving play to the spirit yet it is not giving play to the spirit Wuzu said Those three were absorbed in the lamp of wis dom absorbed in the supreme array Though Magu curtseyed he never understood it as curtseying though Nanquan drew a circle he never understood it as a circle Xuedou says A thousand and ten thousand  Who has ever hit the mark How many could hit the mark every time Calling them together he beckons Nanquan didnt go on so He stops climbing the road of Caoqi He destroys the forest of thorns  The road of Caoqi is dustless and trackless openly ex posed naked and clean level even and smooth why stop climb ing after all Each of you should observe where you are Introduction A quick person needs but a single word a fast horse needs but a single stroke of the whip Ten thousand years is one thought one thought is ten thousand years If you want to know the direct way it is before any mention is made But before it is mentioned how will you search for it Youre headed west Im going east Baizhang asked Guishan How will you speak with your mouth shut Guishan said  Please speak yourself Guishan proceeds by Baizhangs road Baizhang said I dont refuse to speak to you but I fear that I might be bereft of descendants Hes thickskinned He makes a counterattack Commentary Guishan Wufeng and Yunyan were attending Baizhang Chan practitioners must be able to display their ability in speech and discern the point within words They dont damage the point or cut their hands Guishan said Please speak yourself Here he was like sparks like lightning responding to Baizhangs ques tion he answered immediately Xuedou likes these words of Guishan likes his freedom to re volve and maneuver elegantly while still being able to hold fast to his territory Hes already damaged the point and cut his hand The tigers head sprouts horns as he emerges from the wild weeds On the ten continents spring ends and the flowers fade and wither Over the coral forest the sun is dazzling bright A hundredfold a thousandfold Nevertheless he cant be found in phenomena Guishans answer covers heaven and earth Commentary The answers of the three are all different Theres towering like an immense wall theres simultaneous illumining and function ing and theres inability even to save oneself You please speak instead Immediately in this one line Xue dou has displayed his device He goes farther into it and presses ever so lightly to make it easy for people to see by saying The tigers head sprouts horns as he emerges from the wild weeds Guishans answer is like putting horns on a ferocious tigeris there any way to approach it A monk asked Loshan  How is it when born together and dy ing together Loshan said Like an ox without horns The monk asked How about when born together but not dying together Loshan said Like a tiger with horns He goes on to say On the ten continents spring ends and the flowers fade and wither On the ocean there are ten continents where one hun dred years make one spring When the spring is over myriad flowers fade and wither all at once Only the coral tree forest doesnt fade and witherit takes the light of the sun and reflects it back and forth Then it is amazing indeed For this bit one must take it up directly like a headon clash in the front lines There s no room for hesitation Wufeng functions directly and immediately his reply is swift uncompromisingly strict Hes not like Guishan who is so relaxed easygoing and exuberant Followers of Chan today just go under the shelf unable to go beyond him So it is said If you want to attain intimacy dont ask with a question Wufengs answer cut him off immediately indeed it was fast and brilliant Is it killing or bringing to life Verse You should shut up too Already there before anything was said he cut off all flows Observe his strategy on the battle lines It takes the ability of a great general to be able to do this Hes fully equipped an expert accustomed to battle He makes people think of General Li Guang There arent many with such marvelous skill With a horse and spear he covers ten thousand miles and b defeats ten thousand men Over the vast horizon a single hawk soars Where does it alight One with great strategy freely appears and disappears with horse and spear on the battle lines How could you surround him If youre not such a person how will you know there is such strategy In all these three verses what Xuedou describes is like this like Li Guangs miraculous arrows Over the vast horizon a single hawk soars It is certain that one arrow fells one eagle there is no more escape In Xuedous verse Baizhangs question is like a hawk Wufengs answer is like an arrow I have been so occupied with praising Wufeng that without realizing it my whole body has been immersed in muddy water Before he doesnt reach the village later he doesnt get to the shop Baizhang said  I have lost my descendants Obviously with an answer like this half is in front and half is left behind Commentary Yunyan attended Baizhang for twenty years Later he went with Daowu to Yaoshan See how Yunyan studied for twenty years and still was un ripe Something stuck to his skin and clung to his bones he couldnt break through He may have been right but he didnt reach the village before or get to the shop later Yunyan just went to test the others depths When Baizhang saw him acting like this he immediately held him and struck him dead Yunyan was following the waves pursuing the ripples mixing with mud mingling with water The goldenhaired lion is not crouching on the ground Two by two three by three traveling the old road How will you speak with your mouth shut Though it was right under his feet he missed it On Daxiong Mountain Baizhang snapped his fingers in vain The dead do not come back to life Too bad too sad Xuedou adds more grief to his cry of woe Commentary Have you anything to say or not  The goldenhaired lion is not crouching on the ground Xuedou concludes the case on the basis of the facts Yunyan is indeed one but this goldenhaired lion nev ertheless is not crouching To catch its prey a lion conceals its teeth hides its claws and crouches on the ground to rear and leap of Assertion and Denial Introduction In explaining truth there is neither explanation nor dogma in listening to truth there is neither hearing nor attainment Since explanation has no explanation or dogma how can it compare to not explaining Since listening neither hears nor attains how can it compare to not listening Then no explanation and no listening amounts to something Those with the eye to pass through the barrier try to bring it up Story A monk asked Mazu Please indicate the meaning of Chan directly apart from all permutations of assertion and denial Where did he get this saying from Where did he get this news Mazu said Im tired today and cant explain for you Go ask Zhizang He retreats three paces Those who stumble past dont even realize it He hides his body but reveals his shadow Undeniably the old guy has passed the buck When the monk asked Zhizang He should have pressed Mazu Hes stumbled past without realizing it Zhi zang said Why not ask the teacher The scorchedtail tiger has come out of the weeds What is he saying In fact the monk is bind ing himself with straw ropeshes totally dead The monk said He told me to ask you Hes at the disposal of another The first arrow was still light but the second one goes deep Zhizang said I have a headache today and cant explain for you  Indeed Mazus eightyfour enlightened disciples all suffer from this kind of sickness When the monk asked Baizhang He turns it over to another This question of his is undeniably profound and far reaching As for going beyond the permutations of assertion and denial the four basic propositions are existence nonexistence neither and both Had it been me Id have waited till Mazu had spoken then bowed thrice to see how he would have responded When this guy was right in front of it and stumbled past missing it Mazu still di rected him to go ask Zhizang The monk still didnt know that Mazu profoundly discerns all comers He went in ignorance to ask Zhizang Zhizang said Why not ask the teacher The monk said He told me to ask you  Watch this bit of his when pressed he im mediately turns without wasting any more time Zhizang said I have a headache today and cant explain for you Go ask Baizhang In the end whats what The monk came back and told Mazu Mazu said Zhizangs head is white Baizhangs head is black If you figure this by way of intellectual interpretation then you would say they were fooling the monk Some say all three knew the point of the monks question and so they didnt answer All such interpretations amount to covering your eyes and putting poison into the savory delicacy of the ancients Thus Mazu said I will explain to you when you swallow all the water of West River in one gulp This is the same as the present story If you can understand Zhizangs head is white Baizhangs head is black  you can understand the talk about West River This monk took his load of confusion and exchanged it for un easiness he went on troubling these three adepts making them enter the muddy water Yet even so nevertheless the three Chan masters were ex posed by this onesided man People today just make a living on the words They say white refers to merging in light while black refers to merging in dark ness Just occupying themselves with pursuing their calculations such people are far from knowing that the ancient cuts off their con ceptual faculties with a single saying You must go to the true life line and see for yourself before you can gain firm accord Therefore it is said At the last word you finally get to the impenetrable bar rier If you hold the essential crossing you dont let profane or holy pass If you discuss this matter its like having a sword pressing b against your foreheadhesitate and you lose your life Again its said Its like hurling a sword into the skyits not a question of reaching or not Just understand at the point of glistening clarity If you know that myriad differences and distinctions are all one then naturally you will be able to take on opponents from all sides Do you want to understand Zhizangs head is white Baizhangs head is black  Wuzu said Mr Dust Sweeper Verse Zhizangs head is white Baizhangs head is black Half closed half open One hand lifts up one hand presses down The sound of gold bells the flourish of jade chimes Even cleareyed Chan practitioners cannot understand Go travel for thirty more years Let the old man out Linji isnt yet a thief who can steal in broad daylight A leper drags along a companion You too must check into this and see for yourself Poppa is like daddy In all the universe only I know Why use I Ill snatch away your staff If theres no self and no others no gain and no loss what will you use to know Commentary Zhizangs head is white Baizhangs head is black What does this mean No Chan practitioner can leap clear of this little bit See how well Xuedou closes up tight at the end he says that even if youre a cleareyed Chan practitioner you wont be able to un derstand This bit of news is called the hidden secret of the spiri tual immortals which is not passed on from father to son It is called the diamond sword the absolute state Such complications were a matter that couldnt be avoidedwith them the ancients showed a little of their sharp point If you cant pass through as before you have no penetrating understanding and the more you talk the further away you are The colt has trampled everyone on earth to death  The colt refers to Mazu an allusion to the sixth patriarchs prediction of Mazus appearance in the world See how special his way of doing ic things washe just said Zhizangs head is white Baizhangs head is black This is where to see how he tramples everyone to death No one can bite through this line about black and white Linji isnt yet a thief who can steal in broad daylight One day Linji said In this naked lump of flesh is a true person with out station constantly going in and out through your senses Those who havent proved this look A monk then asked What is the true person without station Linji came down grabbed the monk and demanded that he speak  Later Xuefeng heard of this and said Linji is like a thief who steals in broad daylight Xuedou wants to meet Linji but in observing Mazus active edge it certainly goes beyond Linjis Mazu is truly a thief who steals in broad daylight Linji is not yet such a one Turning to refer to the monk Xuedou says Going beyond all assertion and denialin all the universe only I know But dont go into the ghost cave to make your living Xuedou says Only I can know this matter  Even the Buddhas of all times cannot catch sight of it Since one must know for oneself alone what are all of you looking for when you keep on coming here Zhenru commented This monk asking this way and Mazu answering this way went beyond the permutations of assertion and denial  The colt has trampled everyone on earth to death  Introduction The sharp sword wielded horizontally cuts off the nest of compli cations in front of its point The clear mirror hung on high brings forth the cosmic seal within a phrase Where ones state is peace ful one wears clothes and eats food Where spiritual powers wan der at play how can one linger Story Every day at mealtime Jinniu would personally take the rice pail and do a dance in front of the monks hall laughing he would say Bodhisattvas come eat You may play the fishing line as you willwithout disturbing the clear waves the intention is naturally distinct He applies pure ghee and poison at the same timeand hes right Jewels and gems he arrays all at once but nevertheless those he meets with are few Xuedou said  Though he acted like this Jinniu was not goodhearted This is a thief recognizing a thief a sprite recognizing a sprite One who comes to talk of right and wrong is a right and wrong person A monk asked Changqing When the ancient said Bodhisattvas come eat what was his meaning Indeed anyone would have doubts about this So he hasnt known where Jinniu is at all along What will Changqing say Changqing said  Much like joyful praise on the occasion of a meal He sizes up the audience to give his order and wraps up the case on the basis of the facts Commentary Jinniu was an adept in Mazus line Every day at mealtime he would take the rice pail himself and do a dance in front of the monks hall laughing he would say Bodhisattvas come eat He did this for twenty years Tell me where was his intent If it was just a matter of summoning the others to eat usually they make a signal to announce the meal what further need was there for him to take the rice pail himself and do so many tricks If he was expounding this matter why didnt he lecture formally Why did he need to act like this People today dont know that the ancients meaning was out side of words Why not take a look at the stated purpose of the Chan founders coming to China It was clearly stated to be for a special transmission outside doctrine to transmit the mind seal individually Later people would vainly conceptualize arbi trarily and say Why so many concerns When cold turn toward the fire when hot sit in the shade when hungry eat when tired sleep If we interpreted this way on the basis of ordinary feel ings then the Chan school would have died out That which is called the supreme delicacy is converted by such people into poison Since Jinniu descended into the weeds to help people why did Xuedou say he wasnt goodhearted Why did he talk this way Chan prac titioners must have living potential to begin to understand this People today dont get to the ancients realmthey just say What mind is there to see It takes thorough observation to begin to understand If today and tomorrow you go on with such facile explanations youll never be finished In truth it was joyful praise on the occasion of a meal But tell me rejoic ing over what Verse Laughing in the shadow of the white clouds Theres a sword in his laugh None of the Chan monks in the world know the ultimate point He lifts it up with both hands to give to them Is there such a thing Dont slander Jinniu Can it be called a rice pail If you are a real Chan practitioner you dont eat this kind of food If they were offspring of the golden lion They must first be beyond patterns Ill allow that they had eyes but I fear their eyes were not true They would have seen the error three thousand miles away Where was the error Blind men Commentary Laughing in the shadow of the white clouds Changqing says Joyful praise on the occasion of a meal Xuedou says He lifts it up with both hands to give to them But say was he just giving them food or do you think there must have been something spe cial besides If you can know the true point here youre an offspring of the golden lion If they had been offspring of the golden lion there would have been no more need for Jinniu to do a dance with the rice pail and laughin fact they would have known his flaw immediately from three thousand miles away If they just base themselves on words they wont avoid in dulging in fixations Wujius Unjust Beating Introduction The jewel sword with the spiritual point is perpetually revealed in front of us It can kill and it can bring life Its there and its here gained and lost together If you want to pick it up youre free to do so if you want to level it youre free to level it But say whats it like when not falling into guest or host when interchanging with out getting stuck Story A monk from Dingzhous group came to Wujiu Wujiu asked How does Dingzhous teaching compare to here Theres an echo in his words He wants to distinguish shallow from deep Hes really deceiving the man The monk said Not different Among the dead men theres a live one One or a half Like an iron spike Hes treading the ground of reality Wujiu said If its not different then you should go back there and hit him After all the monks one of us He just sees his opportunity and acts Wujiu said A f ter all someone received an unjust beating A mute eating a bit ter melon He lets go and also takes in What good is someone who turns around when hit The monk turned around and said What can I dothe handle is in your hands Its this way three hun dred sixtyfive days a year After all he is a clever monk Wujiu said If you want Ill turn it over for you Who knows which of them is the lord and which the subject He dares to lie in the tigers mouth He doesnt distinguish good and bad The monk came up to Wujiu grabbed the staff from him and hit him thrice Guest and host interchange releasing or capturing according to the occasion Wujiu said An unjust beating an unjust beating Check Why is this old man in such a rush The monk said Theres someone receiving it Haha How many handles are now in the monks hands Wujiu said  I hit this guy carelessly It doesnt come down on either side Wujiu said Yet you act this way The monk laughed and went out An adept Chan student naturally is thus A fierce tiger must have a pure wind following it Now we know he finished the begin ning and finished the end No one on earth can get a grip on him Wujiu said Thats all it comes to thats all it comes to Too bad he let the monk go Why didnt he strike him across the back Where do you think the monk went Commentary A monk from Dingzhous group came to Wujiu If here you can perceive the interplay of these two then ten thousand are in fact just one It is so whether acting as host or as guest in the end the two merge into one agent for one session of discernment Look at Wujiu questioning this monk  How does Dingzhous teaching compare to here The monk immediately said Not different  At the time if it hadnt been Wujiu it would have been hard to cope with this monk Wujiu said If its not different then you should go back there and hit him But this monk was an adept and immediately said  There are eyes on the staff you shouldnt hit people carelessly  Wujiu carried out the imperative relentlessly he said Today Ive hit one and hit him thrice more At this the monk went out Though the monk went out the case was still not finished From beginning to end Wujiu wanted to test the monks real ity to see how he was But the monk had barred the door so Wujiu hadnt yet seen him When Wujiu said An unjust beating an un just beating tell me what did he mean If not for this monks indepen dent resurgence he couldnt have handled Wujiu Then the monk bowed This bow was extremely poisonousit wasnt goodhearted If it hadnt been Wujiu he wouldnt have been able to see through this monk  The monk laughed and went out Though cut off they can still continue In fact this is just the mechanism of interchange Since these ancients were beyond defiling feelings and conceptual thinking both were ad epts neither spoke of gain or loss Though it was a single session of talk the two were both leaping with life and both had the needle and thread of the bloodline If you can see here you too will be perfectly clear twentyfour hours a day When the monk first went out this was both sides letting go what happened after that was both sides taking in This is called interchanging Verse To summon is easy Everyone on earth doubts this Rancid meat attracts flies No Chan practitioners in the world know the ultimate point To send away is hard That does not prevent thorough riddance Mirages appear over the sea Observe carefully the interchange of action points One exit one entryboth are adepts Two people hold a single staff But say whose side is it on The rock of ages though solid can still crumble How will you handle the golden hammer in the sleeve The thousand sages havent transmitted it When they stand in its depths the ocean must dry up There are eyes on the staff Hundreds thousands myriad miles There was no point in giving him the handle Already so before you say Wujius life was hanging by a thread He deserves thirty blows But where was his fault Commentary To summon is easy   To send away is hard Its all falling into the weeds With his extreme compassion Xuedou would often say Calling snakes is easy sending snakes away is hard Right now if I were to toot on an ocarina it would be easy to summon snakes but when I wanted to send them away it would be hard Similarly its easy to give ones staff to someone else but to take it back from him and send him away is hard Wujiu was an adept with the skill to call snakes and also the ability to send snakes away This monk wasnt asleep either When Wujiu asked How does Dingzhous teaching compare to here  this was calling him When Wujiu hit him this was sending him away When Wujiu said If you want Ill turn it over to you and the monk grabbed the staff and hit Wujiu this was the monk sending him away As for the monk laughing and going out and Wujiu saying Thats all it comes to this clearly is each sending the other away appropriately From beginning to end guest and host are clearly distinct Sometimes though host acts as guest and sometimes guest acts as host Even Xuedou cannot praise this enough b  The rock of ages though solid can still crumble This rock of ages is eightyfour thousand leagues wide and thick every five hundred years a goddess comes down and brushes across it with a gossamer cloth then departs for another five hundred years The brushing continues thus until it wears the rock awaythis makes one age an eon Xuedou says that though the rock is solid it can still crumblethough it is strong and solid still it can be worn away to nothing but the action point of these two people can never be exhausted  There was no point in giving him the handle This staff has been used by all the Buddhas of all times and by the succes sive generations of patriarchs and by the Chan masters to re move fixations attachments obsession and bondage Xuedou means that it should be used by oneself alone Fortunately it happened that this monk then just opened up to himif he had suddenly stirred up thun der over dry ground we would have observed how Wujiu met it When Wujiu passed the handle to someone else wasnt this in deed without reason Introduction Fine as powder cold as frost it blocks off heaven and earth and goes beyond light and dark Observe it where its low and theres extra level it off where its high and theres not enough Story Danxia asked a monk Where have you come from  Indeed its impossible to have come from nowhere at all If he wants to know where hes come from it wont be hard The monk said From down the mountain He has put on his sandals and walked into your belly Its just that you dont understand Theres an echo in his words but he keeps it to himself Why just the zero point of the scale He wants to know the real truth The monk said Ive eaten As it turns out hes collided with a pillar After all its an iron hammerhead with no hole Danxia said Did the c person who brought you the food have eyes or not Though hes relying on his power to mystify the man he is also wrapping up the case on the basis of the facts At the time he deserved to have his meditation seat overturned Why act without reason The monk was speechless After all he couldnt run Had the monk been an adept he would have said The same as your eyes Changqing asked Baofu To give someone food is ample requital of benevolencewhy wouldnt one have eyes Hes still only said half Is it throughout the body or is it all over the body One cut two pieces One hand lifts up one hand presses down Baofu said Giver and receiver are both blind He acts according to the imperative One statement says it all Such a person is rarely encountered Changqing said If they fully exerted their potential would they still turn out blind What does he know of good and bad He still isnt sure himself what bowl is he looking for Baofu said Can you say Im blind The two of them are both in the weeds A dragons head but a snakes tail At the time when he said If they fully exerted their potential would they still turn out blind I would have just said to him Blind He only managed to say a half It is not known where he was from At first he studied Confucianism intending to go to the capi tal to take the civil service examinations While he was staying at an inn he dreamed a white light filled the room a diviner told him this was a good omen of understanding emptiness There hap pened to be a Chanist there who asked him where he was going he replied that he was going to be elected as an official The Chanist said How can election to officialdom compare to election to Buddhahood Danxia asked Where should I go for election to Buddhahood The Chanist said  The great master Mazu is now teaching in Jiangxithat is where Buddhas are elected You should go there So then Danxia went directly to Jiangxi The moment he saw Mazu he lifted up the edge of his turban Shitou sent him to the mill and Danxia bowed in thanks He entered the workers hall and labored along with the community for three years One day Shitou announced Tomorrow w ere going to clear away the weeds in front of the Buddha shrine The next day everyone took a hoe to cut down weeds Danxia alone took a bowl of water washed his head and knelt in front of Shitou Shitou laughed and shaved his head for him Then as Shitou began to explain the precepts to him Danxia covered his ears and went out Before meeting Mazu to pay his respects he went into the monks hall and sat astride the neck of the holy icon Mazu personally went to the hall to have a look he said My son is so natural Danxia then got down and said Thank you for giving me a religious name Therefore he was called Tianran Natural Danxia was naturally sharply out standing like this As said officialdom isnt as good as Buddhahood Danxias words tower like a milehigh wall every saying has the ability to remove fixations When he asked this monk where he came from the monk said From down the mountain yet he didnt communicate where he had come from It seemed that he had eyes and was going to reverse things and test the host If it hadnt been Danxia it would have been impossible to gather him in Danxia said Did the person who brought you the food have eyes or not The monk was speechless Nevertheless Danxia still didnt let him go so the monk was blinking stupidly and speechless When Baofu and Changqing were together in Xuefengs group they would often discuss stories of the ancients Changqing asked Baofu  To give someone food is ample requital of benevolence why wouldnt one have eyes He didnt have to inquire exhaus tively into the facts of the case he could take it all in using these words to make a point in order to test Baofus truth Baofu said Giver and receiver are both blind How swift Here he just dis cusses the immediate circumstancesinside his house Baofu has a way of manifestation in being When Changqing said If they had fully exerted their poten tial would they still turn out blind Baofu said Can you say Im blind Baofu meant I have such eyes to have said it all to you are you still saying Im blind Nevertheless its half closed and half open At that time if it had been me when he said If they had fully exerted their potential would they still turn out blind I would have just said Blind  Too badhad Baofu uttered this one word blind at that time he would have avoided so many of Xuedous complications Xuedou too just uses this idea to make his verse Verse Fully exerting potential not turning out blind Theyve only said a half Each wanted to test the other The words are still in our ears Holding down an oxs head to make it eat grass They lose their money and incur punishment Half south of the river half north of the river Without realizing it theyve ruined the point and cut their hands Twentyeight and six patriarchs If you have a rule hold to the rule Xuedou is dragging down the ancient sages he doesnt just involve one person Their precious vessel is brought forth but it turns out to be an error Give me back my staff Theyve dragged me down so that I cant even show my face The error is profound Extremely profound No Chan practitioner in the world can leap clear of it But tell me how profound Theres no place to look for it Gods and humans alike sink into the earth All the Chan practitioners in the world are buried in one pit Is there anyone alive I let my move go Heavens Commentary Fully exerting potential not turning out blind Changqing said If they fully exerted their potential would they still turn out blind Baofu said Can you say Im blind This was like  Hold ing down an oxs head to make it eat grass To get it right you must wait till it eats on its own why push down an oxs head to make it eat When Xuedou versifies like this naturally we can see Danxias meaning Twentyeight and six patriarchs  Their precious vessel is brought forth but it turns out to be an error Not only does Xuedou drag down Changqing but at the same time he buries the twentyeight Buddhist patriarchs of India and the six Chan patriarchs of China In fortynine years Sakyamuni expounded the teachings collected in the Buddhist canon at the end he only transmitted this precious vessel The error is profound  Theres no place to look for it  This cant be explained for you just go sit quietly and inquire into his lines and see Since the error is profound why then is there no place to look for it Hence Xuedou says Gods and humans alike sink into the earth b Yunmens Cake Introduction Turning upward one can take everyone on earth in tow like a falcon catching a pigeon Turning downward one is in the hands of others like a turtle hiding in its shell If you have a rule go by the rule if there is no rule go by the example Story A monk asked Yunmen What is talk that goes beyond Buddhas and patriarchs He opens up Suddenly theres thunder over parched ground He presses Yunmen Yunmen said Cake His tongue is pressed against the roof of his mouth Gone by Commentary A monk asked Yunmen What is talk that goes beyond Buddhas and patriarchs Yunmen said Cake Do you feel your hair stand ing on end with the chill Chan students have asked about Buddhas and about patriarchs about Chan and about the Way about facing upward and about facing downwardtheres nothing more that can be asked yet this one posed a question and asked about talk that goes beyond Buddhas and patriarchs Yunmen was an adept so When the water rises the boats ride high when there is much clay the Buddha image is big He answered saying Cake It can be said that the Way is not carried out in vain his effort is not wasted Yunmen also said Without any understanding when you see people talking about the intent of the patriarchs you immedi ately ask for theories of talk that goes beyond Buddhas and patri archs But what do you call Buddhas what do you call patriarchs that you immediately speak of talk that transcends Buddhas and patriarchs What perception and cognition are there to hinder you On what basis do you entertain views of differentiations Those ancient sages cant do anything for you Observe how the monk asked about talk beyond Buddhas and patriarchs and Yunmen said Cake Does he know shame Theres a type of phony who says Yunmen saw a rabbit and released a hawk thus he said Cake  If you take such a view that Cake is talk going beyond Buddhas and patriarchs how can there be a living road Dont understand it as cake and dont understand it as going beyond Buddhas and patri archsthis then is the living road This is the same as three pounds of flax and knowing how to beat the drum though he just said cake its reality is hard to see Later people often made up rationalizations and said Coarse words and subtle talk all come back to ultimate truth  If you under stand in this way just go be a professor and spend your life collect ing intellectual knowledge Chan followers today say When you go beyond the Buddhas and patriarchs you are trampling both Bud dhas and patriarchs underfootthats why Yunmen just said to him Cake  Since its cake how does this explain going beyond Buddhas and patriarchs Try to investigate thoroughly and see There are many verses on this story but they all go to the side of the question to comment Xuedou alone has versified it best Verse Chan students asking about transcendent talk are especially numerous IH draw a circle and say Havent you been understanding this way What end is there to chewing over the words of others The whole earth is desolate killing people with sadness I strike Commentary Chan students asking about transcendent talk are especially nu merous Chan followers are especially fond of asking about this saying Yunmen said You carry a staff across your shoulders and say you are studying Chan studying the Way and then go looking for a principle that goes beyond the Buddhas and patriarchs But I ask you during all the various activities of the twentyfour hours of the day is there still any principle that goes beyond the Buddhas and patriarchs The gap opens see it Yunmen saw it open up in his question so he used cake to block it up tight But this monk still wouldnt agree to stopinstead he went on asking Chan follow ers these days just go to cake to understand or else they go to beyond Buddhas and patriarchs to make up theories Since its not in these two places in the end where is it Thirty years from now when Ive changed my bones Ill tell you Story In olden times there were sixteen bodhisattvas This bunch of idiots When it was time to wash the bodhisattvas filed in to bathe Why be such ignoramuses Suddenly they awakened to the basis of water How will you understand their saying Subtle contact reveals il lumination Its no longer anyone elses business Having knocked it down it s nothing else  and we have achieved the station of offspring of the Buddha Here all the Chan practitioners in the world seek but cannot find Why two heads three faces To realize this you too must be thor oughly penetrating Each blow leaves a welt Have you ever seen Deshan and Linji Commentary At the Surangama assembly Bhadrapala and sixteen bodhisattvas all practiced pure conduct and each related the basis on which he had experienced the Dharma door of complete pervasion This is numbered as one among twentyfive kinds of complete pervasion When it was time to bathe they filed in to bathe and suddenly awoke to the basis of water Since they didnt wash off dust and they didnt wash their bodies tell me what did they wash Theres no more need for so many complica tions all thats needed is to speak of suddenly awakening to the basis of water and you spontaneously understand Since they didnt wash off dust and didnt wash their bodies what did they awaken to When you get to this realm nothing at all is applicable even the word Buddha is to be avoided They said Subtle contact reveals illumination and we have achieved the station of offspring of the Buddha To reveal is to make ap parent the subtle contact is illumination Once you awaken to the subtle contact and achieve the station of offspring of the Buddha you are in the stage of enlightenment People these days also bathe also wash in water and feel it this way why then dont they awaken They are all confused and obstructed by the objects of the senses which stick to their skins and cling to their bones Thats why they cant wake up immedi ately then and there If here you can see directly then this is subtle contact revealing illumination achieving the station of offspring of the Buddha People these days feel contact too but do they perceive its subtlety Subtle contact is not ordinary feel ing and feeler where conjunction is considered contact and sepa ration is not b When Xuansha stubbed his toe crossing the mountains and then awakened when Deshan hitsisnt this subtle contact If you just search in your body what connection is there You will make the adamantine realm appear on the tip of a hair and turn the great Dharma wheel in every atom Dont just hold onto a single nook or denall places are doors by which Avalokitesvara enters truth For the ancients too there was awaking to the Way by hear ing sound illumining mind by seeing form  A single person may indeed awaken but how did the sixteen bodhisattvas awaken at the same time Thus the ancients practiced together and witnessed together awakened together and understood together Xuedou picks up the meaning of their teaching to make people go to where subtle contact reveals illumination to understand But Xuedou goes beyond the eye of their teaching to let people avoid being trapped in the net of doctrine halfdrunk and halfsober Verse It only requires one accomplished Chan practitioner Theres one right here Ill strike three thousand times in the morning and eight hundred at night Not even one is needed Stretch out your legs on the long bench and lie down In a dream you once spoke of awakening to complete pervasion Already asleep he goes on to speak of dreams Yet Ill allow that youve seen it in dreams Why the sleep talk Though youve washed in fragrant water Ill spit right in your face He adds a layer of mud on dirt Dont defecate on clean ground Commentary  It only requires one accomplished Chan practitioner What does one accomplish Once they hear it mentioned adept Chanists im mediately go carry it out Stretch out your legs on the long bench and lie down An ancient said In clear illumination there is no such thing as awakening The idea of awakening deludes people When you stretch out and sleep theres no false and no truethus there isnt a single thing on your mindwhen hungry you eat when tired you sleep  Xuedou means that if you speak of washing and awakening to subtle contact revealing illumination from the standpoint of such a free Chanist this is like speaking of a dream in a dream So Xuedou says In a dream you once spoke o f awakening to com plete pervasion  Though youve washed in fragrant water Ill spit right in your face Though it seems like fragrant water in fact its foul water suddenly soaking your head What complete pervasion can you go on talking about Xuedou says that this sort of person quite rightly gets spit in the face I say this is add ing a layer of mud on dirt Introduction When the great function manifests it doesnt keep to patterns and rules But say who has ever acted this way Story c A monk asked Touzi All sounds are the voice of the B u d d h a right or wrong He knows how to grab the tigers whiskers A thunderclap in a clear sky Ones own feces do not seem to stink Touzi said Right Hes sold his body to you Hes put it over on one side What mental activity is this The monk said Dont fart He just sees the awl is sharp he doesnt see the chisel is square What is he saying After all he suffers defeat Touzi hit him Hes clutching the loot yet crying hes been wrongedwhy East west south north the reflections and echoes are still present Touzi said  Right Again hes sold his body to you A pitfall to trap tigers And what mental activity is this The monk said Can I call you an ass He just sees the awl is sharp he doesnt see the chisel is square Though he has waves against the current yet he has no horns on his head With a mouth full of blood he spits out at people Touzi hit him A hit It wont do to let him go He should be hitwhy does Touzi stop before his staff is broken Commentary Touzi was plain and truthful and he had extraordinary discern ment Whenever he was questioned he would immediately see the heart of the matter without expending superfluous effort he would immediately cut off the questioner s tongue It could be said that he set plans in motion from inside his tent that decided vic tory beyond a thousand miles This monk had taken his views of sound and form Buddhism and stuck them to his forehead whenever he met someone he would ask about it Knowing Touzi was truthful the monk was making a trap for him from the starthence his subsequent remarks Nevertheless it was Touzi who used the ability to trap tigers fishing out the monks subsequent words This monk received Touzi s answer by saying Dont fart  As it turned out as soon as Touzi set his hook the monk immediately climbed onto it anyone else would have been unable to handle the monk but Touzi had eyes and followed up and hit him Whether he turned left or right Touzi fol lowed him smoothly When the monk made a trap wanting to grab the tigers whiskers he didnt yet know that Touzi was above his trap When Touzi hit him the monk unfortunately had a start but no finish As soon as Touzi picked up his staff if the monk had overturned his meditation seat even if Touzi had used his full capacity he still would have had to fall back three thousand miles When the monk said Can I call you an ass Touzi again hit him Though the monk was making clichs nevertheless he was still exceptional a teacher without the eye on the forehead would have been unable to crush him But Touzi did have room to turn around When the monk made up a theory he wanted to plunder Touzis shop but in the end as before he couldnt do anything to the old man A Chan monk either doesnt act or doesnt quit Since this monk was unable to spring back he was taken in tow by Touzi Obviously theres no one on earth like this truthful old man He spoils the sons and daughters of other peoples families The wheel of his ability is unobstructed What difficulty is there to handling him Act this way and you get a thrashing dont act this way and you still get a thrashing If you take this monks place Ill hit you How pitiful the innumerable people playing in the tide The monasteries produce one or a half they produced these two people All the Chan practitioners in the world act this way In the end they fall into the tide and die Too bad What can they do A sad person shouldnt talk to sad people If they suddenly came to life My Chan seat shakeshes startled me I too fall back three thousand miles The hundred rivers would reverse their flow with a roar Danger It is useless to stop and think I wouldnt dare open my mouth Old Touzi too must break his staff before hes all right Commentary  Touzi Touzi  The wheel of his ability is unobstructed Touzi often said You always say Touzi is truthful but if you suddenly went three steps down the mountain and someone asked you what Touzi s truthfulness is how would you respond An ancient said Where the wheel of ability turns the actor is still deluded The wheel of Touzis ability turns smoothly entirely without obstructions  Touzi said Swallowing three or four  How is it after the moon is full  Touzi said Spitting out seven or eight When Touzi dealt with people he always used this ability When he answered this monk he just used the one word Right The monk got hit both times Hence Xuedou says  The same for that and the same for this The first four lines have all at once completed Xuedous praise of Touzi At the end Xuedou depicts the monk saying How pitiful the innumerable people playing in the tide The monk dared to seize Touzis banner and drum saying Dont fart and Can I call you an ass This is where he played in the tide When the monk had exhausted his clever maneuvers as before he died in Touzis words so Touzi then hit him Thus the monk in the end falls into the tide and dies  b Xuedou releases the monk and says that if he suddenly came to life and overturned the meditation seat then even Touzi would have to fall back three thousand miles and then the hundred rivers would reverse their flow with a roar Not only does my seat shake but the mountains and rivers quake and heaven and earth are blacked out Where will you go to settle your selves and establish your lives Story A monk asked Zhaozhou Does a newborn baby also have the sixth consciousness The moment is fleeting as a lightning flash What newborn baby is he talking about Zhaozhou said Tossing a ball on swiftly flowing water Its gone by You still must check it The monk asked Touzi What is the meaning o f tossing a ball on swiftly flowing water Understand Its gone by Touzi said Moment to moment nonstop flow Commentary In the Abhidharma this sixth consciousness is set up as the true basis Mountains rivers earth sun moon and stars come into be ing because of it It comes as the vanguard and leaves as the rear guard In the stage of Buddhahood the eight con sciousnesses are transformed into the four knowledges in doctri nal schools this is called changing names without changing essence A Newborn Baby Sense faculties objects and consciousnesses are three Origi nally we are unable to discriminate among the sense objects be fore us but the subtle inner faculties produce consciousness and consciousness manifests discrimination of formsthis is the sixth consciousness The seventh consciousness manas can take hold of all images of the world and cause people to be vexed and troubled so that they dont attain freedom As for the eighth consciousness called the storehouse consciousness it contains all good and bad seeds This monk knew the ideas of the verbal teachings so he used them to question Zhaozhou  Does a newborn baby also have the sixth consciousness Though a newborn baby is equipped with the six consciousnesses though its eyes can see and its ears can hear it doesnt discriminate among the six sense objects At this time it knows nothing of good and evil superior and inferior right and wrong gain and loss A student of the Way must become again like an infant then one cannot be moved by praise or blame suc cess or fame trial or ease Though one sees forms one is the same as blind though one hears sounds one is the same as deaf One is like a simpleton mind immutable as the polar mountain Only if you can be like this will you have a little attainment But though one is like this nevertheless one cant be fooled at allas ever mountains are mountains rivers are rivers One is like the sun and moon moving through the sky without stopping without announcing one has so many names and forms Since sky and earth are mindless they last foreverwhat has mind has limits One who has attained the Way is like this too In the midst of effortlessness one carries out efforts accepting all trials and pleasures with a compassionate heart The reclining dragon is very wary of the blue pools clarity If human life can be like this always how can a single label remain in the world Yet even being this way one must go on to leap out of the nest It says in the Flower Ornament Sutra Bodhisattvas in the eighth stage Immovability turn the Dharma Wheel in an atom using effortless knowledge When they have food and drink they partake of it neither the word certainty nor the word uncertainty can be applied to this transcendental matter Shandao said Havent you even seen a newborn baby At that time it does not know the meaning of having the Buddha nature or not having the Buddha nature As one grows up one learns various sorts of intellectual knowledge then one comes to claim ability and understanding not knowing that this is affliction by acquired defilements Among the sixteen contemplation practices the babys practice is best When its babbling it symbolizes the student of the Way detached from the discriminating mind that grasps and rejects Thats why I praise infants I can make a comparison by taking the case of a baby but if I say the baby is the Way people of these times would misunderstand Nanquan said Eighteen times I was able to make a living  Zhaozhou said Eighteen times I was able to break up the family and scatter the household  He also said I was in the south for twenty years and only varied my application of mind at mealtimes  Caoshan asked a monk In concentration the bodhisattva smells the musky elephant crossing the river very clearly what scripture does this come from  The monk said From the Nir vana scripture Caoshan said  Does one smell before or after con centration The monk said Y oure flowing Caoshan said Receive it on the river bank  The Surangama Sutra says Stillness merges into stillness going into the bounds of consciousness Birth of conceptions is false thinking Birth of flows is pursuing falsehood going round in circles Even if you reach the state of effortlessness youre still in the midst of the charac teristics of flowing One must get out of the third aspect birth of flows in order to be joyfully alive and free Therefore Guishan asked Yangshan How is it with you Yangshan said Are you asking about my perceptive understanding or my active understanding If its my active understanding I dont know If its my perceptive under standing its like a pitcher of water poured into another pitcher If you can be like this you can be the teacher of a region When Zhaozhou said Tossing a ball on swiftly flowing water he was already turning smoothly When you toss it on swiftly flow ing water in a blink of an eye its gone The monks also asked Touzi What is the meaning o f tossing a ball on swiftly flowing water  Touzi said Moment to moment nonstop flow  spontaneously matching the question They no longer make use of calculationsas soon as you question them they already know what you are getting at Although a babys sixth consciousness makes no effort never theless from moment to moment it doesnt stop flowing on like a hidden river Of Touzis answer we can say that he profoundly discerns whatever comes up Verse Sixth consciousness inactivehe puts forth a question Though he has eyes he is like a blind man though he has ears he is like a deaf man The clear mirror is on its stand the bright pearl is in the palm Just experience it then youll know On the boundless swiftly flowing water tossing a ball Consistent from beginning to end Gone past W hats he saying Where it comes down it doesnt staywho can watch it Watch it and youll go blind Its gone  Commentary Sixth consciousness inactivehe puts forth a question When the ancients studied the Way they brought themselves to this point this is called achievement of nonapplication They were the same as a newborn baby though they had eyes ears nose tongue body and mind they didnt discriminate among the six sense ob jects When you get to this realm then you can overcome dragons and tigers die sitting or standing Right now people should just put the myriad phenomena before their eyes to rest at once What need is there to get above the eighth stage before you can be like this Although theres no ac tivity as ever mountains are mountains and rivers are rivers Why use antiserum to test an adept Since Zhaozhou and Touzi were adepts he says The adepts have both discerned where hes coming from  On the boundless swiftly flowing water tossing a ball Touzi said Moment to moment nonstop flow Do you know what this really means At the end Xuedou has people set eyes on it for themselves and watch Hence he says Where it comes down it doesnt staywho can watch it This is Xuedous living statement Introduction One captures the banner and seizes the drums beyond the ken of the sages This is not the wondrous functioning of spiritual powers nor is it the suchness of the basic essence Story A monk asked Yaoshan On a level field in the shallow grass the elk and deer form a herd How can one shoot the elk of elks He enters enemy headquarters with his helmet off He raises his head wearing horns He pulls an arrow out the back of his head Yaoshan said  Lookan arrow If youre not running downhill fast its hard to catch up with him Obviously this monk is unusual but once dead he doesnt revive Hes giving play to his spirit Yaoshan said Attendant drag this dead man out He acts according to the imperative He doesnt bother to test the monk again The first arrow was still light the second arrow is deep The monk then ran out He opens his eyes inside the coffin he finds life in death He still has some breath left Yaoshan said When will this guy playing with a mud ball ever be done Too bad Yaoshan let him go He acts according to the imperative but hes adding frost to snow Xuedou commented  Though he lived for three steps after five steps he had to die One hand lifts up one hand presses down Even if he ran a hundred steps he would still have to lose his life Watch the arrow If he lived the same and died the same Yaoshan would stare agape Hes just like an iron ham merhead with no holeuseless C o m m e n ta ry c In the CaoDong tradition this is called a question that uses things or a question testing the host used to clarify the present state of mind Ordinarily deer and elk are easy to shoot Only the elk of elks the king among deer is very hard to shoot This king elk always sharpens its horns on rocks of cliffs so theyre sharp as swords It defends the herd with its own body so even tigers cannot get near Likewise this monk seems intelligent and alert as he draws on this to question Yaoshan to reveal what he would do first When Sanping first called on Shigong as soon as Shigong saw him coming he went through the motion of bending a bow and said Lookan arrow Sanping bared his chest and said  This is the arrow that killswhat is the arrow that brings life Shigong plucked the bowstring thrice whereat Sanping bowed Shigong said After thirty years with a single bow and two arrows today Ive finally managed to shoot half a sage Then he broke his bow and arrows Datian said Since it is the arrow that brings life why draw it on a bowstring Sanping was speechless Datian said  Thirty years hence it will still be hard to find someone to bring up these words  Fadeng composed this verse Of old we had master Shigong Setting his bow and arrows he sat He went on like this for thirty years Not a single one understood Sanping came and hit the target And father and son reached harmony Thinking back carefully All along they were shooting the mound Shigongs strategy was the same as Yaoshans Sanping had the eye on the forehead so he hit the target immediately given a single phrase It was just like Yaoshan saying Lookan arrow and this monk then collapsing playing the elk He had set his trap to make Yaoshan fall in but Yaoshan was an adept and kept on pressing relentlessly When Yaoshan said Attendant drag this dead man out it was as if he was extending his battle lines forward This monk then ran out he may have been right but he wasnt free and clean his hands and feet were stuck Yaoshan said Lookan arrow whereupon the monk col lapsed Was this understanding or not If you say it was why did Yaoshan say he was playing with a mud ball This was extremely vicious It was like when a monk asked Deshan  How is it when a student with a sharp sword tries to take the masters head Deshan extended his neck to him and shouted the monk said  The masters head has fallen Deshan lowered his head and re turned to his room The monk said The masters head has fallen Yantou laughed Cases of this kind are all traps to fell tigers just like the present story Yaoshan wasnt taken in by this monksince he saw through him he just kept on pressing Xuedou says  Though this monk lived for three steps after five steps he had to die Though the monk knew very well how to look at the arrow and immediately collapsed when Yaoshan said Attendant drag this dead man out he ran out Xuedou says hes afraid he wont live beyond three steps Had the monk leaped beyond five steps at that time no one in the world would have been able to do anything to him a In a meeting of adepts from beginning to end there must be an uninterrupted interchange of guest and host only then is there freedom and independence Since the monk wasnt able to con tinue from beginning to end consequently he meets with Xuedous censure If you want to shoot then shoot but why look Yaoshan releases one arrow The monk runs three steps Hes been dead a long time Had he lived for five steps What for Leap a hundred steps How is it when unexpectedly finding life in the midst of death He would have formed a herd and chased the tiger The two reflect each other All the Chan practitioners in the world let him come forth but hes still in a nest in the weeds The correct eye has always been given to a hunter Yet Yaoshan doesnt consent to acknowledge these words Its so for Yaoshanwhat about Xuedou  Commentary The elk of elks  You should take a look Chan practitioners must have the eye of the elk of elks and the horns of the elk of elks they must have devices and strategy Even if its a fierce winged tiger or a horned tiger the elk of elks can still preserve itself and keep harm at a distance Yaoshan releases one arrow  The monk runs three steps When Yaoshan said Lookan arrow the monk fell down when Yaoshan said Attendant drag this dead man out the monk ran out He did very well but he was only able to run three steps Had he lived for five steps  He would have formed a herd and chased the tiger Xuedou says Im afraid that after five steps he had to die had he been able to leap beyond five steps and been alive he would have been able to gather his herd and gone to chase the tiger The horns of the elk of elks are sharp as spears when a tiger sees them even it becomes afraid and flees This elk is the king among deer always leading the herd in driving tigers to another mountain The correct eye has always been given to a hunter Yaoshan is like a hunter who knows how to shoot and this monk is like the elk Introduction Only those with eyes can know the fishing line Story A monk asked Dalong The physical body decays what is the stable body of reality His statement makes them into two Still its all right to separate them Dalong said The mountain flowers bloom like brocade the valley streams brim blue as indigo A flute with no holes striking a felt pounding board The whole can not be broken apart An ancient clearly stated If you want to attain intimacy dont ask with a question The monk asking thus and Dalong answering thus is a single whole Dalong didnt move at all it was like seeing a rabbit and releasing a falcon like seeing a hole and putting in a plug Thus it is said When white clouds lie across the valley mouth many birds returning by night cant find their nests Some say this was just answering glibly They dont know that with one device one perspective the ancients broke fetters and chains that every word and phrase had something precious within If one has the eye and brain of a Chanist sometimes one holds fast and sometimes one lets go Without the great function and great capacity how would one be able to enclose heaven and earth like this One is like a clear mir ror reflecting accurately whatever comes before it This story is the same as that of the flowering hedge though the meaning is not the same Here the monks question was un clear so Dalongs answer was exactly appropriate A monk asked Yunmen  How is it when the tree withers and the leaves fall Yunmen said The body exposed in the autumn wind This is called arrow points meeting Its easy to see Yunmen acting thus but its hard to see Dalong acting otherwise Playing with the thing without knowing its name Buy the hat to fit the head Answered still not understanding South and north not differentiated The skull was switched South of the river north of the river The moon is cold the wind is high What is it like Today is precisely this time All people have eyes but have never seen have ears but have never heard On the ancient cliff frigid juniper A holeless flute hitting a felt pounding board How delightful to meet an enlightened one on the road You must get here yourself too Give me back my staff They come like this forming a crowd Who doesnt use speech or silence to reply What would you use to answer him properly His hand grasps the white jade whip And smashes the black dragons pearl If he hadnt smashed it c He would have increased its flaws Why play with a mud ball Hed seem more and more decrepit his crimes would fill the sky The nation has a code of laws Those who know the law fear it In the morning three thousand blows at night eight hundred blows Three thousand articles of offenses Hes only told half of it There are eightyfour thousand Countless eons of uninterrupted hell wouldnt make up for half of it Commentary Xuedou versifies here with much skill Before when he versified Yunmens The body exposed in the autumn wind he said Since the question has the source the answer too is in the same place This case is otherwise Xuedou instead says Asking without know ing  Answered still not understanding Dalongs answer was a glimpse from the side that was simply outstanding His answer was so clear that whoever questioned him this way had already incurred defeat even before asking Thus Xuedou comes out with his verse to make people re alize that the moon is cold the wind is high and still strikes the frigid juniper on the ancient cliff Thus I just said its a holeless flute hitting a felt pound ing board On the road if you meet an enlight ened one dont use speech or silence to reply This is a verse of Xiangyan that Xuedou has drawn on What is this like  His hand grasps the white jade whip  And smashes the black dragons pearl Thus the command of the founders must be carried out cutting off everything in the ten directions This is the matter of the swords edge for which one must have this kind of strategy Otherwise you turn your back on the sages of all time This is how transcendent people act If he hadnt smashed it necessarily he would have increased its flaws and thus would have seemed broken down and decrepit But in the end how can you be right  The nation has a code of law  Three thousand articles of offenses There are three thousand subdivisions of punishments and none is greater than that for not being respectful This monk offended against all three thousand articles at once How so Because he didnt deal with people on the basis of his own thing As for Dalong he of course was not this way The Ancient Buddhas and the Pillars Story a Yunmen said The ancient Buddhas and the pillars mergewhat level of mental activity is this Three thousand miles away Cracked open He answered himself When someone in the eastern house dies someone from the western house assists in the mourning The single compounded form cannot be grasped On south mountain clouds gather Throughout heaven and earth they cant be seen A knife cannot cut through on north mountain rain falls Not a drop falls Half south of the river half north of the river Commentary Great master Yunmen produced over eighty enlightened teach ers Seventeen years after he died his tomb was opened and his body was found upright and sound as in life All his pointers alternative remarks and state ments on behalf of others were direct and uncompromising This present story is like sparks like lightning baffling and ungraspable Librarian Qing said Is there such talk in the Canon  People these days make their living on emotional interpreta tions saying The Buddha is the guide of the world the compas sionate father of beings Why then do the ancient Buddhas merge with the pillars If you understand this way youll never find it Some call Yunmens saying calling out from nothingness They dont know that the talk of Chan masters cuts off conceptualization cuts off emotional evaluation cuts off birth and death cuts off dogmatism and enters the absolute without retaining anything at all As soon as you rationalize and calculate you tie your hands and feet Just unify mind and environment then judgments of good and bad wont be able to shake you Then it will be all right whether you say there is or there isnt it will be all right whether you have mental activity or not Wuzu said Yunmen supposedly so great really didnt have much guts On south mountain clouds gather on north mountain rain falls Thus he opened up a route of entry for future students Thats why Xuedou picks out the place where he settles heaven and earth to make people see But as soon as you blunder into calculation you stumble past and miss it though its right in front of you Verse South mountain clouds Throughout heaven and earth they cant be seen A knife cannot cut in North mountain rain Not a drop falls Half south of the river half north of the river The twentyeight and the six see it before them The lanterns are hung on the pillars In Korea theyve gone up into the hall Surging up in the east sinking down in the west The east guild doesnt see the profits of the west guild Give me back the story At first he doesnt get there afterwards he goes too far In suffering happiness In happiness suffering A double case Who would you have bring this up Suffering is suffering happiness is happiness Why two heads three faces Who says gold is like ordure Those with eyes will discern Try to brush it off and look Too bad Tell me is it the ancient Buddhas or the pillars Commentary South mountain clouds  North mountain rain Xuedou buys the hat to fit the head watches the wind to set the sail On the edge of a sword he puts down footnotes for you In Korea theyve gone up into the hall  In China they havent yet beaten the drum Xuedou goes where thunder peals and comets fly and says In suffering happiness  In happiness suffering He seems to have piled up jewels and put them here Finally theres this little lineWho says gold is like ordure This is from Chanyues poem  Travel is Hard People cannot fathom the oceans depth or mountains height Past and present more and more green and blue Dont associate with the shallow and superficial The low ground can only produce brambles Who says gold is like ordure Traveling the road is hard The hardships of travel see for yourself And isnt the territory broad and the people few Cloud dwelling saints Though you say it is not there is nothing is not can negate When is and is not are left behind and gain and loss are forgotten then you are clean and free But tell me what is it in front of you and in back of you If you can judge Ill allow that you have personally seen the ancients Story Vimalakirti asked Manjusri This fellow is making quite a fuss He should shut up What is a bodhisattvas entry into the Dharma Door of Non duality Manjusri said According to what I think What is he saying Hes wearing fetters carrying evidence of his crime hauling himself into the magistrates office in all things no words no speech no demonstration and no recognition He might fool others  leaving behind all questions and answers this is entering the Dharma Door of Non duality c Then Manjusri asked Vimalakirti We have already spoken Now you tell us what is a bodhisattvas entry into the Dharma Door of Nonduality Not even the Buddhas of all times let alone Vimala kirti can speak about this one support Manjusri has turned the spear around and stabbed one man to death The arrow hits Vimala kirti just as he was shooting at others Xuedou said What did Vimalakirti say Tsk Xuedou drawing ten thousand arrows to his heart speaks the truth in Vimalaklrtis place He also said Completely exposed Not only then but now too it is so Xuedou is drawing his bow after the bandit has gone Though he uses all his strength to help people nevertheless calamity comes from his own door But tell me can Xuedou see the ultimate point Since he hasnt even dreamed of it how can he say Completely exposed Danger Even the golden lion cannot search it out Commentary Vimalakirti had various bodhisattvas speak on the Dharma Door of Nonduality At the time thirtytwo bodhisattvas all took dualistic views of creation and noncreation of the two truths absolute and conventional and merged them into a monistic view that they considered to be the Dharma Door of Nonduality Finally he asked Manjusri who said According to what I think in all things no words and no speech no demonstration and no recognition leav ing behind all questions and answers this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality Since the other thirtytwo had used words to dispense with words Manjusri used nowords to dispense with words At once he swept everything away not wanting anything and considered this to be the Dharma Door of Nonduality He still didnt realize that this was the sacred tortoise dragging its tail that in wiping away the tracks he was making traces Its just like a broom sweeping away dust though the dust is removed the tracks of the broom remain Since in the end as before some traces were left Manjusri then asked Vimalakirti We have already spoken Now you tell us what is a bodhisattvas entry into the Dharma Door of Nonduality Vimalakirti was silent If youre alive youll never sink into stag nant water If you make up such views youre like a mad dog chasing a clod of earth Xuedou didnt say Vimalakirti kept silent nor did he say he sat there silently He hadnt seen him even in a dream Vimalakirti was an ancient Buddha who had a family and house hold He helped Sakyamuni Buddha teach He had inconceivable intelligence inconceivable perspective inconceivable psychic pow ers and miraculous abilities Inside one room he accommodated thirtytwo thousand jewel lion thrones and a multitude of eighty thousand without it being crowded But tell me what principle is this Dont misunderstand if it is the Dharma Door of Nonduality only by the same attain ment and the same experience can there be common mutual wit ness and knowledge Only Manjusri was able to give a reply Even so was he able to avoid Xuedous critical examination Xuedou talking as he did also had to meet with these two This little bit has nothing to do with gain or loss nor does it fall into right and wrong Its like being on a tenmilehigh cliff if you can give up your life and leap off you may see Vimala kirti in person If you cannot give up youre like a ram caught in a fence This is old Vimalakirti Why snap at him In the morning three thousand blows in the evening eight hundred blows Snapping at him doesnt accomplish anything He deserves a thrashing He suffers an empty affliction out of compassion for living beings Why have compassion for them They themselves have the diamond sword He took the trouble but accomplished nothing Lying ill in Vaisall His whole body withered and emaciated He cant eat or breathe ManjusrI teacher of the seven Buddhas comes When a guest comes one must attend to him When a thief comes one must beat him After all Vimalakirti is living in a ghost cave He asks about the Door of Nonduality Were there anything that could be said it would have been said by him  Then Vimalakirti leans and falls He doesnt lean and fall He finds life in the midst of death theres still some breath in him The golden lion has no place to look Right off Xuedou cuts right through with the diamond sword Vimalakirti should be given three thousand blows in the morning and eight hundred blows in the evening Vimalakirti means Pure Name in Sanskrit He was also known as the Golden Grain Buddha A monk asked Yunju If he was the Golden Grain Buddha why did he listen to the Dharma in the congregation of Sakyamuni Buddha Yunju said He didnt pit himself against others Someone who is greatly liberated has noth ing to do with becoming a Buddha or not becoming a Buddha If you say such a one practices to attain Buddhahood this has even less to do with it Whether he goes against or goes along the gods cannot fathom If he goes along he turns toward the stage of Buddha hood if he goes against he enters the realms of sentient beings Chan Master Shou said Even if you can perfect yourself and get to this realm you still cant follow your inclinations Only when you have experienced uncontaminated sainthood can you go along or go against Thus Xuedou said He suffers an empty affliction out of compassion for living beings In the scripture Vimalakirti says Since sentient beings have illnesses I also have an illness He said  This body has no permanence no strength no power no stability its a thing that quickly decays it cant be relied on It produces suffering and trouble a mass of diseases It is a compound of mental and physical elements  Manjusri teacher of the seven Buddhas comes Manjusri was the teacher of the seven Buddhas of antiquity but he obeyed Sakyamuni Buddhas instructions to go ask Vimalakirti about his illness To the single room thats been swept repeatedly Vimala kirti had cleared everything out of his room just leaving a bench When Manjusri arrived he asked about the Dharma Door of Non duality so Xuedou says  He asks about the Door of Nonduality  Then Vimalakirti leans and falls Vimalakirti frowned Chan followers these days say his speechlessness was the leaning and falling Pushing you up onto a tenmile cliff Xuedou then says He doesnt lean and fall With one hand he lifts up with one hand he pushes down This line versifies his own comment What did Vimalakirti say The golden lion has no place to look  It was not only this way at that time but its this way right now Do you see old Vimalakirti Even if the whole world the mountains rivers grasses trees and for ests all turned into a golden lion you still would no be able to find him Introduction To hold the world fast without the slightest leak so that all the people in the world lose their points and become tonguetied this is the true imperative for Chanists To radiate light from the forehead that shines through the four quartersthis is the ada mantine eye of Chanists To turn iron into gold and gold into iron to capture suddenly and release suddenlythis is the staff of Chanists To silence everyone in the world so that theres no way for them to expostulate and they fall back three thousand miles this is the mettle of Chanists But tell me when one is not this way at all who is this Story A monk came to the place of the hermit of Tongfeng and asked What if you suddenly encountered a tiger here An expert at playing with shadows Theres one or a half in the nest of weeds The hermit roared like a tiger He adds error to error Nonethe less he does have fangs and claws They are born alike and die alike Hearing words understand the source The monk made a gesture of fright Two men playing with mud The monk saw the opportunity and acted This amounts to something Theres a sword in his laugh He can let go and can also gather in The monk said You old bandit One must see through this Both let go The hermit said What can you do to m e I would slap him across the ear What a pity to let him go He adds frost to snow The monk gave up Thus he was stopped Neither of them were done Heavens Xuedou said  This is all right but these two wicked bandits could only cover their ears to steal a bell The words are still in our ears They have been examined by Xuedou But how should they have acted to avoid Xuedous criticism No Chanist in the world reaches that Commentary Observe how those two had such knowing eyes and capable hands Where is the riddle Xuedou picked this story to make people know wrong from right and discern gain and loss Nevertheless from the standpoint of adepts though its handled in terms of gain and loss after all there is no gain or loss If you view those ancients in terms of gain and loss you miss the point entirely People today should each find the place where theres no gain or loss after that you can discern people in terms of gain and loss If you only apply your mind to choosing among words and phrases when will you ever be done As soon as some teacher speaks you immediately ask about Chan and the Way about transcendence and accommodation about how and what These you say are words of eloquence these words referring to self these words referring to things these words from within the essence Once you have gobbled down your meal you only speak of dreams and say you have understood Buddhism You should know that if you go on this way you will never be done In the temporary exercises of the ancients there were no such views as victory and defeat gain and loss right and wrong Tongfeng had seen Linji At the time of the story he lived in a hut deep in the mountains This monk came there and asked What if you suddenly encountered a tiger here Tongfeng then roared like a tiger he rightly went to the thing to act The monk too knew how to meet error with error so he made a gesture of fright Thus Xuedou said  This is all right but these two wicked bandits could only cover their ears to steal a bell Though both were ban dits still they didnt take the opportunity to use it hence they were covering their own ears to steal a bell With these two elders it s as though they set up battle lines of a million troops but only struggled over a broom i i a To discuss this matter it is necessary to have the ability to kill people without blinking an eye If you always let go and never capture or always kill and never bring to life you will not avoid the scornful laughter of others Though this is so these ancients still didnt have so many concerns Wuzu spoke of the concentration of spiritual powers at play the concentration of the torch of wisdom and the concentration of the supreme adornment Its just that people of later times dont have their feet on the ground they just go criticize the ancients and say there is gain and loss Some say the hermit clearly lost the advantage but this misses the mark Xuedou said When these two met it was all letting go When the monk said What if you suddenly encountered a tiger here and Tongfeng roared this was letting go Xuedou said If you want to act then act People today hear such talk and say that the hermit should have carried out the imperative for the monk But you shouldnt blindly punish and beat the hermit But in the end how will you avoid covering your ears to steal a bell Verse If you dont grab it when you see it Youll think about it a thousand miles away Fine stripes Take whats due you and get out What could he do he didnt know to function But he hasnt got claws and fangs I only fear the use of them will be unclear Ill talk to you when your claws and fangs are ready Havent you seen the sudden encounter on Mt If theres a rule go by the rule if theres no rule go by the example The vast sound and light shake the earth This tiger after all goes on this way Still he amounts to something If you can open your eyes you can be born alike and die alike Xuedou is creating complications They take the tigers tail and grab the tigers whiskers How will you take it when it suddenly appears All the Chanists in the world are taken in here Shouting and striking I say why not say You th ief Commentary  If you dont grab it when you see it  Youll think about it a thou sand miles away Just at the point of danger the monk couldnt function at all when the hermit said What can you do to m e the monk should have given him some of his own provisions Had he been able to show his skill the hermit would have had to have a last word Both only knew how to let go they couldnt gather in  If you dont grab it when you see it is already white clouds for ten thousand miles why did he go on to say Youll think about it a thousand miles away b Fine stripes  But he hasnt got claws and fangs This may be so but this tiger also knows how to conceal his fangs and hide his claws Nevertheless he didnt know how to bite people Havent you seen the sudden encounter on Mt  The vast sound and light shake the earth One day Baizhang asked Huangbo Where are you coming from  Huangbo said From picking mushrooms on the mountain Baizhang said See any tigers Huangbo made a tigers roar Baizhang took the axe at his side and made a gesture of chopping Huangbo held it fast and slapped him That evening Baizhang said to the group Theres a tiger on Mt Daxiong all of you must watch out when youre coming and going Today I myself got bitten Later Guishan asked Yangshan about Huangbos tiger story  The vast sound and light shake the earth This bit trans forms freely Xuedou wants a road to express himself in the words Do great people of power see or not Do you see  They take the tigers tail and grab the tigers whiskers Here again this must be ones own Even if you take the tigers tail and grab the tigers whiskers you wont avoid being taken in tow at once The Kitchen Pantry and the Main Gate Introduction One holds the world fast without the slightest leak one cuts off all flows without keeping a drop Tell me what is the eye that pen etrates barriers Story Yunmen said Everyone has a light But they are ignorant of it when you look at it you dont see it and its dark and dim What is everyones light Moun tains are mountains rivers are rivers Though its a light when youre asked about it you dont understandisnt it dark and dim  For twenty years he handed down this lesson but no one understood his meaning  Usually what he said on behalf of others was just a single sentence why are there two here The first sen tence briefly opens a road for you to let you see If youre real as soon as you hear it you get right up and go Yunmen feared people would get stuck here so he also said A good thing isnt as good as nothing As before hes swept it away for you As soon as they hear you mention light people today put a glare in their eyes and say There is the pantry there is the main gate But this has nothing to do with it This is why it is said Perceive the meaning on the hook dont stick to the zero point of the scale This matter is not in the eye or in objects To begin to understand you must cut off views forget gain and loss and be come purified naked and free one must investigate on ones own Yunmen said You come and go by daylight you distinguish people by daylight Suddenly its midnight and theres no sun moon or lamplight If its a place youve been to then of course its possible but in a place youve never been can you even manage to get hold of something The Merging o f Difference and Sameness says Right within light theres darkness But dont see it as darkness Right within darkness theres light But dont meet it as light If you cut off light and darkness tell me what is it Light and objects both forgotten then what is this Also it is said This very seeing and hearing is not seeing and hearing but there s no other sound and form to be offered to you Here if you can understand theres nothing at all substance and function may be separated or not  Just understand Yunmens final statement thoroughly then you can go back to the previous one to roam at play But ulti mately you do not make a living there Vimalaklrti said All things are established on a nonabiding basis You mustnt go here to play with lights and shadows and do mental gymnastics Nor will it do to make up an understanding in terms of nothingness An ancient said  Better you should give rise to a view of existence as big as a mountain than that you should produce a view of noth ingness as small as a mustard seed People of the lesser vehicles often fall onesidedly into this view Verse Spontaneously shining ranged in the solitary light Guest and host intermingle He snaps your nose around What are you doing blind ones He opens a route for you Why only one route Ten suns are shining in concert He has managed to set down one route Flowers fall the tree has no shadow What end is there to creating complications Where will you seek it He fills a black lacquer bucket with black ink When looking who doesnt see You shouldnt always hold onto fences and grope along walls Two blind ones three blind ones   Seeing or not seeing Riding backwards on an ox into the Buddha shrine Give me back the story I hit saying Where has he gone Xuedou too is just m aking his living inside a ghost cave At midnight the sun comes out at noonday the midnight watch is sounded Commentary Spontaneously shining ranged in the solitary light Originally right where you are theres this beam of light it s just that your usual use of it is dark Thats why Yunmen set out this light for you right in front of your faces But what is your light The kitchen pantry and the main gate This is where Yunmen ar rays the solitary light Panshan said The mindmoon is solitary and full its light engulfs myriad forms Afterwards  He opens a route for you Yunmen still feared people would become attached to the kitchen pantry and the main gate  Conceding for the moment the kitchen pantry and the main gate when the morning flowers fall and the tree has no shadow when the sun has gone down and the moon goes dark and all the world is vast blacknessdo you still see When looking who doesnt see Tell me who is it that doesnt see Here where right within light theres darkness and right within darkness theres light both are like a step forward and a step backward You must see for yourself a Xuedou says Seeing or not seeing in reference to A good thing isnt as good as nothing Merged with seeing you dont see anymore merged with understanding you dont understand any more Riding backwards on an ox into the Buddha shrine Hes gone into the black lacquer bucket You must personally ride the ox into the Buddha shrine to see what it is that hes saying sometimes on the summit of a solitary peak weeds grow profusely sometimes theyre naked and free in the bustling marketplace Suddenly they appear as angry titans with three heads and six arms suddenly as Sun Face or Moon Face Buddha they emanate the light of allembracing mercy In a single atom they manifest all physical forms to save people according to type they mix with the ordinary world If suddenly they release the opening upward not even the Buddhas eye could see them even if a thousand sages appeared they too would have to fall back three thousand miles Is there anyone with the same attainment and same realization Story Yunmen said Medicine and disease subdue each other A com pounded form cannot be grasped The whole earth is medicine what is your self Sweet melon is sweet to the stem The whole earth is medicine what is your se lf Do you have a way out Concentrate constantly on towering like a milehigh w all Deshans blows fall like rain Linjis shouts peal like th u n d e rputting this aside for the moment Sakyamuni is Sakyamuni and Maitreya is Maitreya Those who dont know what it comes down to frequently understand by calling it medicine and disease merg ing with each other  For fortynine years in over three hundred assemblies the Buddha set up teachings in accord with poten tials all this was giving medicine according to the disease like exchanging sweet fruit for bitter gourds The whole earth is medicine Where will you sink your teeth into this If you look around and hesitate you wont be able to get your teeth into it Yunmen is under your feet Medicine and disease subdue each other This is just an ordi nary proposition If you cling to being he speaks of nonbeing for you if you are attached to nonbeing he speaks of being for you If you are attached to the idea of neither being or nonbeing he mani fests the golden body of the Buddha for you in a pile of rubbish appearing and disappearing b Right now this whole earth is a profuse array of myriad forms up to and including ones own self If you only call it medicine youll never see Yunmen even in a dream Ultimately how is it See the meaning on the hook dont stick by the zero point of the scale One day Manjusri had Sudhana pick medicinal herbs He said If there is something that is not medicine bring it to me  Sudhana searched all over but there was nothing that was not medicine So he went back and told Manjusri There is nothing that is not medicine Manjusri said Gather something that is medicine Sudhana picked up a blade of grass and handed it to Manjusri Manjusri held it up and showed it to the assembly saying  This medicine can kill and can also bring life This talk of medicine and disease subduing each other is ex tremely difficult to see They discussed this statement medicine and dis ease subdue each other all night until dawn before they were finally able to exhaust its excellence Afterwards Xuedou made a verse to see him off Medicine and disease subdue each othermost difficult to see The myriad locked gates indeed have no starting point Wayfarer Jin E came calling In one night we exhausted the waves of the ocean of learning Xuedous subsequent verse is most effective His meaning is in the host and in the guest You can see for yourself Verse The whole earth is medicine Who would you have discern the point This is scattering sand and dirt Put it on a high shelf Why have people of all times been so mistaken Tsk I dont make the carriage behind closed doors Great Xuedou uses all his strength to help the assembly Misfortune comes forth from ones own door Calm and clear totally untrammeled Who has any spare time He is making a living in a ghost cave The road through is naturally quiet and empty Wherever you step you enter the weeds When you get on a horse youll see the road Twin swords fly through space A single arrow fells two eagles Though your nose be high as the sky youre still taken in tow Commentary The whole earth is medicine  Why have people of all times been so mistaken For all time those who have understood by calling it medicine have instantly gone wrong   I dont make the carriage behind closed doors  The road through is naturally quiet and empty Xuedou speaks to open up a road for you If you build your carriage behind closed doors and it fits the ruts in the road when you bring it out what has this accomplished I am not building a carriage behind closed doors here When I go out the door naturally its quiet and empty Here Xuedou reveals a slight crack to let people see Who would have known that Xuedous opening up a road is also wrong Since your nose is as high as the sky why do you get taken in tow any way Then immerse yourself in this for thirty years If you have a staff I give you a staff if you have no staff you wont avoid being taken in tow Taking charge of the situation one hits home and smashes apart the occult barrier of the golden chains Acting according to the imperative one obliterates all tracks and traces Tell me where is there confusion For those who have the eye on the forehead I bring this up to see Story Xuansha said The adepts everywhere all speak of guiding and aiding people They set up their shops according to their capaci ties according to whether their houses are rich or poor Suppose they met three kinds of invalidshow would they guide them Hes beating the weeds just to frighten the snakes You must fall back three thousand miles With blind people they could pick up the gavel or raise the whisk but they wouldnt see Truly blind This is guiding and aiding people One doesnt have to be blind Deaf people wouldnt hear what they said Truly deaf This is guiding and aiding people One doesnt have to be deaf This is guiding and aiding people One doesnt have to be mute If they couldnt guide these people then Buddhism has no effect How true these words are Theyve already been guided Ill strike A monk asked Yunmen for instruction on this He wants everyone to know too This is pertinent Yunmen said Bow When the wind blows the grasses bend Tsk The monk bowed and rose This monk has broken the staff Yunmen poked at him with his staff the monk drew back Yunmen said Youre not blind Truly blind Better not say this monk is blind Then Yunmen called him closer when the monk approached The second ladleful of foul water douses the monk Avalokitesvara has come At that time the monk should have shouted Yunmen said Youre not deaf Truly deaf Bet ter not say the monk is deaf Next Yunmen said Understand Why doesnt he offer his own provisions At that time the monk shouldnt have made a sound The monk said No A doubled case Heavens Yunmen said Youre not mute Truly mute Hes babbling Better not say this monk is mute At this the monk had an insight He draws his bow after the bandit is gone What vessel is he looking for C o m m e n ta ry Xuansha had reached the point of eliminating emotional defilement and conceptual thought where he became purified naked free only thus could he speak this way Blind people wouldnt see them raise the gavel or whisk deaf people wouldnt hear what they said mute people couldnt be made to speak If they couldnt guide these people then Buddhism has no effect If you now under stand this as being blind deaf and mute youll never be able to find it Thus it is said Dont die in the words To attain you must understand Xuanshas intent Xuansha often used this statement to guide people One of his longtime disciples once said Will you permit me to present a theory of the story of the three invalids Xuansha said Go ahead  The monk then bade them farewell and left Fayan later said When I heard Master Dizang tell about this monk I finally understood the story of the three kinds of inva lids If you say the monk didnt understand then why would Fayan say this If you say he did understand why did Xuansha say wrong One day Dizang said to Xuansha I hear you have a saying about three kinds of invalidsis that so Xuansha said Yes Dizang said I have eyes ears nose and tonguehow will you guide m e Xuansha immediately stopped If you can understand Xuanshas meaning how could it be in the words Later a monk took this up with Yunmen Yunmen said Youre not blind Then Yunmen called him closer When the monk approached Yunmen said Youre not deaf Next he said Understand When the monk said No Yunmen said Youre not mute At this the monk attained insight Had the monk been real he would have turned over the Chan seat as soon as Yunmen told him to bow then how could so many complica tions have appeared The under standing of those two was the same See how the ancients appeared and created millions of kinds of expedient methods Wuzu said One person can speak but doesnt understand one understands but cannot speak If these two came calling how would you be able to distinguish between them If you cant distinguish between these two in fact you will be unable to free people from fixations and bonds If you can distinguish them then as soon as you see them come through the gate you have put on your shoes and walked around several times inside their bellies  Now you better not make your understanding in terms of blind deaf and mute Thus it is said One sees forms as though blind and hears sounds as though deaf  It is also said Though it fills the eyes one doesnt see form though it fills the ears one doesnt hear soundManjusri is always covering the eyes Avalokitesvara blocks the ears At this point only if you see as though blind and hear as though deaf will you be able to be close to Xuanshas meaning Do you know where the blind deaf and mute are Verse Blind deaf mute  Already there before anything is said Already made into one piece Dark without any adjustments to potentialities Where will you search Can you make any judgments What have they got to do with it In the heavens on earth Laughable lamentable Li Lu cant discern the true form How can Shi Kuang recognize the mystic tune No reward has been established for the great achievement Truly deaf How can this compare to sitting alone under an empty window You must be thus to attain Dont live in a ghost cave This breaks through obscurity all at once The leaves fall the flowers bloomeach in its own time What time is it right now You mustnt understand it as nothing Today goes from morning to evening and tomorrow too goes from morning to evening Again Xuedou says Do you understand or not An iron hammerhead with no hole Too badXuedou let go so I hit C o m m e n ta ry Blind deaf mute  Dark without any adjustments to potenti alities All your seeing and not seeing hearing and not hearing speaking and not speakingXuedou has swept it all away at once for you In fact views in terms of blindness deafness and mute ness and calculations and judgment of whats right to suit poten tials are at once obliterated none of them can be applied This transcendental matter can be called real blindness real deafness real muteness without potentials or adjustments In the heavens on earth  Laughable lamentable Xuedou lifts up with one hand and pushes down with one hand But tell me laugh at what Lament over what Its worth laughing joy ously that this blindness is not really blind this deafness is not really deaf this muteness is not really mute Its worth lamenting being clearly not blind yet still being blind being clearly not deaf ic yet still being deaf being clearly not mute yet still being mute Li Lu cant discern the true form  If you cant tell green from yellow or red from white then youre really blind Li Lu was a man of ancient times known for his sharp eyes Even Li Lus eye cant discern the true form of this lofty realm How can Shi Kuang recognize the mystic tune Shi Kuang was a man of ancient times noted for his keen hearing Though he could hear ants fighting on the other side of a mountain Xuedou says that even he would be unable to recognize the mystic tune People who even though they are not deaf are nonetheless still deaf still could not recognize the mystic tune of this lofty realm even if they were Shi Kuang Xuedou says I am not Li Lu nor am I Shi Kuangit is better so sit alone under an empty window  The leaves fall the flowers bloom each in its own time If you get to this realm though you see its like not seeing though you hear its like not hearing though you speak its like not speaking When hungry you eat and when tired you sleep You let the leaves fall and the flowers bloom When the leaves fall its autumn when the flowers bloom its springeach has its own season Having swept it clean for you Xuedou again puts down a path and says Do you understand or not Xuedous strength is ex hausted and his spirit wearied he can just manage to say An iron hammerhead with no hole  Set your eyes on this line quickly only then will you see Do you see Do you hear Can you speak The Hands and Eyes o f Great Compassion Introduction Even if your whole body were an eye you still wouldnt be able to see it Even if your whole body were an ear you still wouldnt be able to hear it Even if your whole body were a mouth you still wouldnt be able to speak of it Even if your whole body were mind you still wouldnt be able to perceive it Now leaving aside the whole body for the moment if suddenly you had no eyes how would you see Without ears how would you hear Without a mouth how would you speak Without a mind how would you perceive Here if you can unfurl a pathway youll be a fellow seeker with the ancient Buddhas But leaving seeking aside for the moment from whom would you seek Story Yunyan asked Daowu What does the Bodhisattva of Great Com passion use so many hands and eyes for Daowu should have given him some of his own provisions then Why are you constantly running around Why do you ask Daowu said Its like someone reaching back for the pillow in the middle of the night Why didnt he use his own provisions One blind person leads a crowd of blind people Yunyan said I understand He adds error to error Theres no different dirt in the same hole He hasnt avoided damaging the point and cutting his hand Daowu said  How do you understand it  Why bother to inquire further He still had to ask Yunyan should be challenged Yunyan said All over the body are hands and eyes What does this have to do with it Hes living in a ghost cave washing dirt in mud Daowu said Youve said quite a bit but youve only said eighty percent Theres no different dirt in the same hole When the manservant sees the maid he takes care Daowu too should be challenged Daowu said  Throughout the body are hands and eyes The frog cannot leap out of the basket Hes snatched your eyes and made off with your tongue Has he gotten a hundred percent or not Hes calling daddy poppa Commentary  i a Yunyan and Daowu were fellow students under Yaoshan Yunyan never lay down to sleep for forty years Yaoshan produced the whole CaoDong school There were three people whose teaching flour ished The Bodhisattva of Great Compassion has eightyfour thou sand symbolic arms Great Compassion has this many hands and eyesdo you Baizhang said All sayings refer to oneself Yunyan used to follow Daowu seeking certainty One day he asked him What does the bodhisattva of Great Compassion use so many hands and eyes for Right at the start Daowu should have given him a blow of the staff across his back to avoid so many com plications appearing later But Daowu was compassionatehe couldnt act like this Daowu said Its like some one reaching back for the pillow in the middle of the night Reach ing for the pillow at night with no lightwhere are the eyes Though they seem covered with mud nevertheless they are clean People today often make up emotional interpretations and say all over the body is wrong while throughout the body is righttheyre merely chewing over the ancients words They have died in the words not knowing that the ancients meaning isnt in the words and that all talk is used provisionally Groping over their bodies the lamps and pillars they all make a literal understanding of throughout the body If you understand this way you degrade those ancients quite a bit So it is said Study the living word not the dead word You must cut off emotional defilements and conceptual thinking be come clean and naked free and unboundonly then will you be able to see this saying about Great Compassion Caoshan asked a monk  How is it when manifesting form in accordance with beings like the moon in water If you go to the words to see youll never be able to get out of Daowus and Yunyans trap Is throughout the body right Theres half on the forehead Youre still in the nest Blind Bringing it up is still a hundred thousand miles away It wont do to let go Why only a hundred thousand miles Spreading its wings the roc soars over the clouds of the six compounds b It propels the wind against the waters of the four oceans Too badas before hes creating complications Where do the hands and eyes on the staff come from He draws his bow after the bandits gone Cant let you go No one has any way to show some life Even having let go one still must take a beating Commentary  Is all over the body right  Is throughout the body right Whether you say reaching back for the pillow is it or running the hand over the body is it if you make up such interpretations youre doing nothing but making a living in a ghost cave In the end neither all over the body nor throughout the body is right If you want to see this story of Great Compassion by means of emo tional consciousness in fact youre still a hundred thousand miles away he says Bringing it up is still a hundred thousand miles away In the following lines Xuedou versifies what was extraordinary about Daowu and Yunyan saying Spreading its wings the roc soars over the clouds of the six compounds  It propels the wind against the waters of the four oceans The great roc swallows dragons with its wings it propels the wind against the waters the waters part and the roc captures a dragon and swallows it Xuedou is saying that if you can propel the wind against the waves like the roc you are very strong indeed yet if such actions are viewed with the thou sand hands and eyes of the Bodhisattva of Great Compassion its just a little bit of dust suddenly arising or a wisp of hair cease lessly blown by the wind Xuedou says that if you take running the hands over the body as the hands and eyes of Great Compas sion what is this good for Thus Xuedou says What speck of dust suddenly arises Nonetheless at the end of the verse as usual he breaks down and gives a comparisonas before hes yet in the cage You dont see  The net of jewels hanging down in patterns reflections upon reflections Xuedou brings out the clear jewels of Indras net to use as a pattern But tell me where are the hands and eyes after all In the Flower Ornament School they designate four reality realms first the reality realm of noumenon to explain uniform equality second the reality realm of phenomena to explain that  i c noumenon in its entirety constitutes phenomena third the real ity realm of noumenon and phenomena in harmony to explain how noumenon and phenomena merge unhindered fourth the reality realm of harmony among phenomena to explain how ev ery phenomenon everywhere enters all phenomena that all things everywhere embrace all things all intermingling simultaneously without obstruction So it is said As soon as a speck of dust arises the whole earth is contained therein each atom contains the bound less cosmos  As for the net of jewels theres a net of jewels in the Hall of Goodness of the god Indra Myriads of jewels are reflected in each jewel and each jewel is reflected in myriads of jewels This is used to illustrate the reality realm of harmony among phenomena Once National Teacher Xianshou set up a demonstration using mirrors and a lamp He arrayed ten mirrors in a circle and put a lamp in the center If you looked in any one mirror you saw nine mirrors mirroring the lamp mirrors and lamp all appearing equally Thus when the Buddha first achieved true enlightenment with out leaving the site of enlightenment he ascended into all the heav ens of the thirtythree celestial kingdoms and at nine gatherings in seven places he expounded the Flower Ornament scripture Xuedou uses Indras jewel net to impart the teaching of the reality realm of harmony among phenomena The six aspects are very clear that is the totality the separation the sameness the difference the formation and the disintegration Raise one aspect and all six are included Its just like this Thats why Xuedou says Where do the hands and eyes on the staff come from  This is to make you attain realization at the staff and ob tain fulfillment at a shout When Deshan hit people as soon as they came through the door and when Linji shouted at people as soon as they came through the door where were the hands and eyes And why did Xuedou go on at the end to say Bah Introduction Even the sages have not transmitted the one phrase before sound The single thread right before us is perpetually unbroken Purified and naked free and unbound hair disheveled and ears alerttell me what about it Story A monk asked Zhimen What is the body of wisdom Through out the body there are no reflected images Why use body Zhimen said An oyster swallows the bright moon Leaving aside for the moment the light en gulfs myriad forms what about the business of the true eye on the staff The crooked does not hide the straight This is adding frost to snow The monk asked What is the functioning of wis dom Fall back three thousand miles What does he want func tion for Zhimen said A rabbit gets pregnant Danger Bitter gourd is bitter to the root sweet melon is sweet to the stem If you make your living in the reflections of a light you wont get out of Zhimens nest In essence this is adding mud to dirt Commentary When Zhimen said An oyster swallows the bright moon and A rabbit gets pregnant in both he used the sense of midautumn i a even so the ancients meaning was not in the oyster or the rabbit As Zhimen was an adept in the line of Yunmen each of his say ings had to contain three statements Moreover without arrangement there is a spontaneous fitness Thus he went to the danger point to an swer this monks questions showing a bit of his sharp point unde niably extraordinary Nevertheless this ancient never played with reflections of a light he just pointed out a bit of a road for you to let you see The monk asked What is the body of wisdom Zhimen said An oyster swallows the bright moon Oysters contain bright pearls when the midautumn moon comes out the oysters float to the surface open up and swallow the moonlight from this pearls are produced If there is moonlight in midautumn the pearls are many without a moon the pearls are few  The meaning of this is no different in midautumn when the moon comes out the rabbits swallow its light and become preg nant Here too if theres moonlight the offspring are many with out a moon they are few But even so his meaning wasnt in the words However people later made a living on the words Panshan said The mindmoon is soli tary and full its light engulfs myriad forms The light is not shin ing on objects nor do the objects existlight and objects both forgotten then what is this People today just stare and call this the light they produce interpretations from their feelings driv ing spikes into empty space It s not only your eyes that radiate lightnose tongue body and mind also radiate light To get here you simply must clean up your sense faculties so that theres no reification and you are purified and free Only then will you see the point of this story Xuedou does his verse just this way Verse One piece of empty solidity beyond saying and feeling Try to set your mind on it and you err stir your thoughts and youre obstructed Not even the Buddhas eyes can catch sight of it From this humans and gods see Subhuti Subhuti should be given a thrashing What do you want with this old fellow Even Subhuti has to fall back three thousand miles The oyster swallows the moondeep deep meaning Youd have to be the one involved to understand What meaning is there What further need for deep deep meaning Given to Chan people it makes them fight and struggle When shields and spears are already at rest theres great peace in the world Understand I hit saying How many blows have you taken Commentary One piece of empty solidity beyond saying and feeling With a single line Xuedou has versified it well naturally we can see the ancients meaning When the six senses are still what is this Its just this one mass empty and bright solid and quiescent You neednt go to heaven to look for it You neednt seek it from some one else The perpetual light spontaneously appears before us Fayans verse on perfect reality says When reasonings exhausted saying and feeling are forgotten How could this be properly described Wherever I go the frosty nights moon Falls as it may on the valley ahead The fruits are ripe and heavy with monkeys The mountains go on so far it seems Ive lost my way As I look up theres a remnant of illumination left Actually this is west of my dwelling place Thus it is said Mind is the faculty things are the objects Both are like flaws on a mirror When the defilement of objectification is obliterated The light first appears When mind and things are both forgotten Nature is real It is also said Ive been living in a threeroom hut In the uniform spiritual light myriad objects are at rest Dont use right and wrong to judge me  Fleeting life and its rationalizations having nothing to do with me These verses too let you see one piece of empty solidity beyond saying and feeling From this humans and gods see Subhuti Subhuti was sitting quietly on a cliff when the gods showered flowers in praise  Brahma said You said nothing I heard nothingno speaking and no hearing is true wisdom  and again he caused the earth to tremble and flowers to shower See how Subhuti expounded wisdom so well without speaking of body or function If you can see at this you can see Zhimens saying an oyster swallows the bright moon and a rabbit gets pregnant  Though the ancients meaning was not in the words never theless there was deep deep meaning in his answer This caused Xuedou to say  The oyster swallows the moondeep deep mean in g Here Given to Chan people it makes them fight and struggle The followers of Chan all over have haggled about Zhimens answers noisily never has a single one seen him even in a dream If you want to be a fellow student with Zhimen and Xuedou you must first set eyes on it for yourself Introduction To transcend emotion detach from views remove bonds and dis solve sticking points to uphold the fundamental vehicle of tran scendence and support the treasury of the eye of the true Dharma you must also respond equally in all ten directions be crystal clear in all respects and directly attain to such a realm But tell me are there any who attain the same realize the same die the same and live the same Story One day Yanguan called to his attendant Bring me the rhinoceros horn fan He creates quite a few complications How can it compare with the fine scene here The attendant said The fan is broken Yanguan said If the fan is broken bring the rhinoceros back to me Yu province is still all right the worst suffering is in Korea What does the master want with the rhi noceros The attendant has no reply After all a hammerhead with no hole What a pity Touzi said I do not refuse to bring it out but I fear the horn on its head will be incomplete This seems like it but he has two heads and three faces Its right under his nose Xuedou commented  The rhino is still here Zifu drew a circle and wrote the word rhino inside it Hes playing with a shadow Xuedou com mented Why didnt you bring it out before He doesnt distin guish gold from brass What is he doing avoiding hardship yet speaking of his suffering Xuedou commented What a pity to have worked hard without accomplishing anything It would be even better to give thirty blows of the staff Clearly Commentary One day Yanguan called to his attendant Bring me the rhinoc eros horn fan  Though this matter isnt in words yet if you want to test someones ordinary disposition and ability it is necessary to be able to use words in this way to reveal it this can be called accomplishment without accomplishment effortless power Yanguan was Chan master Jian In ancient times they used to make fans of rhinoceros horn At the time how could Yanguan not have known that his fan was broken He just wanted to test the man to see whether or not he knew where it was Touzi said I dont refuse to bring it out but I fear the horn on the head will be incomplete Xuedou said I want an incomplete horn He harmonizes in a phrase Shishuang said If I return it to you then I wont have it Xuedou says  The rhino is still here Zifu drew a circle and wrote the word rhino inside because he succeeded to Yangshan he liked to use objects to illustrate this matter for people Baofu said  The master is aged he should ask someone else These words are most appropriate the preceding three quotes are after all easy to see but these words have a profound meaning I understood the reasoning when I was with Librarian Qing in the past he said  The master is old and senile getting the head he forgets the tailbefore he sought the fan now he seeks the rhinoceros the ancients saw through this matter so though each was different when they spoke forth they hit the mark every time always having a way of living expres sion Each phrase preserves the bloodline Verse The rhinoceros horn fan has long been in use In summer cool in winter warm They know but they dont understand Better not fool people And you shouldnt suspect anyone else The boundless pure breeze and the horn on the head Where are they In the heavens and on earth The horn has regrown What is it He rouses waves without wind Just like clouds and rain are difficult to pursue when gone Heavens Still this is losing ones money and incurring punishment as well Xuedou also said If you want the pure breeze to return and the horn to regrow Everyone has this fan they have all its power all the time Why do they not know at all when asked Yanguan is still alive I ask you since the fan is broken return the rhinoceros to m e There is yet one or a half It would be better to overturn his Chan seat Then a monk came forth and said Everyone go meditate in the hall He draws the bow after the bandit has gone He had the spear taken away He neither gets to the village nor reaches the shop Xuedou shouted and said I cast my hook fishing for whales but caught a frog Then he got down from the seat He brought this about He drew his bow after the thief had gone Commentary b The rhinoceros horn fan has long been in use  But when asked actually nobody knows Everyone has this fan and has all its power all the timewhy is it that when asked no one knows where its gone The attendant Touzi all the way down to Baofuneither do any of them know Tell me does Xuedou know If you know what this story is about you will know that the rhinoceros horn fan has a boundless pure breeze you will also see the horn towering on the rhinos head The four old men speaking as they did were like the morning clouds and evening rain once gone they are difficult to pursue I ask you since the fan is broken return the rhinoceros to me Then a Chan stu dent came forward and said Everyone go meditate in the hall  This monk has usurped the masters authority He certainly could speak but he was only able to say eighty percent If you want a hundred percent then throw the meditation seat over for him Now you tell me did this monk understand the rhinoceros or not If he didnt yet he knew how to speak this way if he did why didnt Xuedou approve of him Why did he say he cast a hook fishing for whales but only caught a frog Tell me ultimately how is it Introduction One who can discern the tune as soon as the lute strings move is hard to find even in a thousand years By releasing a hawk upon seeing a rabbit at once the swiftest is caught Story One day the Buddha ascended the seat Guest and host both lose This is not the only instance of indulgence ManjusrI struck the gavel and said Clearly observe the Dharma of the Dharma King the Dharma of the Dharma King is thus One person has inti mately understood The Buddha then got down from the seat Sad man do not speak to sad people if you speak to sad people youll sadden them to death Beating the drum playing the lute two masters in harmony Commentary There was already this scene before the Buddha raised the flower At that time if among the crowd there had been  i c someone with the spirit of a Chan adept who could transcend it would have been possible to avoid the final messy scene of raising the flower It is like the story o f Suzong asking Huizhong about making a seamless monument and also like the story of the out sider asking the Buddha about neither the spoken nor the unspo ken Observe the behavior of those transcendent peoplewhen did they ever enter a ghost cave for their subsistence Some say the meaning lies in the silence some say it is in the pause that speech illumines what cannot be said and speechlessness illumines what can be saidas Yongjia said Speaking when silent silent when speaking But if you only understand this way you will never see it even in a dream If you can immediately and directly understand then you will no longer see that there is anything ordinary or holythis Dharma is impartial it has no high or low Every day you will walk with all the Buddhas Verse Among the assembled sages if an adept had known Better not slander old Sakyamuni Its hard to find one or a half among a thousand or ten thousand The command of the Dharma King wouldnt have been like this Those who run after him are numerous Three heads two faces Clearly How many could reach here Had there been a good interpreter in the assembly Its hard to find a clever one in there If ManjusrI isnt an adept you sure arent What need for ManjusrI to strike the gavel The second and third strokes are totally unnecessary How will you speak a phrase appropriate to the situation Dangerous Commentary Among the assembled sages if an adept had known The multi tude of eighty thousand on Vulture Peak were all ranked among the sages Manjusri struck the gavel and said Clearly observe the Dharma of the Dharma King the Dharma of the Dharma King is thus Xuedou says the command of the Dharma King would not have been like this The Nirvana Sutra says Saindhava is one name for four actual things A wise attendant who understood the four meanings would bring the king water when he wanted to wash and needed saindhava when the king asked for saindhava at mealtimes the attendant brought salt when the meal was over he offered him a bowl for tea when he wanted to go out he brought a horse He acted according to the kings intention without error Clearly one must be a good interpreter to do this A monk asked Xiangyan What is the king asking for as saindhava At this time if there had been a good interpreter who could penetrate before the Buddha had even ascended the lecturing seat he would have attained somewhat The Buddha yet ascended the seat then immediately got down al ready he hadnt got to the pointhow was it worth Manjusris still striking the gavel Story  i a A monk asked Daguang Changqing said Joyful praise on the occasion of a meal what did he mean The light shines again It is unavoidable to doubt without asking you wont know Daguang did a dance He draws a cat according to a model After all he misunderstood Hes playing with a shadow Daguang said Foxy devil This kind ness is hard to requite The patriarchs only transmitted this Commentary The Chan patriarchs only transmitted this little bit but do you people know the ultimate point If you know you can avoid this error if not as before you will only be foxy devils Some say Daguang wrenched the others nose around to de ceive him but if it were actually so what principle would that amount to Daguang was able to help others in his statement there is a road along which to get oneself out Daguang said Foxy devil these words cut off Jinniu indeed outstanding  That is the basis on which he produces his verse But tell me is this foxy devil the same as Zhizangs head is white Baizhangs head is black You ignoramus Fine monk or is it different Tell me are these the same or different Verse The first arrow was still light the second arrow went deep A hundred percent bullseyes Where can you go to escape Who says yellow leaves are gold Yet theyll stop crying but even if you can fool a child its no use If the waves of the Chan stream were alike What limit is there to people playing with mud He draws a cat according to a model He lets out a single road Innumerable ordinary people would get bogged down We meet a live one He has involved every Chan practitioner in the world and makes them unable to get a hold he entangles you too and makes you unable to come forth Commentary  The first arrow was still light the second arrow went deep Daguangs dance was the first arrow He also said Foxy devil This was the second arrow This has been the tooth and nail since time immemorial i b Who says yellow leaves are gold Yangshan said You should each look within do not memorize my words Since beginningless time you have turned your backs on the light and plunged into darkness the roots of your false conceptions are deep so after all they are hard to pull out all at once That is why I temporarily set up expedient methods to take away your coarse consciousness this is like using yellow leaves to stop a childs crying It is like ex changing sweet fruit for bitter gourd The ancients provisionally established expedient methods to help people when their crying has stopped yellow leaves are not gold When the Buddha explained timely doctrines these too were just talks to put an end to crying If you can understand youll be like a tiger with wings Introduction The one statement before sound is not transmitted by the sages the single thread before our eyes is forever without a gap Pure and naked bare and clean the white ox on open ground Eyes alert ears alert the golden lionleaving this aside for the mo ment tell me what is the white ox on open ground Story The Surangama Sutra says When I do not see why dont you see my not seeing Good news W hats the use o f seeing Old Sakyamuni has leaked quite a bit If you see my not seeing natu rally that is not the characteristic of not seeing Tsk What idle time is there You shouldnt tell me to have two heads and three faces If you dont see my not seeing Where are you going Its like driving a nail into an iron spike Bah it is naturally not a thing He pushes down the oxs head to make it eat grass What further sound and form is there to speak of how could it not be you To say you or me is totally beside the point Striking I say Do you see old Sakyamuni Commentary The Surahgama Sutra says When I dont see why dont you see my not seeing If you see my not seeing naturally that is not the characteristic of not seeing If you dont see my not seeing it is naturally not a thing how could it not be you  Xuedou here doesnt quote the entire passage of the scripture if quoted in full it can be seen If seeing were a thing then you could also see my sight If seeing alike were called seeing my seeing when I dont see why dont you see my not seeing If you see my not seeing naturally that is not the characteristic of not seeing If you dont see my not seeing naturally it is not a thing how could it not be you  The words are many and I wont record them Ananda intended to say The objects in the world can all be given names I also want the Buddha to point out this subtle spiritual fundamental illumi nationwhat can you call it to let me see the Buddhas intent The Buddha said When I see the incense stand that can be known when I do not see the incense stand then how will you see Just as the Buddha said When I dont see why dont you see my not seeing If you see my not seeing naturally that is not the characteristic of not seeing If you dont see my not seeing naturally it is not a thing how could it not be you If you say you acknowledge sight as an existent thing you are not yet able to wipe away the traces When I dont see is like the antelope with its horns hung up all echo of sound traces of tracks all breath is utterly gone where will you search for it Xuedou goes beyond the eye of the scriptural doctrines to versify he does not eulogize things seeing or not seeinghe just eulogizes seeing the Buddha Verse The whole elephant or the whole oxthe blinding cataracts no different Half open half closed What are you doing clinging to fences and groping along walls One cut two pieces Adepts of all time have together been naming and describing The old barbarian Blind man Hes right at your feet Each atom of every land lies halfway there Will you ever see him even in a dream Commentary The whole elephant or the whole oxthe blinding cataracts no different  A group of blind people groping over an elephant each speaks of a different aspect this comes from the Nirvana Sutra A monk asked Yangshan When you saw someone come and ask about Chan or the way you drew a circle and wrote ox inside what is the meaning of this Yangshan said  This too is an idle matter if you can understand it doesnt come from outside if not you certainly dont recognize it Now I ask you what have the adepts in various places pointed out in you as your Buddha nature Is it that which neither speaks nor is silent If you take that which speaks as it you are like the blind man who has grabbed the elephants tail If you take that which is silent as it you are like the blind man grabbing the elephants ear If you take that which neither speaks nor is silent as it you are like the blind man grabbing the elephants trunk If you say everything is it you are like the blind man grabbing the elephants legs If you say none are it you abandon the elephant and fall into the view of nothingness According to what the blind ones perceive they just attribute different names and descriptions to the elephant dont say percep tive awareness is it yet do not say its not it The sixth patriarch said Enlightenment basically has no tree the clear mirror also has no stand Fundamentally there is not a single thing how is it possible to be defiled by dust  He also said  The Way basically has no shape or form wisdom itself is the Way To attain this understanding is called true transcendent wisdom One with clear eyes sees the elephant and apprehends its whole body the seeing of the Buddha nature is also like this The whole ox appears in Zhuangzi Pao Ding in cutting up oxen never saw the whole ox he followed the internal patterns to cut them apart letting his cleaver glide freely he did not need to add any further effort In a trice head and horn hoof and flesh separated He did this for nineteen years yet his cleaver was still as sharp as though it had just come from the whetstone This is called the whole ox Though he was so excellent Xuedou says that even if you can be like this the whole elephant and the whole ox are no different from blinding cataracts in the eyes All the teachers in India and China and all over the world are just naming and describing Even when all the atoms in the cosmos can be seen in one atom youre still only halfway there theres still another half of the way yonder But tell me where is the Buddha Old Sakyamuni didnt even know himself how would you have me explain Introduction Where there is a Buddha do not stay if you stay there your head will sprout horns Where there is no Buddha quickly run past if you dont run past weeds will grow ten feet high Even if you are clean and free without mental activity outside of things without things outside of mental activity you still have not escaped stick ing to an outmoded method Story Changqing once said Rather say that saints have the three poi sons than say that the Buddha has two kinds of speech What third or fourth kind will you talk about Baofu said What is the Buddhas speech Changqing said How can a deaf man hear He addresses a plea to the sky He snaps his nose around Why only the second level Changqing said What is the Buddhas speech Baofu said Go have tea Commentary While in Xuefengs group Changqing and Baofu were always re minding and awakening each other engaging in discussion The three poisons are greed hatred and folly the fundamental afflictions Changqing said its better to say that saints have the three poisons than to say that Buddhas have two kinds of speech his general idea was to show that the Buddha does not say anything untrue The Lotus Sutra says Only this one thing is true any second besides is not real  It also says There is only one vehicle of truth no second or third  In over three hun dred assemblies the Buddha taught according to potentials giv ing medicine according to disease His idea having gotten this far how can you see The Buddha taught the truth with one voice this I dont denybut Changqing actually has not seen the Buddhas speech even in a dream Its just like a man talking about foodthat cant satisfy his hunger Baofu saw him talking about doctrine on level ground so he asked What is the Buddhas speech Changqing said  How can a deaf man hear it Baofu knew that Changqing had been living in a ghost cave for some time he said I knew you were speaking on the secondary level And after all Changqing lived up to these words he asked back What is the Buddhas speech Baofu said Go have tea Changqing had his spear snatched away by someone else supposedly so great he lost his money and incurred punishment You should know that only when you can see in this way will you see the defeat of these two men  ic Ill lei out a pathway to let others comprehend Some say that Baofu spoke correctly and Changqing spoke incorrectly they just follow words to produce interpretations so they say there is gain and loss They dont know that the ancients were like sparks like lightning If you only look at it in this way youll never see the ancients meaning If you say What is wrong with How could a deaf man hear What is right about Go have tea So it is said Study the living word not the dead word This story is the same as the story of all over the body all through the body there is nowhere you can judge and compare right or wrong It is necessary for you to be clean and free right where you are only then will you see where the ancients met Wuzu said  It is like coming to grips on the front line It requires a discerning eye and a familiar hand In this story if you see it with the true eye where there is no gain or loss it distinguishes gain and loss where there is no near or far it distinguishes near and far Changqing still should have bowed to Baofu Be cause he used this little bit of skill well like thunder pealing or a comet flying But Baofu nevertheless produced tooth upon tooth nail upon nail There are no such things in my royal storehouse Why are you following the false and pursuing the bad A reclining dragon does not look to still water Where one is not there is the moon waves settle Over the four seas a solitary boat goes by itself It is useless to bother to figure it out He threatens people ferociously do you feel your hair standing on end in a chill Striking I say One is here Changqing O Changqing Take in a thief and hell ransack your house Dont appear in a bustling marketplace He lost his money and incurred punishment In the third month at Dragon Gate youve got a failing mark Not one in ten thousand can withdraw and defer to others Xuedou says A reclining dragon does not look to still water How can there be a dragon hidden in stagnant water If it is primary and second ary this indeed is living in stagnant water There must be huge swells wide and vast white waves flooding the sky only there can a dragon be concealed It is just as was said before A limpid pond does not admit the blue dragons coils As it is said Stagnant water does not contain a dragon and A reclining dragon is al ways wary of the clarity of the blue pond That is why Xuedou says that where there is no dragon there is the moon waves settlethe wind is calm the waves grow still Where there is a dragon waves rise without wind much like Baofu s saying to have tea this indeed is rousing waves without wind Xuedou at this point cleans up emotional interpretations for you and has com pleted the verse in the third month at the Dragon Gate youve got a failing mark  Though Changqing was a dragon who had passed through the Dragon Gate yet he got a rap on the head from Baofu Story Zhaozhou spoke three turning words What did he say The three parts are not the same Commentary After Zhaozhou had spoken the three turning words in the end he said  The real Buddha sits within This statement is exceed ingly indulgent That ancient set forth a single eye extended his hand to guide people briefly making use of these words to convey the message he wanted to help others If you onesidedly bring up the true imperative in its entirety there would be weeds ten feet deep in front of the teaching hall To avoid the indulgence of that final statement Xuedou omits it and just versifies three sayings If a mud Buddha passes through water it will dissolve if a gold Buddha passes through a furnace it will melt if a wood Buddha passes through fire it will burn up What is difficult to understand about this Xuedous hundred examples of versifying ancient sto ries are complicated with judgments and comparisons only these three verses directly contain the breath of a Chanist However these verses are nonetheless difficult to understand If you can pass through these three verses Ill allow as you have finished studying Verse  A mud Buddha does not pass through water Spiritual Light illumines heaven and earth Seeing a rabbit he releases a hawk What has it to do with others Standing in the snow if he didnt rest When one person transmits a falsehood ten thousand people transmit it as truth He meets error with error Who has ever seen you Who would not carve an imitation Upon entering a temple you see its nameplate Running up and running down twentyfour hours a daywhat is it You are it Commentary A mud Buddha does not pass through water  Spiritual Light illumines heaven and earth This phrase clearly completes the verse but tell me why does he mention Shenguang Spiritual Light When the second patriarch of Chan was born a spiritual light illumined the room extending into the sky Also one night a spirit appeared and said to him Why remain here The time for you to attain enlightenment has arrived you should go south Because of his association with spirits the second patriarch was eventually named Shenguang Spiritual Light He lived for a long time near Luoyang and studied many books He used to la ment The teachings of Confucius and Laozi only transmit cus tomary norms Recently I hear the great teacher Bodhidharma is living at Shaolin Shenguang thought When people of ancient times sought the Way they broke their bones and took out the marrow shed their blood to appease hun ger spread their hair to cover mud threw themselves off cliffs to feed tigers Even the ancients did this what about m e Then there was a heavy snow Shenguang stood by the wall and by dawn the snow had piled up past his knees he took a sword and cut off his own left forearm and placed in before Bodhidharma Bodhidharma knew he was a vessel of Dharma so he asked him You stand in the snow and cut off your armwhat for Shenguang said My mind is not at ease please ease my mind  Bodhidharma said Bring me your mind and I will ease it for you  Shenguang said When I search for my mind after all I cant find it Bodhidharma said I have put your mind at ease Afterwards Bodhidharma changed Shenguangs name to Huike Later Huike taught the third patriarch Great Master Sengcan So Xuedou says Standing in the snow if he didnt rest who would not carve an imitation If he kept standing in the snow slavish deceivers would imitate him becoming more contrived bogus imitations These are the obsequious phony followers Xuedou is eulogizing a mud Buddha does not pass through water why then does he bring up this story He had reached the point where there was nothing in his mind clean and naked only thus could he versify like this Wuzu always used to have people look at these three verses Dongshan Shouchu composed a verse that he showed to his group Atop Mt Wutai clouds are steaming rice Before the ancient Buddha hall a dog is pissing skyward Frying cakes atop a flagpole Three monkeys pitch pennies in the night And Master Du Shun said When oxen in Huai province eat grain The bellies of horses in Yi province are full Looking for a doctor all over the world To cauterize a pigs left arm And Great Adept Fu said Emptyhanded holding a hoe Walking riding a water buffalo Someone is crossing a bridge The bridge not the water flows It is also said If the capacity of a stone man were like you He too could sing folk songs If you like a stone man You too could join in the opera Verse  A gold Buddha does not pass through a furnace It burns off the eyebrows  Throughout the universe I alone am the Honored One  Someone comes calling on Zihu On the sign several words An illiterate would have no way of understanding even if it were about a cat No Chanists can get their teeth in They may lose their lives Where is there no pure wind Above the head vast and boundless below the feet vast and boundless I also say Its arrived Commentary A gold Buddha does not pass through a furnace  Someone comes calling on Zihu This one phrase has also completed the verse Why does he bring up someone calling on Zihu Master Zihu set up a sign at his gate saying Zihu has a dog above it takes peoples heads in the middle it takes peoples loins below it takes peoples legs  As soon as the monk turned his head Zihu would return to his room But tell me why could he not bite Zhaozhou Zihu also once late at night shouted in the lavatory Catch the thief catch the thief If not you will surely not be able to do anything about the several words on the sign If you want to see it just pass through completely and then you will see Verse  A wood Buddha does not pass through fire I always think of the Oven Breaker Going east going west what is wrong A leper drags a companion along The staff suddenly strikes Its in my hands Who doesnt have it And then one realizes having turned away from self If you cant find it out what use is it After thirty years youll finally get it It is better to be sunk forever than to seek the liberation of saints If you can seize it here youll still not avoid turning away How to be able not to turn away The staff is still in anothers hands Commentary A wood Buddha does not pass through fire   always think of the Oven Breaker  This one phrase also has completed the verse Xuedou because of this Wood Buddha does not pass through fire always thinks of the Oven Breaker The Oven Breaker Monk of Mt Song was not known by any surname his speech and behavior were unfathomable He lived in seclusion on Mt they had a sacred shrine with just an oven in it People sacrificed to it all the time and had immolated very many living creatures The master entered the shrine tapped the oven thrice with his staff and said What humbug You were originally made of brick and mud compounded where does the spirit come from whence does the sanctity originate that you burn living creatures to death like this And he hit it thrice more The oven then toppled over broke and collapsed of itself Momentarily there was a man in a blue robe and tall hat standing in front of the master bowing he said I am the god of the oven for a long time I have been subject to karmic retribution but today hearing you explain the truth of nonorigination I am freed from this place and live in heaven I have come to offer thanks The master said It is your inherent nature not my force saying so The god bowed again and disappeared An attendant said I and others have been around the master for a long time but have never received instruc tion What shortcut did the oven god find that he was immediately born in heaven The master said I just said to him You were originally made of brick and mud put together where does the spirit come from whence does the sanctity emerge  The attendant had no reply The master said Understand The monk said No The master said  Bow The monk bowed the master said Broken Collapsed The attendant was suddenly greatly enlightened Later a monk reported this to National Teacher Huian The teacher said in praise This man has comprehended things and self as one suchness  The oven god understood this principle therefore he was thus that monk was a body composed of five clusters the master also said Broken  Both were enlightened but tell me are the five clusters the same as brick and tiles mud and earth or different Since it is so why does Xuedou say  The staff suddenly strikes  And then one realizes having turned away from self Why does one become turned away It is just a matter of not yet having found the staff And tell me as Xuedou eulogizes A wood Buddha does not pass through fire  why does he cite the story of the oven breaking and collapsing I will explain it directly for you his intention is just to cut off feelings and ideas of gain and loss once clean and naked you will naturally see his kindness Even if you get heaven and earth to change instantly without rejoinder from the four quarters thunder pealing and lightning flying clouds mov ing and rain rushing overturning lakes and toppling cliffs like a pitcher pouring like a bowl emptying you have still not raised a half Is there anyone who can turn the polar star who can shift the axis of the earth Story The Diamond Sutra says If one is scornfully reviled by others one has done wicked acts in previous ages that should bring one down into evil ways but be cause of the scorn and vilification by others in the present age Paying off the roots has effects that extend to the branches One can only accept it with forbearance the wicked action of former ages Where can you look for it Planting grain will not produce beans is thereby extinguished This is adding frost to snow Its like boiling water melting ice Commentary The Diamond Sutra says If one is scorned and vilified by others the fact is that one has done wicked actions in former ages that should bring one down into evil ways but because of the scornful revilement of people in this age the wicked action of former ages is thereby extinguished  According to the ordinary way of inter pretation this is the constant theme throughout the scripture Xuedou brings it up and versifies this meaning to break up the scholastics livelihood in ghost caves Prince Zhaoming classified this part as the ability to clear away obstruction by karma someone like this in former times created hellish karma but hasnt suffered because of the power of good Because of scorn and vilification by people in the present age the wicked karma of former ages is extinguished This scripture therefore can extinguish the bad karma of innumerable eons changing the grave to light chang ing the light to inconsequential and furthermore bringing attain ment of enlightenment According to scholastics reciting this twentyodd page scrip ture is itself called upholding the scripture but what connection is there Fayan said realizing Buddhahood is called upholding the scripture The scripture says All Buddhas and the teaching of the complete enlightenment of all Buddhas come from this scrip ture But tell me what do you call this scripture Dont mistakenly stick by the zero point of the scale The diamond is likened to the body of truth indestructible and capable of breaking through anything This wisdom is of three kinds Knowledge of the character of real ity is true knowledge the one great matter right where you are shining throughout all time beyond intellectual knowledge and opinion it is that which is clean and naked bare and untrammeled Observant illuminative knowledge is the real world it is that which emanates light and moves the earth twentyfour hours a day see ing and hearing Verbal knowledge is the language that can ex press it that is the present speaker and hearer Even if you could match the ability of the sages that would still not be anything special No self no other how could there be near or far I urge you to stop going through lectures It is better to seek the real directly The nature of adamantine wisdom is void of any dust I have heard through I faithfully accept Are all just artificial names c This verse is most excellent it has clearly explained all at once Guifeng picked out a fourline stanza saying All appearances are unreal if you see that forms are not forms you see the Bud dha The meaning of this fourline stanza is exactly the same as Realizing Buddhahood is called upholding this scripture It is also said in the scripture If one sees me in terms of form if one seeks me through sound one is traversing a false path and cannot see the Buddha This too is a fourline stanza we just take from among them those whose meaning is complete A monk asked Huitang What is a fourline stanza Huitang said Your talk is degenerate yet you dont even realize it Xuedou points out what is in this scripture If there is some one who can uphold this scripture then this is the scenery of everyones original ground the original face but if you act accord ing to the Chan imperative the scenery of the original ground the original face would still be cut into three pieces the teachings of the Buddhas wouldnt be worth a pinch Nowadays people only recite scriptures and do not know what the principle is at all They merely talk about how many they have recited in a day They only recognize the physical text perusing the lines and count ing the ink marks They dont realize it all arises from their own original minds that this is only a bit of a turning point Dazhu said Pile up several cases of scriptures in an empty room and see if they emanate light Its just your own mind in spired in a moment of thought that is the virtue Myriad things all come from ones own mind One moment of thought is aware once aware it pervades having pervaded it transforms An ancient said The green bamboos are all true thusness the yellow flowers are all wisdom If you can see all the way through this is true thusness but if you havent seen what do you call true thusness The Flower Ornament Sutra says If one wants to know all the Buddhas of all times one should observe that the nature of the cosmos is all just the fabrication of mind If you can discern then in whatever situations or circumstances youll be the master and the source If you cannot yet get it clear then humbly listen to the verdict Xuedou puts forth an eye and versifies the main theme to clarify the scriptures spiritual efficacy Verse The clear jewel is in the palm It pervades the sky above and the earth below What is he saying Impenetrable on four sides crystal clear on eight faces Whoever has accomplishment will be rewarded with it Were there no accomplishment how would you award it When neither foreigner nor native comes Inside and outside are void of events Still this amounts to something It has utterly no abilities Where would you look for it Outsiders and the king of demons cannot find any tracks Gautama Gautama It was already so before it was said Commentary The clear jewel is in the palm  Whoever has accomplishment a will be rewarded with it If one can uphold this scripture with actual effect then one is rewarded with the jewel This is having ac tual accomplishment Fayan said realizing Buddhahood is called upholding this scripture These two lines have finished versify ing the story Here even the Buddhas eye cannot see But tell me is this accomplishment or is it wicked action Its like the antelope with its horns hung up there is not even a breath much less any sound or trace where could you go to look for it Here there is no road for gods to offer flowers no door through which demons and outsiders might secretly spy The Buddha regarded all beings as his children if even one person aspires to enlightenment and acts on that aspiration the palace of the Evil One trembles and splits because of this and the demons come to torment and con fuse the practitioner Xuedou says that even if the Evil One comes like this still one must make him lose the way and have no av enue of approach  Do you know me or not Do not even speak of demons even should the Buddha come would he know me or not Even Gautama Buddha himself couldnt see him where will you search for him Let those with eyes try to see for sure Story b When Master Tianping was traveling he called on Xiyuan He used to say  Dont say you understand Buddhism I cannot find anyone who can quote a saying Hes let slip quite a bit This man is right but hes like the sacred tortoise dragging its tail One day Xiyuan saw him from a distance and called him by name A double case Xiyuan said W rong He must be tempered in a furnace He splits his guts and wounds his heart When the seal of the three essentials is lifted the red spot is narrow before any at tempt to discuss it host and guest are distinguished Tianping went two or three steps Already hes fallen halfway behind He is washing dirt in mud Xiyuan again say Wrong Splits his guts and wounds his heart Everyone calls this a double case but they dont know it is like putting water in water like exchanging gold for gold Tianping approached As before he doesnt know where to rest As for such Chan monks even if you killed ten thou sand of them what crime would it be Xiyuan said Wrong After all he doesnt know where to rest Later when Tianping was teaching he said to his group A poor man thinks of his old debts twice in a row he said W rong and tried to keep me over there the summer for him to deal with me when I set out for the south I already knew it was wrong What can he do about the two wrongs One day he asked How is it after trampling down the temporary citadel of Nirvana Baoshou said A sharp sword does not cut a dead man Xiyuan said Cut Baoshou hit him  ten times and Baoshou hit him ten times then Baoshou said W hats your hurry to submit this corpse to anothers painful cane Finally he shouted Xiyuan out Then a monk asked Baoshou  That monk who just asked a question is quite reasonable deal with him appropriately Baoshou hit him too and drove him out Tell me when Baoshou also drove that monk out can you say it was just because he was speaking of right and wrong or is there another reason What was his intent Later both succeeded to Baoshou One day Xiyuan went to see Nanyuan Nanyuan asked Where do you come from  Xiyuan said From Xuzhou Nanyuan said What do you bring Xiyuan said I bring a razor from Jiangxi I offer it to you Nanyuan said Since you come from Xuzhou how is it that you have a razor from Jiangxi Xiyuan pinched Nanyuans hand Nanyuan said Attendant take him away Xiyuan left at once  Tianping had once called on Jinshan Because he had gone various places and attained this turnip Chan and put it in his belly everywhere he went he scornfully talked big and claimed to understand Chan and the Way He used to say  Dont say you understand Buddhism I cant find anyone who can quote a say ing His stinking breath affected others and he only indulged in scorn and contempt ic Before the Buddha had appeared in the world before Bodhidharma had come from India before there were questions and answers before there were Chan stories was there any Chan Way The ancients couldnt avoid imparting teachings according to po tentialities people later called them public cases As the Buddha raised a flower Kasyapa smiled later on Ananda asked Kasyapa what special teaching the Buddha had transmitted to him Kasyapa said Ananda Ananda responded Kasyapa said  Take down the flag in front of the sanctuary But before the flower was raised before Ananda had asked where do you find any Chan stories You just accept the useless seals of various centers and once the seal is set you immediately say I understand the marvel of Bud dhism Dont let anyone know Tianping was just like this This is why it is said Study the living word not the dead word When Tianping raised his head he had al ready fallen into two and three Already he had fallen into seventh or eighth place  Tianping immediately went away He seemed right but wasnt really Nevertheless he still had something of the air of a Chanist When Tianping was teaching he said to his group When I was first traveling I was blown by the wind of events to Xiyuan I did not say it was wrong then when I set out for the south I already knew it was wrong  He said quite a bit its just that hes fallen into seventh or eighth place shaking his head thinking out of touch Even before traveling to study you cant call earth sky or mountains rivers fortunately there is nothing to be concerned about at all  If you entertain such common vulgar views why not buy a bandanna to wear and pass your time in a bosss house Whats the use Buddhism is not this principle If you discuss this matter how could there be so many complications If you say you understand while others do not carrying a bundle of Chan around when you are tried out by clearsighted people you wont be able to use it at all Xuedou versifies in exactly this way Verse Followers of Chan The ignoramuses all have their crimes listed on the same indictment Like to be scornful Those who scold Buddhas and revile patriarchs are plentiful Having studied till their bellies are full they cannot use it A square peg does not fit in a round hole He doesnt fear that bystanders may frown And hes gotten people to fret foolishly After all he says at the outset it was regrettable to go traveling He was already wrong before he had gone traveling Wearing out sandals whats the use What is it like Do not speak only of Xiyuan even the Buddhas of all times and the Chan masters everywhere also must fall back three thousand miles Hes still gotten somewhere How does Xuedous wrong compare to Tianpings wrong Xiyuan again appears in the world He settles the case according to the facts But tell me after all how is it Striking I say Wrong Commentary Followers of Chan  Like to be scornful  Having studied till their bellies are full they can not use it This fellow understood but he just couldnt use it He used to gaze at the cloudy sky and say he understood so much Chan but when he was heated a little in the furnace it turned out he couldnt use it at all Wuzu said Theres a kind of person who studies Chan like stuffing cakes in a crystal pitcher it cant be turned over cant be cleaned out and breaks the moment its bumped If you want to be lively and active just study leather bag Chan even if you smash it down from the high est mountain it still wont break wont burst An ancient said Even if you can grasp it before it is spoken this is still remaining in the shell wandering within limitation even if you can thor oughly penetrate upon hearing a phrase you still wont avoid crazy views on the way  How lamentable laughable old Tianping  After all he says it was regrettable at the outset to go traveling Xuedou is saying its lamentable that he couldnt explain to others it s laughable that he understood a bellyful of Chan but couldnt make any use of it Wrong wrong Some say Tianping didnt understand and thus was wrong some say his not speaking was wrong But what connection is there They hardly realize that these two wrong s are like sparks like lightning this is where those transcendent people tread like using a sword to kill people immediately grab bing their throats whereupon their root of life is cut off If you can travel on the swords edge then you will be free in all ways If you can understand these two wrongs then you can thereby see Xiyuans pure wind suddenly melting Tianping Study for thirty more years Introduction b When a dragon howls mist arises when a tiger roars wind arises In the fundamental design of appearing in the world gold and jade play together in the strategic action of omnicompetence arrowpoints meet The whole world does not conceal far and near are equally revealed past and present are clearly described But tell me whose realm is this Story Emperor Suzong asked National Teacher Huizhong What is the Ten Body Controller An adept ruler the emperor of China he should know this On his head is the rolled lobe hat on his feet are unworn shoes The teacher said Walk on Vairocanas head He takes his hand and walks together with him on the other side of the polar mountain What a pity The emperor should have immedi ately shouted then what further need did he have to understand The teacher said Dont acknowledge your own pure reality body Though he makes complications he still has a way out Drunk and doddering he saddens others to death Commentary Emperor Suzong was already studying with National Teacher Huizhong when he was crown prince he honored him even more after he succeeded to the throne personally greeting him and see ing him off even bearing the palanquin One day he asked the teacher What is the Ten Body Controller The teacher said Walk on Vairocanas head The teachers spine was usually stiff as iron but when he came into the presence of the emperor it was like soft mud Though he answered subtly still he had a good point  Dont mistakenly acknowledge your own pure reality body That refers to what is inherent in everyone complete in each individual A good teacher sets up teaching according to potential ob serving the wind to set the sail if one just stayed in one corner how could one interchange See how Huangbo was a skilled guide when he met Linji he beat him thrice and Linji thereupon under stood but when it came to helping Prime Minister Pei Xiu he was extremely complicated Was he not a good teacher National Teacher Huizhong skillfully used appropriate meth ods to teach emperor Suzong in all it was because he had the skill to take on adversaries from all sides The Ten Body Controller is the ten kinds of Buddha body as experienced by others The three Buddha bodiesreality enjoyment and emanationare identi cal to the reality body because the enjoyment and emanation bodies are not the real Buddha not what expounds the Dharma When remaining in the body of reality as a single expanse of empty stillness spiritual luminosity shines tranquilly When Taiyuan Fu was expounding the Nirvana Sutra in Guangxiao temple there was a wandering monkactually it was the cook of Jiashanwho being snowed in took the opportunity to go listen to the lecture When the lecture touched on the three bases of the Buddha nature and the three qualities of the body of reality as Fu spoke profusely of the subtle principle of the reality body the cook suddenly broke out laughing Fu looked at him and had him summoned after the lecture He asked My simple knowledge is narrow and inferior I interpret the meanings ac cording to the words Just now I saw you laugh during the lecture I must have some shortcoming so please explain it to me The cook said Had you not asked I wouldnt speak since you have I must explain I was actually laughing because you dont know the reality body Fu said Whats wrong with my explana tion The cook said  Please explain it once more Fu said  The principle of the reality body is like space extending throughout space and time allembracing and allpervasive He went right away to knock on the Chanists door He had to have broken up his habitually conditioned consciousness so that there is nothing that can be apprehended yet he has still only realized one half But tell me at just such a moment where is the reality body Students of the Way do not know reality Because they still acknowledge the conscious mind Its the root of countless eons of birth and death Yet fools call it the original being People now just acknowledge this radiant awareness and immedi ately stare and glare playing with their spirits As he said  Do not acknowledge your own pure reality body but when it comes to your own reality body you have still not seen it in a dreamhow can you yet talk about not acknowledging it In the doctrinal schools they consider the pure reality body to be the ultimate law why not let people acknowl edge it Whoever can understand the meaning of this will for the first time understand his saying  Dont acknowledge your own reality body Xuedou dislikes his indulgent kindness but never theless there are thorns in the soft mud Master Dongshan had three roads for teaching people called the hidden road the birds path and extending the hands Begin ners temporarily traveled these three roads Even if you clean everything up and make your self trackless and silent yet in the Chan school this is still the view of novices and children You must still turn your heads around to the troubles of the world and fully arouse your great function Verse The Teacher of the Nation is also a forced name Whats the necessity A flower in the sky the moon in the water When the wind passes over the treetops move Huizhong alone may flaunt his good fame After all he occupies the essential bridge Even among a thousand or ten thousand its hard to find one or a half In the Tang dynasty he helped a real emperor Pitiful Whats the use of teaching him Whats accomplished by teaching a blind Chan monk Once he had him tread on Vairocanas head Why doesnt everyone go like this They would find heaven and earth How would you tread Then his iron hammer struck and shattered the gold bones Making everyday life happy Its already so before saying so Between heaven and earth what more is there Within the four seas vast and boundless there are few who know The whole body bears the load Hes scattering sand and dirt The lands and seas of three thousand worlds are still and silent by night Set your eyes high Hold fast to your territory are you waiting to enter a ghost cave I do not know who enters the blue dragons cave Thirty blows of the staff not one can be omitted Do not mistakenly acknowledge your own pure reality body Commentary The Teacher of the Nation is also a forced name  Huizhong alone may flaunt his good fame This verse is just like a eulogy on a portrait To call him National Teacher is also a case of having forcibly affixed a name The Way of the National Teacher is incomparable he was skillfully able to teach others in this way Huizhong alone may be accepted as a master In the Tang dynasty he helped a true emperor  Once he had him tread on Vairocanas head If you have the eye and brain of a perceptive Chanist you must walk on Vairocanas head only then will you see this Ten Body Controller A Buddha is called the Controller this is one of ten epithets One body transforms into ten bodies ten bodies transform into a hundred bodies and on and on to mil lions of millions of bodies in their totality they are just one body the latter part refers to the saying  Dont acknowledge your pure reality body and versifies it in such a way that water poured on cannot wet it it is difficult to explain  His iron hammer strikes smashing the gold bones This re fers to  Dont acknowledge your own pure reality body Xuedou praises Huizhong greatly the golden bones have been smashed by one blow of his mallet Between heaven and earth what more is there It is just necessary to be clean and naked bare and un trammeled so there is no longer anything to be apprehended then this is the scenery of the basic ground It is just like the lands and seas of three thousand worlds still and silent in the night In a universe of three thousand great world systems in the midst of the ocean of fragrant waters there are infinite lands in each land there is a sea Just when the night is deep and still and heaven and earth are clear and calm tell me what is this Just don t make an understanding of closing your eyes If you understand in this way youll fall into the poison sea I do not know who enters the blue dragons cave Stretching out the legs folding the legs who is this Story A monk asked Baling What is the sharpest sword Cut Dan ger Baling said Each branch of coral supports the moon The light engulfs myriad forms the entire land Commentary Baling does not move his shield and spear but how many peoples tongues fall to the ground Yunmen taught people just like this and Baling was his true heir This story is just like this within one statement there are three statements naturally inherentthe statement encompassing the universe the statement cutting off all streams and the state ment following the waves His reply was undeniably outstanding Fushan Yuan said For one who has not yet passed through studying the statement is not as good as studying the intent For one who has passed through studying the intent is not as good as studying the statement Among Yunmens students were three adepts who replied about the sharpest sword But tell me are complete and each branch of coral supports of the moon the same or different Before Xuedou said The three statements should be distinguished one arrow flies through space If you want to understand this story you must cut off the defile ments of feelings and conceptions and be completely purified then you will see his saying Each branch of coral supports the moon If you make up any further rationalizations all the more you  find youre unable to grasp it This expression is from a poem by the Chan lyricist Chanyue from which Baling took one line to reply to the sharpest sword A sword is tested with a hair when a hair blown against its edge splits of itself the sword is the sharpest sword Baling just goes to the point of the question and immediately answers the monks head fell without him even realizing it He hides his body but reveals his shadow Sometimes on the finger sometimes in the palm Leaning against the sky it shines on the snow Even a great smith cannot hone it What do you still want to forge it for Even Gan Jiang the legendary smith couldnt find it Even a master craftsman would never finish polishing it Even if Gan Jiang came forth he too would fall back three thousand miles It is exceptional unique What is so special about it There is something praiseworthy about it Each branch of coral supports the moon In the third watch the moon descends its light shining in the cold pond Tell me where does it go The worlds at peace Drunk and doddering he saddens people to death Commentary Wanting to even the uneven  The great adept seems inept In the past there were wandering warriors on their way when they saw inequity where the strong oppressed the weak they would let fly with their swords to take the heads of the strong In this way Chan masters hide a jewel sword in their eyebrows and hang a golden mallet in their sleeves whereby to settle matters of un rest instead he goes off into a corner and with one stroke secretly beheads the man while the man is unaware of it a Sometimes on the finger sometimes in the palm  Leaning against the sky it shines on the snow If you can understand then it is like the cold severe grandeur of a long sword leaning against the sky An ancient said  The mindmoon solitary and full its light engulfs myriad forms The light is not shining on objects and the objects are not existing either Light and objects both forgotten then what is this This precious sword is some times manifest on the fingertip suddenly it appears in the palm When Librarian Qing reached this point in his explanation of this text he raised his hand and said Do you see Still its not nec essarily in the hand or the finger Xuedou just takes a shortcut to let you see the ancients meaning That is why it is said When the waves are high at the triple gate the fish turn to dragons yet fools still scoop the evening pond water  Xuedou says this sword can lean against the sky and shine on the snow Usually it is said that the light of the long sword lean ing against the sky can shine on the snow this little bit of func tion is such that even a great smith cannot hone it even a master craftsman could never finish polishing it When Xuedou has finished the verse in the end he reveals the sword saying Exceptional unique It is undeniably exceptional and has special excellence it is not like an ordinary sword But tell me how is it special Each branch of coral supports the moon This can be said to be absolutely unique occupying the heartland alone without any peer Ultimately how is it People your heads are fallen Having brought up one hundred old stories How much sand have I thrown in peoples eyes The translator omitted an insertion about the legendary smith Kan Chiang and his sword No Yeh xviiiTHE BAIZHANG ZEN MONASTIC REGULATIONS Compiled by Dehui Abbot of the Master Sage of Great Wisdom and Long Life Temple Edited by Dasu Abbot of the Great Dragons Flying to Assemble for Celebration TempleFascicle One Chapter I Festivities and the Observance of Rites I Hence from ancient times the sublime rulers of this land have continued to revere the teachings of our Western Sage and have never failed to treat Buddhists in a manner well beyond conventional propriety This is because they revere the Way Our indebtedness to imperial favor is as vast as heaven and earth beyond measurement We are obliged to realize the insight of buddhanature and return to the abode of highest good We will give full play to the wondrous faculty of insight to transcend to the height of spirituality lead the populace toward spontaneous conversion and thereby promote benevolence and long life in this

sheet of paper in his sleeve May I request you to compose the word of tribute for the inauguration of the rite of the imperial birthday If the ofcial is not available at the time the scribes assistant

an ofcial at the novice attendants hall also strikes the wooden sounding board three times and the ceremonial leader leads the group of novice attendants toward the kitchen hall They line up in two columns in front of the hall facing each other and wait for the change of drum pitch The novice attendants then take parallel positions behind the administrative ofcials at a slight distance from them When the abbot reaches the rostrum the novice attendants close in behind the administrative ofcials During the winter months everyone is required at this moment to take off his cap to bow With a gesture of greeting the abbot ascends the rostrum seat followed by his chief assistant and receives from him incense proffered on the lid of an incense case Thereupon receiving the incense back the chief assistant pours it into the burner with his left hand simultaneously placing next to it a stick of incense with his right hand while giving a word of prayer After a slight bow the chief

practice hall bell is tolled three times the practitioners bow and leave the hall Inauguration and Fulllment of the Rite of the Imperial Birthday Recorded in the Ancient Regulations The Ancient Regulations record that the practitioners who participated in the rite of the imperial birthday were given a certicate from the director of the practice hall while temporary visitors or recent arrivals were given a similar certicate from the guest reception ofcial in order to verify their status and career This is because in olden days Buddhist as well as Daoist practitioners were required to pay a tax for their exemption on religious grounds from levies of service Though such certicates are not in use today mention is made here to show such bygone regulations Respectfully meeting at Suchandsuch Temple in suchandsuch district and province on suchandsuch day and month For the Day of Festivity of the Imperial Birthday This temple will conduct the commemoration rite on suchandsuch day and month The inauguration of the rite is scheduled at the Buddha hall in the place set up for the prayer rite to Adamantine Immeasurable Life Buddha and practitioners are assigned to recite the

promotion of imperial wellbeing for the sake of The Everlasting Life of the Present Emperor May the Buddhas supernatural vision clearly illuminate and the Dragon God of Heaven witness the sincerity of the foregoing statement Day month and year Respectfully stated by the imperial subject Head Administrative Ofcial Soandso The imperial subject Abbot Priest Soandso  The descending illumination is so dazzling that its brightness cannot be compared even with that of the sun and moon One only knows that it is futile to look up to praise it nor is there any limit to it even when one tries to make a tribute to it One can only entrust oneself to the care of the imperial realm and thereby faithfully weigh the four kinds of indebtedness ie indebtedness toward parents people kings and the Three Treasures Thus one is obliged to exert ones mind in loyalty and love respectfully wishing the throne to be lled with the three kinds of blessing  The imperial network covers myriads of rivers and mountains thereby bringing all of them to imperial deliberation while the three thousand worlds of the lotus storehouse make the great dominion of the empire ever more spacious  May the imperial couple rise the auspicious star shine the exalted seat be ever in peace the unicorn and phoenix bring good fortune and the wise lead making myriads appear as they are The Word of Tribute for the Fulllment of the Rite of the Imperial Birthday The blooming of the lotus ower is an auspicious sign in this world just as it was auspicious that the Buddha was born into this world It meets with the utmost zenith and returns to it and thereby erects the utmost and establishes its center of the universe The harmonious way of our tradition has indeed received an advantage at the time of the best governance comparable to that of  the ancient Sage The bells and drums of this forest enjoy times of peace their sound expanding and increasing Grasses trees and insects receive the permeating benet of such advantage Good omens inaugurate the dawn and hymns celebrate the owery hill While the robes fall and do nothing yet may heaven and earth take their positions myriads of things be nourished and grow forms be created the principles of yin and yang be harmonized the four seasons be in proper order longevity be enjoyed for ten thousand years and the root and branches be extended for one hundred generations The director leads the recitation of the ūraṃgamadhāraṇīs and invokes the name of Medicine Buddha Veneration to Adamantine Immeasurable Life Buddha Benevolent King Bodhisattva and so on The Word of Praise for the First and Midmonth Days in the Tripiṭaka Hall From ancient times it has been customary on these days to read the sutras and conduct the prayer for imperial longevity The abbot then leads the procession each member holding his palms together in three circumambulations around the building or a single circumambulation if the number of participants is too large The Lotusstore ocean in the Huayan universe is lled with vast perfect illumination Although light rushes back and forth in all six directions ie north east south west zenith and nadir this ocean is profoundly quiescent The mystery of this ocean is indeed inexhaustible no matter how much and how far it is praised and exalted Veneration to Adamantine Immeasurable Life Buddha Benevolent King Bodhisattva Mahāsattva and Mahāprajñāpāramitā The Word of Praise for Daily Ritual Services Twice a day at breakfast and the noon meal the practitioners leave the practice hall and are obliged to assemble at the Buddha hall Having intoned the sacred verses of the esoteric chapter we respectfully dedicate the merit accrued thereby to the festivity and promotion of the wellbeing and longevity of the present emperor Veneration to Adamantine Immeasurable Life Buddha and so on The Festivity for the Birthday of the Crown Prince c On the evening before the appointed day the practice hall novice attendants should notify the practitioners of the scheduled sutra chanting by posting a tablet Next morning they toll the practice hall bell to assemble the practitioners at the Buddha hall All the practitioners of this temple have assembled at the Buddha hall and reverently chanted the ūraṃgamadhāraṇīs and praised the sacred name of Medicine Buddha The merit accrued thereby is dedicated to the festivity of the birthday of the Crown Prince divine heirapparent May the wheel of the sun be turned many more times and the brightness of the moon be increased manyfold so that they will be able to illuminate the whole ocean under heaven May the mountain be like sandstone and the river like a girdle so that the foundation of the nation can be strengthened Veneration to Adamantine Immeasurable Life Buddha and so on Each day the large bell is tolled before sutra chanting begins and the scheduled sutras are recited in the Buddha hall The end of the day is concluded with a word of praise The origin of this practice can be traced to the third year of Kaihuang of the Sui dynasty when a decree was issued throughout the land that during the designated months as well as on the six specic days of religious austerity each temple was required to set up a place of practice for prayer and invocation and no life should be taken or injured According to a sutra the deity Vaiśravaṇa  who is said to have conducted inspection tours every year over the four great continents happened to regulate the southern continent and prohibited the slaughter of animals during the rst fth and ninth months When Tang provincial governors received their appointments to their respective territories they customarily used to by sponsoring a feast for their victorious soldiers whose number was never less than several tenthousands thus increasing the slaughter of animals for food Popular belief however wrongly attributed this custom to superstitious fear Preface to the Chapter The state has the duty of conducting the sacricial rite for the supreme for the imperial ancestors and the rite for the four seasons Each emperor is said to govern the realm of heaven and earth as an incarnate Buddha body  and upon completing his task of transforming the realm returns to the state of buddhahood Thus in those temples in the capital that are supported by the government the imperial portrait is placed in the Buddhas altar Five times a month the portrait is enshrined with offerings and words of reverence as though for a living person and is venerated with a kind of nurturing protective thought We can observe generally that wherever the imperial power of spiritual transformation ows it has spread along with the teachings of the Buddha with no obstruction Thus Buddhist followers have been bathed in the benevolent waves and marshlands Finally set up the imperial seat on the rostrum in the Dharma hall and place the imperial tablet with the sacred name ie that of the deceased emperor solemnly inscribed on a sheet of yellow paper enshrining it with incense a ower vase candle stand table and oor sheet On the appointed day the practitioners assemble at the Dharma hall at the signal of the practice hall bell After is over he concludes the service with the following invocation of merit transference We dedicate the merit thereby accrued to the enshrinement of the imperial carriage with further assistance It is humbly wished that the imperial spirit may enjoy all the corners of the universe assume a visit on the chariot formed of clouds and winds receive the delight of his abode in the center of the sky and of his palace inlaid with precious gems and his pavilion adorned with colorful gems Various Prayer Services Whenever an occasion for prayer arises the place of its performance must be prepared in strict accordance with the rules and must be furnished with food and other offerings The practitioners must carry out their duties in a tidy and austere manner while the administrative ofcials are obliged to supervise the outer and inner temple operations and make their rounds through various quarters and buildings in order to keep them clean His novice attendants are then instructed to inform the practitioners of the coming event and to post the signboard announcing the prayer service Twice a day at morning and noon mealtimes the practitioners assemble at the signal of the bell to chant sutras Either the reading of the three Tripiṭaka scriptures or the four major groups of scriptures ie the Perfection of Wisdom Sutra  the Sutra of the Heap of Jewels  the Flower Ornament Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra  is to be carried out for three ve or seven consecutive days according to the particular situation In the cases of prayers for sunshine or rain practitioners are grouped in teams of ten twenty thirty or fty members led by the rst member of each team so that the sutra chanting can be carried out without interruption from one team to another This is called the uninterrupted wheel of chanting After a whole day of chanting there should be a rite of fulllment and a word of invocation with earnest wishes for a favorable response The format of each invocation is given below The Prayer Invocation for Sunshine It is anxiously observed that vicious rain has caused much damage by preventing things from realizing their function Hundreds of rivers have swept away all things leaving no place of refuge This is a result of the karma shared in common by all people The objective of this prayer is fair weather May a prompt response be granted so that the persistent clouds may be swept away from all elds in the four directions the gloomy disharmony be dispersed the bright sun may appear in the center of the sky and its glorious rays illuminate enabling all human activities to occur in proper order and enabling myriads of things to realize the fulllment of their lives The Prayer Invocation for Rain It is anxiously observed that the suns overbearing rays precipitate disasters for all kinds of crops This is not a punishment heaven sends from above but a result of the mounting transgressions of people below The objective of this prayer is abundant rainfall May the cloud dragon rise over the mountains and rivers bringing about abundant rain so that farm work may be done and the harvest season may be completed once again The Prayer Invocation for Snowfall It is anxiously observed that whenever the winter is unusually warm living things are always harmed Snowfall puries the noxious atmosphere of the land below We thus offer incense with utmost sincerity wishing for the good omen of snowakes amassed on the ground The objective of this prayer is snowfall May a prompt response be granted so that snowclouds may spread equally over thousands of miles and there may be abundant rain and snowfall in the eight regions of the universe the six agencies of nature may operate through the threefold processes ie essential efcient and selfregenerating grasses and trees may grow thick the two principles of yin and yang may be harmonized and the ve primary elements of nature may be in good order and thereby gods and humans may be in harmony The Prayer Invocation for the Dispersion of Locusts It is anxiously observed that ying locusts ll the entire sky This is a bad omen to be feared for after they disappear by entering the ground no one knows where they may stir up calamities again Unless supernatural efcacy is rendered no matter how many human hands may attempt it the dispersion cannot be accomplished The objective of this prayer is the expulsion and dispersion of locusts The Prayer Invocation for a Day of Eclipse It is predicted that an eclipse will take place today and that the ve regulatory agencies of time ie year day month constellation and calendrical numeration are slightly out of proper order Because of such disorder it is feared that the mighty force of heaven might cause the six kinds of evil celestial phenomena ie periods of continuous cloud cover drought wind rain darkening and gloaming to occur Thus in order to rescue the people from their fear and protect them from confusion we rely on the power of the buddhas Teams of practitioners have respectfully conducted uninterrupted prayer through chanting the sacred scriptures and esoteric verses in order to extend our help and protection May the spirit of the sun promptly regain its light so that its ve variegated rays spread wide illuminating the earths surface below and causing shadows to disappear and the sun shines brightly throughout the sky The Prayer Invocation for a Day of Lunar Eclipse The moon is the master of the night through its shining nature of yin The faintness of its illumination during an eclipse reveals heavens inauspicious omen to the people May the owery moon promptly return to its brightness so that evil darkness extinguishes its trace and the clear light may once again manifest itself over the earths land hills and rivers May the moon maintain long life so as to include myriads of phenomena in its vast and cool palace It is neither possible to know its origin even if one were to shake heaven and earth nor to know its fulllment by exhausting myriads of years Buddhas and sentient beings are equally endowed with this nature By acquiring insight into this nature one reaches the summit of wondrous enlightenment by straying from it one is washed away by the waves of life and death From one kalpa to the next one goes through different births in the sixfold cycle of rebirth in accordance with ones karmic retribution and nds no end to this process We Zen practitioners have reverently inherited the formality of the attire and the lineage of his Dharma transmission What we advocate as his principle of practice are the codes of discipline and morality  what we propagate as his word of truth is the body of teachings  and what we transmit as his mind of transcendence is the state of meditation  Moreover our compliance with the socalled Great Origin is to identify ourselves with the totality of the Buddhas wondrous faculty alone through which for the rst time we are called the Buddhas disciples and transmit the life of his insight The Buddhas Birthday Commemoration  The Ascent to the Dharma Hall Prior to the day the practice hall ofcial collects contributions from the practitioners and entrusts the collection to the head administrative ofcial in order to obtain various offerings The procedure is identical to that of the imperial birthday rite When the appointed day comes the head administrative ofcial respectfully sets up a small pavilion decorated with owers in the Buddha hall and places in it a statue of the infant Buddha with a tray of scented water and provides a pair of small dippers and various offerings in front of the pavilion On the felicitous morning of the Buddhas birthday disciple Soandso abbot of Suchandsuch Temple in charge of the Buddhas teaching reverently offers fragrant incense to express care and devotion for the sake of the Original Patriarch ākyamuni Tathāgata the Great Preceptor  May all the buddhas manifest themselves in this world within every successive moment of our consciousness so as to rescue all beings of this Dharma world  Next the abbot sits down crosslegged and says On this eighth day of the fourth month we greet the commemorative morning of the birth of the Original Patriarch ākyamuni Tathāgata the Great Preceptor Disciple Soandso abbot of this temple a remote descendant in charge of the Buddhas teaching has ascended this main rostrum seat to offer the teaching of vehicle of religious salvation The abbot descends the rostrum seat and leads the practitioners toward the Buddha hall When the practitioners have taken their respective positions facing the Buddha image the abbot burns incense and performs three prostrations with halfopened sitting cloth before the altar Without folding his sitting cloth he proceeds to the altar and conducts the offering of sweet hot water and food His guest reception assistant hands him the offerings while the incense offering assistant places them on the altar The abbot returns to his position and again performs three full prostrations and once again proceeds to the altar to offer incense a monetary gift and tea Once again he returns to his position performs three prostrations and stands folding his sitting cloth The single moon abiding in the sky magnanimously imprints its image into the multiple waves of water The single Buddha coming into this world has made multiple buddhas appear and sit on a lotus ower The single light issuing from the Buddhas forehead illuminates all three worlds The single ow of nectar benets all sentient beings born through the four different modes at once Now I respectfully bathe the Tathāgatas The merit body that embellishes their pure insight I wish all sentient beings to be freed from the ve kinds of delement And equally realize the pure Dharma body of the Tathāgata We dedicate the merit accrued from this chanting to the absolute truth and ultimate reality for the sake of adorning the bodhi that is the fruit of buddhahood Veneration to the buddhas of the ten directions and the three times and so on The Word of Tribute The Great Ocean is profoundly quiescent and we hear nothing but the rumbling vibration of its current The Great Void is totally transparent and we see nothing but the latitudinal movement of its respective weft and warp Though there is neither Buddha nor  may each of all dharmas proclaim the precious verses of bathing the Buddha Though there is neither lth nor purity may particle after particle of dust cleanse the golden body The Buddhas Enlightenment and Nirvana  The Buddhas Enlightenment Day Prior to the day marking the Buddhas enlightenment the practice hall ofcial collects contributions from the practitioners and entrusts the collection to the head administrative ofcial in order to obtain various offerings On the eighth day of the twelfth month we reverently greet the commemorative day on which the Original Patriarch ākyamuni Tathāgata the Great Teacher realized enlightenment Assembling all the practitioners of this temple and offering incense owers candles and tea as well as fruit and delicacies we have expressed our care and devotion to the original master of our religion With the special merit thereby accrued we wish in part to discharge our indebtedness to the compassion bestowed upon us and in part along with all sentient beings of the Dharma world wish for them to discover their own insight and turn the great wheel of the Dharma by entering into each innitesimal particle I respectfully announce that we shall leave this hall and with proper dignity and decorum proceed to the hall of the great Buddha to chant sutras Perceiving the morning star over Mount Perfect Enlightenment  the Buddha realized the path Lifting the sun of insight in the great universe composed of a thousand universes he thereby let its illumination ow forth  The Buddhas Nirvana Day On the day of commemoration for the Buddhas nirvana initially the abbot offers incense at the Buddha hall to conduct the midmonth prayer chanting for imperial wellbeing and following that he ascends the rostrum seat at the Dharma hall for preaching as usual On this day of the Buddhas nirvana Soandso Bhikṣu abbot of Suchandsuch Temple remote descendant of the Buddhas teaching respectfully offers precious incense to express our care and devotion for the Great Teacher and Original Patriarch ākyamuni Tathāgata We wish in part to discharge our indebtedness for his compassion in bestowing refuge on us and in part to express along with all sentient beings of the Dharma world our dear remembrance of him On the fteenth day of the second month we reverently honor the commemorative day of parinirvāṇa on which the Original Patriarch Great Teacher ākyamuni Tathāgata entered total cessation Assembling the practitioners and reverently offering incense owers candles tea fruit and delicacies we express our care and devotion to the master With the special merit accrued thereby we wish in part to discharge our indebtedness to the compassion bestowed on us and in part along with all sentient beings of the Dharma world to perfectly realize omniscient knowledge Upon descending from our seats we shall leave this hall and proceed to the Buddha hall with dignity and decorum and chant sutras for this Nirvana Day The abbot descends the rostrum seat and leads the practitioners The pure Dharma body essentially has neither phenomenal appearance nor disappearance but through the power of the vow of great compassion it shows as phenomenal appearance or nonappearance b When the word of tribute is completed he immediately calls for chanting the sutras and concludes with the same invocation of merit transference as before People use it in daily life they are not aware of it only attributing it to the enlightened of the past The Buddha is called the Worldhonored One because he knows both the world of convention and its transcendence He initiated the path of conversion through his entire career by following the standard tradition of the past buddhas When he sat under the bodhi tree the Evil Ones palace darkened the entire world but the Buddha made the lotus ower bloom and the wheel of the Dharma forever turn brightly At the moment when one fully realizes what is truly eternal both existence and nonexistence disappear enlightened and unenlightened become equally a dream or illusion While myriad phenomena continue to change past and present become one moment in which heaven and earth are lost in a dazzling ray of light Indeed what do any of the remote descendants really know May form and nonform light and darkness all equally express the miraculous sound of the Dharma and may squirming worms and living creatures equally realize ultimate insight and meritorious virtue How much more authentic could a transmission be when the realization of buddhahood was directly transmitted to who understood the meaning that ākyamuni imparted by lifting a ower by its stalk Abiding in multiple illusions one is obliged to return to what they really are this is called ultimate quiescence Yet the mysterious gem always illuminates turbidity and lth without discrimination and the precious moon does not avoid casting its reection onto polluted water Great concentration has no limit in space and always abides through myriads of kalpas as many as the sands of the Ganges River Nevertheless we cannot forget the historical aspect of the Buddha and we feel that his memory is ever more dear to us on this memorial day May the Buddha rectify wrong views entertained by those of us who are remote descendants of his teaching reverse the trend of this degenerate period to that of Right Dharma in which both concentration and insight are equally practiced and convert the Evil One and his entire clan to be leading protectors of the religion A Brief Biography of the Buddha The Buddha was born on the continent of India This Sanskrit name is translated as Sweet Beet in Chinese The rst ancestor a royal sage was shot with a hunters arrow At his death his blood owed into the ground c from which two sugarcane stalks sprouted Because the king came from a descendant of the sun his race was also called the suns race From that time after seven hundred generations the lineage reached the time of King uddhodana Because the Buddha had fullled meritorious deeds for myriads of kalpas he entered the womb of Queen Māyā by descending from the Tuṣita Heaven He was born on the eighth day of the fourth month in the twentysixth regnal year Jia and Yin of King Shao of the Zhou dynasty He was named Sarvasiddhārtha One Whose Every Goal Has Been Accomplished On the seventh day after his birth his mother died and he was raised by his mothers younger sister Mahāprajāpatī He cut off his hair and became a mendicant He exchanged his luxurious garments for a hunters clothing crossed the Ganges River to the south and reached the hills of Gayā where he practiced meditation and austerities For six years Siddhārtha toiled hard maintaining his endurance with only a single grain of hemp and rice  He thought to himself that if he continued the ascetic way heretics would claim that selfabnegation is the way to reach nirvana So instead he bathed in the Nairañjaṇā River and accepted a meal of milkrice gruel from the cowherd maiden Sujātā The god Indra made a seat out of kuśa grass and bade him sit on it crosslegged the king of the evil ones mobilized his army to try to disrupt Siddhārthas meditation but none of Māras attempts could prevail in disrupting his determination Thus departed after saluting the Buddha with apologies and repentance On the morning of the eighth day of the second month when he saw the morning star Siddhārtha suddenly attained a great intuitive understanding and realized the highest path highest perfect enlightenment  Some traditions hold that this occurred on the eighth day of the twelfth month the rst year of Zhengjian of Zhou there are different interpretations in other traditions He was then thirty years old Immediately the Buddha is said to have preached the Flower Ornament Sutra at the seat of enlightenment in the forest of Magadha The listeners had not yet ripened were unable to comprehend the teaching as if they were deaf and dumb For three weeks the Buddha meditated under various trees and thought of entering nirvana Meanwhile Brahmā and Indra respectfully requested the Buddha three times to remain and teach what he had realized Thus the Buddha traveled to the Deer Park where he conducted the First Turning of the Great Wheel and taught the three vehicles initially to his ve disciples including Kauṇḍinya Here he taught the Four Noble Truths the twelve links of the chain of causation  the six principles of practice and so forth Twelve years later at the age of fortytwo the Buddha introduced a more advanced teaching recorded in the general Mahayana texts  and thereby was able to educate more disciples and consolidate a rm basis of his sangha By then having reached his seventysecond year he began to teach the Lotus Sutra and thereby entrusted his task to his disciples and assured their future realization of buddhahood Yet in the following eight years he continued to detail his original intent In the ftythird regnal year of King Mu year of Ren and Shen at the age of seventynine the Buddha for the rst time visited the Tuṣita Heaven to preach for his mother In his absence King Udayana who yearned for his master ordered a golden image to be cast and when the Buddha descended from heaven the golden statue is said to have welcomed his return The Buddhas aunt Mahāprajāpatī and her ve hundred female followers as well as such saintly disciples as āriputra Maudgalyāyana seventy thousand arhats and so forth felt unable to bear the passing of their master and hence passed away at the same time The bodhisattvas the four groups of followers ie monks  nuns  laymen  and laywomen  the eight groups of demigods and the kings of the birds and animals all assembled while the Buddha allowed Cunda a smith to make the last food offering For the sake of his disciples the Buddha preached the a principles of impermanence  suffering  and emptiness  Mañjuśrī conveyed the Buddhas wish to nanda and brought him back to the place At once Subhadra came to listen to the Buddhas teaching and immediately attained the state of arhatship O disciples after my death you must pay respect to the prātimokṣa rules and disciplines There is no lessening of its importance He lay his right side on a cloth decorated with seven kinds of precious gems Aniruddha immediately went to the Tuṣita Heaven to tell Queen Māyā that the Buddha had entered parinirvāṇa As she came down from heaven the Buddha once again raised himself to preach in order to console his mother and then said to nanda You must know that because I fear there might appear some unlial people in the future I have exemplied lial piety by coming out of the golden cofn to greet my mother At that moment Mahākāśyapa leading the group of ve hundred disciples arrived running from the hills of Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa and greeted him with lamentation Once again the Buddha miraculously revealed the mark of the sacred symbol of the Wheel of One Thousand Spokes on the soles of his feet Heavenly beings brought aromatic woods to the cremation site and the cremation re continued to burn by itself for seven days Lay followers deposited the Buddhas relics in eight golden vases King Ajātaśatru as well as the kings of eight countries the god Indra and other gods as well as the nāga kings all vied for acquisition of the relics Thus they divided the relics into three portions one for the heavenly gods a second for the nāga kings and the third was further divided among the eight kings King Ajātaśatru obtained eightyfour thousand pieces placed each within a purple and gold case and enshrined them in stupas he had built in the regions of the ve major rivers that ow into the Ganges River Nirvana Day of the Emperors Religious Counselor  Offerings of incense owers candles tea fruit and delicacies should be carefully prepared On the appointed day the bell is tolled to assemble the practitioners and they line up facing the rostrum seat The abbot kneels to offer incense at a portable incense burner while at the same time the director reads the word of tribute The merit accrued from the foregoing deed of chanting shall be dedicated to the one Above the Emperor under the imperial heaven  the great sage who assisted imperial governance by introducing religion and propagating letters the spiritual ruler who endowed with supreme virtue universal enlightenment and true illumination unfailingly assisted the throne in ruling the nation the Buddhist disciple from the Western Heaven and the imperial counsel of the great Yuan We wish to discharge our indebtedness to him for the compassionate refuge bestowed upon us Veneration to the buddhas of the ten directions and the three times and so on The Word of Tribute Heaven inaugurated the nation of Yuan and magnanimously created the great sage as its counselor He quietly helped the foundation of cultural conversion and privately assisted the imperial rule When he spoke his speech became a religious text When he lifted his foot his act became rule His rank was among a thousand buddhas the generosity he extended matched that of earth and his supreme intelligence matched that of heaven A Brief Biography of the Religious Counselor The imperial counselor of religion Baheshiba  whose ordained name was Huichuangxianjixiang was a man of Tibet He was born on the thirteenth day of the fourth month in the year of the sixth stem and boar His father was called Suonangancang During the beginning of Tibet there was a national master of Buddhism āntarakṣita by name He realized the supreme insight and acquired the supernatural powers and his descendants equally excelled in spiritual matters and religious practice through successive transmission The rulers of that country honored them as their religious counselors The man of the seventeenth generation Sasijiawa by name was the paternal uncle of the master At the age of seven he gave his rst lecture and demonstrated his speech showing himself to be well versed and totally commanding At the age of fteen in the year of the tenth stem and ox he came to know that the heavenly mandate would fall to Emperor Shizu Longdeyuanqian  He traveled swiftly on horseback to reach the capital in order to ofciate for him at the ordination ceremony of the Buddhist laity for Xianzong his queen Zhongwei and the Crown Prince  imparting special meaning to the event of their conversion After six years had passed in the year of the seventh stem and monkey Shizu ascended the throne and established the Yuan dynasty in the Zhongtong era Four years later bidding farewell to the emperor he returned west However he was called back before a year had passed In the seventh year of Zhiyuan the seventh stem and horse he was entrusted with the task of creating a new set of scripts as standard for the great Yuan empire Since his accomplishment was profoundly satisfactory to imperial expectation a decree was immediately issued for the prompt enactment of its usage throughout the respective divisions of capitals provinces prefectures and districts The master was appointed religious counselor to the throne the spiritual ruler embodying the great treasure of the BuddhaDharma and was granted the imperial seal c Once again the master returned to the west Eleven years later the emperor sent a special envoy to ofcially invite him back to the capital On the twentysecond day of the eleventh month in the seventeenth year of Jiyuan the master passed away Upon learning of his death the emperor could hardly bear his dear memory and ordered a great stupa built in the capital in order to enshrine the ashes of the master The one Above the Emperor under the imperial heaven the great sage who assisted imperial governance by introducing religion and propagating letters the spiritual ruler who endowed with supreme virtue universal enlightenment and true illumination unfailingly assisted the throne in ruling the nation the Buddhist disciple from the Western Heaven and the imperial counselor of the great Yuan Preface to the Chapter The reason that each person should enshrine his ancestors is to regard the beginning of his form and life as important Form and life begin with love and yet forms change in time and so does love exhaust itself in time Yet the spiritual aspect of the essential nature is never obscured because it neither depends on life nor does it disappear when life ends Therefore the Buddha taught that humans must acquire clear insight into this nature And yet misguided by words and statements scholars of later periods cannot grasp the true meaning as if a doctor were to adhere to the medical textbook too well and forsake actual treatment with medicine and acupuncture What value is there in this Thus any one of us who succeeds in the lineage and hands it on to another must accomplish this just as re naturally burns fuel or water takes the form of the vessel  There is no difference not even as slight as a single hair between past and present Doesnt this tradition emphasize the meaning of original form and life In later days Zen Master Baizhang Dazhi instituted the Zen monastic regulations so that the practitioners of our tradition could abide by their own standards and this was indeed the origin of the Zen monastic community The Venerable Shouduan of Haihuiyuan Temple advised that it is our duty to enshrine Bodhidharma in the center Baizhang to his right and the founder of each temple to his left Look for this information in the introductory chapter of the Regulatory Rules of the Patriarchal Hall  The Memorial Rite for the Patriarch Bodhidharma Prior to the appointed day the practice hall ofcial is obliged to organize the memorial service by collecting contributions and see that word of tribute is composed and approved At the righthand side of the rear of the hall a meditation couch a brush duster and a clothes rack with robes hung upon it should be set up and at the lefthand side of the rear of the hall a chair desk incense burner vases incense and candles should be set up and some scriptures placed on the desk The practice hall novice attendants notify the practitioners of the coming event and post the signboard indicating sutra chanting and also announce to them There will be the memorial service with sutra chanting this evening and also another for fulllment chanting tomorrow midmorning Please be reminded of proper attire Before the evening Zen session the practice hall bell is tolled to assemble the practitioners at the Dharma hall Drumming signals the special rite of offering sweet hot water The abbot burns incense and performs three prostrations  Without folding his sitting cloth he proceeds to the altar to offer hot water and returning to his place performs another three prostrations Then he returns to his seat performs two prostrations and folds up his sitting cloth Ernestly reecting upon the tradition our religion transmits Zen experience in the manner of direct ngerpointing and gratefully depends on the reverberation of the subsequent waves of descendants who transmit it The ultimate Way is vast and difcult to name we hesitate to enjoin this brilliant luster of the Way to any of those remote future generations May the practitioners pray for the gracious assistance of the buddhas by intoning their ten sacred names the Luminous Pure Dharma Body Vairocana Buddha and so on The prayer concludes with the director intoning the following invocation of merit transference We respectfully dedicate the merit accrued from the foregoing prayer to the First Patriarch Bodhidharma perfectly enlightened Great Master Veneration to the buddhas of the ten directions and the three times and so on After the practice hall bell tolls three times the practitioners leave the hall or they may be invited to take their seats for an evening meal While the evening bell tolls the practice hall bell signals the practitioners to assemble and proceed toward the Dharma hall once again The pure Dharma body has essentially neither phenomenal appearance nor disappearance but because of the great compassion and power of its vow it shows as it were phenomenal appearance as well as disappearance We implore May compassion shine its bright mirror reection upon us On the fth day of this month the memorial day has arrived on which the First Patriarch Bodhidharma the perfectly enlightened Great Master and Great Priest entered absolute quiescence Assembling  all the disciples and offering incense and provisions we thereby express our care and devotion for the master We humbly dedicate the merit accrued from chanting the ūraṃgamasūtra for the sake of discharging our indebtedness to the compassion which has bestowed refuge upon us We humbly pray Veneration to the buddhas of the ten directions and the three times and so on Lastly lay devotees line up to worship the patriarch Early the next morning the abbot burns incense performs prostrations offers sweet hot water and rice gruel and participates in the rice gruel breakfast sitting to the side of the patriarch The merit accrued by the foregoing chanting shall be respectfully dedicated for the sake of the First Patriarch Bodhidharma perfectly enlightened Great Master and Great Priest Veneration to the buddhas of the ten directions and the three times and so on He is aided by the guest reception assistant who hands the offerings from the abbot to the incense offering assistant who respectfully sets them on the table beside the patriarchs tablet When this is completed the abbot returns to his position and performs three prostrations as before then once again immediately goes forward to burn incense and offer a monetary gift Upon returning peforms another three prostrations then stands folding his sitting cloth This procedure is identical to that of the special serving of sweet hot water After the special serving of tea the abbot offers incense with prayer and utters a word of tribute Next the director invites the ranking practitioners of the east and west halls followed by the dual order ofcials to proceed in pairs to offer incense at the incense burner The pure Dharma body has in essence neither phenomenal appearance nor disappearance Only because of great compassion and the power of its vow it manifests as it were phenomenal appearance as well as nonappearance The merit accrued by the foregoing chanting shall be respectfully dedicated for the sake of the First Patriarch Bodhidharma perfectly enlightened Great Master and Great Priest Veneration to the buddhas of the ten directions and the three times and so on The Word of Tribute How great was the authentic transmission of the Dharma to China by the distinguished descendant of the enlightened spiritual ruler His insight vast limitless openness and nothing especially holy indeed broke the vital point of the pedantic scholasticism then prevalent When hundreds of rivers reach the vast ocean they all lose their singularity When the bright sun shines in midsky there is no shadow to follow anything on the ground Pointing to the mind of humans he enabled us to see that to become a Buddha means to become mind itself Experiencing the wondrous path one forgets words while having lost words one sees the path As this is a greatly benecial teaching in the world it should widely ourish in terms of its tradition Making a rare appearance in this turbid world by becoming the First Patriarch he found a Mahayana receptacle in the country of China and totally immersed him in the grain The robe of faith symbolizes the weightiness of the buddhas and patriarchs and the strength capable of bearing a thousand weights May a single ower once again bloom in the spring of heaven and earth so that its fragrance may be transmitted through tens of thousands of generations A Brief Biography of Bodhidharma b The patriarch was born the third son of the king of Xiangshi in South India His family belonged to the noble class and his own name was originally Bodhitāra Later along with his two brothers he happened to meet the twentyseventh patriarch Prajñātāra Because the master saw the innate capacity of the patriarch he tested him and his brothers in debate on the meaning of his gift of a gem to them Prajñātāra told him You have acquired the whole inclusive principle and since Dharma conveys the entire inclusive meaning of the Mahayana your name should be changed to Dharma Thus the patriarchs name became Bodhidharma The patriarch asked his master As I have accomplished the essentials of the religion in which country should I propagate Buddhism Please give me a suggestion sir Prajñātāra replied Although you have obtained the essential of my religion you shall not go anywhere far distant Just stay in South India and wait for an opportunity sixtyseven years after my death Then you should go to China where you can set up a great Dharma session to teach the best qualied but do not leave India immediately lest you become quickly exhausted by the troublesome environment of Chinas capital city On the twentyrst day of the ninth month in the eighth year of Putong of Liang in the year of the fourth stem and sheep Bodhidharma arrived in Southern China Suang the prefect of Guangzhou sent an ofcial report to Emperor Wu of Liang  The emperor dispatched his envoy with a decree inviting the patriarch to his imperial court Bodhidharma arrived in Jinling on the rst day of the tenth month and spoke with the ruler but they did not reach an accord in their meeting Thereupon Bodhidharma crossed the Yangtze River to the north on the nineteenth day and reached Luoyang on the twentythird day of the eleventh month which was the tenth year of Taihe under the reign of Emperor Xiaoming of the Wei dynasty He stayed in Shaolinsi the temple of Mount Songshan and spent years facing the wall in silent meditation No one was able to fathom his purpose he was called the wallfacing brahman On the fth day of the tenth month in the nineteenth year of Taihe  he passed away while sitting upright in meditation He was buried on Mount Xiongershan on the twentyeighth day of the twelfth month of the year and a memorial stupa was erected within Dinglinsi During the Tang dynasty Bodhidharma was honored by the title Yuangue Dashi  and the stupa is called Kongguan  The Memorial Rite for Baizhang Prior to the appointed day the practice hall ofcial collects contributions to obtain various offerings On the evening before the day the ceremonial place should be set up properly in the Dharma hall We implore May compassion shine its bright mirror reection upon us On the seventeenth day of the rst month we have respectfully honored the memorial day on which Baizhang Dazhi Jiaming Huangcong Miaoxiang Changshi entered absolute quiescence Assembling all the disciples and offering incense and provisions we thereby express our care and devotion for the master We humbly dedicate the merit accrued from chanting the of the ūraṃgamasūtra for the sake of discharging our indebtedness for the compassion which has bestowed refuge upon us May the rare ower of the uḍumbara tree once again appear to herald springtime in the garden of enlightenment and the insight of the sun extend daylight to forever illuminate the night of dark delusion Veneration to the buddhas of the ten directions and the three times and so on The Word of Tribute He spoke it became the law of the land It exactly marks the norm and establishes the standard Through tens of thousands of generations the Way he established has been known as worthy of reverence The richness of the content is comparable with that of the literary works of Shiqu and Tianlu In content the discourses of teaching and the rules of restraint are combined in a mutually complementary form and the precision represents a specimen of golden sentences and gemlike phrases combined The rules of regulation are ceremonial forms that display footprints inside the building they do not represent the manner of footsteps by which men collect silk oss outside in the eld He ought to be enshrined along with every Zen patriarch May the victorious ags of Indra in his strife overcome all evil ones and heretics and may great trees of shady coolness such as Linji ll the Buddhist world A Brief Biography of Baizhang The master was a native of Changle of Fuzhou province son of the Wang family He sought out Mazu for instruction and training in Jiangxi province and joined his ourishing Zen community Among Mazus able young disciples Dazhu Nanquan Guizong and so forth were called great gures yet the master was appointed primary seat ofcial While traveling he passed Xinwu and took a rest below Chelun Peak A man called Ganzhenyuochang donated land and requested him to stay In the meantime many more practitioners had gathered around him and nally he decided to build a temple naming it Datuoti Great Development and Improvement He passed away on the seventeenth day of the rst month in the ninth year of Yuanhe It is said that the forest of r trees appeared to look ery as if burned and the beautiful gorge dried up by springtime The four groups of followers mournfully buried his ashes on Daxiong Peak Great Virility Prior to this event a foreign ascetic monk Sima Dhutadhara Toutuozhe by name had chosen this place as the burial site saying Since  this peak is linked to three other peaks but has not been fully appreciated for its wonderful beauty if his holiness on this mountain it would enhance his stature as a spiritual ruler and command reverence throughout the land It is said that the people of that period all agreed with him The Tang imperial court granted Baizhang the title Dazhi Chanshi Chan Master Great Wisdom in the rst year of Changqing The stupa erected at the burial site was called Dabaoshenglun Great Precious Victorious Wheel The Song imperial court further added the title Juezhao Mirror of Enlightenment in the rst year of Daguan and the commemorative tower built was called Huiju  In the third year of Yuantong the great Yuan court further added another title Zen Master Hongzongmiaoxing  The Memorial Rites for the Founder and the Patriarchs The founders memorial day and the successive patriarchs religious deeds should be properly honored Whoever contributed to the temple must be enshrined in the Dharma hall the evening before each memorial day The head administrative ofcial should prepare various offerings If the word of tribute is omitted for the memorial days of the successive patriarchs it is not necessary to conduct the special serving of tea and sweet hot water Prior to the appointed day the practice hall ofcial noties the head administrative ofcial to prepare a set of offerings to be placed on the altar The tablet of the patriarch in question must be placed at the western end of the rostrum seat The vast ocean of illumination of the Tathāgatas insight comprises the waves of whirlpools like the cycle of birth and death  The teaching of great concentration dissolves the distinctions of coming and going past and present May compassion shine its bright mirror reection upon us On this day of suchandsuch month the temple respectfully honors the memorial day of Soandso Patriarch and Zen Master of suchandsuch generation in the succession of this temple By offering various delicacies we express our care and devotion for him and the assembly of practitioners has chanted the Mahākāruṇikacittadhāraṇīs We respectfully implore May the sun of insight once again shine illuminating the luminous seed in the patriarchal room reviving the springtime of trees and owers that ourished in Shaolinsi and so on The merit accrued by the foregoing chanting shall be dedicated for the sake of the great master and teacher Soandso to enhance his enshrinement with ever more reverence Veneration to the buddhas of the ten directions and the three times and so on This was the way they paid their debt just as citing the three crucial passages uttered by Haojian of Baling became the honorable act to discharge indebtedness at the memorial service of Yunmen The predecessors had profound thoughts and honoring them is the path of grave importance that should not be abandoned Prior to the appointed day the abbot requests the head administrative ofcial to prepare a set of offerings and provisions with his own money The evening before the day  the altar should be set up in the Dharma hall in due manner The attendants of the practice hall ofcial are obliged to notify the practitioners about the coming event and post the signboard indicating the sutra chanting That evening the ūraṃgamadhāraṇīs are chanted those who are from the same province and those who are related in his Dharma lineage may chant the Mahākāruṇikacittadhāraṇīs Early the next morning the abbot offers rice gruel at the altar and participates in the breakfast meal and upon completion of this rite the practitioners chant the Mahākāruṇikacittadhāraṇīs while those who come from the same province and who are related in Dharma lineage intone the ūraṃgamadhāraṇīs The Special Serving of Tea for the Portrait After the noon meal is over the abbots guest reception assistant delivers to the west hall guest resident and the dual order ofcials an invitation to participate in a special serving of tea to be conducted before the patriarchs portrait that evening As the participants move their respective seat markers to the right side of their seats the abbot makes a gesture of greeting to request them to take their seats He then proceeds to offer incense and sweet hot water at the altar and then serves sweet hot water to the participants Returning to his position the abbot again burns incense performs three prostrations with opened sitting cloth and stands up to bow toward the invitees thanking them for their presence If there are three or ve guests of the west hall their seats must be assigned symmetrically opposite the dual order ofcials The abbot himself serves sweet hot water to the west hall residents of the rst seat section whereas his assistant serves the dual order ofcials of the second seat section If there is no west hall guest in attendance the rst serving is exempted and fruit or cake are served when the sutra chanting is over The retired dual order ofcials must be invited beforehand and senior or junior practitioners related in the Dharma lineage or colleagues trained under the same master must be also invited Novices and those who are indirectly related are not entitled to participate in the event When all participants are seated the abbot stands to offer incense and sweet hot water End of Chapter IV Honoring the Patriarchs of the Zen Tradition The Abbot Resident Bearer of the Dharma I Preface to the Chapter Four hundred years after the initial introduction of Buddhism to China Bodhidharma arrived in this country By the time of Baizhang however the Zen school had begun to ourish When the number of practitioners of Zen rapidly increase unless they deeply respect their teachers authority the rules and disciplines transmitted by the latter may not be rigorously maintained larger buildings were constructed to house them and the two sets of ofcial positions were created to divide responsibilities In the matter of labor even the abbot was obliged to take equal part in the work along with the practitioners Baizhang always said A day of no work a day of no eating How could this principle represent a life of wealth and riches amassing heaps of rice or stores of grain Later however the position of abbot became a position of high status to be purchased at great price or forcefully seized as if it were a rare commodity We sometimes hear about the tragic retributions that people receive in the next life  In the morning once again reminds the abbot about the proceeding and instructs the guest reception attendant to post the signboard indicating the ascent to the Dharma hall and informing practitioners of the days event The usual three tolls of the practice hall bell after the rice gruel breakfast should not be made on this day The practitioners then return to the practice hall and sit crosslegged If any guests are present the abbot thanks them for their participation at this time Ascent to the Dharma Hall on the Everyfthday Dharma Session On occasions of the everyfthday Dharma session the dual order ofcials rst reach the base of the rostrum seat go around to their respective orders position and remain standing there The abbot ascends the high seat but does not burn incense nor utter the word of insight or blessing If requested by lay donors the abbot is obliged to ascend the rostrum seat to preach for them at any time Nowadays those who call themselves Zen experts or who say they are conversant in Zen obliterate the moral retribution of cause and effect augment bad habits and act as if they were in a theatrical performance even bursting into boisterous laughter which is very disappointing to any observer If happen to be near government ofcials or renowned persons a brief explanatory excuse must be made Today contemporary practitioners without exception seek excessive words of praise and appreciation This is especially contrary to the Buddhist tradition If they want to talk about the practical affairs of the temple they may do so on the occasion of tea at the abbots hall One must refrain from engaging in frivolous discussion and annoying others The Evening Dharma Session c In general preaching on Zen to an assembly of practitioners is called a session In the past to assist students Zen masters held such an assembly in the morning as well as in the evening their students could consult and improve  Hence it has been made compulsory to conduct a Dharma session around dusk every day Accordingly prior to their attendance at the Dharma session practitioners take their seats and sit crosslegged in the main hall On occasions other than these for instance on the four annual festivity days ie the opening and closing days of the summer retreat the day of the winter solstice and New Years Day the regular evening session is converted into a night session which is signaled by the evening bell This is called a small or supplemental session In this way the abbot can also meet the requirements of convention The Small or Supplementary Session From its inception the supplemental session has no determined place of meeting According to the size of the audience it is held either in the abbots reception hall or in the Dharma hall In the afternoon the assistant ofcial noties the abbot The supplemental session is in order this evening sir and instructs the guest reception attendant to inform the practitioners and post the signboard announcing the session There is no calloff bell this evening When the evening bell begins to toll the attendant reports the time of the supplementary session to the abbot and starts a series of drumbeats The subsequent proceeding is identical with that of the everyfthday session The abbot preaches on the doctrine thanks any special participants mentioning them all by name and then closes the session with some instructive words of past Zen masters When the abbot descends the rostrum seat the guest novice attendant announces as follows The abbot Venerable Temple Master respectfully invites the ranking west hall ofcial the dual order ofcials the retired ofcials and visiting Zen practitioners to share a serving of sweet hot water at the reception hall immediately hereafter The head administrative ofcial prepares sweet hot water and fruit or cake in advance and has them delivered to the reception hall In the past when Zen Master Chuangzhao of Fenyang stayed in Taiziyuan Temple he hesitated to conduct night sessions because the region of Fen was extremely cold in winter A foreign monk arrived one day and shaking his staff toward him said You have six capable practitioners among your students Why dont you conduct a night session Then he ew up into the air and disappeared The master secretly wrote about this event in a verse At that time Chuyuan the predecessor of Ciming made Shouzhi the head practitioner Ciming lived in Shishuang in later years and used to make it a rule for himself to practice zazen in the mountains after the noon meal Ciming at once hurriedly returned and angrily criticized Fanghui Where did you get this kind of regulation Fanghui gently replied What can you tell me about the evening session at Fenzhou For this event a senior practitioner who has just returned for a second residency may be appointed ceremonial leader Allow me sir to convey your request to the abbot When the request is accepted the ofcial assistant reports this to the practice hall ofcial and requests him to hand in the ceremonial position chart The attendants of the practice hall ofce collect monetary contributions to purchase three packs of largeand smallgrain incense and some sheets of paper to prepare the ceremonial position chart and they give the collected fees to the ceremonial leader When the appointed day arrives the practitioner assistant requests the guest master to set up a screen and a chair either in the abbots reception hall or in the Dharma hall and three incense tables are aligned with some space between them before the chair each set with a pair of candle stands The practice hall attendants are required to inform the practitioners individually about the proceedings and to post the signboard announcing the incense offering for exhortation Prior to the ceremony the assistant ofcial places over the pillar of the Dharma hall a small wooden tablet with the following notice Respectfully stated by assistant ofcial Soandso The practitioners assemble in the Dharma hall and stand at their positions as designated by the chart each carrying an incense case and sitting cloth May your reverence honorable master be seated When has seated himself the ceremonial assistant hands a piece of largegrain incense to the ceremonial leader and bows in unison with the practitioners I Soandso and others are deeply concerned with the matter of life and death and with the swiftness of impermanence b the abbot should raise three kan cases referring to the experiences of some eminent masters of the past and then give his own comments on these topics Offering another piece of incense he returns to his position among the other practitioners where he remains standing with his hands folded over his chest At that moment two groups of three practitioners each from the east and west sections step forward to burn incense The rst two of the east group go to the eastern tables incense burner while the third one goes to the middle tables burner The rst two of the west group go to the western tables burner while the third group goes to the middle tables burner The members of both groups in turn burn incense and bow Subsequently three east group members return by way of the eastern side of the hall while three west group members return by way of the western side of the hall Each group as before slowly proceeds to the very end of their respective sections In similar manner the next two groups of three moving up in their respective lines step forward with their hands folded over their chests but while returning to their former positions hold both palms together When all members of both sections have offered incense in this way and have returned to their places they then perform in unison three prostrations with opened sitting cloth and without folding their sitting cloths We are extremely gratied with the compassion and preaching granted to us by Soandso abbot of Suchandsuch Temple and we are most grateful to the master Returning to the central position the ceremonial leader performs in unison with the other practitioners three prostrations as before and then once again steps forward saying Thereupon the novice attendant strikes the drum ve times and the dual order ofcials turn from their positions to line up before the abbots seat while the ceremonial leader takes his place at the lower end of the west order ofcials When these ofcials have each completed offering incense they return to their positions and turn to face to each other The retired ofcials and subfunctionaries having burned incense stand behind the line of those ofcials who have completed offering incense The ceremonial leader burns incense and performs three prostrations with fully opened sitting cloth in unison with the other practitioners Due to a fortunate past life I Soandso and others have been able to receive your compassion and preaching Next the practitioners in unison thank the ceremonial leader with a prostration with unopened sitting cloth The Special Serving of Tea and Other Servings after the Ceremony c The guest reception assistant setting up a crepecovered desk and a brush and inkslab prepares beforehand a letter of invitation for tea reception on the basis of seniority After the noon meal a series of drumbeats signals the practitioners to return to their places Next morning the abbot once again invites the ceremonial leader for tea and at midmorning invites both the ceremonial leader and the directors assistant for a light refreshment If all members equally participate in the ceremonial offering of incense the primary seat ofcial takes the role of the ceremonial leader and for the special serving of tea the ofcial of the west hall is also invited as an honorary participant Primary Seat Ofcial C General Preaching When practitioners conduct the rite of incense offering in a request for general preaching the abbot is required to take his seat wherever it is set up After the practitioners have assembled the assistant ofcial escorts the abbot into the hall Individual Instruction through Visitation rushi entering into the masters room is the way a Zen master examines his students He urges them on when their understanding is insufcient strikes at their unguarded throat and presses them with regard to their imbalances In order for the furnace to produce gold no admixture of lead or mercury should be found nor should any faulty elements remain when cutting a jewel Therefore in the past practitioners always carried a small incense case with them at all times Whenever they heard three drumbeats they promptly went to receive instruction The practice we have today sets forth six such occasions during each month namely the days ending in three and eight ie the third eighth thirteenth eighteenth twentythird and twentyeighth days of each month and is intended to provide opportunities similar to those of former days When the abbot opens his room for individual visitation the assistant ofcial instructs the guest reception novice attendant to post the signboard before the morning meal in front of the practice hall as well as in all the quarters to inform the practitioners of the schedule An image of Bodhidharma should be placed in the reception hall and incense candles and a place for prostrations should be set up on the left side facing the image When the practitioners leave the practice hall after breakfast the guest reception attendant strikes the drum three times with an interval in between the drumbeats He then returns to the next room where he takes his seat while his assistant after bowing goes to stand on the left side of the room and the attendant stands on the right side The primary seat ofcial followed by the practitioners burns incense and performs three prostrations before the image of Bodhidharma and in a close line they reach the masters room The practitioners follow one after another waiting their turn to burn incense and perform prostrations with opened sitting cloth When entering the room the practitioner is obliged to step into the room with his left foot rst and use his left hand to burn incense step forward and bow toward the master and go to the righthand side of chair he steps to the left of the chair makes a bow and to perform a prostration with unopened sitting cloth He then leaves the room again leading with his left foot and salutes the next practitioner thus signaling him to enter the room in the same manner In the case of a regular ascent to the rostrum seat of the Dharma hall such personalities may be excused from participation by public announcement The point is that depends on the kind of master The rear hall primary seat ofcial usually leads the practitioners  The assistant brings up the end of the line enters the room last similarly receives instruction offers incense and performs three prostrations with opened sitting cloth The novice attendant also burns incense and performs three prostrations with opened sitting cloth Thereupon the abbot burns incense before the image of Bodhidharma performs three prostrations with opened sitting cloth and leaves the room Prayer Chanting on the Days of the Month Ending in Three and Eight In the Ancient Regulations prayer chanting was observed on the third eighth thirteenth eighteenth twentythird and twentyeighth days of each month the eighth eighteenth and twentyeighth of each month The practice hall ofcial is obliged to make a chart of the ceremonial positions in the practice hall based on ordination seniority When the appointed day comes the entrance area of the practice hall must be swept and cleaned and in the afternoon the practice hall ofce attendant informs the practitioners of the schedule for prayer chanting and posts the signboard announcing the event When the abbot comes out from his hall signaled by three strikes of the metal gong located at the kitchen hall with an interval between strikes the practitioners take their positions as designated in the chart and remain standing Meanwhile the abbots secretarial assistant goes directly to his designated position The guest reception assistant proceeds to the front of the the west order ofcials and with a bow invites them to the serving of sweet hot water he then goes around to the front of the column of the east order ofcials and invites them The abbot then comes out into the outer hall and stands in the center followed by his incense offering assistant the Luminous Pure Dharma Body Vairocana Buddha and so on the practitioners remain in silent prayer According to the rst regnal year of Zhiyuan of the great Yuan dynastic calendar it has been twentytwo hundred and eightyfour years since the time the Tathāgata the Great Teacher entered parinirvāṇa Just as this day is about to pass so is our lifespan diminishing like sh in a shrinking pond May you exert yourselves in your endeavors as if to extinguish a re burning on your head For the sake of the foregoing causes we shall intone the ten sacred names of the buddhas Turning toward the abbot they bow before him and moving to their left they make a round with their palms together Recent arrivals follow the practitioners behind the abbots assistant but proceed only up to the rear half of the hall When the assistant stops behind the altar facing the rear exit they also stop there and face him The recent arrivals follow the abbots assistant and leave the hall by the rear exit The altar attendant leaves the hall by passing around behind the altar In the Ancient Regulations the serving of sweet hot water was a norm on the days ending in three and eight but there was no evening meal on the eighth and eighteenth days Inspection Rounds of the Quarters The Ancient Regulations stipulated that a signboard announcing inspection round was to be posted in front of the practice hall to inform the practitioners when the abbot was going to make rounds through the various quarters In each quarter a seat for the abbot is set up and incense tea and sweet hot water are prepared in advance of his arrival When the abbot arrives they greet him outside the gate of their quarters and follow him into the quarters The head practitioner of the quarters burns incense and bows to him in unison with the others and all sit down When he stands up the practitioners perform a prostration with opened sitting cloth to thank him Nowadays the inspection rounds of the practitioners quarters are conducted only on the four annual festivity days and at no other time If anyone is capable of reviving the Ancient Regulations he should be encouraged to do so It is said in the Mahāsaṃghikavinaya that the Worldhonored One visited the bhikṣus quarters once every ve days for ve major reasons rst he was concerned that disciples might be trapped in worldly affairs second that they might be attached to conventional doctrines third that they might be idly asleep fourth to see if anyone might be sick and fth to encourage junior disciples through having them directly witness the dignity of the Buddha Reprimanding Measures The eminent Hanlin scholar Yangyi of the Song dynasty tried to trace the original ideas of the Baizhang Zen Monastic Regulations in the great Tripiṭaka scriptural collection in order to fathom the meaning of their creation Suppose someone assumes an ordained name or  and mixes with real practitioners If a person commits a certain transgression he may be punished by sticks His robes almsbowl and requisites may be burned in front of the assembly of practitioners He should be expelled through the side gate of the temple This single rule is seen to bring about four benets Second it does not destroy the physical body of an imposter and is in accordance with the Buddhas Vinaya rule Third it does not involve public ofcials and avoids possible legal prosecution or imprisonment Fourth it does not create a scandal outside the temple and protects the Zen religious institution Thus the regulations that Baizhang formulated were a reorganization of the Buddhist Vinaya rules and disciplines which were organized under the vefold categories of offenses or the sevenfold classications of transgressions as the broadest standards acceptable to the whole world The successive rulers of the imperial courts granted Buddhist ordination to those men of aspiration and strictly obliged them to follow the Buddhist rules and regulations For instance regarding an offense committed by a practitioner insofar as it does not necessarily involve the civil authorities the temple community is authorized to deal with the offender in accordance with the rules of the monastic regulations Since the title of ākya can be understood to carry ancestral authority over whoever bears that title as a Buddhist similar to secular convention one is obliged to maintain the ancestral rules and regulations and punish transgressors in accordance with those rules and regulations When ones conduct is grave the offender may be whipped and expelled in front of the assembly of practitioners if the offense is light a monetary ne or a ne of incense or oil may be levied and announced on the temples bulletin board If ones conduct involves money and goods his responsibility is pressed with a written record by a consensus of jurors Through just and condential  the offender may be brought to repent and rectify his wrongdoing by himself If an offense is grave the offenders robe and almsbowl must be burned Zen Master Dahui while serving as abbot of Ayuwangsi put up an announcement to instruct his director of practitioners affairs that anyone who argued with others in an unenlightened way would not be welcome and would be dismissed from the temple regardless of whether he may be right or wrong In some cases even if a person is right  he should be shunned If instead he continues to argue and insists upon being right this is an unenlightened attitude When the evening bell is tolled the wooden sounding board at their attendent novices hall is struck three times to call them to assemble The ceremonial leader leads the assembly of novice attendants rst to visit the Buddha hall then the patriarchs hall practice hall and practitioners quarters Escorted by the ceremonial leader the abbot comes into the reception hall and takes his seat When it is over the novice attendants again perform three prostrations and the ceremonial leader announces Goodbye sir repeated in unison by the novices in lower voices General Preaching for Novice Attendants The ceremonial leader visits the ofce of the abbots assistants in advance and after burning incense and performing prostrations requests the assistant in charge to request the abbot to preach Following the assistant in charge the ceremonial leader goes in to escort the abbot All in unison perform nine prostrations I Soandso and others have wished to receive your preaching for some time We implore you in your compassion to grant us the opportunity to hear your preaching on the teaching of the causality of dependent origination Next day the signboard of general preaching should be posted at the novice attendants hall A seat for the abbot an incense table and candle stands are placed in the hall After notifying the novices the ceremonial leader goes to invite the dual order ofcials to participate while the ceremonial assistant leading the novices receives the ofcials at the hall entrance The ceremonial leader and the hall master go to the ofce of the practitioner assistants and escort the abbot to the attendants hall When takes his seat the assistant bows and stands at his side The ceremonial leader leading the novices burns incense offers greetings and performs three prostrations Then dividing the novice attendants he has them take their respective positions behind the east and west order ofcials After the preaching has been attentively heard the ceremonial leader once again leading the novice attendants has them line up and perform three prostrations They then all leave the hall and stand to the right of the entrance He burns a largegrain incense and performs nine prostrations before withdrawing Next he goes to the ofce of the assistants and again offers incense and performs three prostrations Finally both the ceremonial leader and his assistant go round to each of the ofcials to express their gratitude The assistant in charge instructs the guest master to request the presence of the temple ofcials After giving thanks for the tea he once again burns incense and performs the formal propriety of two prostrations with opened sitting cloth and three prostrations with unopened sitting cloth This is the robe of Master Soandso which embodies his faith in the Dharma transmission I hereby present it to your reverence on his behalf The dual order ofcials participate in the serving of tea followed by the serving of sweet hot water and when all this is over they accompany the delegate to the guest house On a different day at the time of his ascent to the Dharma hall the abbot takes the seat that has been placed at the left side of the rostrum seat The ofcial delegate performs three prostrations with fully opened sitting cloth  and respectfully presents the robe to him After descending the high seat makes offerings and chants sutras Receiving a Renowned Virtuous Guest Practitioner When a renowned practitioner visits the temple a signboard indicating senior guest reception should be posted and the large bell tolled to assemble the practitioners to greet the distinguished guest at the gate The guest master reports the visit to the primary seat ofcial by ringing the practice hall bell The practitioners withdraw after saluting the guest with a bow but the dual order ofcials and the retired ofcials remain in the presence of the honorable guest After these ofcials burn incense and drink tea the abbots assistant burns incense and performs prostrations Following him the guests assistants novice attendants serving men and sedan chair bearers perform prostrations all in due order Once again the assistant burns incense and serves sweet hot water to the guest and the temple ofcials The guest reception attendant signals the sedan chair bearers to be ready The abbot accompanied by his assistant escorts the guest on a courtesy round of the practitioners quarters If the guest is from a monastic temple of lower status the assistant takes the role of escorting the guest The abbot requests your honorable presence at the special service of sweet hot water to be held at the reception hall At the reception hall the abbots ofce assistants are obliged to hang curtains and arrange the seat markers designating the special guest seat as well as those of the other participants The drum signals commencement of the ceremony The guest is escorted to his seat incense is offered and he is invited to drink The abbot requests your presence for a serving of sweet hot water and fruit this evening also invites the dual order ofcials to participate in the serving The abbots assistant noties the participants that the abbot is scheduled to go to the Dharma hall the next morning to express his gratitude The abbot shares rice gruel with the guest and then invites him to tea Next they visit the abbot to request him to perform the role of introducing the guest Two chairs  should be placed in front of the two chairs to the left and right of the rostrum The abbot introduces the guest to the practitioners and as usual takes his seat The dual order ofcials proceed forward to salute the guest with a bow The abbot the dual order ofcials and the practitioners accompany the delegate to the guest house burn incense and express their gratitude The procedure and decorum are the same as those of the usual special serving If the guest delegate is equal in rank to the abbot they may deliberate to determine the proper courtesy If the guest is senior to the abbot in Dharma succession the intermonastic reception propriety should be observed as mentioned previously The abbot burns incense and performs prostrations If it is a matter of the propriety for a person of the same Dharma lineage  the guest must be escorted to the abbots ofce and offered the main seat The abbot then has the practice hall bell rung to assemble the practitioners there so that he can carry out the interpersonal propriety The abbot is rst invited to take the central seat and the guest performs an interpersonal discipletomaster propriety The only difference is that a written invitation for the special serving of sweet hot water is not required The abbots guest reception assistant burns incense and verbally invites the guest Format of the Invitation to a Special Reception of Sweet Hot Water The abbot of this temple Soandso unceremoniously invites the above titled Venerable Soandso to a special serving of sweet hot water this evening at the reception hall May you in your compassion especially grant your presence Invitation to a Special Dinner Reception The abbot of this temple Soandso unceremoniously invites the above titled Venerable Soandso to a special serving of rice gruel tomorrow at the reception hall May you in your compassion especially grant your presence Request for a Special Dharma Preaching The abbot of this temple Soandso unceremoniously requests the above titled Venerable Soandso to preach the Dharma and teach the practitioners If the guest is a great magnanimous benefactor such as a highranking government ofcial the large bell should be tolled to assemble the practitioners to welcome him at the main gate of the temple On the appointed day a seat for the patron should be set up in front of the rostrum seat and a signboard to the practitioners should be posted The drum signals the to assemble The guest reception ofcial together with the patron donor escorts the abbot A hand incense burner candles ags and cymbals must be prepared beforehand as required for this occasion On reaching the rostrum seat the abbot ascends it and sits crosslegged while the donor stands before the high seat The patron remains standing during the preaching It is not appropriate to sit down during the preaching of the Dharma When the abbot descends from the seat the patron donor expresses his gratitude If the guest wishes to give alms to the practitioners the abbot must consult with the administrative ofcials to determine the amount of money required A seat for the donor should be prepared in the practice hall next to the abbot Next the abbot and the primary seat ofcial visit the donor at the guest house to thank him for his benefaction One must remember how clear and evident moral retribution is In the Precious Mirror of Human and Heavenly Worlds  the following story is related Zen Master Shouzhi of Mount Yungai in Hunan province was meditating one night in his abbots ofce He suddenly felt scorching heat and heard the noise of dragging chains He then saw someone wearing a ery wooden collar ames still burning up and down The collar was attached by a chain to the gates threshold Astonished Shouzhi asked Who are you One night Shouyu appeared in a dream to thank Shouzhi saying that due to the abbots help he would escape from his hellish suffering would be able to be reborn in the world of heaven as well as that of human beings and would again be able to become a Buddhist practitioner after three transmigrations Scorch marks can still be seen on the gates threshold Not only are diverted for alternative purposes but also in extreme cases temple possessions are stolen for personal use What can be done about such people Receiving the Serving of Tea from a Disciple in the Dharma Succession If a disciple of the abbot in his Dharma lineage visits the temple and wishes to serve tea at the practice hall on behalf of his master his accompanying administrative ofcial must rst meet with his counterpart at the host temple If this formality is excused he performs a single prostration with unopened sitting cloth The guest master conveys this request to the dual order ofcials as well as to the retirees of the individual quarters and posts a signboard announcing the occasion On the appointed day a crepecovered table is solemnly set at the abbots position in the practice hall The guest disciple enters the hall behind the abbot in order to help him take his seat He then turns toward the altar of the guardian bodhisattva and burns incense before it then proceeds toward the abbot with his hands clasped at his chest and bows before him He goes around the back of the altar and he reappears the abbot signals him to take his seat The guest takes the head seat on the raised platform of the guest reception ofcial  Thereupon the kitchen ofce signals the beginning of the noon meal by striking the wooden sounding board When the noon meal is over the practitioners clean and put their almsbowls back in proper order and the table is removed from the abbots place The guest disciple burns incense at the altar proceeds before the abbot and bows A bell signals the serving of tea and when is nearing completion the guest disciple proceeds to the abbot and presents tea It is my greatest joy that you have granted me the privilege of your special presence on this day for this humble propriety and meager offering After opening his sitting cloth again he makes a cordial greeting and then performs three prostrations without reopening the sitting cloth He thanks the ofcials in the outer hall for their participation and once again returns to the altar to offer incense and after ringing the bell retrieves the tea bowl from the altar Next he goes to the abbots ofce to thank him for his presence Whether he is obliged to conduct the propriety of the serving of tea is contingent on the given situation Arrival of the Written Will of the Master in the Dharma Lineage When an ofcial delegate arrives at the temple with a written will the formality of the proceeding is detailed below in part VI section  Sending Written Wills the abbot opens the will and the dual order ofcials console him A ritual altar should be set up in the center of the Dharma hall before which the abbot offers incense and utters a word of insight With three utterances of grief he performs three prostrations and offers sweet hot water and once c again performs three prostrations before placing food and monetary gifts on the altar At the drum signal following the propriety of the special serving he performs three prostrations and offers tea The director of practitioners affairs calls for chanting the ūraṃgamadhāraṇīs and concludes with an invocation  We dedicate the merit accrued by this chanting to Great Master Soandso abbot of Suchandsuch Temple in order to enhance the enshrinement of his dignity and reverence Veneration to the buddhas of the ten directions and so on It is unfortunate for the tradition that the master of your Dharma transmission has passed away We junior practitioners feel extreme sadness because we have lost a support Nevertheless may you endure it for our sake and endeavor ever more assiduously on the path For this purpose silk cloth is to be used As for the ofcial delegate referred to before either the head administrative ofcial one of the retired ofcials the primary seat ofcial of the west hall or a training ofcial of lesser rank may be appointed Unless a head administrative ofcial is appointed someone of lower administrative rank must accompany the delegate in order to handle nancial matters and act as a consultant The practice hall bell is rung to assemble the practitioners at the gate to see off the ofcial delegate and his party A curtain should be hung below the temple gate and seats prepared behind it for the serving of tea and sweet hot water The dual order ofcials and the retired ofcials are invited to participate in the occasion If the head administrative ofcial is serving as the temple delegate the administrative member next in rank should conduct the ceremonial serving if the primary seat ofcial or a retired ofcial is chosen as the delegate the head administrative ofcial is obliged to conduct it The ceremonial host respectfully requests the ofcial delegate to take his seat and burns incense to invite him to drink tea Once again the host rises from his seat burns incense and returns to his seat to drink sweet hot water together with the delegate When the tea bowl is retrieved the ofcial delegate rises thanks the host and climbs into the sedan chair Then he visits the primary seat ofcial as well as the various quarters and nally arrives at the ofce of the abbots assistants where he explains the purpose of his visit The ofcial assistant reports the matter to the abbot and waits for his reply as to whether the invitation is accepted May the Venerable Abbot be seated in the crosslegged meditation posture The official delegate burns incense and performs three full prostrations with opened sitting cloth Thereupon performs another set of three prostrations saying I respectfully wish at this moment on this day that all is well and felicitous with the newly appointed abbot great teacher He then once again performs three prostrations and folds his sitting cloth Having responded to each set of prostrations with a single greeting the abbot then says

reected that the Venerable Master abbot of this temple his dazzling insight like a moon shed his light over thousands and thousands of miles of waves Our grief is sincere indeed and accords with the feeling of the buddhas of the ten directions Though we look up reverently we nd no ground and our determination does not go afar but returns We have assembled here with sincerity to intone our prayer by praising the names of the buddhas the Luminous Pure Dharma Body Vairocana Buddha and so on The merit accrued by chanting the foregoing esoteric verses is intended to enshrine the indescribable rewarding state of nonarising which the Venerable Master abbot of this temple has realized Veneration to the buddhas of the ten directions and the three times and so on The merit accrued by chanting

morning and noon respectively rice gruel and rice must be served and three times a day  tea and sweet hot water must be served Nowadays popular manners and customs have become corrupted Some practitioners want to be assigned to the management posts of estates storage and manpower but do not obtain them while some steal temple property When the abbot punishes such acts according to the monastic regulations these evil ones not only do not repent their wrongdoing but also harbor grudges against the abbot In extreme cases they may even vandalize the enshrined cofn openly taking the clothing and goods by force to demonstrate their brutality For who ever escapes death How much more should those wicked people who have come for training under the deceased master and yet commit such transgressions be expelled punished and reformed If the master of the funeral rite can ahead of time set up guidelines of discipline and reform the regulations so as to prevent such crimes before their occurrence this would contribute greatly to the outward beauty of all the proceedings of the funeral rite Format of the Obituary Note Bhikṣu Soandso in charge of the funeral rite of Suchandsuch

The director of the funeral rite burns incense and performs prostrations toward the portrait The dual order ofcials the retired ofcials and the practitioners then burn incense in turn and perform prostrations one after another while the disciples of the deceased master also perform prostrations at the left side of the portrait The director of the funeral rite comes to the curtain and consoles the disciples of the deceased and they express their thanks by performing three prostrations Next the director of the funeral rite offers condolences to the dual order ofcials and the practitioners saying We wish however that you fulll your task through restraining your grief The disciples must guard the shrine during the night The director of the funeral rite makes a list and order of assignments for the rite of offerings and attaches it to the curtain in the lefthand side of the hall In general the funeral addresses are composed by the head secretarial ofcial appointed by the director of the funeral rite Two or three times each day rites of offering are conducted and no one should hesitate to participate in them In cases when the deceased abbots relations in Dharma lineage or his former students approach the gate the guest reception ofcial meets them reports their arrival to the director of the proceedings and only after funeral garments are delivered to them do they conduct the rite of offering Conducting the Supplementary Session the Serving of Tea and Sweet Hot Water Prayer Chanting and the Funeral Offering On the evening before cremation the director of the proceedings carrying incense in his sleeve along with the director of practitioners affairs and the disciples of the deceased abbot visits the guest house to request the person designated as the director of the funeral rite to conduct the supplementary session in honor of the deceased The director of the funeral rite accompanied by his practitioner assistant ascends the seat and burns incense If no practitioner assistant accompanies him the practitioner assistant of the guardian bodhisattva of the practice hall performs the role of assisting in the rite The Venerable Master abbot of this temple  has entered nirvana This day has already passed by and so has our lifespan been diminished just as a sh living in a shrinking pond All of us must exert ourselves as if to extinguish a re burning on our heads May you be reminded of the truth of impermanence and refrain from falling into unrestrainedness Veneration to the Luminous Pure Dharma Body Vairocana Buddha and so on We earnestly wish that due to his retention of the power of vow he will manifest an apearance as rare as the uḍumbara ower once again guide the wheel of compassion to sail through the waves of life and death and help the strayed multitudes reach the far shore of enlightenment Veneration to the buddhas of the ten directions and the three times and so on When this is over the guest reception ofcial of the temple calls for the chanting of the ūraṃgamadhāraṇīs and concludes with the following invocation of merit transference The merit hereby accrued is intended on this evening before the day of cremation to promote the status of honor and reverence for the sake of the Venerable Master abbot of this temple who has just passed away At the end the Mahākāruṇikacittadhāraṇīs are chanted and the rite concludes with the same invocation of merit transference as before The primary seat ofcial invites the practitioners to a serving of sweet hot water and fruit at their designated seats Former practitioner assistants of the deceased master Head of the attendants hall Workers in charge of lights and re The disciples of the deceased master follow behind the shrine to escort the procession which is announced by tolling the large bell and all other instrumental sounds The golden casket of the Buddha rose by itself and went through the town of Kuśinagara Veneration to the Luminous Pure Dharma Body Vairocana Buddha and so on When the shrine reaches the temple gate the rite of placing the portrait in a portable pavilion and serving tea and sweet hot water should be conducted Both require the chanting of sutras The dual order ofcials and the practitioners line up at the gate to await the shrine The director of the funeral rite leading the practitioners in two columns proceeds on foot scattering pieces of articial paper owers to the right and left along the way No one is allowed to touch anothers shoulders or exchange words all should feel a sense of sadness The director of practitioners affairs of the temple calls for prayer On this day the Venerable Master abbot of this temple terminating all conditions for conversion swiftly returned to true eternity The casket of the Buddha went through the town of Kuśinagara and it is said that re amed up spontaneously to cremate his body Homage to the Pure Land of the Western World Amitābha Buddha of great compassion and commiseration and so on up to the ten names of prayer We have respectfully intoned the sacred names to help the rite of conversion The essential nature is equal to that of his predecessors his excellent capacity does not falter even before the buddhas  and patriarchs he helped the junior practitioners and his compassionate mind permeates the world of humans and heavenly beings With his body comprising hundreds of illusory and phenomenal elements he is now entering the state of ery concentration  Having offered three servings of tea and having burned incense over a single burner we shall receive this deed and carry out the task earnestly The merit accrued from intoning prayer and chanting is intended to promote the status of honor and reverence for the sake of the late Venerable Master abbot of this temple on the occasion of cremation Veneration to the buddhas of the ten directions and the three times and so on Next the practitioners from the same native province as the deceased abbot chant sutras in unison with all the practitioners When this is over the primary seat ofcial leads the practitioners back to the temple and the noon meal is served When the noon meal is over the practice hall bell is rung to assemble the practitioners Twice a day morning and noon rice gruel and rice respectively should be served and three times a day tea and sweet hot water should be served This may be continued for ten days or half a month with the practitioners in attendance chanting sutras Veneration to the Pure Land of the Western World Amitābha Buddha of great compassion and commiseration and so on We wish that the limitless insight and compassion of the widespreading cloud reveal the truth that in the world of the four modes of birth there is neither birth nor death  and also preach the doctrine that within the six migratory passages of rebirth there is no recipient such as self nor is there any agent such as person who undergoes rebirth Having made three servings of tea and burned incense over a single burner we shall receive this deed and carry out the task earnestly Salutation to the holy community of disciples Thereupon the disciples burn incense and express their thanks to the director of the funeral rite by performing three prostrations with fully opened sitting cloth Next the dual order ofcials and the practitioners also thank the director of the funeral rite saying The temple has had an unfortunate loss with the abbots passing away Along with the director of funeral proceedings and others the director of practitioners affairs specially appointed for the funeral rite makes rounds of the various quarters to express his thanks Tea and sweet hot water should be served three times a day accompanied by sutra chanting by the practitioners on each occasion This is continued until the portrait and the name tablet are enshrined in the patriarchal shrine hall Auctioning the Possessions of the Deceased On an appointed day a long table equipped with brushes inkslabs and a bell should be set up either in the outer practice hall or in the upper and lower front sections of the Dharma hall The practice hall bell is tolled to assemble the practitioners The director of practitioners affairs specially appointed for the funeral rite the guest reception ofcial and the assistant in charge of the altar of the guardian bodhisattva sit directly opposite the director of the funeral rite Breaking human greed through the insight of the Dharma is the traditional practice handed down by our predecessors Veneration to the Luminous Pure Dharma Body Vairocana Buddha and so on The method of auction is based on the existing practice and everyone is required to examine the qualities of each item for himself as to whether it is new or old short or long so that he should not regret when no contesting voice comes forth The director of practitioners affairs calls out the price of an item and rings the bell while the attendants look around to conrm the name of the person who has responded to the call Mixing up the papers that record prices and arbitrarily reducing the set price of each item is not allowed Nowadays however the lottery is the method used in most cases as it can greatly reduce the possibility of dispute This method consists of using small pieces of paper on which one thousand characters are inscribed serially representing a serial order of numbers Each numbered paper is copied in triplicate or has three divisions marked by an ofcial stamp According to the number of practitioners who may possibly participate in the event the director of the proceedings and his assistant jointly seal these lottery tickets in an envelope At the appointed time the dircector of the funeral rite delivers the envelope to the dual order ofcials to check the seal and then it is opened by the primary seat ofcial The practitioner assistant cuts the remaining tickets into halves and places one half on the tray At that moment the primary seat ofcial asks a young novice to pick up one halfpiece of a lottery ticket from the tray and give it to him The latter opens it examines the number and passes it to the attendant of the practice hall to announce The practitioners now open their halfpieces for identication The person who holds the matching number responds at once Next the young novice is asked to pick another halfticket from the tray and the number of the item is called in the same manner The practitioner assistant then issues a card to the almsserving master who delivers it to the practitioner The foregoing activity of auction and prayer is intended to promote the rank of honor and reverence for the late Venerable Master abbot of the temple who passed away Veneration to the buddhas of the ten directions and the three periods and so on If any items are not picked up after three days they are again put on auction with adjusted prices The ancient method of auction is also detailed in The Practitioners of the Zen Community  Revenue amount Revenue amount Expenditure amount Expenditure amount Auction held of suchandsuch items Payment collected for suchandsuch items Already paid for suchandsuch items To be paid for suchandsuch items  Total revenue amount Total expenditure amount Balance Suchandsuch amount used for the initial seventhday memorial service and for the cost of sutras purchased for practitioners and attendants Date and year Recorded by Soandso Attendant of the Director of the Funeral Rite Presented to The person in charge of the account books the dual order ofcials and the ofcials of the funeral rite  On the appointed day the bell is rung to assemble the practitioners The call for sutra chanting the recitation of the sacred names of the buddhas and the concluding invocation are all identical to the rite of interring the body After returning to the reception hall offerings should be made before the portrait and the proceedings for thanking the director of the funeral rite and so on are as before Sending Written Wills When all the funeral affairs are completed the director of the funeral rite requests the practitioner assistants to deliver the written wills as special ofcial delegates to the various temples the deceased abbots relations in Dharma lineage lay patrons and government ofcials It is desirable to choose only very capable persons for this purpose since the ofcial delegates are obliged to engage in conversation when they meet with the highranking ofcials of various temples When the ofcial delegate reaches the designated temple he rst meets with the guest reception ofcial who then escorts him to the ofce of the abbots assistant A crepewrapped table has been set up beforehand and the written will is placed there The ofcial delegate steps forward bows and says May your reverence sit crosslegged If the abbot gives some word the ofcial delegate must immediately reply and after burning incense perform a prostration with opened sitting cloth If this formality is excused the ofcial delegate may perform prostrations with unopened sitting cloth in the usual manner Venerable Soandso of suchandsuch locality passed away on suchand such day and month The ofcial delegate sits across from the abbot and one rank space away from the dual order ofcials When tea is over the ofcial delegate straightens his posture and the abbot addresses him a The attendant prepares a papercutting knife the letter and the item which the assistant hands to the master who passes them through the smoke from the incense burner and returns them to the assistant The abbot visits the latter to bow followed by his assistant and the dual order ofcials The head secretarial ofcial is requested to compose a notice of the funeral rite on behalf of the temple but the notice of the funeral rite from the abbots ofce may be composed by the abbot himself The abbots assistant must attend to their conduct at each occasion Next morning the abbot serves tea in honor of the deceased The practitioner assistant announces the event of an ascent to the Dharma hall while the attendants inform the practitioners and post the signboard at the practice hall to announce the event A crepewrapped table on which the letter and material items are placed should be set before the high seat and the abbots seat to the left of the high seat The drum signals the practitioners to assemble in the hall The abbot enters the hall proceeds to the high seat and stands before it When the drumming ends he steps forward to the incense table while the ofcial delegate escorted by the guest reception ofcial go before him across the table I have rushed to deliver the will to your reverence and cannot help feeling apprehensive of my manner in meeting with your reverence He then completes his greeting with three prostrations with unopened sitting cloth and hands the letter to the abbot After descending from the high seat the abbot goes before the funeral nametablet set on the desk burns incense serves sweet hot water makes offerings serves tea and performs prostrations with opened sitting cloth The ofcial delegate returns to the right side of the high seat and bows toward him The abbot again performs prostrations with opened sitting cloth and the ofcial delegate returns his prostrations b The dual order ofcials the residents of the four quarters the practitioners from all regions those of various temple functionaries and those who come from the same native province all make funeral offerings to which the ofcial delegate returns prostrations respectively He should not however return prostrations to lowerranking practitioners related in the Dharma lineage the deceaseds disciples or serving subfunctionaries Thereupon the ofcial delegate steps forward and performs two prostrations with opened sitting cloth and three prostrations with unopened sitting cloth to thank the abbot Next the ofcial delegate makes rounds through the various quarters to thank the practitioners Afterward the temple prepares a special dinner reception for the ofcial delegate in which the dual order ofcials are invited to participate If the deceased master had previously held the position of abbot at this temple he may be enshrined in the patriarchal shrine hall on the same day If so after the chanting is completed the name tablet is carried to the shrine hall and the current abbot offers incense and places it in the shrine with a due word of tribute The ofcial delegate then expresses a word of thanks to the master If the deceased was the incumbent abbot of the temple his enshrinement in the patriarchal hall occurs after three days of services conducted before the remains at the reception hall during which time the new abbot has arrived After burning incense and drinking tea the representing ofcial sits properly upright and states the purpose of his visit After the rite of offerings and the service of sutra chanting at the Dharma hall where the abbot conducts the proceedings with the proper word of tribute the remainder of the proceeding is identical to that described above After tea the practice hall bell is rung to assemble the practitioners and the large bell is tolled to send off the master of the funeral rite at the temple gate Appointing the New Abbot The incumbent and retired dual order ofcials meet for tea at the ofce of the head administrative ofcial to discuss the matter of selecting a prospective candidate for the position of abbot It is customary to select a person who is well qualied by his authentic insight virtue seniority integrity and most importantly by his ability to fulll the practitioners trust and expectations These people seek to monopolize the position of abbot through insidious methods of inuence bribery and scheming To repeat one must refrain from this kind of activity Zen Master Mingjiao said The monastic order and its institutional structures are the material basis for maintaining the Dharma The Dharma means the path of the Great Sage  The material basis and the instrument become meaningful only when practitioners begin to put them to good use It is inevitable that by improving the instrument one improves the material basis and that by improving the material basis one may improve the instrument When both factors are improved and become good one is obliged to maintain their excellence and abide in them In ancient times the resident bearer of the Dharma at Vulture Peak was Mahākāśyapa while that of the Bamboo Forest was āriputra Due to the greatness of these masters the Dharma of the Sage continued to exist for a long time Since the Sage entered nirvana so many generations have passed that we have long since become unable to trace them By fortunate coincidence we in the Zen tradition have the name of zhuchi and its authority and benet Throughout the land however everything has become conventional crowded and confused Unless those of us in the position of guarding the institution are watchful and selective it will be impossible to prevent the original spirit of the Sage and his Dharma from declining no matter how earnestly we wish to maintain and uphold it This would be most lamentable What else can I wish for The Abbot Resident Bearer of the Dharma End of Fascicle Three  cFascicle Four Chapter VI The Dual Order Ofces I Preface to the Chapter The dual order ofces were established to manage various things for the sake of the member practitioners  so that he may engage himself in teaching the essentials of the religion promulgating the path of practice and embellishing the patriarchal tradition Insofar as the handling of money and rice storage and experiencing various duties are concerned no one fails to acquire good training through worldly matters as well as nonworldly religious matters In the past the east and the west order ofces exchanged their positions and reciprocated their functions It is therefore wrong that today the ofcials are divided into the two orders In extreme cases the two groups compete against each other allowing no compatibility if either ones inuence tilts to the stronger or weaker side The Training Faculty of the West Order  The Primary Seat Ofcial of the Front Part of the Practice Hall a The primary seat ofcial is the model standard of the monastic institution comparable to the visual organ of humans and gods He is obliged to advise the treasury as to whether or not each meal ie rice gruel in the morning and rice at noon is prepared well When the community ceases to comply with normative propriety he may have to show what punishment is mandated by the regulations Compassionate toward the aged the sick and the dying he should take care of them up to their funeral rites As a whole he must be ready to act practically in all matters that concern the practitioners like a collar attached to all clothes or a controlling rope attached to an entire net This is called acting for the sake of others by forsaking ones own Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva though he was the teacher of the seven past buddhas agreed to become the primary seat ofcial for an assembly of disciples and helped ākyamuni Buddha accomplish the path by leading his disciples to religious conversion Zen Master Muzhou became the primary seat ofcial under Huangbi and Yunmen under Lingshu whereby they made the foremost position luminous and clear and thus left lessons for those of later periods It is said in the Collection of Records of the Patriarchal Courtyard  The shouzuo is the foremost elder in the ancient tradition In the Zen tradition today the person elected as the primary seat ofcial should necessarily be one who has already achieved the Buddhist insight regarding the nature of self and is able to command his fellow practitioners respect and obedience in terms of his excellence in both moral virtue and religious training The Primary Seat Ofcial of the Rear Part of the Practice Hall Holding a seat on the rear raised platform the primary seat ofcial of the back part of the hall assists the primary seat ofcial of the front part of the hall in upholding community morale for the pursuit of the goal His manner of conduct ornaments the rules and regulations as the model for the practitioners Twice a day at the time of the morning rice gruel and the rice meal at noon and also at the time of zazen practice he must enter and depart from the hall through the rear exit Ascending the rostrum seat in the Dharma hall on a special day he invites the ofcial of the rear part of the hall to move to the front part of the hall For zazen practice and for the period of zazen preceding the evening session he must enter the hall at the time of the third strike of the wooden sounding block located at the practitioners quarters It is not necessary to strike the wooden sounding block located at his quarters on each occasion The rest is identical with the duties of the front hall primary seat ofcial The Head Secretarial Ofcial In the Ancient Regulations this ofce was called shuzhuang and its function was to be in charge of all literary composition including nearly all the signboard announcements to be posted at the temple gate letters of correspondence and verses of prayers and invocations Whoever became the abbot of a renowned large temple would have likely been so appointed under the edict of the imperial court and he had to carry with him a written form of thanks  Yet the abbot must be fully in charge of the great Dharma and cannot divert his attention to literary composition Originally this particular position was adopted from military headquarters where generals had a secretarial ofce in charge of recording the names of soldiers their duties and so on This is called the private secretarial function of the abbots ofce Again another known example was Qingyuan  who was appointed to this position under Zen Master Fayan of Mount Dongshan  The latter wished to glorify the title of the secretarial position by having Qingyuan who was well versed in nonBuddhist literature assist him in disseminating Zen in the religious world Moreover Dahui Zonggao also previously held a similar position In general it is satisfactory if the holder of this position tries to follow these three major gures as models of conduct The Tripiṭaka Hall Ofcial This ofcial should handle the library of sacred scriptures ie the Tripiṭaka sutra building and must also be an expert in the scholarship of scriptural interpretation Today however practitioners read scriptures at the practitioners quarters hence no table or chair is set up in the scriptural hall Reecting upon the origins of our Zen tradition its essence was long since declared as having been transmitted outside verbal or written teachings So why are some practitioners assigned to be in charge of the scriptural library The answer is that whatever the Buddha said to his disciples and whatever he prescribed for their conduct became the teachings and regulations  Especially because our tradition claims that the ultimate experience the supreme insight cannot be trapped by the constraints of language but transcends forms of speech and action This is called the principle of neither adherence nor rejection  The Guest Reception Ofcial This ofcial deals with the reception of highranking guests He then sends his novice attendant to inform the abbot about such visitors The transient guest quarters  which come under this ofce must be kept neat as to the bed curtains furnishings lamp oil and charcoal for burning If he encounters the situation of a death among the guest practitioners he must take charge of the funeral account with the help of his practitioner assistant If one of the new arrivals dies he assumes the role of the director of the funeral rite for the deceased The Bath Hall Ofcial In general on the day designated for bathing a signboard should be posted before the noon meal to inform the practitioners In winter months bathing should be scheduled once every ve days while during the hot season it should be scheduled every day to wash away sweat He assigns the novice attendant of the ceremonial leader to be in charge of the day After the wooden sounding blocks are struck three times in succession in various parts of the corridors throughout the temple a series of drumrolls follows indicating that the time for the practitioners to bathe has arrived Next a second series of drumrolls signals the time for the training faculty ofcials to bathe The third series of drumrolls signals the time for the novice attendants to bathe The fourth series of drumrolls signals the time for the lay workers to bathe and the very last members to bathe are the attendants who supervise the workers and the administrative ofcials As to the boiler after the bathing has been completed the re must be suppressed by sprinkling water carefully over the ames and coals and the hearth cleaned and dried The order of bathing must be specied on the signboard outside the bathroom Nowadays it is believed that the abbot is supposed to bathe after the members of the training faculty have all nished and that the administrative ofcials are supposed to bathe after the novice attendants have all nished This is wrong If the abbot wishes for some reason to take his bath at the same time as the training faculty members no separating screen is required between them He does not go into a private room but disrobes at the front section of the dressing room c A small wooden sounding board should be hung inside the room with instructions written on a tablet posted next to it reading One strike add hot water two strikes This is the standard signal When a donor donates the cost of bathing for the practitioners a service of sutra chanting should be performed followed by an invocation of merit transference The Shrine Hall Ofcial The practitioner at this ofce is in charge of handling the incense burners and candle stands in the various shrine halls and keeps everything neat and tidy by wiping dust from these items and the desks When it becomes windy he must extinguish the incense burners and candles and tie up the bottom of the banners to prevent them from blowing near the ames of lamps and lights Diverting money offered by donors for incense for other purposes of the temple is forbidden On the commemorative day of the Buddhas birthday he is obliged to prepare the sweet water to be used by the practitioners to bathe the statue of the infant Buddha and on the four monthly days of religious observance he must also open the doors of the shrine halls so that general visitors may pay their respects The Incense Offering Assistant the Secretarial Record Assistant and the Guest Reception Assistant The functions of these practitioner assistants are the closest and most intimate with the daily life of the abbot Observing their masters practice of the path and virtue listening to his teaching and instruction in the morning and evening and thereby closely guarded from undesirable inuence while encouraged by desirable inuence they may aspire to reach the great goal of the Dharma and path  Next it is the duty of the assistant ofcial in charge of the secretarial record to compose the abbots correspondence When neither the director of practitioners affairs nor the guest reception ofcial is available the needs of the practitioners or if these ofcials are temporarily absent from the temple the abbots three assistant ofcials are obliged to act as their proxies according to the foregoing prescribed conduct If absence is brief  they do not leave their ofcial positions The Personal Managerial Assistant Many of our predecessors appointed to this position a welltrained person experienced in monastic life There is an episode about Mian who appointed Qingruo as his personal managing assistant and acquired Songyuan as his Dharma heir through this assistant Nowadays many abbots frequently appoint an inexperienced junior practitioner to this position and such appointments often result in damaging the virtuous name of an abbot and in serious mismanagement One must be cautious about this The Medicinal Care Assistant a This practitioner assistant attends the abbot with the duty of prescribing medicine at all times He assists him also in dealing with things around him and helps the managerial assistant A mature person humble and courteous in nature should be appointed to this position The Assistant in Charge of the Image of the Guardian Bodhisattva This ofcial is not part of the ofcial order stays behind the practitioners in the practice of the path and takes meals in the outer hall It is desirable to appoint a person devoted to the path of practice to this post He is obliged to prepare and offer meals twice a day offering the sublime image morning rice gruel and rice at noon to strike the octagonal wooden post with the mallet located at the back of the practice hall to check the seats of the practitioners prior to zazen practice and to reduce the lighting during the night Or  he may strike the octagonal wooden post with the mallet and intone the names of the buddhas When the two elder practitioners Tuigeng and Duanqiao were practitioners they were once appointed to this position They were able to cultivate good associations with their fellow practitioners and thereby encouraged them to progress in the practice of the path Later on however due to the fact that the temples in general became larger and the number of resident practitioners increased the present ofce of head administrative ofcial was added to oversee all aspects of the administration in charge of replenishing the incense and lighting materials to be used in the morning and evening receiving government ofcials and patron donors keeping the record of accounts dealing with revenue and expenditure in cash or in kind  and always working to maintain the annual scal balance He reprimands and instructs the novice attendants and workmen rather than unreasonably punishing them by whip Even when they deserve disciplinary action and punishment he should instead consult with others about the matter applying due consideration and mercy and give warnings In the past when the monastic institution was at the height of its vitality there were many instances in which a west hall ofcial a primary seat ofcial or a secretarial ofcial was invited to take this position and in turn the administrative head was invited to take the primary seat ofce or the secretarial ofce Otherwise an appointee for this position must be qualied by having a high ordination age must be well experienced in life and tradition be clean and capable publicminded and courteous not to mention having the practitioners respect and obedience Accordingly in earlier days there were no more than ve or six retired ofcials in each temple who stayed in the private quarters or in the retirees hall The three qualications of administrative ofcials are comparable to the huge ropes that are linked to shing nets It is difcult to administer the things that belong to the sangha I the Buddha himself should allow only two kinds of people to be in charge of the things that belong to the Three Treasures  arhat alohan saint   srotaāpanna  one who has reached the initial state of transcendence and this is further twofold a one who holds fast the moral and religious rules and disciplines and knows karmic retribution and b one who adheres to repentance of all his actions fearing that he might be still subjected to some offense after this life He must determine whether or not the ordination certicate that each practitioner presents when applying for residency is authentic He must direct his mind with utmost care toward the sick and the deceased Twice each day he goes to the practice hall for meals Upon hearing the sound of the bell located in front of the practice hall he leaves his seat in the outer hall enters the inner hall offers incense before the altar of the guardian bodhisattva using his left hand and stepping back two and a half steps bows toward the altar He then stands with palms joined to the side of the wooden post equipped with its mallet First he looks at the prayer invocation of the day and the names and the localities of the deities to whom it is addressed When the sound of the bell and drum end he makes the rst strike on the octagonal post with the mallet whereupon the practitioners open their almsbowls the Luminous Pure Dharma Body Vairocana Buddha the Buddha with the Perfect Reward Body and so on As each name is intoned he strikes the post with the mallet with his right hand which should not be raised more than ve inches from the post At the moment when the primary seat ofcial nishes reciting the third verse of the almsgiving prayer  he turns and goes to stand by the head position of the raised platform at the back of the rear hall When the rst serving is completed throughout the hall he steps forward and strikes the wooden post with the mallet once again goes with palms joined before the altar of the guardian bodhisattva and bows This gesture conveys that the sangha has received the alms gift from the donor Also in the Vinaya in Ten Chapters  it is said that because no one in the monks hall knew the time the practice of indicating the time by striking the wooden sounding board was instituted Also in the Treatise on Vocal Sound  is interpreted as the order or proceedings namely one who knows the proceedings of the monastic events The Treasury Ofcial In the Ancient Regulations this position was called kutou kitchen storage master Today in many temples it is still called cupboard master  while in the northern region it is called wealth holder  In actuality these are all the same position He oversees the novice attendants in their daily calculation of the accounts concerning revenues and expenditures and has one of them present the days accounts to the abbot This is called the daily accounts  There are other accounts such as an account closed every tenth day  an account closed monthly  and the annual account inclusive of all others that concerns the yearly revenues and expenditures In general the temples properties and commodities no matter how small have to be shared by all the practitioners in the ten directions ie all regions everywhere The treasury ofcial is obliged to select subordinates whether senior or junior who are alert and energetic in mind skilled in calligraphy and accounting and who are honest in nature and have integrity Any items required for the sick must be provided at once If the stores are damaged by sparrows and mice due to carelessness or if rice and wheat grain become wet because of negligence and if there are those who do not comply with the standard service for prompt supply of each of these items as well as for their careful preservation the abbot is obliged to bring any such unt personnel under his control and thereby deal with them over the course of time In preparation and serving he must always maintain sanitary standards with utmost care Instructing the novice attendants to keep the rules he must not allow them to become idle and negligent in matters of public action ie serving food to the practitioners  or participating in physical labor  The kitchen ofcial must treat farmworkers kindly and at planting time  should give them some reward and equal benet among themselves In general he is obliged to carry out repairs and restoration from yearly damage and deterioration such as roof leakage that occur to the temple buildings and various resident quarters Clerical and construction manpower must be calculated in regard to the degree of progress so as to prevent idle workers nonproductive food expenditure robbing of the public fund and damage to the temple institution He must oversee security measures for the estate farms and cottages the mills for grinding and hulling grain the cattle boats and carts for transportation and policing against re theft and robbery By sending messengers reward and punishment must be properly accorded for the kinds of work done Honest service and hard work must be especially rewarded If there is a largescale construction project this ofcial must appoint assisting members to help handle the matter The Head Ofcial of the Practitioners Quarters The duty of this head ofcial is to manage the scriptures and household items for the practitioners quarters The associate head ofcial of the quarters takes his seat symmetrically a little away from the head ofcial in the same line while the master of the rst quarters and the master of the second quarters take their seats to the right and left of the room facing each other The master of the second quarters steps forward to burn incense and returns to his seat The manner of burning incense and serving the sweet hot water is the same as for a regular occasion The Master of the Quarters and Associate Master of the Quarters In order to make the daily life of the practitioners comfortable the head ofcial of the practitioners quarters should assign their respective seating spaces in accordance with ordination seniority inviting each member from lower to higher Assigned on a rotation shift every ten days the master of the quarters assists the head ofcial of the quarters in carrying out these tasks He must not allow any nonresidents from outside to stay in the quarters overnight or to bring things there for sale The Inrmary Ofcial This ofcial is in charge of nursing the sick He provides them with hot water medicine oil lamps for lighting charcoal and re rice gruel and rice as well as all avoring items  making these items available for their use at all times Among the eight kinds of elds of merit  attending to the sick is the foremost Head of Cleaning The tasks of sweeping the grounds cleansing the air with incense replacing used bamboo scrapers with new ones cleaning the lavatories and boiling and adding water must all be carried out whenever required Even when things become somewhat messy the task is to immediately restore the original cleanliness He is obliged to inspect washcloths and pails and change them if necessary The post of head of cleaning has been vacated To volunteer for this please put up your name Someone wishing to volunteer takes the board to the director of practitioners affairs to express his intent The Fundraising Ofcial In general monastic temples where practitioners live always have the problem of being short of funds The Head of the Farmyard Unhesitatingly takes the lead in heavy physical labor He cultivates the soil sows seeds for vegetable crops irrigates the elds when necessary and thereby provides a steady supply of fresh vegetables and so on to the kitchen hall throughout the year The Head of Mill Operations is in charge of hulling and grinding grain His function is indispensably related to the supply of rice and noodles for the practitioners He also supplies hand cloths water trays lamps and dental powder so that there is no shortage In the winter months it is necessary to dry the washed hand towels The Head of the Charcoal Supply is in charge of securing kindling and charcoal before the season in order to protect practitioners from severe cold weather The Head of Estate Management is obliged to inspect the demarcation of the temples rice elds repair the estate cottages supervise farming and settle disputes with the farmers In recent times innumerable evils have been observed to happen in the affairs of many temples and the most extreme cases have involved estate management The following three points briey explain the extent of the problem The common characteristic of this evil rst and foremost in all temples is the fact that the post of estate management is the object of erce competition Accordingly some hold grudges against the abbot for not appointing them to the post and they create discord between superiors and subordinates This is the second evil Even if a mature and capable person is appointed  he is obliged to deal with the prefectural and district governments and will likely have to deal with the clerks of local governments in the city or village or neighboring wealthy landowners Even when there has been no clear expenditure by cunning contrivance a decit may result and there is no benet whatsoever in this case to the temple or to the person in regard to his own religious goals Thus the expense for running the estate often takes half of the temples entire budget This is the third evil It is never the case that temples assign members widely in various parts of the estate operation in the way a wealthy family uses its clan members extensively A temple estate may have a group of farmers at the time of sowing a group of supervisors for farming and at harvest time the temple sends a practitioner in charge of revenue and his attendants for the task This way not only saves the cost of manpower but also sometimes prevents possible disasters by reducing the expenditure required Today many temples have abandoned their estate operations leaving their facilities like abandoned houses The Head of Collection of Various Estate Revenues In the Ancient Regulations in the very beginning there was no post such as estate revenue ofcer under the head of estate management Only in recent times was this ofce created There is no end of such examples which in all cases are harmful both to the temple community and individuals Only if there are retired ofcials who are honest and assist the abbot may it become possible to select an appropriate person in terms of public election and appoint him over some limited area of responsibility Or it may also be possible to appoint a person by lottery from among the practitioners Anyone who holds this post must be rigorous in his standard of personal conduct and motivated to serve the community of practitioners One must not impose heavy demands on the farming families Electing the Primary Seat Ofcial as Occasional Teacher Since this is a serious and grave matter one should not lightly choose the appointee  The abbot then descends We earnestly wish that in your compassion you will grant your consent After offering incense and performing a prostration with unopened sitting cloth he thanks him saying Soandso has fortunately found a waystation here When he completes his exhortation the director of practitioners affairs once again performs prostrations in unison with the practitioners to express thanks Immediately following the elected teacher carrying incense in his sleeve pays a visit to the abbots ofce to express his thanks Performing the formality of two prostrations with opened sitting cloth and three prostrations with unopened sitting cloth he states Next day the abbot conducts a special serving of tea at the practice hall for the primary seat ofcial who is now the elected teacher He visits the quarters of the primary seat ofcial as elected teacher and after burning incense invites him to the serving of tea The manner and proceedings are the same as those for serving tea for the newly appointed primary seat ofcial The primary seat ofcial too is obliged to conduct a special serving of tea for the practitioners The proceeding is identical with that of a special serving of tea sponsored by the front and rear hall primary seat ofcials for the practitioners On the following day the abbot invites the elected teacher the primary seat ofcial to a special dinner reception and the dual order ofcials are invited to participate Electing Various Renowned Virtuous Primary Seat Ofcials as Occasional Lecturer The abbot is obliged to talk to the prospective primary seat ofcial beforehand  If the latter welcomes the idea the abbot invites him for tea with the dual order ofcials participating a Without immediately announcing his invitation he introduces the idea in a polite and earnest manner The manner and proceeding of the serving of tea sweet hot water and the meal reception are identical as before The appointment and resignation of the primary seat ofcial do not mix with those of the dual order ofcials nor is there any ceremonial form of transfer between the old and new ofcials Format of the Signboard The Venerable Abbot master of the temple will serve tea at the practice hall today after the noon meal This is especially intended for the newly appointed primary seat ofcial If one critically characterizes those mediocre ofcials of the present day they indulge in lengthy entertainment with drink and food as their major function and thereby compel those who remain in poverty and in the practice of the path to withdraw more and more into the storehouse of the scriptures The abbot must rectify this kind of evil trend In the Ancient Regulations only ve ofcial titles were mentioned namely the administrative head  the director of practitioners affairs the kitchen ofcial the maintenance ofcial and the treasury ofcial In the beginning there were no individual quarters and the monastic institution ourished Today the number of retired ofcials in many temples large and small has often surpassed a hundred and that of service men and workmen twice as many During the era of Taiding  his excellency Grand Minister Tuohuan of the Commission for Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs had his agency classify all Zen temples into three groups of higher  middle  and lower  This was done in order to limit the number of administrative ofcials in these different classes of institutions When the date of resignation is determined the abbot has the attendant notify the dual order ofcials The abbots assistant burns incense serves him sweet hot water and urges him to stay on In the practice hall when the rst serving of rice gruel is completed the former administrative ofcials enter the hall from the rear entrance Soandso and others were assigned through the abbots compassion to administrative ofces during the past term Because of the declining power of our minds we have conveyed our resignation to the venerable abbot and we are now returning to the practice hall to join you After striking the post once again they proceed toward the seat of the abbot passing to the left of the altar of the guardian bodhisattva and perform the propriety of two prostrations with opened sitting cloth and three prostrations with unopened sitting cloth Soandso and others were selected to serve during the last term We fear however that our performance may not have fully matched the expectation of your reverence and cannot help feeling regretful about it sir Stepping back and going around the altar they line up before the altar perform three prostrations with fully opened sitting cloth then turn to make a round of the hall starting from the primary seat ofcials raised platform After breakfast the attendant of the abbots ofce escorts the new ofcial appointees to the reception hall When the serving of tea is over the abbot rises and burns incense returns to his seat and announces The former dual order ofcials conveyed to me their intent to resign His assistant invites the new appointees to proceed and then proceeds rst toward the master and performs a prostration with unopened sitting cloth The new administrative ofcials likewise step forward and perform the propriety of two prostrations with opened sitting cloth and three prostrations with unopened sitting cloth We Soandso and others have joined this community only recently We fear that our appointment may have been a mistake and cannot help feeling apprehensive sir They complete the meeting with three prostrations with unopened sitting cloth Next the new appointees to the ofces of the training faculty proceed forward and perform the same propriety of two prostrations with opened sitting cloth and three prostrations with unopened sitting cloth uttering the same greetings as before According to the Xianshun Regulations this morning event ie consisting of inviting the new appointees to take seats burn incense and drink sweet hot water was still practiced in various temples up to that time  An alternative it is said is that if there was a plan to have a special serving in the evening of that day the morning rite could be omitted The almsserving attendant tolls the practice hall bell and the practitioners return to their respective seats where they take the meal The abbot enters the hall rst escorting the primary seat ofcial of the front hall followed by the lowerranking training ofcials who reach their seats in proper order The new administrative ofcials as a group must take their positions beforehand on the raised platform that begins with the west hall ranking ofcials seat When the abbot returns to his position the director of practitioners affairs proceeds toward him and bows remaining there by his side The former administrative ofcials conveyed their wish to resign from their posts Since these posts cannot be left vacant the Venerable Master abbot of this temple has invited the following resident practitioners to take charge of the following positions Once again after striking the post the abbots assistant immediately ushers the group of new administrative ofcials in front of the master The administrative ofcials perform in unison the propriety of two prostrations with opened sitting cloth and three prostrations with unopened sitting cloth Immediately he steps aside and moves toward the raised platform of the west hall ofcial leaving the ofcials before the altar The novice attendant of the practice hall ofce announces May the practitioners congratulate the new administrative ofcials The novice attendant then announces May the new administrative ofcials thank the practitioners Next leading the practitioners the training faculty ofcials express congratulations to the new administrative ofcials Again the practice hall bell is tolled and the new primary seat ofcial is escorted to his quarters and is congratulated there in similar manner May the retired dual order ofcials escort the remaining former training faculty ofcials and the former administrative ofcials to their respective retirees halls All the new ofcials and the former ofcials together carrying incense in their sleeves visit the abbots ofce to express their thanks The abbot then invites all appointees to his ofce for a small midmorning snack There will also be a meal reception at the abbots ofce for which a meal of rice mixed with sprouts is prepared and the west hall ranking ofcial as well as the retired ofcials are invited to participate Those functionaries in the lesser posts of miscellaneous duties visit the ofce of the practice hall on a different day after the new dual order ofcials are settled and express their wish to retire from their respective posts He gives the copy of the list of the appointees names to the attendant of the practice hall ofce According to the will of the compassionate abbot I invite the following members to the respective administrative posts as follows The remaining proceedings are identical as before We Soandso and others have assisted you our master for some time Now we are obliged to express our intent to resign wishing to pursue the practice of the path with the practitioners We earnestly wish that in your compassion you grant us relief sir They burn incense perform three prostrations with fully opened sitting cloth and withdraw The director of practitioners affairs burns incense and serves tea After they nish drinking tea he stands burns incense again and says Going through the list of names and positions one by one the director of practitioners affairs greets each appointee steps forward to perform a prostration with unopened sitting cloth toward them as a group and shifts his position I shall now request them to burn incense and perform prostrations sir When the abbot takes his seat the new appointees burn incense and perform in unison three prostrations with fully opened sitting cloth After seeing off the director of practitioners affairs the new and old assistants exchange their positions for the transfer of the duties In the Xianshun Regulations a unique case is mentioned in which the abbot himself escorts the appointed practitioner assistants to their quarters and they are in turn obliged to see off the master after performing a prostration with unopened sitting cloth The novice attendant of the practice hall ofce leads both the new and former abbots assistants on a round through the practitioners quarters The old members return to the abbots ofce early in the evening and together with the new members perform a prostration to thank their master After three days the abbot sends a note to the practice hall ofce to let the former assistants return to the practitioners quarters As usual he is given a reception with tea sweet hot water and a small snack Even if the missing items can be resupplied this necessarily causes an expenditure of the temples funds In order to solve this problem it is necessary for the treasury ofce to keep a central inventory book in which household items and amounts from all the quarters are recorded and the records must be examined from time to time by the abbot and administrative head Anything damaged must be repaired through the temples funds but missing items must be compensated for by the quarter It is hoped that this matter should be given careful scrutiny The Abbots Special Serving of Sweet Hot Water for the New and Former Dual Order Ofcials The abbots guest reception assistant instructs the guest reception attendant to prepare the crepewrapped board with an incense burner and candle stands and goes to the primary seat ofcials quarters to convey the invitation to both the former and new training faculty ofcials The statement is identical to the above The rest of the retired ofcials of the east and west orders who are participating in this special reception are seated at the right and left ends of the main section respectively The incense offering assistant sets up the seat name tablets beforehand and at the appointed time begins to drum Next day after the morning rice gruel the abbot invites the former and new ofcials for tea and later the administrative head also invites them for the same At midmorning the administrative ofce prepares a snack for them and thereafter for the next three days the ofce continues to have rice gruel and rice meals delivered to the former ofcials at their quarters The Practice Hall Ofces Special Serving of Tea and Sweet Hot Water for the Former and New Practitioner Assistants b After a meal of rice mixed with sprouts is served at the abbots ofce the director of practitioners affairs sends his attendant to invite both the former and new practitioner assistants for tea The manner is identical with that of the administrative ofces serving It is preferable however that this serving of tea be conducted prior to the abbots special serving of sweet hot water Thus in order to invite the former and new practitioner assistants for the special serving of tea the practice hall ofcial may have to wait until the abbots special serving of tea for the new primary seat ofcial is completed Those who are invited here are obliged to express thanks the next morning This evening after the serving of sweet hot water is completed at the abbots ofce we will conduct a special serving of sweet hot water at the administrative ofce I earnestly request you to grant us your honorable presence The new training faculty ofcials seats are set in the rst section ie front right of the hall the former faculty ofcials in the second section  the former administrative ofcials in the third section  and the estate management ofcial and treasury administrative ofcial in the fourth section  Additional seats are prepared for the new administrative ofcials as a group in the main section but only the new director of practitioners affairs is supposed to take a seat as participant Finally returning to midhall he burns incense on behalf of the special participant and takes his seat requesting the serving The guests then take off their robes and settle themselves on their seats for the evening meal Your spotless term has been fullled Ushering them into the practice hall from the rear entrance he rst escorts the former primary seat ofcial and next the former head administrative ofcial to their respective seats on the raised platform The Abbots Meal Reception for the Former and New Dual Order Ofcials The abbot

the reception hall As each guest nds his seat and stands beside it the abbots incense offering assistant and the guest reception assistant together go around the hall requesting the guests to take their seats During the meal the incense offering assistant leaves his seat to burn incense and deliver monetary gifts When the meal is over he and the other assistant retrieve the tables The propriety is identical with that of the special serving of sweet hot water With three drumbeats the former and new dual order ofcials leave their seats and perform the formal propriety of two prostrations with opened sitting cloth and three prostrations with unopened sitting cloth to express their thanks The assistant instructs the guest reception attendant to prepare the crepewrapped board with an incense burner a candle stand and an incense box The format previously given is identical with that of the special serving of tea for a renowned virtuous primary seat ofcial The guest reception assistant  visits the primary seat ofcials quarters and after burning incense and performing a prostration says After the noon meal the venerable master abbot wishes to hold a special serving of tea at the practice hall in honor of your reverence The guest reception master then informs the practitioners by posting the signboard indicating the serving of tea and also invites the administrative ofcials and practitioners to participate The ceremonial proceedings are identical to those of the special serving on the four major days of annual festivity  The only difference is that no incense table is placed by each head monk at the four raised platforms nor is the propriety of making a round in the hall for invitation conducted When the serving of tea is over the teabowls are retrieved from the seats of the abbot and the primary seat ofcial At the rst opening of the sitting cloth he says Today I am honored by this special serving of tea The primary seat ofcial goes out of the hall passing behind the altar of the guardian bodhisattva and turns right to the outer hall The abbot escorts him and returns to his place to take the teabowl The practitioner assistant burns incense  then takes down the teabowl from the altar After three drumbeats the practitioners leave their seats The primary seat ofcial waits for the abbot at the lower left section of the Dharma hall and thanks him for

incense he invites him for the serving of tea Today at the end of the noon meal a special serving of tea is scheduled at the practice hall in honor of your reverence and the practitioners Next he instructs the attendant of the practice hall ofce to inform the practitioners about the invitation and post the signboard indicating tea serving When the metal gong located at the kitchen hall is struck to signal the serving of tea the primary seat ofcial of the front hall should make a round through the practice hall inviting the practitioners for the serving of tea Format of the Letter of Invitation The front hall primary seat ofcial Bhikṣu Soandso has the honor of holding a special serving of tea at the practice hall after the noon meal This is especially intended for the primary seat

ofcial transfer between the former and new ofcials In the administrative ofce curtains must be hung and the main seat should be set at the rear of the hall while participants should be seated in the right and left sections of the hall On the next day there should be the serving of a snack The west order ofcial however ends the serving of a snack according to the rank of the guest reception ofcial

Respectfully prepared by Soandso Format of the Envelope Ofcials of This Temple Renowned Elders of the Zen World Local Practice Associates Honorable Practice Hall Practitioners VIII The Ceremonial Incense Offering by the Dual Order Ofcials through the Proceeding of Pairs from the East and West Orders In general whenever the dual order ofcials are scheduled to offer incense in successive pairs from both orders it is signaled by the sound of the cymbals It is not correct however to say that the primary seat ofcial who once held a position of abbot should also burn incense before the dual order ofcials Today the monastic residents gathered together in a large temple have multiplied to as many as hundreds or a thousand in number exhausts the temples granary and burning wood for cooking has stripped the mountainside into a barren wasteland Moreover coming from all directions they gather together as if returning to as if already owning the place Because of this people have served the Buddhas disciples just as they served the master Despite the numbers of resident practitioners rarely fall into indolence If this were not the  case many a legal dispute would have been raised over a square foot of land or a peck of grain How could it be otherwise other than foolishness on their part that donate plots of land for us to expand our residential quarters or that they sacrice their suppers in order to feed more of us We practitioners are fed here and reside here But for what reason Indeed for what reason End of Fascicle Four Fascicle Five Chapter VII II The Proceedings for the Rite of rāmaṇera Ordination  Ordination Procedure He then takes the certicate and a crepewrapped board to the sponsoring master  and also to the dual order ofcials for their review At each ofce he burns incense and performs three prostrations Today however is usually set up in the Buddha hall facing the Buddha statue or the seats are arranged to face each other If the in the Dharma hall a Buddha image fragrant owers incense and candles should be placed there in due accordance with the tradition Now the following section refers to the case of the event taking place in the practice hall simply because it is more convenient to accommodate seating space for a larger number of practitioners The candidates for the rite of ordination must rst request the director of practitioners affairs to determine  the ordination master   the master of ceremonial chanting  and  the master of ceremonial instruction  The evening before the day of ordination the candidates have their heads shaved a small knot of hair is left on the top of the a head This small topknot is called cūḍā in Sanskrit and zhouluo in Chinese meaning a little knot A seat and table for the ordination master should be placed symmetrically a little distance away from the abbots seat  and on the table are incense candles a portable incense burner and a pair of soundmaking ferrules  The chair and table of the master of ceremonial chanting should be placed to the right of the guardian bodhisattvas altar opposite the seat of the ordination master On this table there should be a standset bell  The master of ceremonial instruction escorts the candidate novices whose heads have been shaved from the novice attendants hall as cymbals are played  The group stops at the shrine of local spirits the patriarchs hall and the Buddha hall to offer incense and perform three prostrations at each place Only then do the ordination master and the other two ceremonial masters enter the hall where they perform three prostrations with fully opened sitting cloth before the altar of the guardian bodhisattva and then take their respective places The ordination master enquires of him Have all the practitioners assembled The ceremonial master replies Yes they have assembled sir The ordination master asks Are all the practitioners in accord and harmonious The ceremonial master replies Yes they are sir The ordination master asks Being settled in full accord what do they expect to accomplish The ceremonial master replies To participate in the rite of ordination for the candidate novices who have shaved their heads and received the precepts under oath sir The ordination master concludes So be it Thereupon the master of ceremonial instruction folds his sitting cloth and escorts the novices who are to receive the rite of headshaving into the hall while ringing his handbell The novices perform three prostrations toward the altar of the guardian bodhisattva three prostrations before the ordination master and then kneel Thereupon the master of ceremonial chanting rings the large standing bell and recites The Perfected One thus established the rules of injunction and expounded them every halfmonth in order to explain the benet of those injunctions Veneration to all the buddhas with a deep bow The ultimate goal is the yonder shore May the Buddha open the subtle and secret Way and preach it widely to the people of the world Having completed his recitation he once again speaks to the ordination master requesting May your reverence exhort for the sake of those who have shaved their heads and are ready to receive the precepts under oath The master rises from his seat and all the practitioners stand in unison after him There is the incense of the moral precepts  the incense of meditative concentration  the incense of transcendent insight  the incense of the resulting state of liberation  and the incense of the insight that recognizes the realization of this state of liberation  all of which as one permeate the entire world just as light illuminates from beyond the horizon of the clouds It is offered to the immeasurable numbers of buddhas in all directions to the immeasurable numbers of Dharmas in all directions and to the immeasurable numbers of Sanghas in all directions May all sentient beings also accomplish this quiescence as well Veneration to the Luminous Pure Dharma Body Vairocana Buddha and so on The master and practitioners complete the prayer of calling the ten sacred names of the buddhas When the practitioners take their seats again the master of ceremonial instruction takes the portable incense burner and instructs the candidate novices saying You should request the master to grant you the rite of ordination in your own words If you cannot do so follow along reciting the words as I say them In general whenever Soandso appears you should replace it with your own name Venerable  may you record my request in your mind I Soandso novice now request you to be the master on my behalf to ofciate in the rite of headshaving and receiving the precepts Venerable I pray as my master may you ofciate in the rite of having my head shaved and receiving the precepts As I depend on your ofciating I may be able to accomplish the rite of headshaving and receiving the precepts The ordination master then says O novices sons of good families  the fountainhead of the mind is totally quiescent and the ocean of dharmas is profoundly deep Whoever is astray in it will forever sink down and be lost whereas whoever is enlightened of it will realize liberation outright If one wishes to propagate the supreme path to others there is no better way than that of renunciation The path is vast and wide like empty space it is clean and pure like the moon brightly shining When ones practice of the path is assisted by proper conditions such as authorized with the rules of the precepts the goal of the path is not really far distant because such conditions initially help each one overcome distracting thoughts and eventually realize the state of transcendence It was for this reason that ākyamuni Buddha the Great Sage renounced his princely status together with his golden wheel left the palace during the night took off his precious garment of universal rule and cut off his hair in the forest No Buddha of the three periods ever has taught or will teach that a layperson can realize the ultimate path Nor could any of the past patriarchs were they engaged in an ordinary life of impurity ever have succeeded in delivering others Therefore was directly transmitted from one Buddha to another only through their own hands and the patriarchs transmit it only through patriarchs Hence no heavenly demon could do anything but look on with folded arms and the heretics were eventually converted and whosoever renounced his secular life and received ordination could discharge the four kinds of indebtedness toward his respective benefactors ie rulers parents teachers and associates and patron donors and carry out his task of delivering sentient beings from suffering to liberation After renunciation ones conduct ought to be beyond the ordinary sense of obligation subject neither to worshiping kings and rulers nor to worshiping ones parents you may leave this place for a short while to reect upon your indebtedness to the rulers of the land as well as upon the parental virtue by which you have been brought up The master of ceremonial instruction signals by ringing his handbell and leads them out of the hall Facing north the novices in unison perform three prostrations to express thanks to the ruler of the land and another three prostrations to express thanks to their parents Immediately they change into their practitioners garments return to the altar of the guardian bodhisattva and perform three prostrations The ordination master takes up a pitcher sprinkles water on the head  moistening the hair with his nger and shaves it off with a knife You have thoroughly understood that the world is impermanent The verse is chanted three times and the candidates step back and perform a prostration toward the master The last remaining knot of hair is called cūḍā and can be cut off only by the sponsoring master of the candidate novices I shall now remove the knot of hair on your behalf Three times the master chants the verse as the practitioners follow in unison The master holding up the kaṣāya robes in his hand and uttering a word of insight places a robe on the head of each candidate and intones the verses to be recited when donning the robe How great is the robe that embodies liberation The robe that is a formless eld of merit This is repeated three times with the practitioners following in unison The ordination master says O sons of good families the Dharma is like a great ocean the more you dive into its depths the deeper it becomes You have already renounced the secular world hence you must rst accept the threefold refuge and the ve precepts  Qualied by these steps you may be allowed to approach and join the authentic sangha Next you are obliged to accept the ten śrāmaṇera precepts śrāmaṇerasaṃvara shamishijie t for the life of novices through which you are entitled to share in whatever benet material or spiritual belongs to the sangha Now I shall call for the presence of the Three Treasures on your behalf so that they may witness our ceremonial conduct May those enlightened ones who have accomplished the ten nal stages and the three tenfold preliminary stages of the bodhisattva as prescribed in the sacred scriptures brought back from the ocean storehouse ie the Mahayana sutras such as the Flower Ornament Sutra etc those who have attained the ve saintly fruits of discipleship and those who are advancing toward each of the four higher saintly states catvāraḥ pratipannāḥ sixiang may they all descend to manifest themselves in response to my prayer and witness the conduct of the following rites O sons of good families if you wish to have the precepts conrmed upon you you must rst repent and be cleansed of your faults and aws just as cloth must be washed before it is dyed Now you must repent with utmost sincerity by following along with my recitation of the verse of repentance Whatever evil karma I have committed in my past lives Rooted in beginningless forces of desire hatred and delusion All a result of my acts of body speech and mind I now repent of all of it completely without remainder The ordination master says O sons of good families the Dharma has already cleansed your actions of body speech and mind You are now obliged to take refuge in the Buddha Dharma and Sangha I take refuge in the Dharma the most honorable that transcends the profane I take refuge in the Sangha the most honorable among all human assemblies Now having already taken refuge in the Buddha Dharma and Sangha I declare that the Perfected One who realized the ultimate truth and supreme enlightenment is my master and I now take refuge in him From this moment onward I call the Buddha my teacher and will not take refuge in any other evil wrong teachers and heretics The ordination master says O sons of good families you have already forsaken the evil teaching and taken refuge in the right teaching If you wish to know the rules of the precepts and maintain them you must vow to keep the set of ve rules As long as I live  I will not commit an act of killing I will not commit an act of stealing I will not commit an act of sexual indulgence I will not commit an act of lying I will not commit an act of becoming intoxicated Answer me Answer me again The ordination master says O sons of good families the foregoing set of ve rules is the initial step to enter the path of enlightenment and the foremost cause to escape from the cycle of the threefold evil courses of life Next you must accept the ten rules of the precepts prescribed for aspiring novices Whoever observes these rules under his masters guidance and receives the same benet from the sangha is an authenticated novice worthy of becoming a practitioner you are most obliged to accept the ten rules of the precepts As long as I live I will not commit an act of killing I will not commit an act of stealing I will not commit an act of sexual intercourse I will not commit an act of lying I will not commit an act of drinking I will not rest or sleep on a high and wide bed I will not wear hair ornaments necklaces anointments or perfume I will not watch a performance of theatrical singing and dancing I will not carry any gold silver coins or precious stones I will not partake of food at any unauthorized time Answer me O sons of good families having now committed yourselves to the foregoing precepts under oath you must uphold them reverentially in practice The precepts and disciplines you have acquired are dedicated to the Three Buddhist Treasures and they become seeds sown in the rich eld of merit You must always keep your mind respectful toward those who rank higher middle or lower in their respective places and exert effort in the practice of the path so that you may discharge your indebtedness to your parents Refrain from wearing colorful clothes as clothes are only for the purpose of covering the body Do not be indulgent in seeking tasty food the purpose of which is only to sustain your life Speak with dignity and correctly Refrain from speaking of others faults If people are in a dispute you must talk to each party and encourage them to reconcile There should be a normative distinction between men and women No vegetation should be destroyed at random You should not befriend anyone who is unwise nor should you venerate anyone who is not holy You should not take food other than at the prescribed time nor should you speak unless it is proper and appropriate Be diligent in nding meaning and study the past to know new things When sitting keep yourself in a state of meditation When standing occupy yourself with chanting sacred scriptures You must close up the three evil paths but open the gate that leads to nirvana Placing yourself among those engaged in practice you must enhance your right actions and your mind of enlightenment and never retrogress If you apply your mind in these ways you are a true disciple of the Buddha The novices perform three prostrations to the ordination master and again kneel left knee up and right one down with palms joined together The merit accrued from the foregoing rites of headshaving and receiving the precepts under oath is dedicated to the dragon and heavenly protectors of the Dharma the supernatural gods presiding over the temple buildings May the abbot of the temple always be the ferry or bridge to help people across the ocean of suffering May the management ofcials become the pillar and foundation stones of the religious tradition for a long time to come May the practitioners who have gathered in this hall equally ride the ship of prajñā insight May the ordained novices equally reach the yonder shore of enlightenment discharge all of the four kinds of indebtedness and deliver people who transmigrate through the three realms of existence May all sentient beings of the Dharma world equally realize the ultimate knowledge  Veneration to all buddhas bodhisattvas mahāsattvas and Mahāprajñāpāramitā presiding in the ten directions and the three times On completion of this recitation the ordination master takes his seat The master of ceremonial chanting rings the standing bell and recites the following verses in praise of the Buddha Abiding in this world like pure extended space Like a lotus that is untouched by water Yet the purity of mind even surpasses it I salute him with a deep bow the Highest and Most Honorable One I am determined to realize enlightenment and uphold my mind to strive for the path without ever retrogressing They then turn toward the guardian bodhisattvas altar and again perform three prostrations The ordination master and the other two masters perform three prostrations with fully opened sitting cloth before the altar of the guardian bodhisattva and leave the hall When the practice hall attendant tolls the hall bell three times the abbot leaves the hall and the practitioners descend from their sitting platforms Postceremonial Activities The primary seat ofcial leads the practitioners to the abbots ofce in order to express congratulation If there are a great number of practitioners the abbot must receive their congratulations at the Dharma hall where the guest masters attendant has beforehand set up an area with incense candles an incense burner ower vases a screen and a chair As assigned we have completed the rite of ordination conferring the precepts to the newly ordained novices Though we tried hard due to our lack of cultivation in matters of propriety we fear that it may have taken much longer than the venerable expected Next the primary seat ofcial and the practitioners step forward to burn incense and perform prostrations some opening their sitting cloths some not and some are excused from either formality Next the abbots ofcial assistant and disciples burn incense and perform three prostrations with fully opened sitting cloth proceed forward without folding up their sitting cloths and express congratulation to the master saying Once again they perform three prostrations and proceed forward to enquire of the abbots wellbeing They then perform another three prostrations and fold up their sitting cloths Soandso and others have been allowed to fully receive your reverends tradition and with good fortune have been authorized to wear the kaṣāya robe Thus freed from the toil of worldly matters we are able to sever ourselves from the net of attachment Once again they perform three prostrations step forward and say On this day and this auspicious moment we respectfully wish that all is well and felicitous with the abbot master of the temple who sponsored our ordination They settle into the novice quarters and await another occasion when they will be authorized to ascend the Dharma platform to receive the precepts of the Mahayana tradition We are most grateful for the protection and assistance bestowed upon us The Newly Ordained Novices Join the Practice Hall c After completing the rite of ordination and the conferment of the śrāmaṇera precepts the newly ordained novices notify the abbot of the date on which they wish to take the next step of joining the life of the practitioners in the practice hall On the appointed day after the moment when the director strikes with the to signal completion of the rst serving of rice gruel at the early morning meal the ceremonial leader escorts the newly ordained novices into the hall where they line up before the altar of the guardian bodhisattva Soandso and others have been granted permission to join the community of the practice hall Today we come to present ourselves here by following the honorable practitioners Stepping back they perform another three prostrations and fold up their sitting cloths Lining up before the abbot they bow in unison toward him and turn to proceed on a round through the hall starting from the seat of the primary seat ofcial After that they return to the hall to conduct the rite of opening their assigned space in the hall and chant along with the practitioners Ascent to the Platform to Receive the Mahayana Precepts under Oath It is said that all the buddhas of the past present and future realized the path through renouncing the secular world All the patriarchs who transmitted the seal of the Buddha mind through successive generations are without exception homeless mendicants  Because they strictly maintained the codes of the Vinaya discipline and prevailed well in the three worlds it goes without saying that the vow to maintain the precepts and discipline is the prerequisite for the practice of Zen and for the pursuit of the path Unless one dissociates oneself from transgression and prevents oneself from engaging in unethical conduct how could anyone become a Buddha or a patriarch In order to receive the precepts under oath a candidate should prepare three kinds of robes an almsbowl and new clean garments If he has nothing new he may substitute used ones which have been washed thoroughly and cleaned for the occasion of completing the rite of ascending the Dharma platform Wearing the same attire as did the Buddha upholding the same body of precepts and disciplines as did the Buddha and enjoying the practical consequences as did the Buddhaall this is not at all a minor matter and must not be taken lightly If someone uses anothers robes and bowl on loan or lets someone else use his own even though he may ascend the platform and receive the precepts under oath he has not really received them at all and though he has become a practitioner in external form but has not been endowed with the precepts internally he is thus like someone who has placed himself at an empty gate and eats up the donors gifts for nothing Those who have already received the precepts attributed to the path of śrāvakas must receive the Mahayana precepts of the path of bodhisattvas This is the gradual procedure to enter the religion Steadfast Adherence to the Precepts After receiving the the precepts one must be determined to uphold the rules at all timeseven to the extent of being willing to die for the Dharma rather than live without it The four grave offenses or defeats   The ninety offenses requiring expiation   The seven offenses concerned with the ways for settling legal disputes   The fortyeight minor offenses of the Mahayana precepts prescribed in the same sutra  In addition one must read these sources and thereby become well informed about the offenses in detail so as to know what a given case might be One must not partake of improper food  alcohol spicy vegetables and animal esh One should not partake of these kinds of food Nor should one partake of any food at a restricted period of time  No food is permitted other than rice gruel at breakfast and rice at the midday meal One should most carefully stay away from them When one strives with ones vow to realize a degree of purity in upholding the precepts the BuddhaDharma manifests itself in that person of its own accord If there is no sheepskin in ones possession how is it possible to think of transmitting beautiful wool to anyone else Therefore it is said in the sacred scripture that one must make an effort to keep ones precepts spotlessly clean as if protecting a bright pearl with all ones strength It is said in the Collection of Middlelength Discourses Madhyama gama Zhongahanjing that items that must be kept in ones possession or anything that helps in the practice of the path are called tools for the path as well as tools for enhancing the good Dharma In the Sutra on the Bodhisattva Precepts such necessary items are dened as tools to help people and to accord with the Way  Three Kinds of Robes In general there are three kinds of robes These are called triple robes Hence it is wrong to call the robe made of seven strips of cloth the undergarment  and the loincloth together the triple robes The large robe is again of three kinds The Buddha is said to have stayed one day in front of Indras rock cave  and observed that the rice eld spread out below was neatly marked by ridges into precise patterns Thus he is said to have explained to nanda that the robes of the past buddhas were all like that eld and thereupon suggested to him that his disciples should model their robes after the pattern The Record of the Rising Splendor of the Tradition gives an explanation as follows The rice eld demarcated by ridges holds water and nourishes good rice seedlings which eventually nurture the human body and life The Dharma robe as symbolized by the rice eld is moistened by water which gives four kinds of benets and raises rice seedlings comprising three kinds of good results ie freedom from greed hatred and delusion The Sitting Cloth This item is called niṣīdana in Sanskrit and a cloth on which one takes seat as he wishes in Chinese In the Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya  it is transliterated as nishidanna and translated in Tang Chinese as zuoju or equipment for seating According to the Vinaya in Five Divisions  it is equipment for protecting the body from the ground keeping the robes as well as the monastic bedsheet from becoming soiled and hence it is prescribed that each monk should carry his own cloth for sitting The Mahāsaṃghikavinaya provides further information about the size of the cloth as follows its length should be twice the length of the Buddhas arm and its width one and a half times  The Undergarment As prescribed for monks in the Vinaya discipline  there was only an ancient garment the saṃkakṣikā  This is called in translation a cloth that covers the upper arm and shoulder and is also called a cloth that covers the armpit The size of this robe is long enough to cover the left upper arm and rightside armpit Zhudaozu said in the Chronicle of the Wei Dynasty that the court ofcials of the Wei did not consider it proper for Buddhist monks to keep their right shoulder and arm exposed and thus a oneshoulder garment called piantan  was made which was then patched on to the regular saṃkakṣikā thus covering the whole upper torso That the garment we have today is open in the back but connected at the collar is a legacy of this Wei court order  The Loincloth According to the Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions  nifuxie here xie is abbreviated from sanggeqie was called in Tang Chinese qun It was called chui because the loincloth looks like such a vessel without its lid  The Onepiece Garment According to oral tradition the priests of long ago felt that it was inconvenient that some predecessors had an undergarment but no loincloth while others had a loincloth but no undergarment They were innovative in bringing about the presentday form of the onepiece garment by combining both into one There was an episode in which Puhua begged for a onepiece garment made of wood  Dayang left a pair of leather shoes and a onepiece garment  The Almsbowl b This is called boduoluo in Sanskrit and yingliangqi in Chinese meaning a vessel that can be used according to an individuals need as to quantity It is also called boyu which is a compound of Chinese and Sanskrit syllables ie bo for pātra and yu which means bowl in Chinese The Worldhonored One recollected that the buddhas of the past all invariably carried their respective bowls to receive alms and wondered to himself what kind of receptacle he should use now in order to receive alms from the two merchants At that moment the four guardian gods of the heaven at once brought four golden vessels before him The Worldhonored One however did not accept them because no person who had renounced the world could keep such precious items In the meantime Vaiśravaṇa the guardian king of the northern heaven spoke to the other three saying As I recollect a long time ago the guardian generals of the blue sky brought us four stonecarved vessels that can be used to receive food At that moment a god Vairocana by name reminded them that they should not use these stonecarved bowls for receiving food but exclusively for offering alms to the Perfectly Enlightened One In this period of ours a perfected being  ākyamuni by name has appeared in this world It should be best that these four stonecarved vessels should be presented to that Tathāgata As instructed the guardian kings of the four corners of heaven presented the four stonecarved bowls to the Buddha He stacked them one upon another on his left palm and compressed them from above with his right hand thereby producing a single bowl with four corners for touching the mouth Meritorious conduct of my past lives produced many results Whereby the mind of compassion and purity has arisen within me Because of this the four guardian kings of the heavens Immaculate and steadfast had come to offer me the bowl I need According to the Pewter Staff Sutra  the Buddha is said to have told his disciples that they should keep a staff topped by pewter because all the buddhas of the past present and future have kept and will keep  The staff in question is also called a wisdom staff or staff of virtue because it symbolizes the source of insight and practice and their merit Mahākāśyapa asked the Buddha Why does the cane have pewter rings on top The Buddha replied Xi symbolizes lightness Relying on this staff its holder can remove his delements and escape from this triple world Xi symbolizes insight Because it awakens its holder to the ultimate nature of the triple world as suffering and empty xi symbolizes separation That is to say its holder is to be freed from the ve kinds of desires The pewtertopped staff equipped with two edges each holding three rings is said to have been produced by Kāśyapa Buddha while a staff equipped with four edges holding twelve rings is said to have been innovated by ākyamuni Buddha The tip of this stick is protected by an iron point in order to make it durable The Dusting Brush According to the Vinaya scriptures the disciples suffered from insects and hence were allowed to make dusting brushes  According to the Mahāsaṃghikavinaya the Buddha is said to have permitted his disciples to make brushes out of thread torn cloth grass and bark But they were prohibited to use any brush made of animal hide such as that of a cat cow or horse as well as one decorated with a gold or silver handle They are a a tool that assists the concentration of the mind and the discipline of practice In the Soapberry Tree Sutra  the following story is related Once upon a time there was a ruler named Boliuli He said to the Buddha Since my country is small and located in a remote region I have always felt insecure The Dharma storehouse is so deep and wide that it is impossible for a person to practice everything Please teach me the essentials of the Dharma The Buddha replied If you want to annihilate your mental delements make a set of prayer beads by piercing a hole through one hundred and eight soapberry tree seeds string them together with a thread and carry this with you at all times And if you feel no mental and bodily disturbance then you will be able to leave your life and be reborn in the Yāma Heaven  When you reach the number of one million times you should be able to remove the one hundred and eight delusionbound karmas and thereby realize the fruit of eternal bliss The king replied that he would practice as instructed The Water Jar This is called kuṇḍikā in Sanskrit and ping in Chinese One ought to always keep a clean jar lled with water wherever one goes to use for washing ones hands one of earthenware which holds drinking water and a second made of either copper or iron which holds water for washing The Water Filter In the Record of the Rising Splendor of the Tradition it is said that although this is a small tool the benet it provides is exceedingly great because it protects lives In China however Buddhist practitioners seldom carry such an item According to the Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya the One Hundred and One Formal Acts of Resolution mentions ve kinds of water lters  This is made of silk cloth three by three feet or three by two feet and usable in exible sizes smaller or larger in different circumstances The cloth must be made of the nest silk threads closely woven so that it does not tiny insects A woven silk cloth or coarse hempcloth if used does not serve the purpose of protecting life  A jar for mendicancy faping  Yijiao here does not mean a corner of the kaṣāya robe but simply a thickly woven silk cloth that is picked up by its corner It is used by placing it over the mouth of a jar or over a bowl into which water is poured thereby ltering the water The Venerable Zongze Cijiao Dashi author of the Monastic Regulations of the Zen Garden collected the sources about water lters from sutras and Vinaya texts and composed thirtyone verses on the subject Because of the abundance of descriptions he did not record them all but in the end concluded that the socalled lter cloth could not produce an ample enough quantity of ltered water for the use of a multitude of people In the rst year of Chongning  the Venerable Zongze built a large washbasin by the side of the well in front of the kitchen hall of Hongjiyuan Monastery Even when water was poured into the upper basin  no overow occurred and as many as ve practitioners could easily wash their feet at the same time A similar system was built for the rear room of the bath hall When the Venerable Zongze later on resided at Changlusi he installed a similar waterltering system at the side of each well in that temple in more than twenty places Unless water is ltered at a temple at all times the transgression of killing tiny insects by the resident practitioners comes to be the responsibility of the head of the temple The Precept Knife In the Outline of the History of Zen Practitioners it is said that a small knife called a moral preservation knife  is also a tool necessary for the practice of the path because it symbolizes the severance of all evils The Traveling Pack In earlier days practitioners wore hats when traveling and carried within them scriptures a tea set and so on Robes and garments were packed in two parcels one carried in front and the other on the back The certicate container and the precept knife were inserted in the parcels Today however we use two pieces of indigocolored cloth to pack the parcels First we use one of the cloth pieces to wrap garments and so on into a parcel and is then wrapped in oil paper Next the other piece is used to rewrap the parcel into a square package then a small chain is placed around  it and a hook attached to the top The ordination certicate is placed in a sack which is carried hanging around the neck in the front The kaṣāya robe is tightly wrapped in a handkerchief and placed in a hip parcel which is carried on the lower torso while socks and shoes are placed in a sack that is carried on the back A walking stick is carried in the right hand and when we meet other practitioners on the road we hold our hands together the right hand over the left to greet each other as we pass by At the resting place  he unties the pack removes his socks and shoes washes his feet changes his garment and dons his kaṣāya robe before meeting the guest reception ofcial According to the Vinaya texts bhikṣus may stay wherever there is Dharma and food They may also stay where there is Dharma but no food They ought not however to stay where there is no Dharma even if there is food According to the Ancient Regulations when a practitioner arrived at a monastic temple he rst met with the guest reception ofcial and then visited the practice hall ofce to complete a ceremonial proceeding thereby establishing his residency and securing an assigned space and a desk space for reading scriptures  We new arrivals request an interview Thereupon the guest reception ofcial invites them into his ofce On this day we respectfully wish that the venerable Zen master and guest reception ofcial enjoy every blessing in daily life It is very fortunate for this temple to receive each of the venerables coming from such a long distance After this the visitors stand give thanks for the tea and return to the transient quarters while the guest reception ofcial pays a return visit to them The ceremonial leader receives him and when all in unison greet him the guest reception ofcial says Though this is a belated return I wish that the venerables honorable Zen masters enjoy every blessing in daily life I am especially obliged to thank you for the visit you made just a short while ago I am most grateful sirs The reply is The manner of decorum was already expressed at the time of our meeting The Visit to Honor and Venerate the Abbot If the new arrivals wish to pay respect to and venerate the abbot they must visit the ofce of the abbots assistants after the evening session is completed to meet with the ofcial assistant where they exchange the same propriety as before The assistant ofcial invites them to sit and enquires in detail about the purpose of their visit At once the assistant goes to the abbot and informs him of the guests wish If the request is granted the assistant dispatches the guest master of the abbots ofce to visit the practitioners the next morning while the early morning bell is being tolled to report to them that their meeting with the abbot will be arranged With the ceremonial leader as head the guest practitioners assemble to wait for the abbot May your reverence sit crosslegged He turns to the incense burner offering incense with his left hand and then steps back to perform the formal greeting of two prostrations with opened sitting cloth and three prostrations with unopened sitting cloth in unison with the others At the rst opening  he says I Soandso and the others have for some time heard that your reverence maintains high standards in the practice of the Way We are most grateful today to have an opportunity to see your countenance The group then completes the greeting with three prostrations with unopened sitting cloth When all take their seats the assistant ofcial burns incense and serves tea while the abbot enquires of their home regions their previous names and the temples where they were in residence for the last summer retreat Each question must be answered with reference to actual facts and one should refrain from speaking too much Rising from their seats proceed to burn incense and express their thanks It has been an important reception that the venerable has granted us Our reverence to you sir Subsequently they visit the abbots assistants ofce to express their thanks Arranging the meeting must have taken much effort for which we are especially grateful No sooner have myself Soandso and the others returned from greeting and venerating you as a group and individually than we have received your courtesy return We are most grateful for your presence once again The ceremonial leader moves to the higherranking side to receive and escort the abbots assistant into the quarters After greeting him in unison with the others he says Though it was our duty to come together to venerate you at your quarters on the contrary we are receiving your second visit We only regret very much that we have not been able to express our thankfulness earlier to you sirs Nowadays many of those who travel for training and learning do not stay in the transient quarters  Wherever they go they try to stay at the resident quarters of a temple ofcial by nding someone who comes from the same native province as them The standard of conduct of earlier days is no longer followed When the abbot receives a renowned guest visitor he should escort him afterward to the guest quarters to express his thanks Moreover the abbots of the ve major monastic establishments are not required to make a return visit to express such propriety Between breakfast and the noon meal the guests are invited to partake of refreshments and that evening to a special serving of sweet hot water the guests must wear their robes on this occasion After burning incense and expressing a general greeting concerning the weather they take their seats and the practitioner assistant invites them to drink sweet hot water They must perform the formality of two prostrations with opened sitting cloth and three prostrations with unopened sitting cloth When the abbot is in attendance he must burn incense and if he participates in the serving of sweet hot water he must perform the utmost propriety for the occasion Next morning after the morning gruel the guests are invited to a tea reception After the duration of an overnight stay we respectfully wish that the venerable master head of the temple enjoy every blessing in his daily life I Soandso and the others have been given a favorable reception and we are most grateful We especially express our appreciation for this occasion and we are most grateful The abbot sees them off following after them for two or three steps I Soandso and the others consider the matter of life and death to be of prime importance and are concerned with the nature of impermanence and the swiftness of change Because we have heard of for some time the high standards the venerable holds in the practice of the path we have come to join your community When their request is granted they perform a prostration with unopened sitting cloth and obtain from a note of his approval The practitioner then takes the document to the ofce of the abbots assistants to register his name saying The assistant ofcial in due order dispatches a note marked with the guests name to the practice hall ofce To obtain a permit for temporary absence from the monastery one must wait until half a month has passed In the Ancient Regulations the duration of the application for a temporary travel permit was always limited to a period of half a month and beyond this period one had to follow the same procedure again to reestablish ones residency and to abide by the rules of the practice hall In case of the sickness or death of ones parents or religious teachers the duration of a practitioners absence is not bound by the above rule In general it is customary to show ones reverence for the path of his teacher to place a chair in the reception hall When interviewing new arrivals the abbot must take his seat in a midposition and request them to burn incense and perform prostrations with opened sitting cloth  While sitting near the chair he bids the new arrivals to drink tea Even today this is still practiced in the northern regions  Mistaking certain wrong examples as standard they regard them as ancient tradition and perpetuate them thus creating the wrong effect If one tries to usurp a rank equal by surpassing his own rank he likely invites ridicule by outsiders The path of reverence toward ones teacher has been in total jeopardy Being respectful toward ones teacher is identical to being respectful to the Dharma When the Dharma is respected the standard of the monastic institution improves In the western countries  the way students attend their teachers is comparable to the way they respect their rulers and parents I am simply afraid that our are no match for this standard and we must learn from them Either at the beginning of the ninth month before the winter months or in the new year season the group of new members choose someone known for administrative skill or well experienced in monastic affairs as their ceremonial leader On the scheduled day with the appointed member as their leader they go to the reception hall and line up in front of it May we request your venerable to take a seat crosslegged The abbot utters an instructive word and the ceremonial leader replies Next they thank the assistant ofcial The following morning they attend a tea reception at the abbots ofce and thereafter formally request his permission for residency Waiting while the document of approval is sent to the practice hall ofce they will be escorted to join the members of the practice hall The procedure of joining or returning to the hall is as mentioned above and the abbot returns his propriety when they come to thank him for granting their residency Senior practitioner Soandso Senior practitioner Soandso Date Reported by Soandso Ofce of the Assistants V Led by the ceremonial leader all the invited new arrivals meet the ofcial perform a prostration with unopened sitting cloth and greet him with an enquiry about the weather and his wellbeing They are then invited to take their seats and nish drinking tea I Soandso and the others have received approval from the abbot Thereupon the ceremonial leader leads the group of practitioners into the practice hall from the right side of the front entrance where they line up in front of the altar of the guardian bodhisattva burns incense and in unison with the group performs three prostrations with fully opened sitting cloth He makes a round through the hall from the higher section through the lower section of the hall returns to the front of the altar and bows together with the others The director of practitioners affairs enters the hall and after burning incense proceeds to take a position in the higher section of the hall An attendant carries the certicate on a crepewrapped board and the director instructs the attendant to return the certicate  The same attendant ushers the new residents to the practitioners quarters and strikes the wooden sounding block located within the quarters three times The master of the quarters receives them as they enter the quarters and exchanges a prostration with unopened sitting cloth and an enquiry about the weather and their wellbeing May you in your compassion help us in this matter The master of the quarters replies Welcome to the venerables who have arrived here It is a pleasure moreover to secure the path of quiescence and solitude together with the venerables Immediately the new residents perform a prostration with unopened sitting cloth and move toward the east while the master of the quarters moves toward the west  The master of the quarters leads the new residents to line up before the altar of Guanyin to bow On this day we respectfully wish that the venerable Zen master of the quarters enjoys every blessing in daily life By the abbots compassion I Soandso and the others have been directed to be close to the various ofces and we earnestly request your assistance Nowadays in many cases this kind of meeting does not occur and only a message is sent or it is said that the propriety of prostration should only be conducted at the quarters of the primary seat ofcial However all this is wrong the dual order ofcials should pay a return visit to the new residents when they express thanks to them by performing a prostration in return Day and month Reported by Soandso Practice Hall Ofcial The report sent to the assistants ofce is in actuality the same report received by the abbots ofce the abbots name is omitted to show reverence The report sent to the ofces of the front hall primary seat ofcial the ofce of the abbots assistants and the practitioners quarters should provide information concerning the year of ordination and the native province of each new member but this is not the case with the report that is sent to the other ofces  Simplied Procedure for Establishing Residency b As soon as the abbot has granted residency the assistant ofcial sends the document of approval to the practice hall ofce We are most grateful It would be fortunate however if I could obtain your pardon for any of its shortcomings The practice hall attendant strikes the small wooden sounding block inside the quarters three times The master of the quarters receives the new residents The propriety is the same as before Establishing Residency by the West Hall Primary Seat Ofcial If a renowned practitioner from one of the major monastic establishments wishes to obtain residency he is obliged to express his intent clearly along with the formal statement He will be invited on that day or another day to a tea reception to meet with the dual order ofcials and the retired ofcials The west hall primary seat ofcial of Suchandsuch Temple has not abandoned us and has come to stay with us in order to guard the path of quiescence and solitude As soon as this propriety is completed he proceeds to the abbots ofce carrying an incense case to express his thanks Escorted in by the practice hall attendant he visits the ofces of the dual orders and the retired ofcials in order to return his thanks to them On the following day the abbot invites him to a special meal and tea reception I Soandso have come here especially to take refuge because the matter of life and death is of prime importance I am most grateful for your acceptance of my request to be included in the residency record We shall follow the standard propriety of this temple in escorting you to your quarters sir When the exchange of a bow with the dual order ofcials has been completed he pays a visit to the abbots ofce carrying an incense case in his sleeve and expresses his thanks to him for the individual quarters to which he has been assigned The practice hall ofce attendant escorts him on making rounds through the administrative ofces and the various quarters of the training ofcials to express his thanks The primary seat ofcial burns incense and serves tea for these ofcials the abbot sends a message to the guest resident saying that the temple community as a whole will escort him to his quarters The person burns incense and performs prostrations with opened sitting cloth If he is of lower rank than the abbot if he formerly attended him as his assistant and so on he is obliged to receive the propriety prescribed for such relations Establishing Residency through an Interview Requested by Casting Incense When a new arrival is unable to present himself at the proper time either because of certain unavoidable conditions or due to not having received a message to forego his intended visit he is allowed to approach the abbot whenever possible Upon seeing the abbot he casts an incense case to the oor and says Picking up the incense case he requests permission for residency If the abbot grants permission the assistant ofcial sends the document of approval to the practice hall ofce The following procedure is identical as before If the residency chart is already nalized he is obliged to request the practice hall ofce to place his name in the chart Or if there are numerous residents he is to be placed at the end of the ordination order The Propriety of Giving Thanks for the Granting of Residency In the Ancient Regulations those who were permitted to join the practice hall were obliged to conduct the propriety of giving thanks at once for the residency granted to them they would have to wait till either one of three later occasions to do so namely before the winter solstice before the new year and before the summer retreat Zen Master Fozhao moved from Yuwang to Jingshan  accompanied by Quanguyun as his assistant at his inauguration as abbot Fozhao therefore settled the case by ruling that the propriety of giving thanks for permission for residency should be accomplished before either the summer or winter season of each year Prior to the time of the propriety the assistant ofcial examines the Record of the Ordination Year of the practice hall ofce and assigns one of the eldest in ordination seniority among the new arrivals to be the ceremonial leader and another as coleader In earlier days a person who was once the assistant to the abbot of a major temple was customarily chosen as the ceremonial leader Often however the sense of harmony was disturbed by competition and disputing which temple was of higher or lower status According to the original regulations even an assistant ofcial of the abbot having returned to the practitioners quarters was obliged to follow the rules of the quarters as one of its residents It is probably best for the abbot to endeavor to follow the system of ordination seniority The ceremonial leader must learn various proprieties by obtaining the small chart Grouping the practitioners in several subgroups consisting of three members and assigning one in each group as the subleader he instructs them in detail to memorize set statements and to learn the manner of conduct to precisely execute their movements foward and backward turning and bending so that no embarrassing gap would result in the actual performance  Those newly approved residents are each requested to contribute money for the purchase of incense and to be ready for the performance of the propriety of giving thanks for the approval of their residency Reported by Soandso Attendant Practice Hall Ofce The practice hall attendant posts this notice in front of the practitioners quarters collects the incense money and delivers it to the abbots ofce through his assistant The assistant ofcial consults with the abbot to determine the date of the occasion Those newly returned brethren are requested tomorrow after breakfast to visit the abbots ofce to express thanks for the granting of their request for residency The assistant ofcial hands over a pack of largegrain incense to the ceremonial leader who in turn hands it to his coleader to hold The ceremonial leader leads the new residents to their positions as indicated by the chart He accompanies the assistant ofcial to escort the abbot into the hall and returning to his position bows in unison with the others May I request you to sit crosslegged Stepping back with his left foot he turns and passes to the right of the incense table returns to his place and bows in unison with the others The coleader then takes the pack of incense out of his sleeve and hands it to the leader The ceremonial leader receives it in his sleeve with a small bow with his hands clasped over his chest he steps toward the incense table burns incense with his left hand returns by the same route as before and bows in unison with the others Leading the rst three members he and the others open their sitting cloths the abbot stretches out his hand signaling by this gesture that they are excused from full propriety Soandso and the others due to good fortune from past lives have been permitted to reside under your protection As before he steps back goes around the right end of the incense table returns to his place and after a bow again opens his sitting cloth The ceremonial leader stands folding his sitting cloth steps forward again and says The rst three practitioners bow turn to the left and go around to the end of the line Their statements and manner of conduct are identical to the preceding The ceremonial leader remains in place next to the assistant ofcial and watches each group as they complete the propriety When his coleader reaches his former position he joins him and leading all the members they bow in unison and withdraw The ceremonial coleader heads the procession while the ceremonial leader brings up the rear He enters the quarters from the righthand side of the entrance turns around toward the lowerranking section of the quarters and directs the members to form lines as many as are needed according to their number He then turns to enter the quarters escorting the abbot All members step forward or back maintaining their lines and adequate distance between themselves with due attention to each other Though this is another moment we respectfully wish that the venerable master head of the temple enjoys every blessing in daily life We Soandso and the others are obliged to express our thanks through veneration to you for the residency you have granted us The ceremonial leader moves to the higherranking side outside the entrance and remains there while the coleader leads the members by turning around toward the higherranking section of the quarters The ceremonial leader says We Soandso and the others are fortunate that we have acquired our residency with your assistance Next the dual order ofcials are escorted into the quarters At this moment we respectfully wish that the primary seat ofcial the administrative ofcial and all the other Zen masters enjoy every blessing in daily life The coleader leads the group members turning behind the altar of Guanyin Bodhisattva to stand before the incense burner We Soandso and the others are very much obliged to you for your thoughtful guidance and hence express here our special thanks On the appointed day it is necessary for the guest reception master of the abbots ofce and the attendants of the practice hall ofce to rise early and prepare the notice of return propriety by copying the originals and posting them in front of the practitioners quarters Day and month Message upon instruction Soandso Attendant of the Guest Reception Master  The Venerable Primary Seat Ofcial and the Administrative Ofcial will visit the leader of those practitioners who acquired their current residency for the sake of the return propriety after the morning rice gruel Day and month Message delivered Soandso Attendant of the Practice Hall Ofce  The Abbots Special Tea Reception for New Residents See also the similar reception given by the dual order ofcials chapter VI part VII section  The guest reception assistant prepares the invitation for the tea reception by copying the list of the ordination dates ranking and names of the new residents  On the appointed day as early as the time of morning bathing a table brushes and an inkslab should be set up in the skylit hall   The new residents are requested to line up and inscribe under their respective names Soandso has respectfully received the invitation As to those renowned senior practitioners who once held positions in other temples the day before the guest reception master must deliver to them letters of invitation prepared according to their ordination dates and request them to place their signatures on the sheets with their names The assistant ofcial instructs the guest reception master to draw up copies of the name tablets marked special serving for each guest according to their ordination seniority either in terms of the quadruple seating arrangement or that of the sextuple seating arrangement  If there is any disagreement the eldest in ordination age among the renowned practitioners from a major temple must be recommended to take that seat On the appointed day after the noon meal the new residents are called to assemble by the signal of drumming The incense offering and guest reception assistants conduct the proceedings of the reception for the leftand rightside sections of the seated guests respectively greeting the guests one by one and bidding them to take their seats Incense is burned to signal the invitation for the guests to offer incense to signal the drinking of tea and to signal the presence of the main guest This is identical with the propriety of the small reception to serve sweet hot water held on the four annual celebration days The main guest of the reception leads his colleagues in expressing thanks for the reception by performing the formal propriety of two prostrations with opened sitting cloth and three prostrations with unopened sitting cloth We Soandso and the others are obliged to express our thanks for todays reception especially served for us On this day at this respectful moment may the venerable master of the temple enjoy every blessing in daily life Returning to the line of his colleagues he performs three prostrations with unopened sitting cloth in unison with the others and withdraws The next day the administrative ofcial instructs the attendant of the guest reception master to prepare the letters of invitation for tea according to the ordination dates and names but without titles or ranks and waits for the invitees in front of the practitioners quarters to obtain their signatures indicating acceptance of the invitation Soandso has respectfully accepted the invitation The invitees assemble at the administrative reception hall where the primary seat ofcial is the main participant The wooden sounding block located in the hall is struck to signal commencement of the reception Again on the following day the primary seat ofcial and the other training faculty ofcials obtain the signatures of the invitees in the same manner as before In the case of four or six training ofcials divided into two groups they conduct the proceedings in making rounds to bow in the case of three or ve training ofcials the primary seat ofcial burns incense and takes a position in the center standing In the Ancient Regulations this propriety continued for three days but today it is completed within a day in most Zen temples The seating tablets and the drum may be borrowed from the abbots ofce The training faculty and administrative head keeping a seat vacant for the abbot mutually serve as the main participants The only difference is that when the invitees express their thanks they are without fail obliged to move away from their seats turn toward the host and bow and then offer the word of thanks He also posts a tablet indicating the zazen practice in front of the practice hall and at the practitioners quarters to inform the practitioners The almsserving master is  obliged to set up incense and light candles within the practice hall At the moment when they all enter the hall the wooden sounding block is struck a third time somewhat softly Thereupon the second master of the quarters closes the entrance to the quarters and strikes the wooden sounding block located in front of the primary seat ofcials quarters three times The rst strike is made when the abbot leaves his quarters the second when he reaches midway and the third when the abbot enters the practice hall The primary seat ofcial burns incense in front of the altar of the guardian bodhisattva and makes a round through the hall from the lowerranking section to that of higher ranks and then takes his place sitting crosslegged Next after notifying the abbot three strikes are made in a similar manner as before on the wooden sounding block located at the abbots quarters The abbot enters the hall burns incense and makes a round of the hall from the higherranking section to the lower ranks and sits crosslegged at his place After zazen practice the practitioners gradually arise from their places in order to rest Some may leave their quilts in the hall and do not act as the others do Or some may return to their seats after a while and leave their kaṣāya robes at their places as the others do yet do not participate in the zazen session but remain outside the hall In either case such people must be caught and reprimanded Only the primary seat ofcial is allowed to come or go from his seat by passing in front of the abbot The abbot and the training ofcials leave the hall while the practice hall attendant stands to the extreme right near the entrance and bows toward them  Nor is there the regular Zen discourse but zazen practice scheduled on a regular day after the Zen discourse should be held as usual The abbot and the primary seat ofcial make a round through the hall Once a practitioner has completed a rotation shift he starts again from the beginning Inscribed on both sides by Abbot Soandso with his signature The tablet is to be passed to the next person early the next morning Recently the number of practitioners in charge of the hall has increased so that they form large groups They chew fruit seeds and gather for idle talk and laughter perpetuating such behavior and making it an evil custom and they disturb the quiet of Zen practice The Manual of Zazen Practice Generally speaking a bodhisattva who seeks the insight of prajñā should raise the mind of great compassion issue forth the universal vow  engage himself in the ardent practice of samādhi and resolve to liberate sentient beings He does not seek liberation merely for himself but renounces all causes of trouble and brings myriads of thoughts to rest so as to unify body and mind and make no distinction between motion and stillness He must measure each meal as to its adequacy and regulate hours of sleep and rest prepare a thick seat cushion in a quiet environment and sit in the full crosslegged position or in the halflotus position The left hand is placed on the right hand and the thumbs of both hands touch The body is held straight in sitting with and the nose and abdomen vertically aligned The tongue rests on the upper palate the lips and teeth are rmly closed and the eyes remain slightly open so as to avoid falling asleep When a practitioner realizes the state of concentration he acquires the utmost superior power In ancient times those practitioners who were well trained in the practice of zazen always kept their eyes open while abiding in deep concentration Zen Master Yuantong of Fayunshan is said to have scolded his students who sat with eyes closed There is a deep meaning therefore in the expression Wherever there is a dark hill there lies a cave where devils abide One must not delve into thoughts that arise whether good or bad As soon as a thought arises he must become aware of it He must always be aware of what arises in the sphere of consciousness without losing clear discrimination and without becoming dull or scattered A myriad of years is nothing but one moment of thought which is neither discontinuous nor continuous This is the essential Way of Zen practice The taste of insight into the Dharma nourishes ones spirituality a quiescent state of everlasting illumination Waking and sleeping are as it were identical and life and death are as one Nevertheless it is often the case that when the path is lofty ones wayfaring is more likely to be even more intensely disturbed by devils in thousands of situations If once however you can manage to bring right mindfulness into your present consciousness no obstacle can disturb or delay anything just as it is explained in the ūraṃgamasūtra in the Tiantai Practice of amatha and Vipaśyanā by Zhiyi  and in the Manual of Practice and Realization by Guifeng  If one analyzes devilish disturbance in detail one becomes aware that everything arises from ones own mind and not from outside  When the power of samādhi and prajñā becomes superior devilish obstruction disappears of its own accord When you are ready to emerge from dhyāna you should move your body slowly and arise from your seat with ease and grace never abruptly and roughly Among all forms of practice samādhi is regarded as the best If one does not engage in meditation and concentration  one is bound to become totally lost in the triple world of existence dallying in external causes When the water is moving it is difcult to look for pearls The water of samādhi is clean and transparent and reveals the pearl of the mind of its own accord Thus it is said in the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment that the insight of prajñā free from obstruction and spotlessly clean arises on the basis of Zen concentration  The Lotus Sutra also says that one should practice mind concentration in a tranquil environment and settle himself at ease immovable like Mount Sumeru This means that it is always on the basis of the condition of quiescence that you may transcend the state of an ordinary person as well as that of a holy person In the past those who passed away while sitting crosslegged or while standing must have been rm in the power of concentration He also posts a tablet indicating the zazen practice in front of the practice hall and the practitioners quarters At dusk incense is burned and candles are lit in the practice hall The wooden sounding block located in front of the practitioners quarters is struck to signal the practitioners to assemble After the rst strike the practitioners enter the hall at the second strike the training ofcials enter and at the third strike the primary seat ofcial enters In some temples it is against the regulations to not wear the kaṣāya robe for the occasion of Zen sessions When the cooking of the evening rice gruel has been completed the practice hall attendant noties the primary seat ofcial He passes behind the altar of the guardian bodhisattva and to its right reaches the front entrance takes down the tablet and strikes the practice hall bell three times at which time all practitioners bow in unison while remaining in their seats Thereupon the practitioners descend from the raised sitting platform and pull out their bedding to a halfopen position Because of that the abbot led all the members of the temple to assemble for the Zen session At the drum signal they proceeded to approach the abbot There is an episode related to this Because the region of Fenzhou was very cold the honorable Shanzhao canceled this type of evening session  and the phrase the release from the Zen session  derived from it The Evening Zen Session c Today in monastic institutions where numerous practitioners reside the evening Zen session is still practiced with the original meaning This is called the great Zen practice session and it is nearly identical to a regular Zen session The only difference however is that the primary seat ofcial does not burn incense after entering the practice hall but proceeds directly to his place and waits for the abbot to enter and sit crosslegged at his seat The practice hall attendant strikes the wooden sounding block at the primary seat ofcials quarters three times and the practitioners turn around to face each other while sitting crosslegged on their seats The primary seat ofcial descends from his seat leaves the hall through the rear entrance reenters the hall through the front entrance burns incense before the altar of the guardian bodhisattva makes a round through the hall as usual and then returns to his place and sits crosslegged If the abbot conducts the evening session the practice hall bell is not rung the guest reception master of the abbots ofce makes three drumbeats signaling the abbot to leave the hall The primary seat ofcial leading the practitioners follows him to the Dharma hall or to the abbots reception hall When he takes his seat on the chair the assistant ofcial the dual order ofcials and the east and west hall ofcials each step out individually from their regular positions and bow prior to the beginning of his exhortation If there is no evening session the practice hall attendant goes before the primary seat ofcial and after a bow says During a period when a series of Zen sessions is conducted it is better to alternate days with a session with days having no session so that the junior members can learn the proceedings In the evening when the wooden sounding block in front of the practitioners quarters is struck three times they leave their quarters and return to the practice hall Next the abbot enters burns incense and makes a round When an extended session of zazen is requested  the abbot reenters the hall from the rear entrance and settles on his seat without making a round through the hall When the sound of the primary seat ofcial opening his pillow is heard the practitioners make ready to take their nightly rest Next morning the practitioners are awakened by three strikes of the wooden sounding block The practitioner assistant for the guardian bodhisattva pulls around the hall towel rack to surprise late risers When the practitioners nish washing and return to the hall the primary seat ofcial enters rst burns incense and makes a round through the hall Next the abbot enters burns incense and makes a round in the same way At the signal of four drumbeats ie the fourth watch of the night and the fth point  AM the abbot leaves the hall The rest of the training ofcials and the practitioners leave the hall a moment later through the rear entrance change their garments and hats and after a rest return and wait on their bed spaces Sometimes the primary seat ofcial returns to the hall and once again makes a round through the aisles of the hall When the hall bell has ceased ringing the metal gong located at the kitchen hall is sounded to signal the time to fold up the bedding  The practitioners may then leave the hall as they wish Contemplation of the buddhas or scriptures should be simultaneously practiced  With a bow the practitioner burns incense performs nine prostrations with fully opened sitting cloth  and folding up the sitting cloth steps forward and says As I Soandso regard the matter of life and death of primary importance and am concerned with the swiftness of transformation I earnestly request the venerable master in his compassion to grant me special instruction with words of expediency When it is over he steps forward to burn incense and once again performs nine prostrations with fully opened sitting cloth This is called the propriety of giving thanks for causes and conditions  The practitioner is also obliged to drop in at the assistant ofcials ofce to thank him The Propriety of Partaking of the Morning Rice Gruel and the Noon Meal In the early morning after the metal gong located at the kitchen hall has been struck to signal the release from morning silence and later at mealtime while awaiting the sound of the kitchen hall metal gong the practitioners go to their respective places in the practice hall where their almsbowls are kept and take them down They then enter the practice hall bow before the altar of the guardian bodhisattva and proceed with palms joined together to their respective seats With your back to the raised sitting platform rst use your right hand to pull up your left sleeve and hold it by the left armpit and then use your left hand to pull up the right sleeve and hold it by the right armpit Then supporting your weight on both hands placed on the board behind you shove your sandals below the board and then rst bend in your left foot and pull in the right foot next proceeding to carry your whole body backward a foot or so across the wooden board Then sit crosslegged spread the kaṣāya robe to cover the knees neither revealing the undergarment nor letting it hang down over the platform In the Ancient Regulations the abbot came to the practice hall every day At breakfast he rst sits in the outer hall and when the practice hall bell is rung he enters the hall Attending the Special Tea and Sweet Hot Water Reception The propriety involved in the tea and sweet hot water reception by the abbot and the dual order ofcials is a rather serious matter for a number of reasons One must not be negligent about it Once invited one must be on time to attend the event Anyone who does not attend due to negligence is certainly not entitled to live under the same roof The Request for Universal Participation in Tasks of Labor The rule of universal participation in the task of labor is meant to equalize the work contribution of individuals whether higher or lower in rank In general wherever a number of people live together there should necessarily be things accomplished on the basis of all members cooperative effort At the sound of the wooden shshaped gong or the drumbeat every member tucks up his sleeves with a strip of cloth over his arms and assembles at the designated place for the task of labor Except for the guard of the practitioners quarters the practice hall guard and the sick and aged every practitioner is equally required to participate in such tasks A day of no work is a day of no eating VII Introduction Zen Master Wuliangshou said  Escaping from worldly dust and leaving human convention shaving the head and wearing the kaṣāya robe and pursuing the path by sojourning in various monastic institutions one must clearly know the rules and disciplines of these institutions Since wrong behavior easily becomes an established custom through repetition and learning it is very difcult to reform Because such fault and sickness are so frequently observed in everyday life it has nally led to the compilation of those paradigmatic rules of Baizhang as models In order to escape from the about these rules it is necessary to put each of these rules into practice immediately and only after strict adherence to each can one claim that one has pursued the nature of the self claried the forms of the mind understood the problem of life and grasped the nature of death The practitioners who renounce and are constantly traveling can bequeath their rules to those who have not renounced  For many householders are not inferior physically or mentally to those who have left the householder life and they are equally obliged to discharge their indebtedness to the buddhas and patriarchs The Rules for Morning Proceedings As to the rules of conduct among the practitioners you should not go to sleep before others do nor should you get up after others have Before the timekeeping bell signals three oclock in the morning you must arise energetically and put your pillow at the foot of the bed space Pull yourself together and sit straight with the whole body so as not to create wind which may disturb your neighbors Even if my life should end at this very moment may I immediately be reborn in the Pure Land Then go out to the washstand lifting the hanging screen of the practice hall softly You must not make noise by dragging your sandals or gargling loudly When one lifts the hanging screen to go out of the entrance of the hall one should not let his hand drop until it is all the way down The water tray for washing ones face must be gently handled and one should not use too much hot water Dip the right ngers in dentifrice and rub the left side of the mouth then dip the left ngers in dentifrice and rub the right side of the mouth Do not dip your ngers in the dentifrice again it should be cautioned that ones mouth odor may be transmitted to others in this way When rinsing the mouth lean forward with your head down and after taking the water spit it out with both hands downward it is cautioned that it may splash over nearby buckets that are being used by others You must not wash the head There are four disadvantages for yourself and others  Do not make noise by blowing your nose splashing water onto your face loudly  or deling the washing trays by spitting Washing the face at three oclock in the morning is for the primary purpose of religious practice and stamping with the sandals are most annoying to the practitioners who are seriously engaged in practice While washing your face do not ght others for towels nor should you use the towel to wash your head When entering the practice hall through the higherranking section step into the hall with the left foot rst conversely when entering from the  lowerranking section step into the hall with the right foot rst Then ascend the raised sitting platform fold up your bedding halfway and sit upon it crosslegged When changing your garment you must put the new one on over the old one keeping yourself covered while taking the old one off You must not expose any part of your body while changing clothes nor should you create a breeze by moving hurriedly If you wish to burn incense and venerate the Buddha you should do so while the timekeeping bell is being rung Carry the kaṣāya robe in your sleeve leave the hall by the rear entrance and don the robe outside How great is the robe of liberation Formless yet the eld of every merit Oṃ siddhāya svāhā  To fold up the kaṣāya robe rst pull the grip portion and untie the ring You should not hold the robe in your mouth or use your chin to pull the robe When venerating the Buddha at the shrine hall  you must not occupy the central part of the oor lest you obstruct the abbots entrance into for the rite of veneration Nor should you call the names of the buddhas out loud nor should you walk beside someone who is performing the rite of veneration You must take a place in the empty rear part of the hall May the sound of this bell go beyond this Dharma world May it be heard by all those who abide in the dark ghostly world of iron prisons May those who suffer in the three deplorable realms of existence be freed from it Ending the perpetual warfare of swordwheels At the end of morning zazen practice at the time of minor release of silence  everyone must fold up their bedding and place the pillow within it The way to fold the bedding is to rst nd the two front corners and stretch the quilt by hand straight in front Then fold that one half into half and next fold the other half which is closer to you into half You must not extend the quilt into the neighboring space by folding it sideways nor should you let any sounds escape when pulling the quilt nor should you create any air movement by shaking it You may either go to the practitioners quarters to have an herbal medicine drink or engage in the practice of a meditational stroll in the hall eventually returning to your almsbowl position by turning toward your upper shoulder  When entering the hall from the front entrance you must step in from its southern corner you are not allowed to approach from the northern corner or from the center The Rules for Meal Proceedings As to meal proceedings when the wooden shshaped gong is sounded signaling mealtime no one is allowed to enter the hall You may request a meal attendant to fetch your bowl and sit in the outer hall Or returning to the practitioners quarters you may join the serving team If you have already been seated when your neighbors come to their seats you are obliged to join your palms together Unless one greets with respect the practitioners of the higher and lower seats as well as those across the aisle there is no difference between a Buddhist gathering and of brahmans Rise and stand straight for a moment then turn again toward your upper shoulder  with both palms together ready to take the bowl down First with your right hand release it from the hook then with your left hand support it while turning around and bending down to place it on the oor In this way you can avoid colliding with your neighbor with your back hip When the hall bell rings everyone must descend to the oor to greet the abbot who is entering the hall and all bow in unison No one however should move their hands to the right or left The Buddha was born in Kapilavastu Enlightened in Magadha First preached in Vārāṇaṣī Entered nirvana at Kuśinagara As to the manner of opening the bowl rst recite with palms joined together the following verse mindfully a

small size and place it together with the sack holding the spoon and chopsticks laying these horizontally nearest your place literally to the body When placing the utensils into the sack you should put the spoon into the sack rst  but when removing them from the sack take out the chopsticks rst  The bowlcleaning spatula must be laid vertically to the side of the second bowl with its tip extending half an inch out from the tray sheet so that alms for the sake of the hungry ghosts may be placed on it Neither the spoon nor the chopsticks should be used for this offering and it ought to be no more than seven grains of rice Whenever food is received it is a general rule to make such an offering but when food has not been received it is not permissible to make an offering directly from the serving ladle Join your palms together lightly graze your chest do not let your ngertips reach the mouth Both hands cross each other at the ngers with the ngertips almost sticking into their nostrils In dragging the sandals and lifting up the entrance screen there is no rened cordiality whatsoever Uttering sounds like and leaking breath they look like heroes When receiving food you are obliged to hold the bowl with both hands and intone the following verse from memory In order to request more or less  signal by keeping your right hand still or raising it slightly to indicate that you have received enough Do not shake to the right or left Second reect upon whether your virtue and practice have been perfected or are far from satisfactory and partaking of the almsfood Third reect upon whether your mind is prevented from evil thoughts and freed from wrongdoing because such are caused by desire and so forth Fourth reect upon whether you regard food as good medicine and use it properly to treat illness and prevent emaciation of the physical form and strength Fifth reect upon whether you are aware that it is for the sake of realizing the ultimate goal of the path that you receive this almsfood Next you must produce some alms and intone the following verse from memory O host of hungry ghosts I now make an offering of food for you This food is offered widely in all ten directions for all the hungry ghosts Whether taking up the bowl or putting it down you must not make noise either with the spoon or chopsticks You should not cough or sneeze If this naturally occurs you should cover your nose with your sleeve You must not scratch your head because dandruff may y and fall into the bowls of neighboring practitioners nor should you put your nger in your ear nor make

primary bowl and sifting rice from it Do not eat rice by mixing it with side dishes in the primary bowl While eating pay attention always to your neighbors on each side so as not to be too far behind

pick up each bowl in due order and place them one after another into  After this has been completed hold your palms together and recollect the verse that is recited at the end of each meal Having nished the food I feel the strength of my physical body Whose majesty shakes the heroes in all directions and in the three times Entering the quarters as well as coming to your seat is performed exactly as is done in the practice hall Remaining in position wait for the moment when the master of the quarters nishes burning incense then bow to your neighbors both higher and lower in rank Drinking Tea and Reading Sutras at the Practitioners Quarters When practitioners take their seats to have tea in the practitioners quarters they must be careful not to allow their robes to hang down Nor should they talk and laugh with others with their heads close together Do not greet others by a single raised hand nor collect leftover tea When ascending the raised sitting platform you must not let your robe hang overboard Some greet others with a single hand but for what reason After drinking tea if you want to read sutras do not unfold the text scroll too widely but limit it to  You must not walk about in the quarters carrying the sutra in your hand nor should you let its binding cord hang down nor should you read it aloud nor should you lean against the wallboard It is advisable to leave the quarters early for zazen practice Using the Lavatory When going to the lavatory according to the Ancient Regulations you must change into the robe made of ve strips of cloth wutiaoyi namely a simplied robe Take a clean handkerchief and hang it over the left arm Untie the string belt and hang it upon the bamboo rack and take off the simplied robe and onepiece garment Neatly fold them up

feed upon feces Squat down and maintain the right posture do not groan nor spit saliva or nasal mucus nor should you make conversation with another through the wall The Ancient Regulations says At the doorway snap your ngers lightly When coming out of the lavatory you must not leave the shoes in disarray Do not pour water on both hands for cleansing When the left hand is used for cleaning cover the thumb and the two adjacent ngers and do not use many bamboo spatulas c After using the spatulas wash them with water and leave them in the space near the lavatory Leave the water bucket where it was

of the door with your wet hand Pick up a pinch of ash and then dirt with your right hand not with your wet hand You must not spit saliva to mix with the dirt Wash the left hand and then use to wash the hand up to the elbow In general whosoever goes to the lavatory and does not intone the prescribed mantras will never be able to cleanse his delement even upon reaching the subterranean depth of the golden layer by using as much as ten times the water in the Ganges River to wash his delement away Therefore one must maintain the mantras steadfastly and intone them seven times each on every occasion Because of this practice the ghosts and spirits always accompany him and protect anyone who intones them accordingly Finally cleanse your mouth with fresh water Some Vinaya rules prescribe the method of cleansing after urination As long as no signal is heard from the kitchen hall metal gong you should not return to the practitioners quarters Nor should you wash your clothing before the

of text in the practice hall While engaged in a meditational stroll between the higherand lowerranking sections you must not take a direct passage through the hall First it is the space where the almsbowl is used second it is the space where the kaṣāya robe is placed and third it is the space toward where ones head is directed during sleep at night Nor should anyone open their storage box by squatting down on the oor Nor should you descend from the raised platform by stepping on the boardedge After going around outside the temple wearing grass sandals and the simplied robe made of ve strips of cloth no one is allowed to step into and walk about in the Buddhas shrine hall or the Dharma hall without rst changing their clothes You should not wear the practitioners sandals with bare feet Nor should you walk hand in hand with another while explaining the secular truth as to its rightness and wrongness Separating oneself from ones parents and leaving ones original teacher What would one intend to accomplish by traveling afar to seek knowledge Whoever has not settled with the matter of the religion of the Zen tradition May not accomplish anything even until they become whitehaired Movement must be conducted with gentle walking For which one must learn Assajis majestic demeanor Words must be spoken in a low voice For which one must learn Upālis manner One must not go to the shrine hall for no purpose Nor should one step into the stupa compound to waste time When washing your clothing after the noon meal you must keep one shoulder covered Nor should you soak the garment by pouring hot water directly from a jar After using the bamboo poles and drying racks they must be returned to their place When the wooden sounding block is struck to signal the time for washing the feet you must not compete with others to obtain a washbucket If you have boils or sores that itch you must wash your feet after the others nish or go somewhere not directly within sight to do so Each practitioner must act expediently to avoid any occasion that might incur disturbance in the minds of his fellow practitioners You should return to the practice hall without waiting for the signal of the wooden sounding block when your work is done Once the signal has been completed no one is allowed to enter the hall No one should remain standing outside the hall Nor should anyone shout aloud or compete to obtain items such as gruel rice salt vinegar and so on No one is allowed to return to the practice hall or walk through the corridors without wearing the regular robe Nor should anyone wait for the signal of the wooden sounding block to leave the practitioners quarters When the evening bell is tolled each practitioner with palms together silently and mindfully recites this verse  Listening to the sound of the evening bell we feel that delement is reduced It increases farreaching insight inducing enlightenment It helps us out of hell and the ery pit Let us aspire to realize buddhahood and help sentient beings Everyone must rst return to his oor space to practice zazen You must not scratch your head on the raised meditation platform nor should you make noise by manipulating your prayer beads on the raised platform nor should you exchange conversation with your immediate neighbors If the practitioner next to you is not yet well cultivated you must help him improve himself by way of skillful words and never hold a sense of dislike toward him After the bell to signal the end of zazen practice or the time to sleep no one may use the front entrance for going or coming Awaiting the moment when the primary seat ofcial prepares his pillow those who feel extremely tired go right to sleep While sleeping lie on your right side not on your back facing straight upward because this is called the dead mans sleep Wrap the kaṣāya robe in the handkerchief and place it above your head  Today many practitioners place it below their feet but logically this is not a convenient practice The Rules for Bathing On bath day carry your toiletries in the right hand enter the bath hall from the lowerranking section and after a bow go to an empty space Before taking off the onepiece robe remove your underwear and wrap the loincloth around your body to prevent the bathing trousers from becoming loose Then untie your underwear and place it in the wrapping cloth Next take off the onepiece robe and tie it together with the sash and the robe made of of ve strips of cloth When you hear the three drumbeats and enter the bath hall Separate those clothes that directly touched the body from those that are clean Wrap all your clothing into one bundle turning it front and back and then change into the wooden footwear Do not enter the bathwater with bare feet You should wait your turn to bathe at an empty spot in the lowerranking section and must not occupy the space reserved for the training ofcials and seniorranking practitioners  Be careful not to pour hot water over anothers body Do not dip your foot inside the bucket nor urinate inside the bathing room nor prop your feet up on the bucket nor exchange laughter and conversation with others Do not pour water over your body with a bucket while standing Do not let the loincloth drop from your body Do not dip your feet into the water bucket to wash them nor use too much hot water Those with itching sores must bathe last and not try to enter into the bath any earlier by hassling  Do not use the public washcloths for cleaning your head or face because these are used for handcleaning after wearing the undergarment and thereby you put the robe made of ve strips of cloth on over it After coming out of the bath greet those on the right and left ascend the raised platform and sit crosslegged for a while facing the wall Then rst donning the robe and the onepiece robe descend to the ground take down your bathing trousers while bundling up the loincloth into it This is because the wrapping cloth may have become wet Holding the handkerchief in your left hand greet the right and left then leave the hall Find the names of the donors and chant sutras or intone mantras as you wish concluding with an invocation of merit transference The Rules for Being at the Fireside During the winter months when approaching the reside you must rst sit on the reside board then turn around to the back and sitting properly greet the right and left You must not play with the re shovels and pokers  nor should you blow on the re or let ashes y up Do not exchange conversation by putting your head together  and neither should food items be placed in the embers Do not dry your sandals to the point of scorching nor burn your shins or clothing Do not expose your underwear by rolling up the onepiece robe Do not spit or toss lth into the re Conclusion of the Daily Rules of Conduct The rules of daily conduct as previously collected are concerned with the major events that take place in the lives of practitioners and are not intended to be heard by established senior practitioners An Exposition on the Model Zen Principles of Conduct The following was written by Great Master Cijiao the honorable Zongze  Ever since the coming of the patriarch from the west the facility of the Zen monastic institution was destined to evolve fundamentally for the community of practitioners The Normative Principles for the Community of Practitioners Thus came to be the position of senior head ofcial to teach the community of practitioners in the Zen religion So did the position of primary seat ofcial to provide model leadership for the community of practitioners So did the position of the head administrative ofcial to support the community of practitioners So did the position of kitchen ofcial to prepare daily provision for the community of practitioners So did the position of maintenance ofcial to engage himself in various tasks for the community of practitioners So did the position of treasury ofcial to keep accounts of revenues and expenditures on behalf of the community of practitioners So did the position of secretarial ofcial to deal with recording and correspondence for the community of practitioners So did the position of guest reception ofcial to receive and attend patron donors on behalf of the community of practitioners So did the position of assistant to communicate requests and invitations between the abbot and the community of practitioners So did the position of the master of the quarters to guard personal possessions clothing and almsbowls for the community of practitioners So did the positions of bath master and water supply chief to provide sanitary bathing and laundry for the community of practitioners So did the positions of charcoal supply chief and replace chief to shield the community of practitioners from cold weather So did the positions of alms campaign leader and fundraising master to make appeals for monetary and alms donation for the community of practitioners So did the position of cleaning task chief to sweep and scrub on behalf of the practitioners The community of practitioners has no worry whatsoever and can devote themselves singlemindedly to the pursuit of the path Reecting upon the assisting works of the multitude shouldnt we know and discharge our indebtedness The practitioner should learn the propriety of the order of high and low and be rmly in command of the decorum whether in movement or stationary The practitioner should respect the external regulations and adhere to the inner rules The practitioner should be harmonious like milk and water with the other practitioners in six ways ie physical harmony in sharing the same residence verbal harmony in the absence of disputation volitional harmony in sharing the same action disciplinary harmony in sharing the same practice harmony of thought in sharing the same understanding and harmony of receiving benet in sharing equal amounts The practitioner should receive the food that is offered for the sake of realizing the goal of the practice The practitioner should carefully use and look after the household items of his current quarters The practitioner should examine his mind of understanding in reference to the ancient teachings under bright windows and on a clean desk In dealings with his colleagues the practitioner should be rm like a mountain regardless of whether it is a vase or a bowl that is missing The practitioner should keep his mind calm as to his sickness and suffering and willingly take the rice gruel and medicine This is the way to discharge ones indebtedness to the bath hall master and the water supply chief The practitioner should keep his mouth shut his hands together and withdraw from the reside in order to let others have a chance to warm themselves The practitioner should reect upon whether his virtue and practice are deserving when receiving almsfood The practitioner should bail water carry used bamboo spatulas and have a sense of shame and repentance The practitioner should be easy to follow and simple to serve Those who are endowed may realize the goal within one lifetime The community consisting of these practitioners indeed constitutes the true treasure and most worthy eld of merit in this world The Ofcials Failure to Follow the Normative Principles If the monastic institution is not reformed and if the wheel of the Dharma does not turn well this is not the way for the senior master to teach the religion to the practitioners If the three forms of karma are not well regulated and if the four manners of conduct ie walking standing sitting and lying down are not respectfully accomplished this is not the way for the primary seat ofcial to provide model leadership for the practitioners If the practitioners feel no peace nor any sense of security and if those who are demoralized do not leave this is not the way for the director of practitioners affairs to please practitioners If the food lacks the six kinds of tastes ie sweet hot salty bitter sour and mild and if it is not served with the three qualities ie plain clean and consistent this is not the way for the kitchen ofcial to prepare food for the practitioners If the buildings and quarters are not well maintained and if there is a lack of various kinds of household items this is not the way for the maintenance ofcial to provide the practitioners with secure accommodation If the guest reception ofcial disdains the poor favors the rich and entertains the laity while slighting his fellow practitioners this is not the way for the guest reception ofcial to assist the practitioners If decorum and respectful appearance are absent and if the order of high and low is  this is not the way for the abbots assistant to help the practitioners communicate  If the inrmary hall master does not learn how to care for and serve and if he disturbs the sick this is not the way for the inrmary master to the practitioners If sufcient hot water is not available and if hot and cold water is not supplied in good balance this is not the way for the bath hall master and the water supply chief to help the practitioners cleanse their bodies If the alms campaign leader and the fundraising master are not publicminded toward donations or have not done their best to secure funds this is not the way for them to serve the practitioners The Practitioners Failure to Follow the Normative Principles If the practitioners slight the senior master the abbot of the monastery ignore the Dharma and follow their own natural inclinations in various circumstances this is not the way for them to discharge their indebtedness to the abbot If the practitioners covet fancy meals and humble dishes this is not the way for them to discharge their indebtedness to the kitchen ofcial If the practitioners misuse writing brushes and inkslabs and show off their writing talent this is not the way for them to discharge their indebtedness to the secretarial ofcial If the practitioners hoard things and if  this is not the way for them to discharge their indebtedness to the master of the quarters If the practitioners anger easily and are difcult to please and if they do not follow the for their illness this is not the way for them to discharge their indebtedness to the inrmary hall master If the practitioners to warm themselves and refuse others the opportunity to do so this is not the way for them to discharge their indebtedness to the charcoal supply chief and the replace chief The Prime Importance of the Practitioners In general no matter how fast one may run about like a whirlwind thousands of times there are always some cases in which it is just never enough It is hoped that whoever is reared in the lions den will become a lion and whatever grows under a forest of sandalwood trees may become another member of that forest Five hundred years from now  let there be seen another grand gathering like that once held on Vulture Peak  The practitioners are the eld of merit in which laypeople nd fortune by cultivating and must be the object of peoples respect When the practitioners are well respected the Dharma is also well respected but when they are slighted the Dharma is also slighted There is no exception in the law of cause and effect from which no one can escape The Way and Principles of Practitioners Practitioners are the sons of the Buddha and no different from the saintly being the Arhat  hence they are worthy of reverence from heavenly as well as human beings The morning rice gruel and the noon meal of rice must be prepared to meet all dietary needs The four kinds of alms and requisites ie food and drink clothing bedding and medicine must always be provided without a shortage ever occurring From the time of ākyamuni after two thousand years the inherited shade still covers all his descendants Of the worldilluminating light emitted from his forehead not even a portion of its merit is ever exhausted despite all of our usages You must simply learn how to serve your fellow practitioners and not worry about poverty There is no difference between holiness and worldliness in the status of a Buddhist practitioner which is universally accepted in all regions It is true that this world is made up of all kinds of divisions and yet how could it be right to discriminate against practitioners from different regions or treat them with disdain on account of such differences The transient quarters are supposed to receive guest practitioners and be open to any traveling practitioner for three days Serve them with due propriety If one can transcend the mind of limitedness there will be no limit to the reward of merit Within the Zen school the high and low harmonize their minds and try to put aside mutual deciencies if any One must not expose family scandals Even though their exposure may not harm anyone such conduct reduces peoples trust and respect in the end Such an action is comparable to parasitic worms infesting the body of a lion and consuming its esh from within Indeed neither nonhuman devils nor nonBuddhists could accomplish such destructiveness If one wishes to prevent the decline of the path to hold up the Buddhist sun for a long time to increase the majestic luster of the tradition left to us by the patriarchs and to assist the sacred tasks of the imperial court one must make the foregoing rules of conduct ones normative principles The Prayer for Ailing Practitioners Should a practitioner become ill those from the same native province and his religious colleagues gather at his bedside set up incense candles and a Buddha image and conduct a prayer of veneration for the Buddha with the following invocation When water becomes transparent there appears the autumnal moon When an earnest prayer is applied the meritorious eld of fortune manifests itself Indeed the true foundation of our refuge is the Buddha and his enlightenment This morning we have gathered for the sake of Venerable Bhikṣu Soandso To clear up the wrongs he has suffered through many past lives And repent for the transgressions accumulated through innumerable transmigrations Devoting our utmost sincerity to this end we now request the holy assembly To venerate the buddhas by calling the sacred names and thereby accomplish a thorough purication The Luminous Pure Dharma Body Vairocana Buddha and so on We earnestly wish that the primordial mind may be puried That the four material principles may become light and easy Extending natural life as well as wisdom That the physical body may become as rm as that of the Dharma body Veneration to the buddhas in the ten directions and the three times and so on If the illness is very serious a prayer directed toward Amitābha Buddha should be recited ten times The Buddha Amitābha shines in golden luster The sublimity of his features is beyond comparison The white ūrṇa curly hair sweetly rolling appears on his forehead like Mount Sumeru His blue eyes are transparent and clear like the four surrounding great oceans In the illumination shed from his ūrṇa appear immeasurable myriads of buddhas And innumerable bodhisattvas also appear within this illumination everywhere This morning we have gathered for the sake of Venerable Bhikṣu Soandso To clear up the wrongs he has suffered through many past lives And to repent the transgressions accumulated through innumerable transmigrations Devoting our utmost sincerity to this end we now request the holy assembly To venerate the buddhas by calling the sacred names and thereby accomplish a thorough purication May the honorable assembly call the name of Amitābha one hundred times The names of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara and Bodhisattva Mahāsthāma each ten times As well as the innumerable bodhisattvas abiding in the great ocean of purity If however it is unavoidable for him to come to the end of his life may he swiftly realize the goal of rebirth in the Pure Land Veneration to the buddhas in the ten directions and the three times While chanting this prayer and the sacred names practitioners must maintain their minds in purity and refrain from becoming entangled in worldly thoughts The Words of the Will Venerable Soandso native of suchandsuch province became a Zen practitioner by receiving the ordination certicate in suchandsuch year at suchandsuch place Day month and year Orally conveyed by Practitioner Soandso who is ailing  X The attendant of the practice hall ofce reports the to the primary seat ofcial the training and administrative ofcials and the abbots assistant Along with the practitioner in charge of public proceedings the practitioner who attended the ill person collects the contents of the sutra cabinet  the storage box located in the practice hall and all personal possessions and prepares a record of them numbering and sealing each item This procedure must be handled jointly by the inrmary hall master and the practitioner who attended the deceased Even when the deceased has no bamboo case for his personal possessions an equally dedicated funeral rite should be conducted for him In the case that an administrative retiree who resided in the private quarters left behind many bamboo cases after his death the deceaseds possessions once sealed off may be placed in that particular quarters but must be guarded by a practitioner assigned by the treasury ofce Unless the recently deceased practitioner had previously informed the abbot the dual order ofcials or the retirees about the manner in which he wished his possessions to be distributed or unless he left a written will in regard to the matter no one can arbitrarily distribute his possessions to anyone or any place Zen Master Dachuan while residing at Jingcisi discovered that the primary seat ofcial and the director of practitioners affairs had made forgeries concerning certain items that were entrusted by a deceased practitioner and hence subsequently expelled them When an ailing practitioner closes his eyes  the inrmary hall master at once noties the director of practitioners affairs and requests the attendants of his ofce to prepare hot water Bathing the body they shave the head cleanly The cloth used for drying the bathed corpse is to be distributed to those who bathed it and the handkerchief used for shaving is to be given to the person who shaved the head The Enlightened Spirit of Venerable Soandso Having Newly Entered Perfect Quiescence If the deceased is the distinguished west hall ofcial it may be written as The Spirit of the Previous Abbot of Suchandsuch Temple Soandso Title Zen Master Soandso In other cases the title is given according to the ofce held by the deceased a Offering incense candles and various food provisions the sacred assembly of practitioners chant the Mahākaruṇādhāraṇī before the shrine and thereby settle the deceased spirit through the invocation of merit transference During the night the candles are kept lit all night The practice hall attendants prepare beforehand articial funeral owers made of white paper while the attendant of the deceased offers morning gruel and a noon meal every day The administrative ofcial serves tea and sweet hot water three times a day and burns incense As the practice hall ofce attendant rings his hand bell and walks ahead the primary seat ofcial leads the practitioners before the funeral shrine This same rite is to be conducted three times a day If the occasion coincides with the rst day of the month or midmonth days or with the imperial coronation day the public conduct of the rite is excused and the funeral proceeding must also be postponed Requesting Buddhist Funeral Rites Without fail the abbot must be requested to conduct the rite of applying re  On a small white sheet of paper the document must be written as follows The funeral rite of applying re is to be ofciated by the venerable master abbot of this temple as respectfully requested by the practice hall ofcial Bhikṣu Soandso The other funeral rites will be ofciated as acknowledged in this note If the deceased is the west hall guest ofcial or a retired administrative ofcial who resided in the individual quarters and left sizable personal possessions the following additional rites may be conducted serving tea and sweet hot water  turning around the portable shrine  turning around the remains  and so on Since Venerable Soandso entered ultimate quiescence the rite of cremation has been scheduled on suchandsuch date for which I respectfully request the venerable to conduct the rite of touching re The director of practitioners affairs then presents the note of request before withdrawing The director prepares a record book of the funeral rites as a reference to be consulted before making new requests of ritual conduct on the basis of the rotation system While the primary seat ofcial settles the price of each item adjusting the price when necessary the guest reception ofcial and the assistant ofcial write the names of the items on the board and list the prices below each item in accordance with  If there are numerous possessions the prices of items may be reduced as a whole so as to benet more practitioners and thereby advance the fortune of the departed Prayer Chanting the Night Before the Cremation The afternoon of the day before the funeral procession for the cremation is scheduled the attendant of the practice hall ofce must directly report to the abbot and the dual order ofcials about the schedule and notify the practitioners by posting the signboard indicating prayer chanting The treasury ofce must also be requested beforehand to prepare a food offering and send workmen to set up the area for the funeral rite Those practitioners from the same province as well as those related in Dharma lineage compose a word of tribute for the occasion and pay the treasury ofce for a food offering Three pieces of incense must be prepared for the funeral offering After the cancelation of the evening session has been announced the practice hall bell is rung to assemble the practitioners for the rite of prayer chanting before the funeral shrine The administrative ofcial burns incense and offers tea and sweet hot water to the shrine beforehand The abbot burns incense upon arrival and takes his place at the higher main position of the east order The designated ofcial steps forward from his order to burn incense and upon returning bows Next he bows before the abbot and turning toward the east order ofcials bows and makes a round passing in front of each of the east order ofcials down to the last one then bows  Making a round he passes in front of each of the west order ofcials down to the last one and if he is an incumbent ofcial passes through his vacated position proceeds to the right of the funeral shrine and stands there The attendant of the practice hall ofce carries a chain on a crepewrapped board to the ofcial and after completing the rite of closing the door places the chain over the doors of the shrine We earnestly reect that life and death alternate just as hot and cold change one after another When it comes it is as swift as the lightning  that strikes across the entire sky and when it departs is like the waves that cease to exist over the entire ocean On this day Venerable Soandso who has just entered ultimate quiescence totally exhausted the causes of life and abruptly departed from a lifelong dream understanding that every psychophysical element is transitory and ultimately quiescent and hence felicitous The venerable practitioners have assembled at this place to pay tribute to the shrine and call the sacred names of the buddhas so as to help the deceaseds spirit advance swiftly toward the Pure Land With this prayer and sutra chanting we dedicate the merit thereby accrued to the venerable practitioner Soandso who has just entered ultimate quiescence We humbly wish that his spirit surpasses the pure sanctuary that his karmas be free of worldly delement that the lotus bloom opens its noblest blossom and that the Buddha grant him the certicate of supreme destiny I humbly request the practitioners once again to intone the prayer Veneration to the buddhas in the ten directions and the three times and so on With this chanting we dedicate the merit thereby accrued to the venerable practitioner Soandso who has just entered ultimate quiescence When this is done the abbot returns to his position at the higher end of the east order line and remains standing there The Funeral Procession the procession to the funeral site begins it is a general rule that the treasury ofcial instructs the attendants in charge of the workmen to prepare rewood for the cremation and mobilize various workmen After all preparations for the funeral procession have been completed including musical instruments such as cymbals and drums streamers articial owers to scatter incense and candles a portable shrine carriage and so on the night before the practice hall ofce attendant reports that everything is ready to the abbot and the dual order ofcials and also posts a signboard indicating the schedule for the funeral procession The next morning after the is struck with the mallet to signal that the rst serving of rice gruel has been completed the director of practitioners affairs makes an additional strike and announces After breakfast you are requested to participate in the procession to accompany the deceased to the cremation site Except for those who are on duty at the practitioners quarters and in charge of guarding the practice hall everyone is equally required to participate Straightening his posture by the boardedge of the primary seat ofcial he proceeds to make a round through the aisles of the hall up to the outer hall and once again returns to the inner hall to bow toward the altar before going out May I request the primary seat ofcial and all practitioners to attend the service of sutra chanting at the inrmary hall scheduled to begin at the sound of the bell At the sound of the practice hall bell the practitioners assemble and the director of practitioners affairs intones a prayer We are about to raise the shrine of the departed spirit and proceed to the place where the memorable rite of cremation will take place Veneration to the Luminous Pure Dharma Body Vairocana Buddha and so on When this is done the attendants play cymbals lift the shrine and carry it out to the temple gate If the rites of serving tea and sweet hot water and turning the shrine around are scheduled the shrine at this point should be turned around toward the temple buildings and an incense table placed before it The primary seat ofcial stands before the shrine while the practitioners line up in two parallel lines with the shrine at the center The attendants stand outside the gate greeting the practitioners with heads down and palms together and then fall in behind the procession when all have passed by Cremation When the procession reaches the nirvana platform  the head administrative ofcial burns incense and offers tea Next the abbot offers incense then returns to his position Thus the body is about to be cremated according to the tradition It is wished that by burning the body which was instrumental to his propagation of the Dharma for a hundred years his passage to reach the goal of nirvana will be helped unfailingly Veneration to the Western Paradise to Amitābha Buddha of Great Compassion and Commiseration and so on after ten repetitions of the prayer In the foregoing prayer we called upon the ten sacred names in order to help the deceased be reborn in the Pure Land We earnestly hope that the wisdom mirror distributes its brilliance the wind of truth disperses variegated colors and the ower of the enlightened mind will bloom in the bodhi garden and help the mind become cleansed of delement in the ocean of the Dharmanature Having offered three servings of tea and having burned incense over a single burner we shall send its smoke on a cloudjourney The head administrative ofcial at the moment when the prayer refers to servings of tea and burning of incense steps forward to serve tea and burn incense whereby he expresses the propriety of the temple community as a whole Veneration to the buddhas in the ten directions and the three times The practitioners from the same native province and Dharma lineage also chant sutras and conclude with the same invocation of merit transference A signboard indicating this event is posted to notify the practitioners The abbot and the primary seat ofcial are seated side by side with an armlengths distance in between in the rear while the dual order ofcials are seated in two parallel lines facing each other Just inside the hallway a table is placed facing the rear of the hall equipped with calligraphy brushes an inkslab a standing bell scissors and a simplied robe as well as other necessary items directly on the oor The practice hall ofce attendants report to the abbot the dual order ofcials and the practitioner assistants when these preparations have been completed They place the bamboo basket before the abbot and the dual order ofcials in turn so that each may inspect the seal They then receive the key from the primary seat ofcial open the basket take out the items one by one in numerical order place them on the oor display area and set the empty basket to the side facing the rear The oating cloud has dispersed and there remains no sight of it whatsoever The last remnant of a candle has been exhausted in extinguishing its own ame May the practitioners now intone the ten sacred names of the buddhas for the sake of the venerable practitioner Soandso and assist his enlightened spirit to be reborn in the Pure Land Veneration to the Luminous Pure Dharma Body Vairocana Buddha and so on After the prayer of the ten sacred names the director of practitioners affairs once again rings the bell and says Everyone is obliged to examine the items with regard to their being old or new long or short and so on for after the sound of the bell ceases no dispute is allowed Respectfully stated The director of practitioners affairs once again rings the bell then holds up the deceaseds ordination certicate and cuts it horizontally across the name characters with the scissors saying The director of practitioners affairs takes off his kaṣāya robe and places it inside the bell and dons the simplied robe The attendants of the practice hall inform all the participants of the price by relaying the announcement The attendant of the practice hall ofce determines the name of the person who has made the winning bid The guest reception ofcial copies the name down and places it on the bulletin board and the abbots assistant referring to the name issues a card and has the attendant in charge of meal proceedings give it to the person The attendant then puts the item back into the basket The merit hereby accrued from this auction and prayer is dedicated for the sake of the venerable practitioner Soandso who has just entered ultimate quiescence toward the enshrinement of the transcendental abode of his realization May I once again request the practitioners to intone the prayer Veneration to the buddhas in the ten directions and the three times and so on Items that are not picked up by the bidders within a threeday period are priced appropriately for subsequent sale and a record book the Funeral Revenue and Expenditure Account Book  must be prepared According to the Buddhas own regulations the meaning of distributing the robes is to create in the mind of the living the following thought It has become like this with him and it will be like this with me as well Such a thought is expected to reduce ones desire and attachment This is the height of stupidity must be deleted from the name tablet Sutra chanting should be performed three times a day On the afternoon of the third day the account book is to be displayed in front of the practice hall making everything accountable to the practitioners If the formula used differs from the standard format or if there is some point in question it should be pardoned with due propriety and notice given above as well as below and rectied on the strict basis of fact Anyone who committed a transgression should be subject to the punishment of expulsion The practice hall ofce noties the practitioners beforehand and posts a signboard indicating the rite of sending the ashes to the tower Escorting the ashes from the inrmary hall to the memorial tower they conduct the rite of depositing the ashes in the tower After depositing the ashes the administrative ofcial seals the tower The merit hereby accrued is intended for the sake of Venerable Soandso who entered ultimate quiescence and on depositing his ashes in the tower to enshrine the transcendental abode of his realization The guest reception ofcial calls for chanting the ūraṃgamadhāraṇīs and practitioners from the same province also conduct a service of chanting The funeral shrine For the abbots attendant to convey the masters commands and carry his incense case For three monetary gifts for the foregoing events An expenditure of twenty guanwen for the inspection and sanction by the abbot and the dual order ofcials of the contents of auction of which the cost of two is received by the abbots ofce An expenditure of four hundred and fortyfour guan and ve hundred wen for the service of sutra chanting by the practitioners of which Guanyin Bodhisattva the guardian bodhisattva  and the abbot each receive the amount of two guanwen approximately four hundred regular practitioners each receive one guanwen the practice hall attendants who participate in the chanting the practitionersinabsentia and the recent arrivals together numbering seventyve each receive one half ve hundred wen Prepared by Soandso attendant The practice hall ofce Assistant of the guardian bodhisattva Soandso Guest reception ofcial Soandso The maintenance ofcial The kitchen hall ofcial The treasury ofcial The director of practitioners affairs The treasury ofcial The administrative ofcial The head administrative ofcial The Buddha hall master The bath hall master The Tripiṭaka hall master The Tripiṭaka hall master The secretarial ofcial The rear practice hall ofcial The primary seat ofcial Signed by all dual order ofcials The abbot signed The institution of the wooden board account record perhaps derived from the custom of earlier times to record whatever information was necessary for accomplishing ritual conduct on a wooden board whereby it was shown that no arbitrary changes were allowed This has become the practice of preparing a wooden board accounting record on the death of a practitioner of the Zen monastic community At the auction such possessions are assigned a monetary value necessarily requiring a record of reference inscribed on a wooden board Other than the amount expended for an event the remaining money must be divided into three parts and seven parts with the former amount of threetenths given to the temples general fund as overhead  For example in the case of one hundred guanwen thirty guanwen would be turned over to the temples revenues In the case of there being less than a hundred guan no threetenths overhead should be considered The remaining amount must be equally distributed to the practitioners If remuneration for the practitioners service of chanting sutras is one hundred wen one guan must be due for conducting a religious rite and twice that amount is due to the abbot If a recently deceased retiree ofcial left behind personal possessions such as a rice eld rice crops cottages bedding furniture and so on all these must be turned over to the temple The Practitioners of the Zen Community The Annual Celebration Days and Calendar I In the western regions ie the Central Asian Buddhist countries including India there are three seasons one of which is established as the period of retreat during which no one may leave or come to the monastery The system of order is based on seniority determined by whether ones learning of the Zen texts by heart  practice of crosslegged seated meditation and year of ordination earlier or later than anothers For the duration of ninety days  practitioners in order to achieve some denite degree of merit in the practice of the path In the thirty days prior to the retreat period each acquires the basic needs of life  enabling them to develop Zen insight internally and nurture their physical wellbeing externally so that they can sustain peace of mind and body through the subsequent period of concentration The ve regions of the Indian continent are so vast that the weather in these regions varies between hot cold rainy and dry and is never the same everywhere Thus the period of retreat begins in the fourth month in some provinces in the fth month in others and even in the twelfth month elsewhere b although it always begins on the sixteenth day of the month It is sometimes called the summer retreat and at other times the winter retreat  and it was on the basis of this retreat that the meaning of ordination age began to be used to refer to the years of a practitioners career It is however a kind of baseless vulgar saying that the expression soandso many years of winter retreat originally referring to the determination of a practitioners career in reference to his ordination age was distorted to mean that examining the quality of a waxmade statue buried in the ice is to verify the impeccability of a persons practice in terms of clean ice and that burying a waxmade human form in the ground is the way to examine whether his practice has accomplished the goal or not How could such distorted ideas have come from our traditional transmission Moreover what is practiced and experienced in our tradition cannot be fathomed even by a holy man such as Laozi How much less could such an external object be a measurement of the state of religious transcendence or immanence Today in the Zen monastic institution the inauguration of the summer retreat is set for the midmonth day of the fourth lunar month and it ends on the midmonth day of the seventh lunar month If the retreat is set to begin one day earlier by performing a special ceremony every retreat participant is enabled to fully concentrate on their intent the fulllment of their practice within the retreat period this is not in accordance with the Vinaya but they do not realize or understand the intended meaning of the rule hidden outside it In China winter begins at the beginning of the year and is regarded as being the start of the four seasons It is important to coordinate the seasonal proprieties with those of secular society Since it is the best method of conversion to follow such expediency the beginning and end of the summer retreat the winter solstice and the new year have been institutionalized as the four major festival days in Zen monastic communities Their ceremonial proprieties are well ordered how glorious it is to regard them The practice hall ofce copies the number of practitioners from the residents Ordination Record Book and instructs an attendant to present this to the primary seat ofcial then to the abbot and the dual order ofcials  posts it in front of the practice hall and sets up a table below it equipped with an inkslab and brushes For approximately three days after the noon meal practitioners are advised to check the residency chart draft and correct any mistakes or wrong information about themselves Therefore in order to prepare the residency chart  a draft is rst made and each member must examine whether his name and rank appear in it in the proper order of seniority If in effect some do derogate others names and transgress the norms of the precepts it is obvious that the director of practitioners affairs must deal with them by informing the primary seat ofcial about the matter in detail and also by reporting it to the abbot Format of the Residency Chart Draft The ordination rank is to be written in red ink while the name is to be written in black ink The Ordination Ages of Practitioners Name and Title Ordination Year of Regnal Era The Original Ordination The Immemorial Past The Venerable Eldest Senior Practitioner jñātakauṇḍinya Ordination The Venerable Master Abbot Soandso Senior Practitioner Ordination Suchandsuch Year of the Zhiyuan Era Soandso Senior Practitioner Ordination Suchandsuch Year of the Yuanzhen Era Soandso Senior Practitioner Ordination Suchandsuch Year of the Dade Era Soandso Senior Practitioner Ordination Suchandsuch Year of the Zhida Era The foregoing chart is prepared as presented to  It is feared that there might be some errors should there be any each of the venerable practitioners is advised to correct them The Serving of Tea by the New Residents on Joining the Practitioners Quarters After establishing membership in the practitioners quarters based on the preceding examples the new residents donate funds to the quarters for the cost of a tea reception The signboard reads as follows They line up beforehand to the right of the quarters entrance and wait for the practitioners to leave the practice hall Those who are serving tea stand in line and after giving greetings request the practitioners to take their seats No more than nine practitioners should offer incense Three practitioners step forward to offer incense and then step back and turn around mutually coordinating their movements in a precise and smooth manner This is called offering incense on behalf of the practitioners The small wooden sounding block in the hall is struck twice to signal that the serving of tea has been extended to every member in the hall This is called the commendation to drink tea  When the wooden sounding block is struck once the teabowls are retrieved and the practitioners all rise from their seats The head ofcial of the quarters steps forward to the incense burner and on behalf of all the practitioners thanks the practitioners who served the tea

altar of the Buddha hall the abbot burns incense offers tea and sweet hot water to the Buddha and takes his place midhall This same propriety is performed in the ceremonial proceeding for the prayer of imperial longevity and the commemoration of the Buddhas birthday On the other hand the ūraṃgamadhāraṇīs prayer service is essentially meant to be a prayer on the part of the practitioners for the successful completion of the summer retreat He initiates the prayer service by intoning the esoteric verses and upon completion utters the phrase Mohe  with which the practitioners again accord in unison The merit accrued from chanting the sutra is dedicated to the goal of absolute truth and absolute reality bhūtakoṭi shiji and also thereby to enshrine the state of supreme enlightenment that

large bell should not be sounded however the practice hall bell and the Buddha hall bell should be tolled every day in any case On the thirteenth day of the seventh lunar month the ceremonial fulllment of the ūraṃgamadhāraṇīs prayer service should be conducted  The Universal Invocation of Merit Transference The foregoing chanting of the sacred ūraṃgamadhāraṇīs has been intoned by the sacred assembly of bhikṣus The merit thereby accrued is dedicated to the deva and nāga guardians of the Dharma to the local earth spirits and the gods of the temple building the creators of things May those suffering in the three worlds of existence and of the eight kinds of diffculties be freed May the four kinds of benefactors and the three worlds of existence be fully rewarded The Word of Tribute for the Inauguration of the ūraṃgamadhāraṇīs Prayer Service Because iron is the essence of tempering and grinding its edge can never become dull and because the mirror borrows the luster of a wellpolished gem its reection can never become darkened Therefore our preceding sages manifested their capacities sometimes suppressing and other times enhancing such qualities in order to shatter even the tiniest speck of delusion for the sake of sentient beings The episode of Mātaṅgī and nanda tells how marvelously an illicit magical power was intimidated and ākyamuni and Mañjuśrī especially revealed the esoteric means of conversion From analytical study of the forms of teaching and the method of introspection taught by the Buddha throughout his lifetime career one may nd the doctrines and practices and yet from the point of view of the esoteric revelation of practice and realization there is neither realization distinct from practice nor is there practice separate from realization It reveals the absolute insight and terminates multiple illusions  An empty ower has no stem Abiding in right concentration one restrains every inner movement Still water creates no waves In reecting upon the descendants it may be asked Chanting the words left by our predecessors we admonish ourselves May we earnestly wish to reduce myriads of kalpas as many as the sands of the Ganges River into a single moment of thought for there is no distance between now and then May we also wish to identify all the lands of the ten directions as a single abode of existence so that all may universally attain supreme enlightenment At the great assembly of the disciples where all in stern dignity gathered at Vulture Peak the grand universe of three thousand great universes was embraced within a speck of dust and the three different dimensions of time dissolved into a single moment of thought Irrespective of whether one is mundane or transmundane each individuals wondrous enlightenment reecting each moment of great illumination manifests myriads and myriads of bodies and surpasses all the ftyseven stages of realization The use of a nger is meant to exemplify the truth that it is not the nger  and thus this nger also ceases to be simultaneously with its being that which it points to While it resembles emptiness and contains it within it is yet juxtaposed with emptiness and thus emptiness are reciprocal Since there has been no obstacle throughout the period of the retreat may we earnestly hope that our practice of concentration and insight prevails over the gates of all senses and intellect and that the transcendent faculty arises as often as it may within phenomenal faculties and thereby lead them equally to enter into the ultimate state of the śūraṃgama samādhi The Tablet of Ordination Ages Ofcials of the practice hall ofce the assistant ofce and the practitioners quarters get together beforehand to draw up the tablet of ordination ages by copying  In the afternoon of the fourteenth day these tablets must be placed in the higherranking section of the outer practice hall in the lowerranking section of the Dharma hall and in the practitioners quarters Each ofce sets up a table equipped with an incense burner and candle stands as well as various alms offerings The Minor Propriety of Serving Sweet Hot Water at the Abbots Ofce At the occasions of the four annual celebration days according to ancient custom traditionally three kinds of reception are held at the abbots ofce for serving hot sweet water The rst reception prescribes the dual division seating arrangement  This reception is held for the east and west hall highranking ofcials with the primary seat ofcial as a participant The second reception consists of the quadruple division seating arrangement   the training ofcials are to take their seats at the rst section in the abbots reception hall  the administrative ofcials take their seats at the second section   the retired west order ofcials are seated at the third section   the retired east order ofcials are seated at the fourth section  The ofce of assistant ofcials prepares a draft chart beforehand for each occasion and presents it to the abbot before establishing the nal seating arrangements In the afternoon three crepewrapped tables are placed in a line in the reception hall  and the three formal seat arrangements drawn up as No  are displayed in the lower section of the reception hall The abbot requests the venerables presence at a special serving of sweet hot water this evening at the reception hall sir For those other training ofcials and subfunctionaries as well as some renowned practitioners the attendant of the guest reception master at the abbots ofce is sent to invite them respectively with the following words The abbot wishes the venerable to be present at a special reception for serving sweet hot water to be held at the reception hall before the evening session sir Curtains are hung in the

designated by the seating tablets and remain standing Both the incense offering assistant and the guest reception assistant dividing the two areas of serving proceed to stand before each of the guests greet each one with a bow and after requesting them to take their seats return to their places The incense offering assistant steps forward to offer incense and upon returning to his place once again he and the guest reception assistant go around to each of the guests to bow and burn incense on their behalf Thereupon the abbots ofce wooden sounding block is struck twice to signal the completion of the serving of sweet hot water Next the incense offering assistant steps forward to burn incense on behalf of the participant With the signal of a strike on the wooden sounding block the cups are retrieved and at the signal of ve drumbeats the guests are obliged to leave The proprieties of the three types of reception are identical The proprieties of the serving of tea and sweet hot water were the major and most common tradition in Zen monastic temples But because disruptive quarrels concerning whether the seats are too high or too low and so on frequently occurred among guests in recent years has mostly been abandoned This propriety is said to be regarded as a practice that should be widely encouraged in the future Prayers Given at the Shrine of the Local Spirits on the Four Annual Celebration Days In general on the afternoon of the day before annual celebration days various alms offerings are solemnly set out at the shrine of the local spirits and incense candles a table incense burner and water jar are arranged there The practice hall ofce attendants post a wooden tablet announcing the scheduled prayer chanting to notify the practitioners The manner of striking the wooden sounding blocks located throughout the corridors of the temple is identical with that of the three monthly days ending in eight  The abbot rst visits the patriarchal shrine hall and then the Buddha hall to burn incense and perform three prostrations at which time the kitchen hall metal gong is sounded three times and the large bell is tolled When the abbot arrives he offers incense and returns to his place He leads the prayer chanting and concludes with the appropriate invocation of merit transference  We humbly pray for their protection so that the present retreat may be fullled without interruption As this day begins the fulllment of another year of Buddhist ordination we rejoice that there has been no problem throughout the ninetyday period and peace and ease have prevailed with us As this is the day when the sun begins its return course it is the beginning of the birth of ten thousand classes of beings Veneration to the buddhas of the ten directions and the three periods and so on The Administrative Ofces Special Serving Serving of Sweet Hot Water for the Primary and the Practitioners on the Four Annual Celebration Days When the prayer chanting has concluded a

perfect did the discipline of interpersonal propriety and of musical harmony become necessary Even a peasants spontaneous singing accompanied by rhythmic striking of the ground is better than the most skilled performance of musical instruments and better also is the taste of a wine fermented in a simple cask than those of wine products fermented in ve different stages The founding father of our religion in India initially revealed such spontaneous conversion in which insofar as it is concerned with the wondrous enlightenment originally within each person there is no difference whether one is saintly or worldly Since actual things that are equally real rather have purity and delement the insight of nondifference does not depend on the depth or shallowness of an individuals practice and realization nor does it refer to effcacy and usage And yet those who have no insight are dazed and stupeed like someone who is deaf and dumb His teaching became the literature of the three baskets  and his practice was meditation and concentration dhyāna and samādhi His career promoting the method of conversion continued for fortynine years before his parinirvāṇa The Sanskrit term ghaṇṭā means a bell whether made of clay wood copper or iron that when struck creates a sounda metallic bell a stone bell a cymbal a drum a wooden post and mallet a wooden sounding block or a conch shell If great concentration is always maintained and if transcendent function always remains quiescent while hearing one does not hear and while being aware one has no awareness Thinking thus one strikes a sound object and the mysterious wind should suddenly arise ie spontaneous transformation Is this not the veritable capital city of purity and peace The Large Bell The large bell has its origin in assisting commands in monastic temples When tolled in the early morning it breaks the long night and warns those who linger in sleep When tolled in the evening it creates awareness of dark ignorance and reveals the state of delusion It is better to draw its wooden striker leisurely rather than hurriedly because the longer the sound lasts the more desirable it is When tolled there should be three cycles each consisting of thirtysix tolls altogether making one hundred and eight May the sound of this bell reach beyond the Dharma world so that it may be heard by all those who suffer imprisoned in gloomy darkness May their hearing and the sound be puried and may they realize total comprehension May all sentient beings thus realize perfect enlightenment After chanting this he should call the name of Guanyin Bodhisattva  If he calls the name before each time he tolls the bell the benet will be very great The Practice Hall Bell Whenever the practitioners are to assemble  the practice hall bell is tolled This bell is tolled seven times to signal the abbots entrance into the practice hall to meet with practitioners The practice hall ofcial is in charge of this The bell is tolled seven times to call the practitioners to assemble at the Buddha hall but the tolling of this bell must be coordinated with the tolling of the practice hall bell without fail The hall master is in charge of this matter At sunrise many buddhas manifested themselves along with it and esoterically exhorted and revealed the twelve categories of sutras Whenever a bell is tolled all evil paths and all suffering ceased to be Again in the Chronicle of Jinling written in the Yuan period  it is said that there was a man who died a sudden violent death and went down to the place of the underworld ruler This man told him that he was formerly the ruler of the Southern Tang but because Song Jiqiu mistakenly killed those of Hezhou who had surrendered this suffering had been imposed upon him When he listened to the sound of bells his suffering ceased temporarily The man thus instructed returned to this world and reported the matter to the ruler This is presented to the eminent ancestor ruler Emperor Xiaogao so as to help him be liberated from darkness and suffering  The Large Metal Gong The large metal gong is struck for three long rounds on two occasions during the day as part of the breakfast and noon meal proceedings After the shshaped wooden gong is sounded the metal gong is struck three times to signal the beginning of the meal and then struck continuously in diminishing intervals This is called the long metal gong  On occasions of prayer chanting and the ūraṃgamadhāraṇī prayer session the metal gong should be sounded three times for each occasion to warn against re and candle ames The Small Blocks The abbots ofce the administrative ofce the quarters of the primary seat ofcial and the other quarters each keep their own small wooden sounding blocks  and at the time of the release from silence in the early morning all these blocks are struck simultaneously for one long round The practitioners quarters have small wooden sounding blocks in both the inner and outer areas The wooden sounding block located outside should be struck three times at the time of the practitioners greeting each day and at the time of regular zazen practice as well as zazen practice prior to the evening session It is also sounded before the practitioners return to their quarters On the occasions of servings of tea and sweet hot water the small wooden sounding blocks are also struck for a long round  The block located inside the quarters is struck three times on the occasion of the establishment of residency two times when cups are delivered to the hall for tea or sweet hot water once when the cups are retrieved and three times when the practitioners leave the practice hall In case of the minor propriety of serving sweet hot water it is sounded for one longer round The Fishshaped Wooden Gong On the occasions of breakfast and the noon meal the shshaped wooden gong is struck for two long rounds with diminishing intervals Tradition holds that the sh is always awake day and night and therefore carving a sh form out of wood and striking it every day is intended to warn against human ignorance and indolence The assistant of the the guardian bodhisattva signals the practitioners to leave the practice hall by making a single sound  We have clearly understood the Dharma of the Dharma King That Dharma of the Dharma King is indeed like this ākyamuni Buddha then descended the rostrum seat The small hand bell is always carried by the practice hall ofce attendant and is used to punctuate the beginning and ending of chanting or intoning by the practitioners For the ascent to the Dharma hall the drum should be sounded for three consecutive rounds First three light beats are made to signal the beginning next with a stick in each hand beat the drum so as to gradually shorten the intervals between strikes reciprocating heavy and light beats so that the sound is harmoniously lengthened arising and receding repeatedly tremulous and reverberant like the resounding of spring thunder The rst round consists of striking with a long interval and lengthened reverberation the second round is begun with a short and halting stroke a little faster but with a level continuity in its sounding the third round is a somewhat mufed sounding throughout and ends at the b moment the abbot ascends the rostrum seat The end signal is three beats made with both sticks simultaneously One round of drumbeats signals the supplementary session a series of ve beats signals the general exhortation and three beats signals the practioners visit for individual instruction these drumrolls are done with somewhat longer intervals between strikes The tea reception is signaled by a long round of drumming the assistant ofcial is in charge of this The noon meal is signaled by three rounds of drumbeats identical to the manner of announcing the abbots ascent to the Dharma hall but this can be shortened and abruptly ended  A long roll of drumbeats signals the mobilization of all members for a task of labor The drum signal for night watches is three equal beats in the early evening the number increasing according to the number of the hour The drum signal for bathing is communicated by four different rounds reecting the different groups of bathers and each round gradually culminates in accordance with the number of practitioners who have already bathed One should never let these methods of communication lapse It is said in the Sutra of Golden Splendor that Bodhisattva Ruciraketu dreamed of a golden drum during the night Its form was elegant and great and it emitted brightness in all directions like the sun Within this illumination he saw all the buddhas of the ten directions on seats of lapis lazuli under a tree bearing numerous jewels surrounded by hundreds of thousands of disciples listening to their preaching A man who looked like a brahman struck the drum with a piece of aspen wood and uttered in a loud voice some verses that conveyed the meaning of repentance When Bodhisattva Ruciraketu awakened from the dream he went to the Tathāgata and told of the golden drum and the verses of repentance of which he had dreamed Also in the ūraṃgamasūtra the Buddha is said to have asked nanda nanda moreover do you hear in this Jetavana Monastery the sound of the drum that conveys the time of meals and the sound of the bells that call the monks to assemble As the drums and bells resound from one preceding moment to another subsequent moment in continuity what do you understand with these sounds Do the sounds come to your ears or do your ears go to the origin of the sounds End of Chapter IX The Monastic Sound Instruments The Causes of His Birth b The Buddha was once staying at Bamboo Grove Monastery in Kalandakas garden near Rajagrha One day he rose early dressed himself in his robe and with a group of bhiksus  carried his alms bowl to the city of Rajagrha to collect alms At that moment a gatha was heard in the air The Buddhas body is like a golden mountain Walking with the gait of an elephant king So serene and dignified are his features His face resembles the full moon Surrounded by a group of bhiksus He is proceeding to the city When the Worldhonored One had just stepped on the threshold of the gate while he was entering the city there occurred various miraculous events the blind recovered their sight the deaf gained their hearing the dumb could speak and the paralyzed could walk those who were confined in prisons gained liberty and those who bore grudges and hatred became merciful calves were released spontaneously from their tethers and returned to their mothers all animalselephants horses cows and so ontrumpeted neighed and mooed aloud with great delight all birdsparrots mynas cuckoos peacocks and the likecaroled merrily in con cord all ornamentsrings bracelets hairpins earrings and all kinds of precious thingsclinked melodiously of themselves in their cases and all musical instruments sounded naturally At that moment the earth became clean of itself free of all sorts of filth debris rubble brambles and poisonous plants and it quaked in six wayswhen the east rose up the west sank down when the west rose up the east sank down when the south rose up the north sank down when the north rose up the south sank down when the center rose up the four sides sank down when the four sides rose up the center sank down and it all rolled round and round At that moment another stanza was heard from the air The whole earth depends On the four seas With the countries cities and mountains As its ornaments When the Worldhonored One trod on the earth It quaked in six ways Like a boat upon the seas Blown by a blast of wind i ic When the Buddha entered the city his divine powers caused all the people to dance with delight like water in the great sea agitated by the wind All the people uttered the following stanza Of all pleasures in this world None surpasses that of the Buddha entering the country When the earth quakes in six ways All rubble is removed without rem n a n t Those who are imperfect in sense organs Become perfect and complete All sorts of musical instruments Produce lovely songs by themselves The Causes of His Birth At that time the Worldhonored One walked to the main road where there were two children one of whom was the son of an agrakulika and the other the son of a kulika  These two children were playing on a heap of sand The first one was named Jaya and the second one Vijaya When the two of them saw the Buddha marked on his body with the thirtytwo characteristics the first child put a handful of sand as if it were cooked rice into the Buddhas alms bowl Endowed with great compassion by nature Is this person adorned with a round light Who is free from birth and death Now I remember him with one heart As I remember the Buddha in my mind I offer him this handful of sand When Jaya had offered the sand he made a vow saying May I become a cakravartin by the merit of this good root so that I can make extensive offerings to the Buddhadharma The Buddha knew his mind and saw that his right vow would give rise to a superior and wonderful fruit in a future life As the Buddha the Tathagata was the field of blessedness he accepted the sand with a mind of compassion With a smile he emitted rays of different colors blue yellow red and white either from the top of his head or from below his knees The rays issuing from below his knees radiated to the eight hells Those who were suffering in the cold hells felt warmth and those in the hot ones enjoyed coolness When the light shone upon their bodies they were freed from all pains and afflictions These beings had doubts in their minds Now we are free from suffering but shall we stay here or be born somewhere else At that moment the Worldhonored One wishing to arouse good thoughts in them produced a metamorphic figure and sent it to those beings Upon seeing the metamorphic figure they thought a in their minds Now we shall not be bom in other places but are simply liberated from suffering by the power o f this person But the figure made them understand that their retribution in the hells had been dissolved and that they would be bom  at the termination o f their existence in the hells in the world of men or in the heavens where they could realize right views The rays issuing from the top of the Buddhas head radiated to the Four Heavenly Kings and up to the highest Akanistha heaven In the rays the Buddha expounded the Dharma of suffering impermanence voidness and nonego and he also uttered the following stanza Be strenuous to become a homeless recluse To tally with the Buddhadharma Destroy the army of rebirth As an elephant shatters a dwelling house If a man practices the Buddhadharma Diligently and without indolence He will be free from birth and death And gain the cessation of all pain The Buddhas light was able to shine upon the whole great chiliocosm and then return to his body If the Buddha wished to recall past deeds the light would enter his back if he wished to predict future events it would enter his front if he wished to predict birth in the hells it would enter his feet if he wished to predict birth among animals it would enter his ankles if he wished to predict birth among the hungry ghosts it would enter his toes if he wished to predict birth among mankind it would enter his knees if he wished to predict the birth of an iron cakravartin king it would enter his left palm if he wished to predict the birth of a golden cakravartin king it would enter his right palm if he wished to predict birth in the heavens it would enter his navel if he wished to predict the enlightenment of a sravaka a direct disciple of the Buddha it would enter his mouth if he wished to predict the enlightenment of apratyekabuddha  it would enter the white curl between his eyebrows and if he The Causes of His Birth wished to predict the enlightenment of a bodhisattva a being destined for full Buddhahood it would enter the protuberance on his head Each time the light returned from the great chiliocosm it would first encircle the Buddha three times before it entered the appropriate spots of his body according to circumstances Now as the Buddha smiled the light not without reason entered his left palm after having encircled him three times On seeing this event Ananda with his hands put palm to palm uttered the following stanza Being free from unrest and arrogance The Buddha turns evils into superior causes He never smiles without a reason Exposing his snow white teeth He knows by his wisdom What others are delighted to hear With his supreme brilliant light He can dissolve others doubts There is cause for the Tathagata the Worthy and Omniscient One to wear a smile Ananda did you see the child putting a handful of sand into my alms bowl Ananda said in reply Yes I did The Worldhonored One said again A hundred years after my nirvana this child will be born in the city of Pataliputra with the name of Asoka He shall be a cakravartin king ruling over one of the four continents and take delight ip believing the right Dharma He will build eightyfour thousand stupas to enshrine the Buddhas relic bones for the benefit of many people The Tathagata then uttered the following stanza After I have entered nirvana There will be born to the Maurya family A king of men named Asoka Enjoying wide fame for taking delight in the Dharma With stupas containing my relic bones He will adorn Jambudvipa Such will be the reward of the merit Gained by offering sand to the Buddha The Buddha then took the sand and handed it to Ananda saying Mix this sand with cows dung and spread it over the place where the Buddha used to walk in meditation Ananda then daubed the ground with the mixture as he was told Now in the city of Pataliputra there was a king by the name of Candragupta whose son was Bindusara and Bindusaras eldest son was Susima At that time a daughter of most elegant features the best ever known in the country was born to a Brahman in the city of Campa A physiognomist said in prediction This girl will become a queen and give birth to two sons The first son will become a cakravartin king ruling over one of the four continents and the second one will be a recluse and attain enlightenment The Brahman was greatly delighted to hear this prediction With a desire to gain wealth and nobility the Brahman took his daughter to the country of Pataliputra adorned her with all kinds of ornaments and sent word to King Bindusara My daugh ter is most elegant in features the best ever known in the country I offer her to the king to be his consort The king accepted his offer and kept the girl in his harem His other consorts in the harem however considered the matter among themselves saying This girl is the most elegant in the country If the king sees her he will certainly be attracted by her beauty and will love us no more Thinking in this way the royal consorts ordered the girl to serve the king as his barber Once the king ordered a shave and while the girl was shaving him he fell asleep When he woke up he was pleased with the girl and said to her Whatever you wish to have you may declare it Then the girl said to the king I wish to have enjoyment with Your Majesty The king said As you are a barber and I am a king how The Causes of His Birth can I enjoy you The girl replied to the king I am the daughter of a Brahman and not a barber My father a Brahman intended me to be the kings consort The king inquired Who has made you a barber The royal consorts was the reply The king said again You need not do this job any more And he took the girl to c be his consort Shortly afterwards she became pregnant and ten months later she gave birth to a son As the king thought that he had no sorrow he named his son Asoka  As his second son was born at a time when he was without sorrow he named the child Vitasoka  Asoka was rough and coarse in appearance and his father did not like him At that time King Bindusara wished to know through physiognomy which of his sons was competent to succeed him on the throne So he summoned a heretical physiognomist named Pingalavatsajiva to whom he said Venerable teacher I wish to know through physiognomy which of my sons is competent to succeed me as king after my death Pingalavatsajiva said in reply If Your Majesty wishes to read the future of the princes we should go to the Golden Palace King Bindusara then took the princes to the Golden Palace Asokas mother said to him Today His Majesty wishes to read the future of the princes You may go to join them Asoka said As the king does not like me why should I go His mother said Just go Asoka said in reply I shall go as you order me But please ask somebody to send my food to that place When Asoka was leaving the city of Pataliputra he met a minis ter of the court by the name of Radhagupta who asked Asoka Where do you intend to go Asoka said in reply Today the king is at the Golden Palace in order to read the future of the princes I am going there Radhagupta then handed his good old elephant to Asoka so that he could ride to the Golden Palace After arriving at that place Asoka sat down on the ground among the other princes who all had various kinds of food and drink contained in golden and silver vessels Asokas mother prepared rice and cream which she put in an earthenware vessel and sent to him King Bindusara said to the physiognomist You should read the future of the princes one by one to see who is competent to be king after my death The physiognomist pondered over the matter in his mind thinking If I say Asoka is competent to be king the king will certainly kill me because he does not value him Having considered the matter in this way the physiognomist said to the king For certain reasons I shall not mention any name in my physiognomic reading The king said Good Then the physiog nomist said The prince who has the best animal for riding will be competent to be king The king said Go on with your prediction The physiognomist said again The prince who is sitting on the best seat will be competent to be king The king said again Go on with your prediction The physiognomist said again The prince who has the best food and drink contained in the best vessels will be competent to be king When the princes heard these words each of them thought that he had the best animal for riding the best seat and the best food and drink contained in the best vessels and that he should be king But Asoka thought in his mind Now this physiognomist ia refuses to mention any name in his physiognomic reading If the one who has the best riding animal will be competent to be king then I have the best riding animal I have the great earth as my seat and I eat rice and cream the best of foods My vessel is made of earth and what I drink is water So far as I can see I shall be king The physiognomist paid a visit to mother who asked him Who will become king after the demise of His Majesty He said in reply Asoka mother then said to the physiog nomist If the king inquires any more about who is competent to be king you should go to a distant place and not stay here But you may come back when Asoka becomes king So the physiognomist went far away to some other country At that time a country named Taksasila which was under the rule of King Bindusara attempted to rebel against his suzerainty King Bindusara said to Asoka You may assemble the four divi sions of troops and march to that country But no weapons or The Causes of His Birth provisions were given to him Thus Asoka commanding the four divisions of troops went to punish Taksasila Upon hearing that Asoka was coming the people of Taksasila came out half a yojana to decorate the road and sprinkle scented water over the ground to receive Asoka to whom they said We come to welcome you O Prince not to fight with you nor do we harbor any enmity against His Majesty the great king But the minister sent by the king is governing our country in a bad way and we wish that he be recalled Then the people offered various gifts to Asoka and welcomed him to their country as has been extensively related Asoka was again sent by the king as an envoy to the country of Kasi In the country of Kasi there were two warriors who said to their king We two are strong enough to level a mountain When Asoka comes we need not serve him as his subjects At that moment the heavenly beings voiced a warning saying Asoka will be a cakravartin king to rule over one of the four continents You should not go against him Now Susima the eldest son of King Bindusara was returning from the royal gardens to the city of Pataliputra when he met on the way the kings prime minister who was bald coming out of the city To joke with him Susima patted him on his bald crown The prime minister thought Even now he dared to pat me on the head Should he become king he would certainly hurt me with a sword It befits me to take measures to prevent him from becoming king Thus he ordered five hundred ministers to leave Susima and he announced that Asoka would be a cakravartin king ruling over one of the four continents and that all of them should serve ib him together He even agitated the people of Taksasila to rebel against the king refusing to be his subjects any more King Bindusara dispatched Susima to subjugate the rebels but when he reached that country he could not suppress the revolt At that time Asoka returned home and King Bindusara who was seriously ill and on his deathbed ordered a messenger to instruct Asoka to go back to Taksasila while asking Susima to return home speedily saying I intend to hand over state affairs to him The ministers smeared Asokas body with the yellow juice of ginger to make him look as if he were sick and they also boiled laksa and kept the juice in a bowl which they put someplace while announcing that Asoka was ill When King Bindusara was approaching his end the ministers dressed Asoka and took him to the king to whom they said T h is is a prince When Susima returns we shall restore the throne to him Upon hearing these words the king was greatly enraged Asoka said If I am the legal king let the heavenly beings crown me right now When he had said so the heavenly beings immedi ately put a celestial crown on his head At this sight the king was all the more furious and died with hot blood oozing from his mouth Then Asoka ascended the throne and after ascending the throne he appointed Radhagupta as his prime m in ister Susima was very angry to hear that Asoka had ascended the throne after the death of the king and he wished to punish Asoka with his troops Asoka in his city mobilized a great num ber o f soldiers to guard the four gates of the city He ordered two strong and valorous generals with groups of soldiers to guard the southern and western gates he ordered his prime minister Radhagupta with a group of soldiers to guard the northern gate and he himself commanding a group of soldiers guarded the eastern gate Radhagupta made by different expedients various kinds of devices at the eastern gate of the city he had figures of Asoka and his soldiers carved out of wood and had ditches dug in the ground in which smokeless fires were kept burning under coverings that were camouflaged by dry earth scattered over them The Causes of His Birth Susima and his troops intended to attack the northern gate but Radhagupta said to him Dont attack me You should attack the eastern gate If you can kill King Asoka I will surrender to you Listening to his suggestion Susima directed his army to attack the eastern gate where seeing that none of the wooden figures was moving he marched straight forward fell into the fire pits and burned to death After Susimas death his army commander Bhadrayudha by ic name a brave and powerful man led his army of more than a thousand soldiers to become Buddhist monks to practice the Way and they attained arhatship  King Asoka administered state affairs but his five hundred ministers disdained him Once he said to his ministers Pull up flower and fruit trees to protect thorns and brambles The ministers said in reply No We should pull up thorns and brambles to protect flower and fruit trees But Asoka repeated that they should pull up flower and fruit trees to protect thorns and brambles Three times his ministers disobeyed him In a fit of anger Asoka drew his sword and beheaded the five hundred j ministers Another time King Asoka took five hundred maids of honor to the rear garden where there was a tree with profuse flowers and foliage called an asoka tree On seeing this tree King Asoka said I am glad that this tree bears the same name as I As Asoka was physically rough and coarse the maids did not wish to go near him While he was sleeping in the garden the maids intending to displease him plucked all the flowers and leaves of the tree leaving it bare When Asoka woke up and saw the bare tree he asked the maids Who stripped this tree so completely The maids said in reply W e did it In a fit of anger King Asoka wrapped all the maids in bamboo screens and burned them to death As he was so wicked the people of the time called him Candasoka  The prime minister Radhagupta told King Candasoka that he should not personally beat or kill but should order somebody else to do it Thus the king recruited an executioner There lived then in a village in the mountains a man good at weaving clothes who had a son called by his father Girika This young man was so fearsome that he was capable of doing unrighteous deeds and always scolded his parents He beat everyone male or female in the household and would kill or hurt all living creatures His trade was fishing and hunting and as he did so much slaughtering he was also called by the people Candagirika ia When the king was searching for a cruel person his mes senger came upon this man The messenger said to him The king wishes to govern the people by means o f killing Can you do the job The man answered I could kill everybody in the whole of Jambudvipa if I were asked to do so The messenger reported to the king what the man had said and the king ordered that he be brought to his presence By order of the king the messenger went to the mans place and told him The king has asked you to come The man said to the messenger Just wait a moment I must go to see my parents Then he went to inform his parents that King Asoka wished to govern the people by means of kill ing that he had asked him to do the job and that he was willing to go But his parents would not permit him to go and so in a fit of rage he murdered his parents Then he returned to the mes senger who asked him Why are you so late The man said in reply Because my parents would not allow me to go I finished them off When the man came to the palace he told the king that if he wished to punish people he should build a prison with a gate well decorated to look most magnificent so that anybody who saw it would be delighted with it He also asked the king to issue a strict order that nobody should be allowed to come out once he had entered the prison The king said Very good Candagirika then went to Kukkuta Monastery where a bhiksu was reciting a scripture in which the events in the hells were related such as cauldrons with boiling water furnaces with burning charcoal mountains planted with knives trees bearing swords and other painful implements of punishment Those who were bom in the hells were punished according to the sins they had The Causes of His Birth committed Such hellish things were extensively related in the Scripture o f the Five Divine Lictors Upon hearing these words Candagirika made all the implements of torture that were used in the hells In the country of Sravasti there was a merchant who went to sea with his wife a son was bom to them while they were at sea and the child was thus named Sagara  After voyaging to and fro for twelve years they encountered five hundred pirates who killed the merchant and seized his property Later he became a Buddhist monk and on his wanderings he reached the country of Pataliputra One day he got up early dressed himself properly and went into the country with alms bowl in hand to collect food As he did not know the place he entered the prison to beg for alms because he saw that its gate was so nicely decorated Inside the prison he saw all kinds of imple ments of torture and intended to withdraw But Candagirika got hold of him and said You shall suffer death and cannot go out Being frightened the monk cried and wept with tears flowing down Candagirika said to him Why are you crying like a child The monk replied It is not because I value my body but because it is difficult to attain emancipation It is difficult to renounce ones home but this I did It is difficult to live during the time of Sakyamuni Buddha but I am living in it I have not gained the true Dharma of all Dharmas and that is why I am anxious and worried Candagirika said to the monk I have been instructed by the great king that nobody should be allowed to leave this prison once he has come into it The monk said with tears You must allow me one months extension Not one month but seven days may be allowed was the reply Considering that he was approach ing his death the monk zealously practiced the Dharma with great energy for the full seven days At that time a prince had a talk with a palace maid and King Asoka being irritated by the sight had the two of them sent to the prison for punishment Candagirika put them in an iron mortar and pounded them with a pestle Greatly terrified by the sight the b monk uttered the following stanza The Great Master the Buddha compassionate The Leading Recluse has rightly said that This material form is like a bubble Unsubstantial and not everabiding This fair and graceful body Where is it after its destruction Thus one should give up What the ignorant take pleasure in I should realize that on this occasion Candagirika said to him The night is over and the day is dawning You should know that the time of suffering is approaching The monk said in reply I do not know what you mean by saying that the night is over and the day is dawning But I do realize that the night of ignorance is over and the sun of wisdom is appearing By the light of the sun of wisdom I see that nothing has reality in this world Thus I intend to edify the world with the Dharma of the Buddha He also told Candagirika Now you may do whatever you please with this body of mine At that time the warden of the prison being a merciless man and having seen nothing of the world relentlessly put the monk into an iron cauldron poured pus blood feces urine and other filthy things into it and built a big fire with much fuel to boil the monk in the cauldron But when the fuel was exhausted the body of the monk was not damaged at all On seeing that the monks shape was not changed the warden beat and scolded the jailors angrily W hy dont you add more fuel to the fire The warden then personally added fuel to the fire but it would not burn Meanwhile he saw that the monk was sitting crosslegged on a lotus flower in the cauldron After seeing this phenomenon the warden immediately went to report to the king The Causes of His Birth Upon hearing this matter the king followed by his people went to see it At that moment the monk instantly came out of the iron cauldron by his supernatural powers and rose up into the air like a king goose hovering in the air in eighteen different ways King Asoka was delighted to see the monk as conspicuous as a mountain appearing in the air and he uttered the following stanza I do not know about this Who are you in fact You should tell me the truth And let me know you now If I know the truth I shall be a disciple of yours c The monk then thought in his mind This king is now capable of accepting the Buddhas words He will build many stupas to en shrine the Buddhas relics so that all people can gain the benefit of the Dharma Having thought so he wished to reveal the Buddhas merits and uttered the following stanza I am a disciple Of the best debater of the highest grade The inexhaustible power of the right Dharma Regards nothing as a real being The Buddha is a bull king among men Who can control himself and regulate others It is he who has liberated me From the prison of the three realms of being The king was also predicted by the Buddha A hundred years after my nirvana there will be a king by the name of Asoka in the city of Pataliputra He will be a cakravartin king and rule over one of the four continents and he will construct eightyfour thousand stupas for the enshrinement o f my relics The prison to be built by the king in which numerous people will be killed will be like the hells He will finally demolish it and impart freedom from fear to all living beings The great king should now comply with the Buddhas wishes He then uttered the following stanza Thus the great king of men Should have a mind of pity For all living beings And grant them freedom from fear King Asoka fixing his mind on the Buddha and putting his hands palm to palm uttered the following stanza in penitence I take refuge in the Buddha the Dharma And his disciples in the Sangha  May you the son of the ten powers Treat me with patience All the evils that I have done I shall confess to you Now I shall cultivate my mind with diligence And with a mind of deep veneration ia When King Asoka was about to leave the prison Candagirika said to him with his hands joined palm to palm Your Majesty is aware that I have been instructed not to allow anybody to go out of this prison once he has entered it The king said to him Do you intend to kill me Yes was the reply The king asked him Which of us came in first Candagirika said in reply I came in first Then the king told the jailors to arrest Candagirika put him The Causes of His Birth in the lakuca house and set it on fire He also ordered people to demolish the prison so as to impart freedom from fear to all living beings With the intention of building numerous Buddhastupas the king arrayed his four divisions of troops and went to the Drona Stupa constructed by King Ajatasatru In this way he took out the relics from seven stupas one after another Then he went to a village named Ramagrama where stood the first stupa ever built He intended to break it also and take out the relics The Naga king then invited Asoka to the Naga palace and said to him This is the stupa to which I always make offerings May Your Majesty preserve it King Asoka consented and then the Naga king sent him back to Ramagrama Considering that the Naga king protected that stupa with twice the usual attention because it was the first one ever built in the world Asoka realized that he could not obtain the relics contained therein and returned to his own country King Asoka made eightyfour thousand precious cases and put the relics in all of them He also made eightyfour thousand vases banners and canopies and gave them to the Yaksas  ordering

are not a woman Because this is the place where the Buddha attained supreme perfect enlightenment The lady called the candali maid and said to her Can you restore the tree to grow as before The maid replied If the root o f the Bodhi tree is not dead I can rejuvenate the tree to grow again Then the candali maid unloosed the cord with which she had bound the tree and dug a ditch around it Every day she poured milk into the ditch to irrigate the tree and in a few days it gradually revived and became alive as it was before The people reported it to the king saying Your Majesty has done a great

King Asoka had uttered this stanza three hundred thou sand bhiksus of whom a hundred thousand were harmonious arhats and two hundred thousand were learners and numerous zealous ordinary people gathered together but nobody among the Sangha took the chief seat King Asoka said to the Elder Yasas who possessed the six supernatural powers Why is it that nobody is sitting on the first seat The Elder replied Because it is the seat for the chief Elder The king said again Is there anybody even higher than Your Reverence The Elder replied Yes The Buddha said that among his disciples the foremost in preaching like the roar of a lion was the person surnamed Bharadvaja and named Pindola The chief seat is for him Upon hearing these words King Asoka was so excited that his hair stood on end like kadamba flowers He said Most Virtuous One is there any bhiksu who saw the Buddha before he entered nirvana and is still living now The Elder replied Y es the person who is surnamed Bharadvaja

face was like the autumnal full moon Whose pure voice dissolved affliction Entering the samadhi of nondisputation King Asoka inquired again Where and how did Your Reverence see the Buddha The Elder said in reply Your Majesty the Worldhonored One stayed at first in the city of Rajagrha with a following of five hundred passionfree arhats The passionfree Mahamuni Was followed by passionfree arhats

that occasion the Tathagata instructed me saying You must not enter nirvana so long as my Dharma abides in the world  Pindola then uttered the following stanza At the invitation of Sumagadha The Buddha went there by divine power Making Offerings to the Bodhi Tree I followed him to the land of Pundra Raising a mountain high by my own power The Buddha instructed me on that occasion To live in the world so long as the Dharma abides That was the condition upon which I was able to see the Buddha Again Your Majesty when you were a child in a previous life you offered sand with a childish mind to the Buddha while I offered him cooked rice when he entered the city of Rajagrha to collect alms Radhagupta rejoiced at the event The Buddha made a prediction saying A hundred years after my nirvana

as his father Upon seeing that Kunala was going to present twice as many gifts as his father the whole assembly laughed merrily Make an announce ment in my name that the gifts are offered to the monks o f the five sects Kunala then raised four fingers to show to the bhiksus Greatly enraged the king said to the minister Radhagupta Now I am performing meritorious deeds Who is so ignorant of worldly deco rum as to compete with me On seeing that the king was getting angry Radhagupta saluted him at his feet and told him who dared to compete with him in the performance of meritorious deeds by uttering the following stanza Who dares to compete with the king In the act of merit making Make an announcement in my name to the assembly that I offer everything to the monks of the five sects And he also uttered the following stanza Everything in my palace Excepting my treasures But including attendants and courtiers I offer to the monks The monks of the congregation Are fields of blessing I and my prince Shall gain merits i ia After having presented alms to Pindola and all the monks in the assembly King Asoka constructed a wall around the Bodhi tree He personally climbed up to the top of the wall and poured four thousand water pots of scented water to irrigate the tree which started to grow as before And he uttered the following stanza Having been watered by the king the Bodhi tree started to grow as before with green and pliant branches and leaves and it unfolded new buds to the great delight of the king and his minis ters and people Food and drink were then offered to the monks In the assembly there was a monk of great virtue by the name o f Yasas who said to the king This assembly of monks is truly to be adored and respected You should make offerings to it without a mind of discrimination King Asoka served food to the monks with his own hands from the highest in order to the last one At the end of the order there were two novices who made joy buns out of cooked rice and threw them to each other for fun King Asoka was amused to see them and thought that the two novices were playing like children The king went again to serve the chief monk with food and gradually came to the presence of Yasas who said to him Your Majesty should not harbor any feeling of disbelief towards any monk in the assembly The king consented but he told the Elder Yasas that two novices were having fun with cooked rice Yasas said in reply Those two novices are arhats having gained free dom of mind and wisdom The king was greatly delighted to hear this When the king saw these things he asked What is the use of these things They replied Since Your Majesty wishes to present us with separate gifts of robes after offering food to the monks we intend to dye the new robes Upon hearing these words the king thought in his mind I was just thinking within my mind and did not say anything How did these persons come to know my mind Then he prostrated himself on the ground to worship at the feet of the two novices and uttered the following stanza to them I king of the Maurya clan And my courtiers and men Have done deeds of merit And gained great benefits i ib King Asoka said to the two novices On your account I shall offer three robes to each of the monks in the assembly So after having Making Offerings to the Bodhi Tree performed meritorious deeds for the monks of the five sects King Asoka also presented three robes to each of them besides offering four hundred thousand taels of gold to them He also paid a large amount of gold and silver to redeem his land palace attendants and ministers as well as himself and Kunala The Causes of Vitasoka King Asoka had a mind of deep faith in the Buddhadharma After constructing eightyfour thousand stupas he convened an assem bly of monks of the five sects to whom he offered food and drink There were in the assembly three hundred thousand arhats twice as many learners and innumerable zealous ordinary people in whom the king had double faith At that time King Asokas younger brother Vitasoka believed in the dharma of the heretics and he said None of Sakyamunis disciples has attained emancipation Because they always take delight in a pleasurable way of life and dread asceticism King Asoka said to his younger brother Do not fix your faith in the wrong place You should believe in the Buddhadharma At another time when King Asoka went out hunting his younger brother saw a hermit in the mountains who was scorching himself with heat from five directions while earnestly practicing asceticism I spread grass on the ground answered the hermit If they have desire in their minds how could they cherish the notion of detesting and forsaking desire And he uttered the following stanza The hermit in the wood of mortification Living upon fruits roots and flowers Breathing air without taking foul nutrition Cannot quell his carnal desire Sons of Sakyamuni Buddha Eat milk foods and butter Wear robes of many types And never give up one piece If they could keep their senses under control Mount Vaidurya would be able to float i ic King Asokas younger brother also said that the Sakya disciples were cheating the king into performing meritorious deeds Upon hearing these words King Asoka trying to employ some expe dient said to his minister My younger brother believes in the heretics We should try to employ some expedient to convert him to the Buddhadharma In reply to the king the minister said What does Your Majesty wish me to do The king told him Now I am going to the bathroom to take a bath I shall take off my crown and garments You may dress my younger brother in my costume and ask him to ascend the throne The minister said in reply Yes King Asoka then went to the bathroom to take off his orna ments and after the king had entered the bathroom the minister said to his younger brother You would have been king if it had not been for Asoka Now you may try to put on this crown and the royal garments and ascend the throne Having said so the minister dressed the prince in the kings garments and caused him to ascend the throne The minister then reported to King Asoka saying Your ser vant has carried out the order of Your Majesty King Asoka came Making Offerings to the Bodhi Tree to see his younger brother who was wearing the crown and sitting on the throne and said to him So you have assumed kingship even when I am not dead In a fit of rage the king called in the executioner a fellow dressed in dark blue with dishevelled hair and holding a bell in his hand Having come into the presence of the king the executioner paid homage to him and said What do you wish me to do The king said I have discarded this younger brother of mine You may kill him When the king had said this a group of people holding weapons in their hands came up to surround the prince At that moment the minister saluted the kings feet and said to him This is Your Majestys younger brother and I beg Your Majesty to have patience and not to be angry with him King Asoka said to the minister in reply I shall be patient with him for seven days As he is my younger brother I shall give him the kingdom temporarily allow him to be king for seven days and provide him with various musicians and maids o f honor for his amusement All people should come to pay respects to him Standing at the gate with a knife in hand the executioner announced to the king every day One day has passed There will be six days more So on the sixth day he announced that there remained only one more day On the seventh day the royal ornaments crown and garments were returned to King Asoka The minister and other people took Vitasoka to see the king who asked him During the seven days of your kingship how did you enjoy the pleasant music and various kinds of amuse ment In reply the kings brother uttered the following stanza He who has seen the beauties Heard the melodies And tasted the delicacies May answer your inquiries a The king said again I gave you the kingdom so that you were king for seven days and you enjoyed all kinds of amusement to your hearts content while numerous people came every day to pay homage and express good wishes to you How can you say that you did not see hear or taste anything delightful In reply the prince again uttered the following stanza In the last seven days I neither saw nor heard anything Nor did I smell or taste flavor I could not feel the touch Of the ornaments I was wearing Or of the charming maids who were attending As I was thinking of dreadful death I lost the sensations of these things The songs of the nautch girls dancing The palaces and bedding The land and all the treasures Aroused in me no pleasure In the same way the homeless bhiksus meditate on the impermanence of the countless births and deaths on the basis of the twelve entrances How can they have any passions They also meditate on the pains of the hells and of the animals cruelly killing one another on the hungry ghosts suffering from hunger and thirst and on men always rushing about without ease to all places for a living and also on the pains of the heavenly beings at the stage of decadence All beings in these five ways of existence are Making Offerings to the Bodhi Tree suffering mentally and physically without happiness The bhiksus also consider that all the five skandhas are impermanent pain ful void egoless and unsubstantial just like an empty village without inhabitants As the five skandhas are void and with out an ego the world is burning with the fire of impermanence Since the Buddhas disciples always contemplate in this way how can they have any passions And he also uttered the following stanza Just for a single day You pondered on the fear of death Without joy and pleasure Nor with a mind of attachment The disciples o f the Buddha Contemplate birth and death every day How can they have joy and pleasure And harbor minds of delusion On their food and garments b As well as on their bedding They meditate upon how to gain liberation Free from mental attachment King Asoka employed this good expedient to convert Vltasoka to the Buddhadharma and Vltasoka with folded hands said to the king Your Majesty I now take refuge in the Tathagata as well as his Dharma and the Sangha And he also uttered the following stanza I take refuge in the Buddha Whose face resembles a lotus flower A shelter for divine and human beings I also submit to the pure Dharma and the Sangha It was for the sake of converting you to the Buddhadharma that I adopted this expedient Vitasoka offered various kinds of flowers and incense with the performance of music to the Buddhastupas and he also pre sented different kinds of food and drink as alms to the monks Then he went to Kukkuta Monastery where the Elder Yasas an arhat possessing the six supernatural powers was residing Upon arriving at the monastery he sat face to face with Yasas wishing to hear the Dharma from him With his supernormal powers Yasas perceived that Vltasoka had done good deeds in his previous lives and that this was his last birth with a corpo real body as he would attain arhatship The Elder preached the Dharma and praised the renunciation of home life After hearing the Dharma Vltasoka wished to renounce his home life and said to Yasas with folded hands You have preached the Dharma and Vinaya well May I renounce my home to be a fully ordained monk I wish to lead a life of celibacy according to the Buddhadharma Yasas said in reply Good man you may go back to ask King Asoka whether he permits you to renounce your home Vltasoka returned to King Asoka and said to him with folded hands May Your Majesty allow me to renounce the home life as I wish to lead a life of celibacy accord ing to the Buddhadharma And he also uttered the following stanza The kings will is an iron hook Do not stop me from leaving home The king is the lord of the earth And should allow me to leave my hearth For this world the Buddha is a ray And I wish to go along his Way Making Offerings to the Bodhi Tree Upon hearing these words King Asoka embraced his younger brothers neck and said with tears and sobbing Vitasoka do not i c conceive such an idea Because the monks wear coarse and shabby clothes eat what is given by others and sleep under trees Now stop thinking about becoming a monk Vitasoka said in reply Your Majesty I wish to become a monk not out of hatred or craving or poverty or to evade some enemy It is simply because I see that this world is full of pain and continual rebirths without emancipation and I see that the Buddhadharma is the only right path leading to freedom from rebirth without fear So I wish to become a monk with pleasure King Asoka sobbed more piteously when he heard these words Vitasoka then uttered the following stanza Rebirth is like a rope hanging Man is on it always swinging King Asoka then said to his younger brother Before becoming a monk you have to practice begging for alms In the royal garden at the back of the palace there was a big tree under which grass was spread on the ground to provide a place for Vitasoka to stay An earthen bowl was given to him so that he could beg alms from the palace With begging bowl in hand he went to the palace where he obtained different varieties of the choicest food The king became angry with the palace attendants and said to them Why do you give the best food to the mendicant From now on you should give him coarse food Thus wheat was cooked and kept for a night and then given to him when it had turned sour Vitasoka accepted the food and ate it without feeling disgusted At this sight King Asoka said to him Stop taking this food I permit you to become a monk but after becoming a monk you should often come to see me Then Vitasoka went to the Kukkuta Monastery and when he reached there he thought that if he became a monk at that place the people and environment would distract his mind from cultivating the Way and that he should go to become a monk at some distant place So he travelled to the country of Videha where he became a monk and engaged himself in meditation vigorously until he attained arhatship Having attained arhatship the Elder Vitasoka enjoyed the bliss of emancipation and thought that as he had made an agree ment with the king to see him often after becoming a monk he should fulfill his promise a Then he travelled by easy stages to the country of Pataliputra Early in the morning the Elder Vitasoka dressed himself and went to the city with his begging bowl to collect alms Then he stood up and gazed at him with his hands joined palm to palm without feeling weariness He uttered the following stanza with tears of emotion All living beings are happy To live in a harmonious family But you renounced your home To live a life quiet and calm Now I understand your mind With no amount of wisdom are you content At that time the minister Sugupta saw that Vitasoka wore a robe made of castoff rags He carried an earthen bowl went from house to house to collect alms and without distinguishing in his mind accepted whatever food coarse or fine was given him He said to King Asoka Vitasoka is content with few desires and has accom plished what he aimed to achieve Making Offerings to the Bodhi Tree He always practicing almsbegging Wearing castoff rag clothing Living beneath a tree Has a mind in constant samdhi His mind is broad without leakage His body is free from malady Leading a righteous life He is always cheerful King Asoka was greatly pleased to hear these words and he uttered the following stanza You abandoned the Maurya clan The kingdom of Magadha Precious jewels of every kind And the best enjoyment of the five desires You rejoice at the four noble truths Free from arrogance pride and distress Practicing the Way with great diligence My country is glorified by your eminence The supreme Dharma the ten powers You are qualified to possess After the meal his eating bowl was washed and put aside King Asoka sat before him to listen to his preaching and in the course of preaching Vitasoka uttered the following stanza King Asoka and five hundred courtiers together with the people of the country surrounded Vitasoka respectfully with folded hands to send him off The courtiers and people uttered the following stanza King Asoka the elder brother Sends off the younger one with respect The supreme fruit of renunciation Is now fully realized b In order to reveal his merits the Elder Vitasoka soared into the air and all the people saw his departure King Asoka and the multitude folding their hands palm to palm witnessed the event with fixed gaze and uttered the following stanza Then the Elder Vitasoka repaired to a borderland and upon reaching there he fell so seriously ill that his head was covered with boils The king hearing about it dispatched attendants and physicians to cure him When he was a little better some time later both the physicians and the attendants were sent back As he needed only milk for his nourishment he went for convenience of begging alms to live at a place where there were many cows One man who followed the heretical Making Offerings to the Bodhi Tree dharma worshipped a naked god painted in the shape o f the Tathagata and paid homage to it at its feet A Buddhist disciple saw this matter and reported it to Kang Asoka After hearing it the king ordered that the man be brought into his presence Now within the domain of King Asoka all the Yaksas in the air up to the height of half a yojana were under his control and all the Nagas one yojana below the earth also belonged to him Upon hearing the order of the king the Yaksas in an instant brought the heretical disciple and his picture into the presence of the king Being greatly enraged by the sight he had all the heretics of Punyavardhana killed and one hundred eight thousand heretics i c were slaughtered in one day There was another heretical follower who accepted a heretical dharma worshipped a naked god painted in the shape of the Tathagata and paid it homage at its feet When King Asoka heard about it he again ordered his men to arrest that man and his relations all of whom were put in a house which was then set on fire The king also issued a decree saying If anyone can get the head of a Nirgrantha I shall award him a piece of gold At that time the Elder Vltasoka came to a place where cows were reared and spent one day there As he had been sick for many days his hair and beard were long his nails were sharp and he was wearing a coarse garment without color or brilliance A cow herd woman thought in her mind Here comes a Nirgrantha to our house And then she said to her husband You can kill this Nirgrantha and send his head to King Asoka and you will surely get a gold coin The husband hearing this unsheathed his sword and went to Vltasoka with the intention of decapitating him The elder reflecting that nowhere could one escape from ones retribu tion faced death as it befell him His head was then sent to King Asoka by the man wishing to win the reward of gold When the king saw that the hair on the head was of an attractive variegated color he had a suspicion in his mind and inquired of the physicians and attendants about it They said to the king This is the head of Vltasoka Upon hearing these words the king fainted and fell to the ground When water was sprinkled on him he recovered and got to his feet after a long while A minister said to the king Even a man who is perfectly free from passions is not spared from this suffering It befits Your Majesty to grant freedom from fear to living beings Asoka fol lowed this advice and issued an order that no Nirgranthas should be killed any more Then the bhiksus had a doubt about it and inquired of Upagupta What deed did Vltasoka commit in the past that he suffered this retribution of being murdered by another Upagupta said in reply Elders listen In the past there was a hunter who killed many herds o f deer In the great forest there was a spring where the hunter spread his net and tied the rope beside the water In this way he killed many deer every day That was a time when the Buddha was not yet born in the world One day apratyekabuddha took his meal beside the water After taking his meal he bathed and went to sit underneath a tree All the deer smelling the fragrance of the pratyekabuddha did not go to the waterside When the hunter came and did not see any deer he ia traced the footmarks and came to the pratyekabuddha On seeing him the hunter thought in his mind It is because of this man sitting here that the deer did not come Thereupon he killed the pratyekabuddha with a knife You should know Elders that that hunter of bygone days was todays Vltasoka As he had killed many deer every day in the past he suffered various ailments in his present life His murder of the pratyekabuddha caused him to suffer pains of every description in hells for innumerable years He was always killed each of the five hundred times he was born as a human being This was his last birth but even though he had attained arhatship he was still murdered by a man The bhiksus again asked Upagupta But how did this person come to be born into a great clan and attain arhatship Upagupta said in reply Formerly when he became a monk in the Dharma of Kasyapa Buddha he loved to give alms and often advised lay supporters to offer various kinds of food and drink to the Sangha There was then a stupa containing the Buddhas hair and nail Making Offerings to the Bodhi Tree relics to which he offered incense flowers banners and canopies as well as different kinds of musical performances It was because of this karma that he was born into a great clan And for a hundred thousand years he constantly practiced celibacy with a right vow on account of which he attained arhatship The Causes of Kunala Ring Asoka constructed eightyfour thousand stupas in one day and on that day his wife Padmavati gave birth to a son with regular features and particularly beautiful eyes No one saw him but loved him A palace attendant reported to the king that by the merits of the king his wife had given birth to a son The king was pleased to hear this news and uttered the following stanza I am today Greatly pleased My clan of Maurya Is well known to all May my son in the palace Increase the Dharma Thus the child was named Dharmavivardhana  Then he was carried in to be shown to the king who was glad to see him and uttered the following stanza Beautiful are the eyes of my son Created by merits previously done Bright and very brilliant Resembling utpala flowers These eyes of merit Adorn his features His face is regular and dignified Like a full moon in the season of autumn King Asoka assembled his ministers and said to them Have you ever seen eyes such as those of this child The ministers said in reply We have really never seen such eyes among human beings But in the Snow Mountains there is a kind of bird called a kunala whose eyes resemble the eyes of this child And they uttered the following stanza On top of the Snow Mountains At the place of precious flowers The birds called kunala b Stay in their nests The eyes of this child Resemble those of the bird The king then ordered Bring that bird here The Yaksas in the air up to the height of half a yojana heard the kings words and the Nagas one yojana below also heard his words In an instant the Yaksas brought a bird to the king who compared its eyes with the eyes of his son and found no difference between them Thus he gave the child the name of the bird and uttered the following stanza The king of men on the earth Uses the name of kunala With most beautiful eyes As his sons name So that on this earth His fame will spread far When Kunala had grown up he was given a lady named Kancanamala to be his wife Once King Asoka brought him to Kukkuta Monastery where lived an elderly monk by the name of Yasas an arhat possessing the six supernatural powers At that moment Yasas foresaw that before long Kunala would lose his eyes So he said to the king W hy do you not ask Kunala to do his own deeds King Asoka said to Kunala The Most Virtuous One asks you to do what you should do You should meditate on this And he also uttered the following stanza Ordinary people have upsidedown views Giving rise to what is wrong Kunala then sat alone at a quiet place in the palace to meditate that the eyes and other sense organs were painful and imperma nent King Asokas chief wife Tisyaraksita went to Kunala and saw that he was sitting alone When she saw his eyes a surge of lustful desire arose in her mind and she embraced him with her arms while she uttered the following stanza A strong fire of love Is burning in my heart Like flames licking a dry vine Come you to satisfy my mind When Kunala heard these words of hers he plugged his ears with his hands and uttered the following stanza At this place of mine No such words should be said You are a mother to me And I am a son to you Passions of this illegal kind Should be put far away Why should you for this matter Open the gate to the evil way I fixed my mind of love upon you But you have no love in your mind Since you dislike me You will soon be wiped out Kunala said in reply I would rather die For the Dharma of purity than live I would not stay in life With a mind of obscenity One who has an evil mind Loses the good Dharma of Devas and men If the good Dharma becomes imperfect On what will ones life depend There was then in the north a country named Taksasila which rebelled against King Asokas orders When the king heard about it he intended to go there himself but his ministers said to him Kunala should be ordered to go There is no need for you to go yourself King Asoka summoned Kunala and said to him You should go to that country Kunala replied to the king So be it King Asoka also uttered the following stanza At this moment I heard him saying So be it Though he is my son He is also my heart As I remember him in my mind He is more lovely to me King Asoka then had the roads repaired All corpses were removed and all aged and sick people were ordered to keep out of sight The king rode in the same carriage with Kunala to see him off At that time a Brahman physiognomist foresaw that Kunala would soon lose his eyes On seeing that the king was gazing at his The Causes of Kunala sons eyes without paying attention to anything else he uttered the following stanza Why should they be lost All the people in this country When they see Kunalas eyes Feel pleased As if enjoying heavenly bliss If they see him lose his eyes They will all be distressed i a Kunala then gradually proceeded to the country of Taksasila The people of that country hearing about it went out half a yojana to repair and decorate the road They placed water everywhere in anticipation of the coming multitude The people uttered the fol lowing stanza The people of Taksasila Hold water in precious jars And other offerings To greet Prince Kunala When the prince arrived the people folded their hands and said to him We do not come to meet you to fight nor do we bear any grudge against the great king But the minister sent by the king to our country governs the state unjustly and we wish him to be dismissed from office Then the people presented offerings to Prince Kunala and welcomed him to their country King Asoka then fell seriously ill he vomited out of his mouth and filthy fluid oozed from his pores All the best physicians failed to cure him King Asoka said to his ministers Recall Kunala I shall consecrate him king and hand over the throne to him Now I shall cling to this life no more Tisyaraksita thought in her mind If Kunala becomes king I shall certainly be put to death With this reflection in her mind she said to King Asoka I can cure the king and get rid of the disease There is no need to send for any more physicians So the king listened to her words and refused to see any physicians Tisyaraksita said to the physicians If there is anybody outside male or female who is suffering from the same disease as the king you may bring that person in There was then in the country of the Abhlras a man suffering from the same trouble as the king The sick mans wife consulted a physician and told him the symptoms of her husbands illness The physician said in reply Bring the man here I wish to see him and write out a prescription for him Thus the woman brought the patient to the physician who then sent him to the kings wife The kings wife put the sick man in a secluded place had his abdomen cut open and extracted both his raw and his ripe viscera In his ripe viscus there was a big worm and when it moved upwards vomit was ejected out of the mouth Excrement was discharged below when it moved downwards If it moved sideways filthy fluids oozed from the pores The kings wife ground some mallika and placed it beside the worm but it did not die She then put some pippall beside it and it still did not die She again placed some dry ginger near the worm and it still did not die But it died instantly when she placed some garlic beside it ib The kings wife reported this matter to the king saying The king should now eat some garlic which will cure the disease The king said in reply Being a Ksatriya I should not eat garlic The lady said For the sake of your body and life it should be taken as medicine So King Asoka ate some garlic and the worm was then killed and his disease was cured Thus he became as fit and lively as before After having bathed King Asoka said to his wife What ever you desire to have now I shall grant you as you wish The kings wife said to him May the king allow me to be king for seven days The king said to his wife If you become king you will certainly kill me His wife said again After seven days I shallThe Causes of Kunala return the kingship to you Thus King Asoka granted her the request In the letter there was written the following stanza I am now very powerful My prestigious name fearful As Kunala the prince Has committed an offence Now I order you people To extract his two eyes To perform this matter now You should take action in haste When the royal lady had written this letter she needed to impress it with the kings dental marks King Asoka was then sleeping and as the lady wished to seal the letter she went close to the king The king woke up with a start The lady asked the king Why are you frightened and startled The king said in reply to the lady I had an inauspicious dream in which I saw a vulture attempting to extract Kunalas eyes This is why I was startled with fear The lady said in reply The king need not be worried Prince Kunala is now quite safe and sound In the second watch the king had another dream and he was again wakened from sleep with a start He said to the lady I had another dream as ominous as the first one The lady asked W hat was it The king said in reply I saw that Kunala had long hair a beard and sharp nails and he was unable to speak The lady said He is safe and sound Do not worry about him Afterwards when King Asoka fell asleep the lady stealthily had the letter impressed with the kings teeth and had it sent to the people of Taksasila At that time King Asoka again dreamed that all his teeth had fallen out When he had taken a bath early the next morning he summoned as a lifeanddeath matter a physiognomist and told him everything he had seen in his dream saying You should read the meaning o f my dream The physiognomist said in reply If anyone has had such a dream his son will lose his sight If anyone dreams that his teeth have fallen out His son will lose his sight Since ones son has lost his eyes It is the same as losing ones son c When King Asoka heard these words he stood up facing the deities of the four quarters with folded hands and implored their protec tion with vows saying I take refuge singleheartedly in the Buddha In the pure Dharma and in the Sangha All the recluses of this earth Are most eminent in the world May all saintly monks Extend protection to Kunala When the messenger arrived with the letter in the country of Taksasila the people of the country upon seeing the letter hid it away and did not give it to Kunala They had affection for him and did not wish to cause resentment in his mind The people also reflected Since the great King Asoka is so fearful that he has neither esteem nor confidence even in his own son and wishes to extract his eyes how can he treat us without malignance And they uttered the following stanza Now as regards this Kunala He is no different from a great recluse O f all living beings He is the benefactor But to him the great king Asoka Has no mind of compassion The Causes of Kunala Let alone to any other beings He will spare none from cruelties Upon receiving the letter Kunala said to the people If anyone can extract my eyes he may do so at his own discretion The people then called in a candala and said to him Extract Kunalas eyes The candala said with folded hands I cannot do that Why If a man could erase The full moons brilliant light He might extract the eyes From your face a moon that is bright Kunala took off his precious coronet and said to the candala If you can extract my eyes I shall give this to you There was another man of abominable features marked with the eighteen marks of ugliness who said I can extract your eyes At that moment Kunala remembered what the most virtuous Yasas had told him and he uttered the following stanza This is a true saying a I always remember and ponder That everything is impermanent This was taught by my teacher And I should deeply keep it in mind I do not fear the pain As I have seen that nothing is everlasting In compliance with the kings order You may extract my eyes Kunala then said to the ugly man You may gouge out one of my eyes and place it in my palm as I wish to see it When that ugly man was about to take out Kunalas eye numerous people angrily scolded him and uttered the following stanza His eyes are pure and without stain Like the moon in the air You are extracting his eyes As one might pull a lotus from a pond Numerous people wailed and wept piteously while the ugly man took out Kunalas eye and put it in his hand Accepting his eye in his hand Kunala uttered the following stanza to it Originally in former times You could see all colors But at this moment now Why can you not see them Formerly you caused the seer To have a mind of attachment Now I see that you are not real But false and unsubstantial Like a bubble on water That is void and without entity You are simply powerless And not independent When Kunala was meditating on the impermanence of all dharmas he attained the fruition of a srotadpanna After having gained the fruit he said to the ugly man You may gouge out my other eye as you like The ugly man then cut out the other eye and placed it in Kunalas hand Although he had lost his eyes of flesh he obtained the Eye of Wisdom and then he uttered the following stanza have gained it now The king has abandoned me I am no more the kings son As I have gained the Dharma I am a son of the Dharma King Now I have freely fallen From the palace of suffering And also freely ascended To the palace of the Dharma King Knowing that it was Tisyaraksita who wanted to extract his eyes Kunala uttered the following stanza When Kunalas wife Kancanamala heard that Kunala had lost his eyes she went to her husband out of anxiety about him At a place where there was a crowd of people she saw Kunala who had lost his eyes and was bleeding Thus she fainted and fell to the ground and people sprinkled water on her to restore her to consciousness She wept and uttered the following stanza b Your eyes were bright and lovable When I saw them formerly they were pleasurable Now they are apart from your body They cause in my mind a great worry Kunala said to his wife Do not weep As I have done the deeds I am receiving the retribution He also uttered the following stanza All sorts of unions Are bound to end in separation This matter you should know There is no need to weep with lamentation Kunala and his wife then returned to King Asokas palace from the country of Taksasila As the two of them had never before since their birth walked on the ground they were so weak and feeble that they could not bear the hardship o f their labor Kunala was good at playing the lute as well as singing and playing wind instruments They followed the original road and begged for food to sustain their lives Gradually they reached their own country and intended to enter the palace gate but the gatekeeper did not allow them to go in Since they could not get in they withdrew and lodged in a carriage shed and stable In the third division of the night Kunala played his lute and started singing a song with the words My eyes are lost but the four noble truths have I seen And he also sang the following song If a man possessing wisdom Sees the twelve entrances With the lamp of wisdom He may be free from rebirth The sufferings of the three realms of being Are the sufferings of ones own mind As for all faults of the three realms of being One should perceive them now If one wishes to acquire supreme bliss One should ponder on the twelve entrances The Causes of Kunala Now the song that is being sung And the sound of the lute Sound like my son King Asoka called in a man  The voice I heard seemed to be that of Kunala it was so melodious and yet so sad and sorrowful That voice distracted my mind as an elephant is rest less with an uneasy mind when it has lost its son but hears its sons trumpeting You may go to see whether it is Kunala or not If it is Kunala then bring him here Under the kings order that man went to the carriage shed and stable where he saw a man who had lost both eyes and whose skin was tanned by the sun he did not recognize the prince He went back to report to the king saying The person Your Majesty i c ordered me to see is a lonely blind man staying with his wife in the carriage shed and stable He is not Kunala Upon hearing these words King Asoka felt distressed and pondered over the matter And then he uttered the following stanza I saw in a dream before That Kunala had lost his eyes Now this blind man Must be Kunala without doubt Go there again To bring him to this place As I am thinking of my son My mind is not at ease What is your name Kunala replied with the following stanza My father is named Asokavardhana With the surname of Maurya The whole great earth Is under his control And I am his prince By the name of Kunala Sumamed Dharmaraja Buddha I am the son of the Dharma King The messenger then brought Kunala and his wife to the palace King Asoka saw that Kunala had been exposed to wind and sun burned and was dressed in a garment made of grass and rags and that his appearance had changed beyond recognition With a doubt arising in his mind King Asoka asked him Are you Kunala Yes I am was the reply When King Asoka heard this he fainted and fell to the ground An attendant saw what had happened to the king and uttered the following stanza When the king saw that Kunala Had no eyes in his face A painful feeling burned in his heart He fell down from his sofa The attendant then sprinkled water on the king to make him recover his consciousness The king then returned to his seat and carried Kunala and sat him on his lap weeping and shedding tears and stroking his head and face while he recollected his features of bygone days And he uttered the following stanza The lightning of hatred Has broken my heart You just tell me who it was And I shall not bear a mind of malice Having committed an atrocity Why do you not sink into the ground You did not perform what was right But committed a great misdeed Since you have done evil I abandon you forever Just as a gooddeed performer Would give up filthy lucre When King Asoka with a fire of hatred burning in his heart saw Tisyaraksita he again uttered the following stanza At this moment now I wish to extract her eyes And use an iron saw To dismember her limbs To break her body with an axe To cut out her tongue with a knife To sever her neck with a sword To bum her frame in fire Or to force her to drink poison To do away with her life King Asoka said such things intending to punish Tisyaraksita When Kunala heard these words he had a mind of deep compas sion and uttered the following stanza b What Tisyaraksita has done Are nothing but evil deeds The Causes o f Kunala Now may the great king Not kill her for that reason None of the great virtues Can surpass forbearance As the Worldhonored One has said It is the first and foremost He also issued an order to kill that man of Taksasila Long long ago in the past there was in the country of Varanasi a hunter who killed many deer in the Snow Mountains Once when he went to the Snow Mountains a thunderbolt crashed in the sky and five hundred deer being frightened by the bolt fled into a cave Upon seeing this group of deer the hunter caught every one of them Then he thought in his mind If I kill all of them their flesh will become rotten I have no other choice but to extract both eyes from each of them so that they will neither die nor run away and I can gradually slaughter them afterwards Having reflected in this way he gouged out all their eyes Elder what do you think That hunter was Kunala in a former life Because he had extracted the eyes of the deer he was always bom in hells for innumerable years When he was released from the hells and was born in the human world his eyes were always extracted for five hundred lives His present life is the last residue of his retribution The bhiksu inquired again What was the cause of his being bom into an eminent clan with a pair of handsome eyes and gaining arhatship Elder listen said in reply Long long ago in the past at a time when the span of human life was forty thou sand years a Buddha a fully enlightened one by the name of Krakucchanda appeared in the world There was then a king by the name of Subhavyuha who constructed a stupa with the four precious substances for that Buddha the Worldhonored One After the kings demise his younger brother who did not believe in the Buddha secretly took away the jewels and gems with which the stupa was built leaving only the earthwork and the wooden structure behind All the people who saw that the stupa was damaged cried with regret and annoyance ic The son of a householder asked the people W hy are you crying with regret and annoyance They said in reply Originally the stupa for the Worldhonored One had the four precious sub stances but now they are destroyed and gone Thus we are crying with regret and annoyance at the sight The son of the householder restored the stupa with the four precious substances as it was before and enlarged it so that it was broader and higher than it was at the beginning He also made a golden image and placed it in the stupa After having done this he made a vow saying As Krakucchanda is the teacher of the world today may my future teacher be the same as this Buddha now You should know bhiksu that that son of a householder was Kunala As the result o f his mending and repairing the stupa of Krakucchanda Tathagata he was born into a prominent clan in this life Because he made an image of the Tathagata his body in the present life is most handsome and graceful And as he vowed to meet a good teacher he now has Sakyamuni as his teacher and realizes the four noble truths The Causes of Offering Half an Amra Fruit to the Sangha Having acquired firm faith King Asoka asked the bhiksus Who has made the largest amount of offerings ever to the cause of the Buddhadharma The bhiksus said in reply The Elder Anathapindada gave the largest amount of offerings The king asked again W hat amount of offerings was he able to give to the cause of the Buddhadharma The bhiksus said in reply He spent a hundred crores of taels of gold Having heard this King Asoka reflected If the Elder Anathapindada could spend a hundred crores of taels of gold I should also spend a hundred crores of taels of gold in alms giving King Asoka constructed eightyfour thousand stupas and offered one hundred thousand taels of gold each to the place where the Buddha was born the place where he attained the Way the place where he turned the Wheel of the Dharma and the place where he entered nirvana and also to each of the places where the various arhats entered nirvana He also convened a great assem bly of the four groups of Buddhist followers He offered food at the same time in one day to three hundred thousand monks of whom onethird were arhats and twothirds were learners and zealous ordinary people Again King Asoka retaining only his treasures offered all his land palace attendants ministers and Kunala as well as himself to the Sangha He also presented four hundred thousand taels of gold in alms to the Sangha and paid an enor mous amount of gold to redeem his land and his own person Later he offered ninetysix crores of taels of gold to the Sangha in alms When King Asoka was afflicted with a serious illness he was very sad and worried Upon hearing that the king was ill the minister Radhagupta who was the kings friend and rejoiced at his good deed of offering sand as alms in a previous life went to the kings place and saluted him at his feet And then he uttered the following stanza ia Your face formerly resembled a lotus That no dust or filth could stain All enemies of great strength Could never get sight of the king Who was like the hot sun at the meridian Upon whose rays nobody could gaze How is it that today You are shedding tears and sadly sobbing King Asoka answered with the following stanza Now I am sad and worried Not for the sake of my life or wealth But because I shall leave the group of saints For this I am sad and worried All the disciples of the Worldhonored One Have achieved various kinds of merits With different sorts of food and drink I make daily offerings to them As I remember this matter I cannot help shedding tears Moreover Radhagupta formerly I desired to offer one hundred crores of taels of gold to the Three Treasures but my intention was not fulfilled Now I intend to present forty crores of taels of gold in alms to satisfy my original intention After due considera tion he wished to send forty crores of taels of gold to Kukkuta Monastery At that time Kunalas son Sampadin was the crown prince The minister said to the prince King Asoka will pass away very soon and yet he wishes to send forty crores of taels of gold to Offering H alf an A m r a Fruit Kukkuta Monastery As all kings depend on wealth for their power the prince should order the treasure keeper not to allow the gold to be taken out Thus the prince issued the order accordingly and the edict of King Asoka was not put in force But golden vessels were provided for the king to take his meal After taking his meal he ordered that the golden vessels be sent to Kukkuta Monastery Thus golden vessels were withheld and silver ones were allowed for his use After taking his meal the king again ordered that the silver vessels be sent to Kukkuta Monastery So silver vessels were withheld and iron ones were provided for the use of the king But after taking his meal he again ordered that they be sent to Kukkuta Monastery Then iron vessels were also withheld and earthenware vessels were allowed for his use Then King Asoka had nothing more in his possession except half an amra fruit in his hand As King Asoka was greatly distressed in his mind he summoned his ministers and people and said to them all harmoniously Who is now the lord of this earth The ministers rose up to salute him and said with folded hands Only heaven and nobody else is the lord Then King Asoka shed tears that rolled down like rain and he uttered the following stanza I have no more free control over anything This is the only thing you should do for me Send this half an amra fruit to Kukkuta Monastery and announce my words saying King Asoka worships at the monks feet Formerly I possessed the land of the whole of Jambudvlpa but now I have only half an amra fruit This is my last alms which I hope the monks will accept Although this is a small thing the beneficial merit of offering it to the monks is great  And he also uttered the following stanza Under the kings order the messenger sent the half an amra fruit to Kukkuta Monastery Before the elder monk he offered it to the Sangha and uttered the following stanza with his hands joined palm to palm c The whole earth is under the one umbrella Of the kings rule without hindrance Like the brilliant light of the sun Shining upon all places Of his fancied good deeds The merit has come to the end As the sun sinking down into the earth Has no more brilliant light With worship and veneration He offers half an amra fruit As a sign of his merits termination It is his last gift At that time the Elder assembled the bhiksus and said to them Now you should cherish a mind of fear Just as the Buddha has said it is fearful to see impermanence manifested in other per sons Whoever could bear it without a feeling of abhorrence and abandonment He has nothing more than an amra All treasures on the great earth Were under his protection This King Asoka of today Gives half an amra in alms Ordinary beings of all realms of existence Are proud of the force of their merit and virtue When the monks received King Asokas half an amra fruit they crushed it into pulp and mixed it in soup which was then served to all members of the Sangha King Asoka said to Radhagupta Who is the king now Radhagupta saluting him at his feet said with joined hands Heaven is the lord of earth and nobody else is King Asoka who was then supported by some people looked around at the four quarters and said toward the place of the monks with his palms joined together With the exception of my treasures I now offer the great earth and even the great sea together with every thing else to the Sangha And he also uttered the following stanza Water is the garment of the earth The seven jewels adorn its surface Which supports all living beings As well as all the mountains Now I give up all these things As alms to the monks a From the monks I shall gain the fruit Thus I am giving them these things as gifts By the blessing of this almsgiving I do not seek the place of Sakra Nor to find pleasure in the heaven of Brahman Nor to be the lord of all parts of the earth Holding this document in his hand he joined his palms toward the place of the monks and said to them Offering H alf an A m r a Fruit I offer this great earth and everything to the Sangha After having said so he passed away Then the ministers adorned a hearse with multicolored silk as an offering for the body of the king After making the offering they intended to perform the ceremony of enthronement by sprinkling sea water upon the head of the crown prince Radhagupta said to the ministers The whole great earth has been offered to the Sangha by the great King Asoka The ministers said in reply Then what shall we do Radhagupta replied Formerly King Asoka desired to offer one hundred crores of taels of gold as alms to the Buddha the Dharma and the Sangha When he had given ninetysix crores of taels of gold he wished to complete the round figure but the ministers did not agree with him As the king was discontented he offered the whole great earth as alms to the Sangha Then the ministers took out forty crores of taels of gold to redeem the great earth and performed the ceremony of enthronement by sprinkling sea water upon the head of Prince Sampadin Sampadins son was Brhaspati Brhaspatis son was Vrsasena Vrsasenas son was Pusyavarman and Pusyavarmans son was Pusyamitra When Pusyamitra ascended the throne he assembled the ministers  By what expedient means can I make my name everlasting The ministers said in reply Your Majestys surname is derived from King Asoka who constructed eightyfour thousand stupas so that the Buddhadharma did not perish and his name is still well known Your Majesty should now construct eightyfour thousand stupas The king said in reply The great King Asoka possessed a great divine power unsur passed by anyone Is there any other means for me to keep my name known forever There was then a Brahman an adept in incantation but an ordinary person not believing the Buddhadharma who said to the king There are two causes that may make ones name everlast ing The first is to do evil and the second to perform good deeds The great King Asoka constructed eightyfour thousand stupas but if Your Majesty were to destroy them now your name would be everlasting When King Pusyamitra intended to destroy the Buddhadharma he arrayed his four divisions of troops and went to Kukkuta Monastery Upon arriving at the gate of the monastery he heard the roar of a lion Being greatly frightened the king returned to the country of Pataliputra In this manner he went to Kukkuta Monastery three times and each time the same thing happened to him ib When he returned to that country he assembled the monks of that monastery and said to them Now I intend to destroy the Buddhadharma Each of you should tell me of his own case All the monks said together W e all protect the stupas Then the king executed the Elder monk and killed all the other monks At that time the country of Sakala was under the kings domain He said to the people of that country that anyone who could get the head of a bhiksu would be rewarded with golden money A man who intended to get his head said to the king There is a bhiksu in that monastery I wish to take his head and send it to Your Majesty Having heard this the king desired to take the head of the bhiksu himself At that moment the bhiksu was absorbed in the intense contempla tion of perfect cessation and by the power of the contemplation he was invulnerable to knife stick fire and poison Since he could not kill the bhiksu the king went away to some other place and reached the country of Kosthaka In that country there was a Yaksa deity who was guarding the Buddhas tooth relic The Yaksa reflected The Buddhadharma is going to perish But as I am observing the precepts I can no longer kill any living creature I have a daughter whom the Yaksa Krmisa originally wished to marry But as he often committed evil deeds in former times I did not give my permission Now for the sake of protecting the Buddhadharma I should give her to him in marriage There was another powerful Yaksa who always protected King Pusyamitra Owing to his power nobody could injure the king The deity who guarded the Buddhas tooth relic led away to the South Sea the Yaksa who protected the king and at that moment the Yaksa Krmisa brought a great mountain and pressed it on King Pusyamitra and his four divisions of troops who all died instantly Thus that mountain was named Sunihita  Since King Pusyamitra was killed the great Maurya clan died out The Causes of the Buddhas Prediction Concerning Upagupta When the Buddha wished to enter nirvana he converted the Naga kings Apalala and Gopalacandala and after having done so he came to the country of Mathura In that country he told Ananda One hundred years after my nirvana there will be in this country of Mathura a perfumer by the name of Gupta whose son Upagupta will be a Buddha without the special marks He will perform the ic functions of a Buddha and teach many people to achieve arhatship Into this cave which is eighteen cubits long and twelve cubits broad he will ask each of his disciples to put a chip four inches long and thereby eventually fill up the cave Ananda you should know that after me Upagupta will be the foremost in edifying his dis ciples Ananda do you see that green mountain in the distance Ananda said in reply I see it Worldhonored One The Buddha said That mountain is named Urumanda One hundred years after the Tathagatas nirvana the bhiksu Sanakavasin will build a monastery on that mountain and preach the Dharma to edify Upagupta who will become a monk In the country of Mathura there will be two brothers named Nata and Bhata Being the sons of a wealthy person they will be donors for the construction of the monastery on Mount Urumanda Thus the monastery will be named Natabhatika The Buddha said to Ananda You should not wonder at this matter Even long ago in the past when he was bom in an evil path  he already benefitted many people Again beside Urumanda Mountain on its three sides there were in the past five hundred pratyekabuddhas on one side five hundred recluses on another side and five hundred monkeys on the third side Among the monkeys there was a chief monkey who went to the pratyeka buddhas Being delighted to see them he picked fruits and flowers from the trees and offered them to the pratyekabuddhas The pratyekabuddhas were sitting crosslegged and the monkey paid homage to them one by one After having worshipped them the monkey sat erect at the last seat after the monks and he did so every day When all of the pratyekabuddhas entered nirvana the monkey did not know it and made offerings to them as be fore When he saw that the pratyekabuddhas did not accept his offerings he dragged their clothes and pulled their feet but the pratyekabuddhas did not move Then the monkey realized that all the pratyekabuddhas were dead He cried and wept sorrowfully and went to the recluses The five hundred recluses were lying on thorns and thistles and the monkey imitating the recluses also lay on thorns and thistles He also imitated the recluses by lying on ashes and a earth and scorching himself with heat from five directions as the recluses did When they had gone away after scorching them selves the monkey quenched the piles of fire with water and hid the ashes away He pulled up the thorns and thistles on which the recluses had lain and threw them away He also cleared away the ashes on which they had lain The recluses grasped the branches of trees to suspend themselves in the air The monkey loosened their hands and made them drop to the ground He often taught the recluses how to behave themselves in the four respectinspiring forms of demeanor in walking standing sitting and lying After having taught them this he sat upright before them to practice concentration and said to them All of you should sit like this The five hundred recluses then sat together with him in meditation Having no teacher to preach the Dharma to them the recluses meditated on the thirtyseven classified ways leading to enlightenment and attained the path of the pratyekabuddha Having attained the path they reflected It is owing to this The Buddhas Prediction Concerning Upagupta monkey that we have attained the holy path Thus they offered incense flowers food and drink to the monkey When the monkey came to the end of his life the pratyekabuddhas cremated his body with fragrant wood The Buddha said to Ananda That monkey was Upagupta Even in an evil path of existence Upagupta did great benefit for many people One hundred years after my nirvana he will again perform great beneficial deeds on Mount Urumanda At that time the Worldhonored One said to Ananda Hold a corner of my robe Then the Worldhonored One lifted Anandas physical body into the air and they went together to the country of Kasmira Upon arriving there said to Ananda Do you see the many mountains and forests here Ananda said in reply I see them Worldhonored One He again told Ananda One hundred years after my nirvana there will be in this coun try of Kasmira the bhiksu Madhyantika who will establish the country of Kasmira in this land Then the Buddha gradually proceeded to the city of Kusinagara When the time of his nirvana arrived he told the Elder Mahakasyapa Now I wish to enter nirvana You should collect the Dharmapitaea to make it last one thousand years in order to absorb and convert all living beings Mahakasyapa said to the Buddha Worldhonored One I shall act according to the instructions of the Worldhonored One The Buddha then thought of Sakra Being aware o f the Buddhas mind Sakra the Lord of Devas came to the Buddha The Worldhonored One told SakraKausika you should protect  and maintain the Dharmapitaka Sakra said to the Buddha Worldhonored One I shall do so The Worldhonored One then thought of the Four Heavenly Kings who knowing the mind of the Buddha came to the Buddha The Buddha said again to the Four Heavenly Kings After my nirvana the four of you should protect and maintain the Dharmapitaka Even in the future during the times of the three wicked kings you four together should protect and maintain the Dharmapifcza The Four Heavenly Kings said to the Buddha We shall do so Worldhonored One At that time having entrusted the Dharmapifoa to Mahakasyapa and Sakra as well as to the Four Heavenly Kings the Worldhonored One returned to the country of Mathura gradually proceeded to the twin sala trees in the city of Kusinagara and told Ananda The time of my nirvana is approaching Make a bed for me to the north of the twin sala trees At midnight tonight I shall enter perfect nirvana And he also uttered the following stanza Old age and sickness are the shore From which I have crossed the sea Intending to enter the land of no sorrow I give up this body as a raft Rebirth is like the sea With fearful old age as its water Sakyamuni is the bull king Who has crossed the sea of rebirth Like a man depending upon a raft b Who safely reaches the other shore After the Buddhas nirvana eight stupas were erected to preserve his relics The ninth stupa contained a water pot and the tenth one was a stupa of embers Thus a stanza was uttered as follows Eight stupas were as tall as mountains Relics were preserved underneath The ninth one was a stupa of the water pot And the tenth one a stupa of embers f Sakra the Lord of Devas and the Four Heavenly Kings offered all kinds of incense and flowers as well as different kinds of music to the relics and he said The Worldhonored One entrusted us with the Dharmapifaa and entered nirvana Now we should comply and protect the Buddhadharma Then Sakra said to Dhrtarastra The Buddhas Prediction Concerning Upagupta You should protect the Buddhadharma in the east He said to Virudhaka You should protect the Buddhadharma in the south He said to Virupaksa You should protect the Buddhadharma in the west And he said to Kuvera rYou should protect the Buddhadharma in the north The Worldhonored One said After my death three wicked kings will come to live among you If they destroy the Buddhadharma you should defend and protect it Then the Buddha entered nirvana along with innumerable arhats A sorrowful voice was heard in the air uttering the follow ing stanza What a pity that the disciples of the Buddha Have all entered nirvana Today in this world Everything is empty and void The shadow of ignorance darkened the lamp of the right Dharma All the arhats of great virtue entered nirvana Nobody was there to guard and protect the Buddhadharma any more and it seemed that the right Dharma of the Tripitaka would not last long At that time Sakra and the Four Heavenly Kings as well as countless divine beings went together to Mahakasyapa Upon arriving there they worshipped at Kasyapas feet and said The Worldhonored One has entrusted the Bharmapitaka to you Most Virtuous One and to us Most Virtuous One you should now protect the Buddhadharma together with us All the Buddhadharma should be collected and must not be allowed to disperse Now the Buddhadharma supported and accepted by divine beings and men will stay in the world for one thousand years for the sake of absorbing and converting all living beings Then Kasyapa struck a bell and by his supernatural power i c the sound issued from his mouth telling all people in Jambudvipa about it There were then five hundred arhats staying at Kusinagara Kasyapa said to the Elder Aniruddha Now who is ab sent from the assembly of arhats Aniruddha said in reply Gavampati is now at the Sirisa Palace in heaven He is absent at the moment The most virtuous Kasyapa asked the bhiksus Who is the youngest person in this assembly The arhat Purna said in reply I am the youngest one Mahakasyapa said to him Can you accept the instructions of the Sangha Purna answered I can Kasyapa said again Good man it is excellent truly excellent that you can accept the instructions of the Sangha Now you may go to the Sirisa Palace in heaven to Gavampati and tell him Mahakasyapa and the monks summon you to come down   Purna then went to the Sirisa Palace and said to Gavampati Kasyapa and the monks who are living in perfect harmony in Jambudvipa have a function of the Sangha that requires you to go down in haste Gavampati said in reply Good man you should say the Buddha and the monks instead of Kasyapa and the monks Because the Buddha having entered nirvana the heretics and the like might despise the Buddhadharma and moreover some evil bhiksus might try to cause a schism in the Sangha The heretics might say Since the Buddha has entered nirvana the Dharma has also completely disappeared and the bhiksus know nothing of it Formerly when the Buddha was in the world his light of wisdom made the world bright and brilliant Now he is dead and the world has become dark What is the use of my going there He also uttered the following stanza The whole world is now empty Nowhere is delightful anymore Without the Tathagata to preach the Dharma There is nothing to be done in Jambudvipa Now I wish to stay here To enter nirvana The Buddhas Prediction Concerning Upagupta Now you may return there and tell them my mind saying Gavampati worships Mahakasyapa and the monks and repeat the above stanza The whole world is now empty Nowhere is delightful anymore Without the Tathagata to preach the Dharma There is nothing to be done in Jambudvipa Now I wish to stay here To enter nirvana i ia After having said these words Gavampati entered nirvana When Purna returned to Jambudvipa he uttered the following stanza Superior Sangha of great virtues The venerable Gavampati Said with veneration Since the Buddha has entered nirvana Today I shall also Enter nirvana Just as when the great elephant died His son followed suit At that time Mahakasyapa made a rule From then onward all monks should live in harmony to collect the Dharmapitoa Until this function was completed none of the bhiksus should enter nirvana And he also uttered the following stanza From today onward All monks should live in harmony As long as the Dharmapitaea is not collected None should enter nirvana When the five hundred arhats were living in harmony Maha kasyapa informed the Sangha saying This Elder Ananda has always followed the Tathagata He is getting old now and all monks should respect him He also uttered the following stanza This Elder Ananda Received and upheld what the Buddha said He is sharpwitted and has intelligence And always followed the Tathagatas steps Understanding the Buddhadharma with a pure mind Thus we should respect him As he is beneficial to all monks And is praised by the One with Ten Powers At that time Mahakasyapa said to the bhiksus If we collected the Dharmapitaka at this place many monks would come here in crowds and would certainly weep with grief which would disturb our Dharma function We should go to the country of Magadha where the Buddha attained enlightenment to collect the Dharmapitaka Kasyapa and the five hundred arhats then went to the city ofRajagrha while Ananda supported by the Elder Vrjiputra travelled to the country Vrji When they arrived there the four groups of devotees of that country were sad and grieved to hear that the Buddha had entered nirvana Having seen this he went to Ananda and upon reaching there he uttered the following stanza You should go under a tree To fix your mind on nirvana While Gautama was sitting in meditation Very soon he attained nirvana iib At that time the Elder Ananda under the edification of Vrjiputra spent the whole day in walking and sitting to wash his mind of the five covers He did so from the first till the fifth watch in the night and when Venus appeared he went out to wash his feet Having washed his feet he returned to the monastery and intended to lie The Buddhas Prediction Concerning Upagupta down with his right side on the bed Before his head touched the pillow he freed himself from all passions and attained arhatship Then he went to the city of Rajagrha where Kasyapa and the five hundred arhats had also arrived At that time Ajatasatru son of Vaidehi on hearing that Kasyapa and five hundred arhats were coming decorated the road and prepared different kinds of offer ings to welcome Mahakasyapa King Ajatasatru had formerly achieved the rootless faith caused by the Buddha for when he saw the Buddha coming to him he prostrated himself from a lofty storied house but the Buddha took hold of him by his supernatural powers This time while he was riding on an elephant he also prostrated himself at the sight of Mahakasyapa and Mahakasyapa also took hold of him by his supernatural powers Kasyapa said to King Ajatasatru The Tathagata could utilize his supernatural powers without a pre liminary thought but a sravaka must premeditate before he can utilize his supernatural powers If you prostrate from such a height without my being prepared you might lose your life From now on never do it again The king said in reply I shall do as you say King Ajatasatru worshipped at Kasyapas feet and said to him with his hands joined together Most Virtuous One when the Worldhonored One entered nirvana I did not see him If you Most Virtuous One intend to enter nirvana you must come to see me Kasyapa answered Let it be so And he also said to the great king We wish to collect the Buddhadharma in this city The king said in reply From now on till the end of my life I shall offer robes food and drink medicine and bedding to the Sangha The monks may stay at Bamboo Grove Monastery Then Kasyapa reflected This monastery is broad and big and the bhiksus might cause a disturbance to our function There is a grotto by the name of Pippalayana We should go there to collect the Dharmapitaka Then Kasyapa and the five hundred arhats went together to Pippalayana Grotto After arriving there and having properly arranged their lodgings he said to the bhiksus In the future the bhiksus may lose their correct minds We should work together to collect the Udana and Gdtha before midday and after midday we shall collect the other Dharmas Then the five hundred arhats took their seats according to order and on each seat was spread a nisidana  i ic All the monks thought in their minds which of the three pitakas they should collect first Mahakasyapa said W e should first collect the Sutras The monks said again W ho can recite the Sutras Kasyapa said in reply The Elder Ananda is the foremost among the wellinstructed disciples All the Sutras were received and retained by him We should ask him to recite the Sutras Kasyapa then said to Ananda You should now recite the Sutras and we the assembly shall collect them together And he uttered the following stanza You Elder Ananda should know That this Dharmapitaka Was created by the Tathagata And that it subsists through your effort You uphold the Buddhas Dharmapifaa Like a bull carrying a heavy burden The Tathagata possessing the ten powers Is the peerless and great brave one He could put an end to the three realms of being And the Buddhadharma is as fine as clarified butter At that time the Elder Ananda said in reply Let it be so Then he rose from his seat and standing before the presiding Elder and looking at all the monks he uttered the following stanza In this auspicious assembly of monks The Worldhonored One alone is absent The mind of purity is unadorned Like the sky without the moon The Buddhas Prediction Concerning Upagupta The Elder Ananda worshipped the monks one by one beginning with the presiding Elder After worshipping them he ascended the high seat and thought Some Sutras I heard personally from the Buddha and some I did not But now I shall say Thus have I heard to all of them The most virtuous Kasyapa said to Ananda Elder you should tell us where the Sutras were spoken And he uttered the following stanza All the great wise ones request You a son of the Buddha to tell us At which place the Buddhas First Sutra was spoken Thus have I heard Once the Worldhonored One was staying at the Deer Park of the recluses in the country of Varanasi The Buddha told the bhiksus about the noble truth of suffering and so on Such as this was extensively related At that time the Elder Ajnatakaundinya reflected Among this assembly I am the person who heard this Sutra spoken to me and my companions The Buddhadharma that has been trans mitted uninterruptedly is the Dharma I heard at the beginning Thus a sad and regretful feeling arose in him and upon seeing this sight Ananda also felt sad and regretful He came down from the high seat sat on the ground and uttered the following stanza a The three realms of beings are powerless Like the moons reflection in the water Or illusion or the trunk of a banana tree But with the power of wisdom One may know everything in the world Thus one should forsake birth and death And try to realize nirvana Like a tree falling in a gale At that time all five hundred arhats left their seats and sat on the bare ground Kasyapa said to the bhiksus How is the Sutra recited by Ananda Then the five hundred arhats entered samadhi and after emerging from samadhi they said Such is the Sutra We shall ask him to collect the Vinaya as we wish Then Kasyapa said to Upali Elder you should recite the Vinaya as we wish to collect it Let it be so was the reply After the collection of the second Dh axmapitaka was com pleted Mahakasyapa again thought We ourselves should recite the Mother of Wisdom  Kasyapa then said to the bhiksus What are the Mother of Wisdom They are the four objects of meditation the four right efforts the four supernatural powers the five sense organs the five spiritual powers the seven branches of enlightenment the eight fold right path the four unhindered wisdoms of eloquence the wisdom of nondisputation and the wisdom of vows which should all be collected The Dharmakaya the theory of discipline calm ness and tranquillity and doctrinal views are teachings of the Mother of Wisdom Thus the most virtuous Kasyapa concluded the collection of the Dharmap itaa And he uttered the following stanza We have collected the Dharma the Sutras For the benefit of the world The things said by the Buddha of the ten powers Were immeasurable The darkness of ignorance in the world Can be dispelled by the lamp of the Dharma The Buddhas Prediction Concerning Upagupta At that time the Elder Ananda thought When the Buddha the Worldhonored One was about to enter nirvana he said to those who had violated minor rules that might be given up I should now tell the monks Then before the presiding elder he said with hands joined palm to palm I personally heard the Buddha saying that thenceforward if anyone violated the minor rules he might give them up and not pretend to observe them If the monks agree we may give them up together When there are no more minor offenses all the monks may live in peace and happiness Then the most virtuous Kasyapa said to Ananda Did you ask the Worldhonored One which are minor rules that might be given up and which are not minor rules that might not be given up Among the five sections  do they belong b to the fifth or the fourth section Ananda said in reply I really did not ask Because all the great bhiksus in the presence of the Buddha did not ask about it and as I was the youngest person and had nothing to feel guilty or shameful about in my mind I did not ask about it Moreover as the Buddha was about to enter nirvana I was feeling sad and sorry and thus I did not ask about it Mahakasyapa then said to Ananda You are guilty of a duskrta offense as you offered muddy water to the Buddha when the Tathagata asked for water from you at the time of his approaching nirvana Ananda said in reply I was the youngest person and had nothing to feel guilty or shameful about in my mind At that time five hundred carts had just crossed the Krakustha River I fetched the water shortly after the carts had gone away and thus the water was muddy Kasyapa said again When the Tathagata needed water why did you not hold the bowl toward heaven so that heavenly beings would have certainly poured water into it Why did you fetch muddy water to offer to the Buddha Therefore you have committed a duskrta offense Again the Worldhonored One had a new robe as yellow as gold in color Why did you tread on it with your feet Ananda said in reply I did not do so out of shamelessness but because nobody else was there  Thus I stepped on it with my foot Kasyapa said again W hy did you not hold the robe toward heaven Heavenly beings would have come to hold it Therefore you have committed a duskrta offense Again at that time the Buddha said to you that if a man had cultivated the four supernatural powers he could live for a kalpa or less than a kalpa and he let you know that the Buddha the Tathgata had already achieved the four super natural powers Why did you not ask the Buddha to stay in the world for a kalpa or less than a kalpa Ananda said in reply Most Virtuous Ksyapa I was not shameless At that time the king of Maras bewitched my mind and thus I failed to ask the Tathgata to stay Ksyapa said That is also a duskrta offense Again why did you show the Tathgatas physical mark of a wellretracted male organ to women Ananda said in reply It was not out of shamelessness that I showed the physical mark of a wellretracted male organ to women At that time the women were full of lustful desire and if they saw the Tathgatas physical mark of a wellretracted male organ they would feel disgusted with their female form and wish to gain the male form That is why I showed it to them Ksyapa said You have committed a duskrta offense for which you should make a confession At that time Ksyapa said to the bhiksus We should now recite the seven rules for settling disputes and other minor offenses Among the bhiksus some said that the regulations to be learned by the monks and nuns were minor rules others said that the four dharmas were minor rules ic some others said that the ninety rules were minor rules still others said that the thirty rules concerning confiscation and expiation were minor rules and some others even said that the two rules concerning uncertain cases of infringe ment were minor rules Some of them said If only the four grave prohibitions and the thirteen rules concerning temporary expul sion were reserved while all the other rules were abandoned the heretics would say that the Dharma of the sramana Gautama is motley and variegated When the Buddha was in the world the Dharma was harmonious and in unison and when he passed away the Dharma also disappeared After the Buddhas nirvana all The Buddhas Prediction Concerning Upagupta his disciples acted on their own discretion those who wished to observe the rules observed the rules and those who wished to abandon the rules abandoned the rules The Buddha said these words If a bhiksu cannot observe the disciplinary rules with a whole mind he should observe them with a right mind If he has received the disciplinary rules he should not abandon them but should accept and observe all that the Buddha has spoken If a bhiksu accepts and observes what was spoken the good Dharma will increase without retrogression Therefore all the disciplinary rules spoken by the Buddha were accepted and observed The Causes of the Transmission of the Dharmapitaka by the Five Disciples of the Buddha The Worldhonored One transmitted the Dharmapitaka to Maha kasyapa and entered nirvana Mahakasyapa transmitted it toA n an da and entered nirvana Ananda transm itted it to Madhyantika and entered nirvana Madhyantika transmitted it    to Sanakavasin and entered nirvana Sanakavasin transmitted it to Upagupta and entered nirvana and Upagupta transmitted it to Dhltika When Upagupta was edifying his disciples in the country of Mathura each of them was asked at the time of becoming an arhat to throw a chip four inches in length into a cave twelve cubits broad and eighteen cubits long made a vow that when the cave was filled with chips he would enter nirvana ia and when the cave was full of chips he did enter nirvana after having handed over the Dharma to his disciple Dhltika who was the last disciple to throw a chip into the cave to make it full Upagupta said to Dhitika Formerly the Buddha handed over the Dharmapitaka to Mahakasyapa Mahakasyapa handed it over to Ananda Ananda handed it over to Madhyantika and Madhyantika handed it over to my upadhyaya Now I hand this Dharmapitaka over to you Having handed down the Dharmapitaka he entered nirvana seven days later Both heavenly and human beings passed the news from place to place throughout Jambudvipa One hundred thousand arhats came harmoniously together to make offerings and the number of learners and upasakas and upasikas was uncountable At the time of entering nirvana rose into the air in the postures of walking standing sitting and lying down with water coming out of the upper part of his body and fire from the lower part in eighteen transformations All the heavenly beings and people in the world were delighted Then he performed jhapita of himself with the chips  At that time one thousand arhats entered nirvana with him Then Dhltika received and protected the Dharmapitaka The Causes of Kasyapa The causes of the nirvana of the Elder Mahakasyapa At that time the Elder Kasyapa had all the Sutras the Vinaya and the Abhidharma recited With the wisdom of vows he understood the Tnpitaka achieved the body  and realized the samadhi of cessation With the allcomprehensive four unhindered wisdoms of eloquence he collected the Dharmapitaka with five hundred arhats The Dharma as spoken by the Buddha was handed down to various superior persons one by one so that it might spread to all places for constant reading and reciting and not be lost for the benefit of all people He often thought I am getting advanced in age but old age and death are the law of impermanence He also thought in this way I have received according to my ability what the Buddha has spoken My good friends have received the Sutras and thus the sons of the Dharma have been bom What I have done at present for requiting the Buddhas kindness is only a small repayment for the Buddhas favors Who can fully repay all the kindness of the Buddha All my fellow students are har monious in the Dharma and I have been carrying myself too long to receive and gather up the world I am too tired from carrying myself for so long and as this stinking body is extremely tired my time of nirvana is approaching He also uttered the following stanza The Transmission o f the D haim apitaka We should widely teach the Worldhonored Ones Dharma words In all places The shameless ones are expelled Those having a sense of shame are accepted I have done what is beneficial to me My time of nirvana is coming Mahakasyapa then went to Ananda and said to him The Worldhonored One handed over the Dharmapitaka to me and then entered nirvana Now I wish to enter nirvana and hand over the Dharmapitaka to you You should accept and uphold it In due time a son will be bom to a merchant in the city of Rajagrha and as the child will be born covered with a sana garment he will be called Sanakavasin Sanakavasin will sail on the great sea and later he will have faith in the Dharma o f the Worldhonored One to whom he will always make offerings You should edify him to become a monk and transmit the Buddhas Dharmapitaka to him Mahakasyapa then handed over the Buddhas Dharmapitaka b to the Elder Ananda My Worldhonored One had great compassion He did what was hard to do and his edification was allround and pervasive By his countless merits he created his most recent body The relics of the Worldhonored One are wor shipped at all places I should enter nirvana and you ought to know that there is nothing else for me to do He also uttered the following stanza To the relics of the Worldhonored One I have already made offerings It was from him That the samadhi of enlightenment was bom To the one who did what was hard to do This is my last offering Mahakasyapa went by his supernatural powers to the four caityas at the places where the Buddha was born where he at tained enlightenment where he turned the Wheel of the Dharma and where he entered nirvana With utmost veneration he wor shipped and made offerings to them He did the same at the eight relic stupas He also entered the Naga palace to make offerings to the Buddhas tooth relic like a lion king entering a lake that was terrorless deep large unruffled pure and undefiled After having made offerings to the Buddhas tooth relic there he came out as quickly as the Naga king could appear in the air and instantly reached the palace of the Trayastrimsa heaven where Sakra and the other heavenly beings were glad to make offerings to him After having received the offerings he intended to enter nirvana at that place Upon seeing the signs of the matter Sakra said to Kasyapa As you are mindful of pure practices you have always lived in the mountains What is your intention in coming here This is a lonely place where you have nobody to depend upon At that time the Elder Mahakasyapa said to Sakra Kausika I take pleasure in looking at the Buddhas tooth relic and the Buddhas heavenly crown as well as his mani  pdtra alms bowl and other things This is my last time to make offerings to them He also uttered the following stanza To say that my suffering is ended I have come here To see the signs of the Buddha I have come here Sakra and the other heavenly beings hearing Kasyapas words felt sad and sorry and out of respect for him they handed the Buddhas tooth relic with both hands to Kasyapa who received it respectfully and looked at it without blinking He offered mandarava flowers bakula flowers and small particles of ox head sandalwood to the tooth relic Mahakasyapa said to Sakra and one The Transmission of the Dharmapitaa thousand heavenly beings You should practice nonslackness Then Mahakasyapa suddenly disappeared from the summit of Mount Sumeru and returned to the city of Rajagrha At that time the Elder Kasyapa handed over the Buddhas Dharmapifoa to Ananda and then Ananda followed behind Kasyapa every day Ananda said to Kasyapa Do not enter nirvana Kasyapa then told Ananda You and I may enter each i c by his own way Ananda rose early in the morning and having dressed him self in his robes he took up his begging bowl and entered the city to beg for food first delightful name second delightful listen ing third delightful appearance People were never tired of look ing at him and never tired of listening to him speaking on the Dharma Kasyapa also rose early in the morning and having dressed himself in his robes he held his begging bowl and entered the city to beg for food He thought I promised that at the time of entering nirvana I would go to see King Ajatasatru Kasyapa then went to the royal palace and said to the gatekeeper I am here wishing to see the great king You may go into the palace to inform the king about it The gatekeeper said in reply The king is now sleeping
