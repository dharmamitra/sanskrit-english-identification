The abandonment of the deepest weaknesses I have taught as being the abandonment of all passionate inclinations forever which consists of the Buddha stage The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how many eons must one pass through to be able to abandon these weaknesses The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Avalokitevara and said 
Good son one must pass through three great incalculable immeasurable eons They are incalculable since they cannot be measured in years months halfmonths whole or half days and nights instants moments or seconds The Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One what are the characteristics faults and good qualities of the passions that appear in all these bodhisattva stages The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara and said 
Good son they are characterized by nondefilement because from the moment they are fixed in the initial stage bodhisattvas penetratingly understand the reality realm of all things Therefore these passions arise with the full awareness of those bodhisattvas and are not unconscious and thus they are characterized as undefiled 
Bodhisattvas are unable to engender any suffering in their own bodies and are without fault But they do engender passions so as to be able to sever the causes of suffering for sentient beings 
Thus those have unlimited good qualities The Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara addressed the Buddha and said 
How rare Worldhonored One is that unexcelled supreme awakening for it has such great benefit enabling bodhisattvas to engender passions How wonderful are the good roots of all the wordhearers and solitary enlightened ones How much greater are these other unlimited virtues   Chapter VII The Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One you have taught that the vehicle of the wordhearers and the great vehicle are but a single vehicle 
What was your underlying meaning The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara and said Good son in the wordhearers vehicle I have taught the various essences of all things the five aggregates the six internal bases the six external bases and suchlike 
In the great vehicle I have taught that all those things are identical with the reality realm with the one principle Thus I do not teach that these vehicles are different 
Some say more than I intended some less but their reasoning in regard to the difference of the vehicles is contradictory In such fashion they evolve and present their disputations 
Such is my underlying meaning in this regard Then the Worldhonored One recited verses to emphasize his meaning The stages what they encompass their descriptions their opposite  their preeminences the vows they engender the learningsall these depend upon the great vehicle preached by Buddha One who cultivates them well will become awakened 
In both the lower and the higher vehicles Ihave taught the various essences of all things and again I have taught that all are identical with the one principle for I have preached both the lower vehicle and the higher vehicle Therefore I teach that there is no differentiation in vehicles 
If one discriminates by taking my meaning literally whether by saying more or less  those two will be contradictory In foolishness such understandings will lead to disputes 
At that time the Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how should we designate this doctrine on the explication of underlying meaning 
How should we revere it  b The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Avalokitevara and said 
Good son it should be designated as the explicit teaching on the perfections and you should revere it as such When this explicit teaching on the perfections was preached some seventyfive thousand bodhisattvas in that great assembly attained the brilliant concentration of the great bodhisattva vehicle 
 Chapter VIII The Duty Accomplishment of a Tathagata At that time the great Bodhisattva Mafijusri questioned the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One you have taught about the Dharma body of a Tathagata How is this Dharma body to be characterized The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Mafijusri and said 
Good son the Dharma body of a Tathagata is characterized as the full perfection of the conversion of support which one realizes through the practice of the perfections in all the stages 
Know that because of two characteristics it is inconceivable for it is beyond verbal fabrication and is not a conditioned state 
Sentient beings in contrast imagine and cling to what is conditioned through verbal fabrications Worldhonored One is the conversion of support of the wordhearers and the solitary enlightened ones to be termed Dharma body or not Good son it is not to be termed Dharma body Worldhonored One what kind of body should it be called Good son it is termed a liberation body The liberation bodies of all wordhearers and solitary enlightened ones are the equal of all Tathagatas 
But because of the Dharma body we say that they are different 
Because they are different from the Dharma body of all Tathagatas all are different from the unlimited good qualities of a Tathagata which cannot be grasped through reckoning or analogy   The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning The Bodhisattva Mafijusri addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how should we understand the characteristics of the birth of a Tathagata The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Mafijusri and said 
Good son the action of the Transformation body of a Tathagata arises in many fashions just as do world realms 
It is characterized as being adorned and supported by a host of the good qualities of a Tathagata 
Know that this Transformation body is characterized as having birth whereas the Dharma body is characterized as not having birth The Bodhisattva Mafijusri addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how should we understand the skillful method whereby the Transformation body is manifested by a Tathagata The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva MafijuSri and said 
Good son in all the three thousand vast Buddha lands in many honorable and high royal households in many honorable and rich landed households enter into the womb are born and mature at the same time They experience desire leave home and engage in the practice of asceticism After abandoning that practice of asceticism they realize full supreme awakening is the sequence they manifest 
This is what is termed the skillful method whereby the Transformation bodies are manifested The Bodhisattva Mafijusri addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how many varieties of teaching are supported by those bodies of all the Tathagatas by means of which sentient beings already converted but not yet matured are led to maturity and by focusing upon which those already matured are led speedily to attain liberation The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Mafijusri and said 
scriptures discipline and theory Worldhonored One what is scripture 
What is discipline 
What is the matrix   Chapter VIII Mafijusri wherever I have explained doctrine by relying upon summary schema that is scripture 
It relies upon the fourfold schema the ninefold schema or the schema of twentynine items 
the cataloging of actions their progressive actualization the power to cause future transmigrations that comes from having conceptualized personality and the power to cause future transmigrations that comes from having conceptualized things 
the application of memory to the object  the diligent zeal therein the firm abiding of thought  the abiding in joy under present conditions the method of transcending all states of suffering and the perfect knowledge of these 
This last is of three kinds the perfect knowledge of the support for mistakes the perfect knowledge of the support for heretical practices among outsiders that depend upon concepts of sentient beings and the perfect knowledge of the support for the absence of pride among the orthodox 
the support for meditation its realization its cultivation its becoming stable its varieties its objects the skill to know what has already been abandoned and what has yet to be abandoned its distractions the support for its lack of such distractions perseverance in the labor and effort to meditate the preeminent benefit of meditation its steadfastness the listing of its holy exercises the listing of the aids to holy exercises its penetration to reality its realization of cessation the transcendence of its worldly insight  a The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning into doctrine and discipline over the attainments of the highest insight of all heretics and the regression that comes from its lack of cultivation for regression comes from not cultivating and does not refer to the fault of mistaken views 
MafijuSri discipline refers to that doctrine about the precepts and the states associated with these precepts that I have explained for wordhearers and bodhisattvas Worldhonored One how many aspects are included in the precepts of a bodhisattva Good son you should understand that there are seven 
The second is instruction in the theme of the grave sins 
The third is instruction in the theme of the sins against discipline 
The fourth is instruction in the nature of sin 
The fifth is instruction in the nature of sinlessness 
The sixth is instruction in how to be delivered from sin 
The seventh is instruction in rejecting the code of discipline 
MafijuSri the matrix refers to my doctrines on analytical exposition which eleven kinds of characteristics 
The first are the characteristics of worldly conventional  
The second are the characteristics of ultimate meaning 
The third are the characteristics of the objects that are aids to awakening 
The fourth are the characteristics of the aspects  
The fifth are the characteristics of the essences  
The sixth are the characteristics of the results of those  
The seventh are the characteristics of the explanations of the experiencing of those  
The eighth are the characteristics of the things that obstruct those  
The ninth are the characteristics of things which harmonize with those  
The tenth are the characteristics of defects in those  
The eleventh are the characteristics of the excellences of those  Understand that the characteristics of worldly conventional are three in number The first is instruction on persons 
The second is instruction on the characteristics of clinging to what is totally imagined 
The third is instruction on the activity whereby all things function 
 Chapter VIII Understand that the characteristics of ultimate meaning are found in the instruction on the seven kinds of suchness treated above 
The characteristics of the objects that are aids to awakening are the teachings on all knowable matters  
The characteristics of aspects are the instructions on the eight methods of investigating which refer to truth proposition faults qualities methodology transmigration reasoning and differentiating the general Truth refers to the suchness of all things Proposition refers to one can establish a personality whether or not one can establish the characteristics of clinging to what is totally imagined whether or not one can establish a direct affirmation a distinguishing answer a counterquestion or an answer of silence and whether one can establish a distinction that separates the underlying meaning from the explicit answer 
Faults refer to all the defiled states that have the errors I have described by means of innumerable different methods Qualities refer to all the superior benefits I have described by means of innumerable different methods Methodology has six varieties The first is method in regard to true reality 
The second is method in regard to realization 
The third is method in regard to teaching 
The fourth is method in regard to avoiding the two extremes 
The fifth is method in regard to inconceivable discourse 
The sixth is method in regard to underlying meaning Transmigration refers to the three times past present and future the three characteristics of the conditioned  and the four kinds of causes  Reasoning is of four varieties The first is reasoning from observation 
The second is reasoning from occurrence 
The third is reasoning from demonstration 
The fourth is reasoning from reality 
Reasoning from observation means from the causes  b  The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning and conditions that produce conditioned states of being and from the concomitant language  
Reasoning from occurrence means from causes and conditions that result in things that bring them to completion or that bring them into action once they have arisen 
Reasoning from demonstration means from causes and conditions that cause meanings proposed explained and defined to be both valid and understood 
the purified and the impure 
In sum there are five purified reasonings and seven impure reasonings There are five aspects that are termed purified 
The first is characterized as attained through direct insight 
The second is characterized as attained through the support of that direct insight 
The third is characterized as engendered through various analogies 
The fourth is characterized as truly perfected 
The fifth is characterized as wellpurified teaching That which is characterized as ascertained through direct insight consists in what is known by direct perception in the world that all conditioned states are impermanent that all conditioned states involve suffering that all conditioned states are without a self Such are said to be attained through direct insight 
Because they can be supported upon the obvious basis of impermanence which is a matter of direct insight all conditioned states are instantaneous that other worlds have sentient beings that pure and impure actions are never lost 
One can ascertain that the various differences among sentient beings depend upon their various actions One can ascertain that the suffering or the joy of sentient beings is based upon their pure or impure actions Such are said to be attained through the support of direct insight 
That which is characterized as engendered through various analogies consists in drawing upon facts commonly known in the  Chapter VIII world such as the birth and death of all conditioned states internal and external in order to offer an analogy It consists in drawing upon commonly known images in the world such as what it is like to suffer by being born etc in order to offer an analogy It consists in drawing upon commonly known images in the world such as the absence of mastery in order to draw an analogy It consists in drawing upon commonly known examples such as external prosperity in order to offer an analogy 
Such are said to be characterized as engendered by analogy That which is characterized as truly perfected consists in the ability to definitively establish a proposition as ascertained through direct insight through the support of that direct insight and through analogy That which is characterized as wellpurified teaching consists in what is taught through omniscience such as discourse on the final quiescence of cessation Such are said to be characterized as wellpurified teachings Good son these five characteristics are the purified logical principles of investigation 
Because they are pure you must cultivate them The Bodhisattva MafijuSri addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how many are the characteristics of omniscience The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Mafijusri and said 
Good son they number five The first is that if the voice of an omniscient one appears in this world it will be heard everywhere 
The second is that he will be endowed with the thirtytwo major qualities 
The third is that he will be endowed with the ten powers and be able to sever all the doubts of all sentient beings 
The fourth is that he will be endowed with the four fearlessnesses proclaim the true doctrine and be irrefutable by any other 
The fifth is that in that good doctrine and discipline he will be able to bring forth the four kinds of monks with the eightfold path 
Good son you are to realize that this reasoning from what is well demonstrated because based upon direct insight inference and the holy teachings is termed purified in its five characteristics What then are the seven characteristics that are termed impure The first is characterized as ascertainable through similarity to other forms 
The second is characterized as ascertainable through dissimilarity to other forms 
The third is characterized as ascertainable through similarity to all forms 
The fourth is characterized as ascertainable through dissimilarity to all forms 
The fifth is characterized as ascertainable through dissimilar examples 
The sixth is characterized as incomplete 
The seventh is characterized as the explanation of impure teachings If something is ascertained through the mental construction of thinking about everything then that is characterized as ascertainable through similarity to other forms If the characteristics natures actions cause result and differences of things are fixed as all having differences in each of their differing characteristics this is characterized as ascertainable through dissimilarity to other forms 
Good son if in that which is ascertainable through similarity to other forms and in its example the characteristics of all dissimilar forms are included then its proposition cannot be demonstrated 
If in that which is characterized as ascertainable through dissimilarity to all other forms and in its example all similar forms are included then its proposition cannot be demonstrated 
Because incomplete it negates wellunderstood purified reasoning Because impure it cannot be cultivated 
If its characteristics are drawn from dissimilar analogies if it negates wellpurified teaching know that at base it is impure Reasoning from reality refers to from the reality realm which abides in all things and supports the nature of things whether a Tathagata appears in the world or not Chapter VIII The theoretical matrix on differentiating the general refers to that final understanding whereby what is at first described generally by a single term is later differentiated and distinguished by many terms The theoretical teaching on essences refers to those characteristics of essence I have explained concerning the aids to awakening which are taken up together with their aspects and objects such as the stations of mindfulness etc 
Worldhonored One you have summarized the meaning of the scripture discipline and matrix for the bodhisattvas in amemory formula unknown to heretics By means of this memory formula unknown to heretics you lead bodhisattvas to penetrate the underlying meaning of what the Tathagata has preached The Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Mafijusri and said 
Good son hear the truth for I will summarize for you the meaning  b The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning of that unique memory formula which leads all bodhisattvas to penetrate the underlying intent of what I have enunciated 
Good son I have preached that both defiled and purified states lack any purposeful activity whatsoever and have no personality whatsoever for everything is apart from becoming 
Since all the common worldlings in their weak bodies cling to things and are passionate in regard to their false views distinguishing the essence of personalities one from the other they imagine an TV and a mine In this false view they say T see I hear I smell I taste I touch I know I eat I do I am defiled I am purified In such fashion their perverse efforts increase 
But if they knew things as they really are then they would be able finally to abandon those bodies of weakness and without any purposeful effort would attain the unconditioned support that does not abide in passion the highest purity apart from all verbal fabrication and the unconditioned support without any purposeful effort 
Thus I have preached that they are apart from becoming for defilement and purification admit of no before or after 
In their bodies of weakness are passionate about their views and therefore imagine an I and a mine It is because of such a delusion that they say I see I eat I become I am defiled and purified etc 
But if they knew things as they are in reality then they would be able to abandon those bodies of weakness  Chapter VIII and attain that unconditioned support apart from defilement or purification apart from verbal fabrication apart from purposeful effort 
At that time the Bodhisattva MafijuSri addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how should one understand the arising of the thinking of all Tathagatas The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva MafijuSsri and said 
You should understand them to be magical creations The Bodhisattva Mafijusri addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One the Dharma body of all Tathagatas is apart from all effort 
If it is apart from all such effort then how does it engender any thinking at all The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva MafijuSri and said 
Good son because of the force of the effort whereby they have previously cultivated the wisdom of skillful methods they do give rise to thinking 
It is just as one needs no effort to wake up after a deep thoughtless sleep for one awakens because of the force of efforts previously expended 
Or it is similar to one who needs no effort to arise from the concentration of stopping  for he returns because of the force of his previous efforts 
Just as one produces thoughts when one leaves sleep or the concentration of stopping  so a Tathagata produces thoughts because of the force of the wisdom of skillful methods he has previously cultivated The Bodhisattva Mafijusri addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One should the Transformation body of a Tathagata be described as thinking or not The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Mafijusri and said 
This is so because it does not have any independent thinking but it does have thinking dependent upon others   Tla The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning The Bodhisattva Mafijusri addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One is there any difference between the field of a Tathagata and the sphere of a Tathagata The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Mafijuri and said 
Good son the field of a Tathagata refers to pure Buddha lands adorned with that assembly of incalculable good qualities common to all Tathagatas 
The sphere of a Tathagata refers to the five different kinds of realms  
This is the difference between the two The Bodhisattva Mafijusri addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One what are the characteristics of the supreme awakening of a Tathagata of his turning of the wheel of doctrine of his entering into cessation The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Mafijusri and said Good son these three are characterized by nonduality 
That is to say there is no perfect awakening nor any absence of perfect awakening 
There is no turning of the wheel of doctrine nor absence of turning the wheel of doctrine 
There is no entering into cessation nor absence of entering into cessation 
This is so because of the ultimate purity of the Dharma body of Tathagatas and because of the constant manifestation of the Transformation bodies of Tathagatas The Bodhisattva Mafijusri addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One all varieties of sentient beings gain merit in seeing those Transformation bodies in hearing them and revering them 
Good son the causality of a Tathagata in their regard is that of a dominant objective condition for those Transformation bodies are sustained through the power of the Tathagatas The Bodhisattva Mafijusri addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how is it that without any effort the Dharma body of Tathagatas emits great light for sentient beings  Chapter VIII and sends forth images of unlimited Transformation bodies while the liberation bodies of wordhearers and solitary enlightened ones do not do so The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Mafijusri and said 
Good son it is similar to the fact that the water and fire crystals that come from the disk of the moon and the sun emit a great light without any effort but other water and fire crystals do not do so for because they are sustained upon the august powers of sentient beings because of the dominant force of the actions of sentient beings 
Or it is similar to the fact that a mani jewel crafted by a master craftsman emits the images inscribed upon it whereas one not so crafted does not 
In this manner therefore the Dharma body of Tathagatas polished and perfected through the intense cultivation of the wisdom of methods in the unlimited reality realm is able to emit from itself great light and images of various Transformation bodies 
But that does not occur with the liberation bodies of others The Bodhisattva Mafijusri addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One as you have explained sentient beings in the world of desire are led to be born among the noble families of warriors and brahmins because they are sustained by the august powers of Tathagatas and bodhisattvas In their physical and material wellbeing they lack nothing Whether they take on the form of gods in the world of form or in the world of noform they are able to attain perfection in their physical and material wellbeing 
Worldhonored One what was your underlying intention in this explanation The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Majfijusri and said 
Good son the august sustaining power of Tathagatas and bodhisattvas whether in the path or the practice  is capable in all places of leading sentient beings to obtain perfection in their physical and material wellbeing As appropriate they preach this path and this practice 
Those who are able to and actually do correctly cultivate  b The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning this path and this practice will never lack for such perfection of their physical and material wellbeing 
But for sentient beings who turn away from and reject this path and practice and harbor thoughts of bitterness or anger the physical and material they may have had will dwindle after their lives are over 
You should understand from this not only that the august Tathagatas and bodhisattvas bring about physical and material wellbeing but also how the dwindling of the body and riches comes about for sentient beings The Bodhisattva Mafijusri addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One in all defiled lands and in all pure lands what are those things easy to find 
What are those things difficult to find The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva MajijuSri and said Good son in defiled lands there are eight things easy to find and two difficult to find 
The two things difficult to find are the implementation by bodhisattvas of a high commitment and effort and the appearance of a Tathagata in the world 
Mafijuri understand that the case is exactly opposite in pure lands At that time the Bodhisattva Mafijusri addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how should we designate this doctrinal teaching on explicating mysteries 
How should we revere it The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva MafijuSri and said Good son this teaching is designated the explicit teaching on the action of the Tathagata and you should revere it as such When this explicit teaching on the duty accomplishment of the Tathagata was preached in the great assembly some seventyfive thousand great bodhisattvas all realized the perfected Dharma body 

Sūtra of Aṅgulimālika Translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the Liu Song Dynasty by The Tripiṭaka Master Guṇabhadra from India Fascicle  Thus I have heard At one time the Buddha was outside rāvastī  staying in Jetavana Park which was purchased for the Buddha from Prince Jeta by Anāthapiṇḍika the Elder 
He was accompanied by innumerable BodhisattvaMahāsattvas His four groups of disciples and innumerable gods dragons yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kinaras mahoragas piśācas and rākṣasas as well as the godson SunMoon the four worldprotecting godkings and celestial māras 
At that time the WorldHonored One to widely expound the wondrous Dharma to deliver sentient beings pronounced a mahāvaipulya sūtra called Wielding a Sword 
Good in the beginning in the middle and in the end completely pure and fully revealed good meaning good flavor and the appearance of the Brahma way of pure life 
Not too far north of rāvastī was a village called Sana There lived a poor woman named Bhadrā in the Brahmin caste Her son World Appearance lost his father when he was young At age twenty his body strength and appearance were outstanding and he was intelligent and eloquent 
There was another village called Prahasa Having lived there for a long time was a Brahmin master named Maṇibhadra who had mastered the four Vedas and World Appearance studied under him 
Humble submissive and respectful World Appearance made offerings to him with total devotion 
One day at the invitation of King Prasenajit  Maṇibhadra left his house and told World Appearance to stay there 
World Appearance said to her You are virtually my mother 
How can you do this wicked thing in your house Ashamed and fearful he abandoned his clothes and evaded her 
Because he disobeyed me I want to end his life so that he cannot marry Consumed by burning desire like a disease she scratched her body with her fingernails 
So I know that he has the power of great virtue After pondering he said to World Appearance You are shamefully honored by evil men and are not a true Brahmin You should kill a thousand people to expunge your sin World Appearance was by nature humbly obedient 
Respectful of his teachers words he said Alas Preceptor killing a thousand people is not something I should do His teacher asked him You are an evil man 
Do you not aspire to becoming a Brahmin and being reborn in heaven He answered Very well Preceptor at your command I will kill a thousand people Then he prostrated himself at his teachers feet 
His teacher marveled at his obedience and said Because you are a hugely evil man you will not be killed Then he thought I will let him die  He told World Appearance From every person you have killed take a finger 
After you have killed a thousand people use their fingers to make a garland wear it and come back 
Then you can become a Brahmin World Appearance said to his teacher Very well Preceptor I will follow your instruction Then he killed nine hundred ninetynine people short of a thousand by only one and became known as Aṅgulimāla  
At that time Aṅgulimālas mother thought that her son might be hungry She took four kinds of fine food and went to give to him 
When he saw his mother  he thought I should enable my mother to be reborn in heaven He drew his sword and went to kill her 
At that time a tree called aśoka  ten yojanas less ten feet from rāvastī 
When Aṅgulimāla saw the WorldHonored One approaching he drew his sword and quickly charged forward He thought I will kill this śramaṇa called Gautama When the WorldHonored walked away Aṅgulimāla spoke in verse 
Stand still stand still great śramaṇa the prince of King uddhodana I am Aṅgulimāla and must take a finger of Yours

Stand still stand still great śramaṇa the one who conquers the arrogance of the godking Indra asuras and rākṣasas

Stand still stand still great śramaṇa I am tired now And cannot catch up with You But I must take a finger of Yours 
Stand still stand still great śramaṇa Because You observe well the pure precepts You should quickly relinquish a finger of Yours Not to cross me 
Then the WorldHonored One like a gooseking walked seven steps and looked about like a lion He spoke to Aṅgulimāla in verse Abide abide Aṅgulimāla abide in the pure precepts I am a SamyakSabuddha and give you the sword of wisdom 
You are Aṅgulimāla and I am a SamyakSabuddha I now give you the water of the unsurpassed good Dharma You should drink it quickly to end forever your thirst for birth and death

You are Aṅgulimāla and I am a SamyakSabuddha I now give you the water of the unsurpassed good Dharma You should drink it quickly to end forever your thirst for birth and death Abide abide Aṅgulimāla abide in the pure precepts 
Using yourself as an example do not kill and do not tell others to kill As self and others are no different so too are others and self 
Using yourself as an example do not kill and do not tell others to kill Do not assume the form of a rākṣasa who smears its body with human blood 
Do not wield a sharp sword stained with human blood Quickly cast away your finger garland and end the karma of a double life 
Your double life does not accord with the Dharma but is that of an evil rākṣasa Even a lamb knows devotion to its mother 
Sadly you are pitiable because you were misguided by an evil teacher Wielded a sharp sword and killed those born to live  
The karma you have done is more evil than that done by animal predators Your killings surpass a rākṣasas 
You will enter the gang of evil māras and be forever separate from humans Denounce the rebellious evil one who does not requite his mothers kindness 
She carries protects and nourishes him in her womb for twelve months After he is born she nurses him and endures his filth day and night 
Observe your mother who is shedding bloody tears Out of love and concern for you she has brought you food in person 
Her hair is disarrayed by wind and her body is soiled by dust Her hands and feet are cracked revealing the suffering of her deteriorating body 
Long distressed by hunger and thirst through winter and summer Her mind is perturbed as she laments her suffering 
When Aṅgulimālas mother heard the dialogue between the BuddhaBhagavān and her son and saw that her sons mind was subjugated because he lowered his menacing arm concerned for her son she spoke to the Buddha in verse Today a longlost treasure store is recovered My eyes impaired by dust and filth have become bright and clear How sad that my sons mind was deranged As he smeared his body with human blood 
Constantly holding a sharp sword in his hand He killed many people who became a pile of corpses I would like my son to follow me To reverently bow down to the SamyakSabuddha Many who see me scold me in foul language Because I have such a son 
Then the WorldHonored One told Aṅgulimāla Under this tree is your mother who gave birth to you and reared you Her great kindness is hard for you to requite How can you kill her to have her be reborn in heaven 
Aṅgulimāla whoever claims that nondharma is dharma is like a thirsty deer that seeks water in a mirage in springtime Likewise are you Because you follow an evil teachers instruction you are confused Whoever does nondharma and claims that it is dharma after death will fall into the indiscriminate hell 
Aṅgulimāla come quickly to take refuge in the Tathāgata 
Aṅgulimāla have no fear 
The Tathāgatas great lovingkindness is the place of no fear He regards all sentient beings equally as Rāhula  and cures their diseases For those without reliance He serves as their reliance 
The stability of the Tathāgata is their rest place For those without kin He serves as their kin For those in poverty He serves as their treasure store To those who have lost the Buddha path He indicates the unsurpassed path 
For those in fear he serves as their protector For those adrift He serves as their ship 
You should quickly cast away your sharp sword and renounce family life to train to attain bodhi You should prostrate yourself at your mothers feet to repent and cleanse  Earnestly request her permission to renounce family life in order to deliver her from her suffering in the Three Realms of Existence 
I now approve your renouncement of family life and your acceptance of the complete monastic precepts You now should drink the Dharma water like sweet dew You are tired after long roaming in confusion on the evil path You now should rest 
You will become a giver like me to give benefits to all those who abide by the law and enable them to cross the ocean of birth and death Forthwith Aṅgulimāla cast away his sharp sword 
As a yearling infant recoils at once when he touches fire and cries as his hands tremble likewise Aṅgulimāla cast away his finger garland at once and cried aloud as his hands trembled 
If a man in deep sleep is bitten on the foot by a snake he immediately awakens and casts the snake far away 
Likewise Aṅgulimāla cast away his finger garland 
Then Aṅgulimāla as if having exorcized possession by a nonhuman regained his sense of shame and sense of dishonor His entire body sweated blood and his tears poured like rain 
As a good doctor recites a mantra to a patient bitten by a snake to have him slither like a snake so Aṅgulimāla slithered on his abdomen in a circle thirtynine times 
Then he moved forward prostrated himself at the Buddhas feet and spoke in verse Amazing The Sabuddha the one who possesses the foremost lovingkindness The tamer and teacher of men comes to me To enable me to cross the ocean of ignorance Which abounds with dark waves of delusion and confusion 
Amazing The Sabuddha the one who possesses the foremost compassion The teacher and tamer of men comes to me To deliver me from the wilderness of birth and death Which abounds with the thorn brushes of various afflictions 
Amazing The Sabuddha the one who possesses the foremost sympathetic joy The teacher and tamer of men comes to me To deliver me from my delusions Caused by the wrong views like the perils of tigers wolves and other predators 
Amazing The Sabuddha the one who possesses the foremost equability The teacher and tamer of men comes to me To deliver me from the indiscriminate hell And save me from immeasurable suffering For those without reliance He serves as their reliance 
For those without kin He serves as their kin He now comes to me to be my refuge Though I am laden with evil karmas and bound for tremendous suffering 
Then the WorldHonored One told Aṅgulimāla Rise quickly go to your mother earnestly repent and request her permission to renounce family life Aṅgulimāla rose from his place at the Buddhas feet and went to his mother 
I now take refuge in my mother And take refuge in the BuddhaBhagavān I bow down at my mothers feet And request her permission to renounce family life 
His mother answered in verse I now give you permission To renounce family life for the sake of your next life I also beseech the Tathāgata to permit me To renounce family and accept the complete monastic precepts 
Amazing inconceivable The Tathāgata is beyond analogy The Buddha who now delivers my son Pities all in the world 
His sublime physical body And virtues are unparalleled 
 Sūtra of Aṅgulimālika Translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the Liu Song Dynasty by The Tripiṭaka Master Guṇabhadra from India Fascicle  Then the BrahmaKing ikhin the ruler of this Sahā World emitted vast radiance to illuminate the city of rāvastī Singlemindedly he joined his palms and bowed down at the Buddhas feet After making offerings to the Tathāgata and Aṅgulimāla he spoke in verse Amazing 
As an analogy when a venomous snake sees a mantra master it spews venom But he has no fear and tames it to make it quiet Likewise the great master in the Three Realms of Existence Has tamed the atrocious Aṅgulimāla 
I now bow down to the physician of the Three Realms of Existence whose great spiritual power is inconceivable I now bow down to the sovereign king whose establishings are extraordinary 
Because there is no analogy for His utmost excellent works He is called the beyondanalogy honored one 
Now Aṅgulimāla does excellent karmas and tamely abides in the precepts and extreme quietness His body and mind are stable and fearless Just as ones true nature is golden Like the pure and wonderful Jambūnada gold 
I pray that the Tathāgata out of pity will accept my offerings And command Aṅgulimāla to don a celestial garment So that I will attain great bodhi When he dons this robe to protect his Brahma way of life His ultimate pure mind will remain motionless 
Aṅgulimāla said to the Brahmaking Who are you speaking these superfluous divisive words Your saying that Aṅgulimāla should don your robe to practice the Brahma way of life for a long time is an insult You are an evil Brahma god not an image of Brahmā 
You a mosquito mention Brahma What is meant by Brahma 
What is meant by worldly Brahma karma 
Why would I don a mosquitos garment to practice the Brahma way of life 
Nor would I be a servant take others orders or be a debtor As a trapeze flyer quickly flies to and fro in the sky likewise you a puny mosquito after enjoying the pleasures in your Brahma heaven will fall to this human world 
You do not know the true merit of a Bodhisattvas rebirth here but take nondharma as dharma Gods like you are unaware of the deluded turning of the wheel of birth and death 
Alas BrahmaKing do you truly know good versus evil 
You say that Aṅgulimāla has done huge evil karmas How do you a mosquito an evil Brahma know that 
You should learn to take Bodhisattva actions The Brahmaking answered You killed nine hundred ninetynine people short of a thousand by only one 
If you are not an aggressive one where can a truly aggressive one be found 
If you are not an evil māra where can a truly evil māra be found 
Aṅgulimāla do not abandon selfrestraint but use skillful means to obliterate your evil karmas 
The Tathāgata has truly great compassion which can deliver even atrocious sentient beings such as Aṅgulimāla Aṅgulimāla said to the Brahmaking Evil Brahma mosquito where will you go 
Where will you go round and round in confusion 
You do not know that evil sentient beings after death go down evil lifepaths 
As an analogy someone goes to a forest at night He sees fireflies on the trees and is terrified He returns to the city and tells others That forest is burning Then people go there and see fireflies not a fire 
It is the same with you an evil Brahma god You declare I am deluded to deceive yourself and others Later on you and others will come to know that ones delusion is illusory 
As an analogy a deluded man goes to a forest When he sees the flowers of the aśoka trees he takes them as fire He returns to the city and tells others That forest is burning Then people go there and see that there is no fire 
It is the same with you a puny mosquito Later on you and others will come to know that good and evil are illusory Do not speak such untrue words again 
You should keep quiet and not tell lies Then the four worldprotecting godkings came to the Buddha After making great offerings to the Buddha and Aṅgulimāla they spoke to them in verse 
Amazing So extraordinary Today the hero of this world fought a great battle He answered questions about the highest truth And used wisdom light to dispel the darkness of ignorance 
Amazing The tamer of men the unsurpassed teacher of gods and humans Because of His immeasurable power is called the Tathāgata 
He is the foremost padma  completely pure and soft Untainted by dust or water 
Now Aṅgulimāla is excellent like the moon in the sky He is stately and his observance of the precepts is perfect 
Aṅgulimāla said to the four worldprotecting godkings What kind of mosquitoes or small insects are you 
Because you protect the world you exalt yourselves Your saying that you will give me a celestial bowl as alms is an insult 
Although you now see my tribulations you soon will see yourselves holding pottery vessels 
He who is called a world protector claims that he can tame evil ones Actually whoever is called a protector protects the true Dharma  not the world 
As an analogy someone hears the sound of a kañjala and sees its shape Then he sees a crow and gets confused He keeps calling it kañjala kañjala It is the same with you You take nondharma as dharma and safeguard it just like that person who sees a crow and calls it kañjala 
You should protect the Dharma not the world 
You four mosquito godkings should keep quiet Then Pāpīyān the evil māraking came to the Buddha After making offerings to the Buddha he stood aside and spoke to Aṅgulimāla in verse You should quickly renounce family life as a hoax and enter my city I do not care about you but will let you evade naraka  
Aṅgulimāla answered in verse Go far away thieving dog māra who speaks like a fearless mosquito Before you are bound by five fetters Pāpīyān quickly go away Do not force me to instantly kick a vile dog with my left foot 
As a goldenwinged garuḍaking dwells atop Mount Sumeru And observes dragons frolicking in the vast ocean Likewise a Bodhisattva dwells above hell Joyfully drinks the water of liberation and observes suffering sentient beings 
You thieving dog māra should keep quiet and intently listen to the Dharma like drinking sweet dew Then return to heaven and do whatever you want 
Then the Brahmaking Maheśvara made great offerings to the Tathāgata and Aṅgulimāla and stood aside With joy and respect he praised in verse I now bow down at the feet of the WorldHonored One and speak stanzas with joy and respect The Tathāgatas sublime physical body is like an utpala  
His white teeth are like a kumuda  and his pure eyes are like thousandpetaled flowers His wisdom is taint free purer than a puṇḍarīka  Amazing Aṅgulimāla is excellent and so extraordinary 
Although abiding on the ground of ordinary beings he has tamed that māra He will quickly attain sabodhi and rescue all in the world 
Aṅgulimāla answered in verse On what lowly lifepath are you falsely calling yourself Maheśvara 
śvara is a false name because you are not truly a sovereign king 
How do you know whether I abide on the ground of ordinary beings 
Longtoothed piśāca quickly answer my question 
Suppose that a mange victim with an unsightly body Widely prescribes for the world the cure for mange 
Unable to cure his own disease how can he cure others diseases 
Likewise is a puny mosquitos delusion 
If you do not know your true nature how can you know others minds And say that Aṅgulimāla abides on the ground of ordinary beings 
You should not be empowered to be a sovereign king To see  the ignorant should keep quiet 
Then the god of the tree under which the Tathāgata sat saw Aṅgulimāla and respect and faith rose in her heart She praised in verse Come quickly Aṅgulimāla the brave wise and firm one I ask you to don the Dharma robe and I will offer you your first meal 
Aṅgulimāla answered in verse The Tathāgata has never eaten anything nor have the voicehearers To whom are you giving alms 
Speak quickly to resolve my doubts 
The tree god challenged him in verse As the Tathāgata regularly eats food so too do voicehearers If you firmly decide to renounce family life you should not tell lies You should discard falsity and fawning which are impure 
If one oversteps even one dharma it becomes a lie Then one cannot transcend the world but will do evil 
Aṅgulimāla answered in verse You are on a lowly lifepath and what do you want to do 
You should observe yourself because the Buddha speaks ill of women Who in the world tells lies and who speaks the truth 
Who in the world is greedy for food and who in the world falls ill and dies 
The Tathāgata possesses all the virtues of a vast self If one says something that one cannot know this is a lie 
If one does not eat food but claims that one does this is a lie If one says that one does not understand veiled words this is a lie If one has not even renounced family life how can one accept the complete monastic precepts 
I do not overstep a single dharma while you overstep countless dharmas Go quickly to the god of gods to repent of your false speech 
The tree god challenged him in verse Why do you say that I am on a lowly lifepath 
Not yet having discarded the way of a piśāca how can you know that I am male or female 
Aṅgulimāla answered in verse As an analogy a WheelTurning King possesses a jeweladorned throne If a dog lies on it even temporarily it becomes impure 
You possess a lowly nature and live a life of convenience You assume a female body and indulge in the pleasures of the five desires 
You should use skillful means to quickly abandon your body which is as lowly as a female dogs body You should discard male or female appearances and train to realize the emptiness of dharmas Once you realize their emptiness you will quickly acquire a mans nature 
Then the venerable āriputra and Mahāmaudgalyāyana like goosekings used their transcendental powers to soar across the sky They came to the Buddha bowed down at His feet and stood aside When they saw Aṅgulimāla sympathetic joy rose in their hearts and Mahāmaudgalyāyana praised in verse Outstanding 
You should quickly follow the Buddha to renounce family life and observe the pure precepts Accompanied by those who practice the Brahma way of life you can soar across the sky to Jetavana Park 
As you soar in the sky like a gooseking you will be radiant and pure like the full moon 
What are transcendental powers in the world and what are their roots 
The one honored as possessing the foremost transcendental powers Speak quickly to resolve my doubts 
Mahāmaudgalyāyana answered in verse If one practices pure relinquishment one often gives away shoes and vehicles as alms If a bhikṣu observes the pure precepts he stays far away from dissipation For these two reasons one quickly acquires transcendental powers 
Aṅgulimāla again spoke in verse Alas Mahāmaudgalyāyana practices the way of a mosquito And cannot discern the truly foremost transcendental powers 
One should constantly practice benefiting oneself and others and wish to bring others peace If one trains in these skillful means one will quickly acquire superior transcendental powers 
One should comfort Dharma expounders and those who endure tribulations If one sacrifices ones body to save and protect others one will quickly acquire superior transcendental powers 
I now should take quick action to widely deliver sentient beings When I arrive at Jetavana Park I will acquire great transcendental powers 
Immeasurable and boundless are Tathāgatas 
After speaking these stanzas Aṅgulimāla asked āriputra in verse Why is āriputra honored in the world as one with great wisdom Whence does wisdom arise 
Speak quickly to resolve my doubts 
āriputra answered in verse Faithful observance of the five precepts bring great wisdom After ones death wisdom always comes with ones rebirth As ones renown travels far ones wisdom remains motionless 
Aṅgulimāla again spoke in verse Praising that Tathāgatas are eternal brings one great wisdom The Buddha says that great wisdom enables one to expound the Dharma 
Alas āriputra practices the way of a mosquito And does not know the true meaning of wisdom Crude is a mosquitos wisdom and the ignorant should keep quiet 
Then the venerable nanda came to the Buddha He bowed down at the Buddhas feet and stood aside When he saw Aṅgulimāla sympathetic joy rose in his heart and he praised in verse Very good 
I now express sympathetic joy over his mastering sūtras in the nine categories 
Aṅgulimāla asked in verse The Tathāgata praises you as foremost in hearing much  
What is meant by hearing much  and whence does it arise 
nanda answered in verse Recite and study sūtras in the nine categories and without stinginess expound them to others From these practices one hears much  and ones total retention of it is inconceivable 
Aṅgulimāla again spoke in verse Whoever praises that Tathāgatas are eternal Is called foremost in hearing much  
Alas nanda practices the way of a mosquito And does not know how to hear much  
Then the venerable Rāhula came to the Buddha He bowed down at the Buddhas feet and stood aside When he saw Aṅgulimāla sympathetic joy rose in his heart and he praised in verse Very good 
I now express sympathetic joy over his respecting the precepts 
Aṅgulimāla asked in verse The Tathāgata praises you as foremost in respecting the precepts 
What is meant by respecting the pure precepts 
You are the Buddhas beloved son Speak quickly to resolve my doubts 
Rāhula answered in verse Intently and respectfully observe all precepts pronounced by the Buddha This is the foremost way to respect the precepts 
Aṅgulimāla again spoke in verse Saying that Tathāgatas are eternal Is called the highest way to respect the precepts 
Alas Rāhula practices the way of a mosquito And does not know the truly foremost way to respect the precepts 
Then Aniruddha came to the Buddha He bowed down at the Buddhas feet and stood aside When he saw Aṅgulimāla sympathetic joy rose in his heart and he praised in verse Amazing 
I now express sympathetic joy over his soon acquiring the god eye 
Aṅgulimāla asked in verse The Tathāgata praises you as the one with the foremost god eye 
What is the god eye and how is it acquired 
Speak quickly to resolve my doubts 
Aniruddha answered in verse Always give away bright lamps as alms and expound the Dharma to develop others From these practices one acquires the god eye to see faraway things hindrance free 
Aṅgulimāla again spoke in verse Diligently expounding the Tathāgatas profound Dharma store by skillful means With full disclosure and without concealment brings one the most excellent eye 
Alas Aniruddha practices the way of a mosquito And does not know the skillful means to acquire the god eye 
Then the venerable śramaṇa Dravya came to the Buddha He bowed down at the Buddhas feet and stood aside When he saw Aṅgulimāla sympathetic joy rose in his heart and he praised in verse Amazing 
I now express sympathetic joy over his training in enduring adversity 
Aṅgulimāla asked in verse How does one acquire the foremost endurance 
How does ones endurance of adversity arise 
Speak quickly to resolve my doubts 
The śramaṇa Dravya answered in verse Whether ones right arm is smeared with sandalwood or ones left hand is cut by a sharp knife If ones mind remains equable and motionless ones foremost endurance arises Then one can endure superior selfrestraint in the world 
Aṅgulimāla again spoke in verse If one reveals the Tathāgata store to the world One can enable those who hold the wrong views to discard their selfview and train to realize that dharmas have no self One should declare that this is the Buddhas true Dharma so that they will not dread to hear it 
One should discard arrogance and attachment to ones body and life to widely expound the Tathāgata store This is called enduring superior selfrestraint in the world 
The śramaṇa Dravya practices the way of a mosquito And does not know the skillful means to acquire the highest endurance 
Even a mosquito can endure hunger thirst heat cold and pain Crude is a mosquitos endurance and the ignorant should keep quiet 
Then the venerable PūrṇaMaitrāyaṇīputra came to the Buddha He bowed down at the Buddhas feet and stood aside When he saw Aṅgulimāla sympathetic joy rose in his heart and he praised in verse Very good 
Aṅgulimāla asked in verse The Tathāgata praises you as foremost in expounding the Dharma 
What is meant by expounding Dharma and what is meant by knowing its meaning 
I pray that you will expound the Dharma to resolve my doubts 
PūrṇaMaitrāyaṇīputra answered in verse There are things never found by Buddhas and holy voicehearers The truly enlightened one understands well what this means and widely expounds it to sentient beings What does this stanza mean 
It means that all past Buddhas delved into all dharmas by skillful means and found neither the realm of sentient beings nor a self  a person a sentient being or an everlasting soul that all present and future Buddhas do delve and will delve into all dharmas by skill means and do not and will not find these things that all past present and future Pratyekabuddas and holy voicehearers delved do delve and will delve into all dharmas by skillful means and did not do not and will not find these things Therefore I tell sentient beings to discard the realm of sentient beings and a self a person a sentient being or an everlasting soul because dharmas are empty and have no self 
In this way I expound the Dharma Aṅgulimāla said to PūrṇaMaitrāyaṇīputra Alas PūrṇaMaitrāyaṇīputra practices the way of a mosquito and does not know how to expound the Dharma 
Alas an ignorant mosquito does not know that the Tathāgatas teaching that dharmas have no self is a veiled teaching It is like a moth throwing itself into the flame of the lamp of ignorance 
Actually what BuddhaTathāgatas never find means that all past BuddhaBhagavāns looked into all sentient beings by skillful means and did not find the absence of their Tathāgata store that all present BuddhaBhagavāns look into all sentient beings by skillful means and do not find the absence of their true self that all future Buddhas will look into all sentient beings by skillful means and will not find the absence of their true nature that all past present and future Pratyekabuddhas and holy voicehearers looked do look and will look into all sentient beings by skillful means and did not do not and will not find the absence of their Tathāgata store 
This is the true meaning of the Buddhas stanza Moreover what BuddhaTathāgatas never find means that all past BuddhaTathāgatas delved do delve and will delve into all dharmas by skillful means and did not do not and will not find a self imagined by the world to have various features such as its size being that of a thumb a grain of rice a sesame seed a wheat berry or a mustard seed its color being blue yellow red or white its shape being square round long or short 
Some say that ones self is in ones heart or above or below ones navel some say that it is in ones head eyes or body parts some say that it permeates ones body like sweat some say that it is constantly in peace and joy and at rest Such countless diverse deluded thoughts are the worldly way to identify ones self All Buddhas Pratyekabuddhas and holy voicehearers never find such a self and the truly enlightened one explains this to sentient beings This is the true meaning of the Tathāgatas stanza not what you just explained according to your deluded thinking 
Moreover what BuddhaTathāgatas never find means that all past BuddhaBhagavāns sought by skillful means and did not find the action of the Tathāgata store because the Tathāgata in every sentient being by nature has no action but has immeasurable purity and majesty and countless good characteristics that all present BuddhaBhagavāns seek by skillful means and do not find the action of ones Tathāgata store because the Tathāgata in every sentient being by nature has no action but has immeasurable purity and majesty and countless good characteristics that all future BuddhaBhagavāns will seek by skillful means and will not find the action of ones Tathāgata store because the Tathāgata in every sentient being by nature has no action but has immeasurable purity and majesty and countless good characteristics 
All past present and future Pratyekabuddhas and holy voicehearers did not do not and will not see with their eyes the Tathāgata store in their bodies 
There is a reason For example because Rāhula respects the precepts when he observes pure water he does not understand that he sees an insect  He wonders whether it is an insect not an insect or a dust particle 
After intently observing for a long time he gradually comes to see the tiny insect as it is 
It is the same with a Bodhisattva on the tenth ground When he observes his true nature in his body he entertains countless different views of this nature Because it is hard to enter ones Tathāgata store it is hard to comfort a Dharma expounder In the blazingly evil world not sparing his body or life he expounds the Tathāgata store to sentient beings 
Aniruddha possesses the foremost god eye and truly and clearly sees bird tracks in the sky which cannot be seen by those who possess only the physical eye However they believe that Aniruddha sees bird tracks  Likewise Pratyekabuddhas voicehearers and ordinary beings with the physical eye believe that they have the Tathāgata store because it is stated in the Buddhas sūtras How can they see their Buddha nature as Buddhas do 
Even Pratyekabuddhas and holy voicehearers come to believe it because of their trust in a source How can ordinary beings like the born blind know on their own without learning about it from others 
I heard from a past Buddha that in the initial kalpa of this world the earth contained four flavors Those who tasted these four flavors then still eat dirt now because they do not abandon their longtime practice 
It is the same with those who trained under past Tathāgatas to observe their Tathāgata store Because of their longtime training they now still believe it with delight and train through the long night to requite the Tathāgatas kindness 
When they hear about ones Tathāgata store from a future Dharma expounder they will also believe it with delight Those who believe with delight are the Tathāgatas sons and will requite His kindness 
As an analogy since the distant past an owl has had no sense of shame and has never requited its mothers kindness Even now it never abandons its longtime habit 
It is the same with sentient beings Because in their past lives they had no sense of shame and no sense of dishonor they continue in this way from the past to the present and to the future Likewise because they did not believe it with delight when they heard about ones Tathāgata store they continue in this way from the past to the present and to the future 
As an analogy an ugly monkey is constantly in fear and its mind is restless like raging waves Because its past habit it continues to be restless 
It is the same with sentient beings whose minds were are and will be restless in the past present and future When they hear about ones Tathāgata store they do not believe it with delight 
As a horned owl that sees better by night than by day prefers dark to light likewise sentient beings prefer evil to good and throughout past present and future do not delight in seeing a Buddha or believing in ones Tathāgata store 
Because a person has acquired the wrong views through the long night and is attached to the wrong doctrines of those on the wrong paths he now does not abandon his past habit It is the same with those who have long studied the veiled teaching that dharmas have no self 
Suppose that someone encountered Buddhas in the past made offerings to Them served Them and heard about ones Tathāgata store even as briefly as a finger snap Because of this good karma his faculties became skilled and he enjoyed unrestricted wealth and rank In this life sentient beings like him also have skilled faculties and enjoy unrestricted wealth and rank 
Because in the past they briefly heard about ones Tathāgata store from Buddhas when they hear about it in the future they will believe it with delight and train according to the teachings heard Their faculties will be skilled their wealth and rank will be unrestricted their body will be strong their wisdom will be radiant and their Brahma tones will be pure and loved by all They will become a WheelTurning King a prince or a great minister They will possess worthy virtues and be free from arrogance and conceit 
They will acquire other merits and will even become the godking akra or one of the four worldprotecting godkings Because of the merit they acquired by hearing about the Tathāgata store their body will always be stable free from illness and trouble Their lifespan will be prolonged and they will be loved and respected by all They will fully hear the sweetdew teaching that a Tathāgata constantly abides in the great parinirvāṇa and firmly and stably abides in the world in accord with the worldly ways 
They will know that a Tathāgata is not born from desire but born to widely expound the Dharma to the world Through the benefits of their wisdom and merit wherever they will be reborn they will be reborn into an excellent clan and family and have many children and grandchildren and their parents will live long Throughout past present and future they will always enjoy all pleasures in heaven or in the human world because they have heard that the Tathāgata store forever abides in every sentient being 
If sentient beings on the five lifepaths have missing limbs and undergo all kinds of suffering as they transmigrate through birth and death throughout past present and future it is because they have slighted ones Tathāgata store 
If sentient beings serve Buddhas and stay close and make offerings to Them then they will come to hear about ones Tathāgata store If they accept it believe it with delight do not malign it and truly comfort the expounder know that they are Tathāgatas 
If sentient beings go against Buddhas or malign ones Tathāgata store when they hear about it they burn away their seeds 
Alas pain pain 
The nonbelievers in the three time frames are so pitiable In this way a Dharma expounder should give teachings and praise the truth of a Tathāgatas eternity 
If he does not do so he abandons ones Tathāgata store This person should not sit on a lion throne Like a caṇḍāla  he should not ride a great kings elephant 
All Buddhas seek the birth of ones Tathāgata store by skillful means and never find it because no birth is Buddha nature which exists in every sentient being has countless excellent characteristics and is pure and majestic 
All Buddhas seek the untruth of ones true nature by skillful means and never find it because truth is ones Buddha nature which exists in every sentient being has countless excellent characteristics and is pure and majestic 
All Buddhas seek the impermanence of ones true nature by skillful means and never find it because permanence is ones Buddha nature which exists in every sentient being has countless excellent characteristics and is pure and majestic 
All Buddhas seek the instability of ones Tathāgata store by skillful means and never find it because stability is ones Buddha nature which exists in every sentient being has countless excellent characteristics and is pure and majestic 
All Buddhas seek the change in ones Tathāgata store by skillful means and never find it because no change is ones Buddha nature which exists in every sentient being has countless excellent characteristics and is pure and majestic 
All Buddhas seek the inquietude of ones Tathāgata store by skillful means and never find it because quietude is ones Buddha nature which exists in every sentient being has countless excellent characteristics and is pure and majestic 
All Buddhas seek the destruction of ones Tathāgata store by skillful means and never find it because no destruction is ones Buddha nature which exists in every sentient being has countless excellent characteristics and is pure and majestic 
All Buddhas seek the damage to ones Tathāgata store by skillful means and never find it because no damage is ones Buddha nature which exists in every sentient being has countless excellent characteristics and is pure and majestic 
All Buddhas seek the illness of ones Tathāgata store by skillful means and never find it because no illness is ones Buddha nature which exists in every sentient being has countless excellent characteristics and is pure and majestic 
All Buddhas seek the aging and death of ones Tathāgata store by skillful means and never find them because no aging and no death are ones Buddha nature which exists in every sentient being has countless excellent characteristics and is pure and majestic All Buddhas seek the impurity of ones Tathāgata store by skillful means and never find it because purity is ones Buddha nature which exists in every sentient being has countless excellent characteristics and is pure and majestic 
As oil does not mix with water likewise ones Buddha nature never mixes with ones afflictions though ones countless afflictions shroud ones Tathāgata nature Hence ones Buddha nature abides in ones afflictions like a lamp contained in a bottle 
When the bottle is broken the lamp is revealed The bottle means ones afflictions and the lamp means ones Tathāgata store An expounder of ones Tathāgata store whether a Tathāgata a Bodhisattva or a voicehearer with or without afflictions expounds it according to his ability 
PūrṇaMaitrāyaṇīputra I say that such an expounder is a truly enlightened one who can shatter the hearers bottle of a koṭi afflictions enabling him to see his true nature like seeing an āmra in his palm 
As an analogy when the sun or moon is covered by dense clouds its light is obscured When the clouds are removed its radiance illuminates 
It is the same with ones Tathāgata store When it is shrouded by ones afflictions it is unseen when ones afflictions are removed its radiance illuminates everywhere Ones Buddha nature is radiant and pure like the sun or moon 
Alas PūrṇaMaitrāyaṇīputra practices the way of a mosquito and does not know how to expound the Dharma He should quietly scurry away 
Then SundaraNanda came to the Buddha He bowed down at the Buddhas feet and stood aside When he saw Aṅgulimāla sympathetic joy rose in his heart and he praised in verse Very good 
He should use skillful means to acquire a Tathāgatas sublime physical body 
Aṅgulimāla asked in verse The WorldHonored One praises your respectable looks as foremost 
What respectable looks are extraordinary 
What is the cause of ones respectable looks 
Explain now to resolve my doubts 
SundaraNanda answered in verse Wash ones hands and join ten fingers Bow down to a Buddhas śarīras  Always make offerings to the ill From these practices one acquires respectable looks 
Aṅgulimāla again spoke in verse As a Buddhas body has no tendons or bones how can it produce śarīras 
Although a Tathagata is apart from śarīras His dharma body possesses excellent skillful means 
He is inconceivable because He enables nonbelievers to believe with delight Using skillful means He displays His śarīras Leaving śarīras behind by skillful means is the way of Buddhas 
The world has always made offerings to various images of The Brahmaking Maheśvara godsons and goddessdaughters Because they are not ones refuge one erects a memorial pagoda to enshrine a Buddhas śarīras 
If sentient beings understand this skillful means Their applied wisdomknowledge is the cause of their respectable looks 
What you just said is a deluded guess of the cause of ones respectable looks 
Alas SundaraNanda does not know the door to ones respectable looks 
Then the venerable Upāli came to the Buddha He bowed down at the Buddhas feet and stood aside When he saw Aṅgulimāla sympathetic joy rose in his heart and he praised in verse Amazing 
Aṅgulimāla asked in verse The Tathāgata praises you as foremost in upholding the Vinaya 
How does one uphold the Vinaya 
Speak quickly to resolve my doubts 
Upāli answered in verse Never do evil always do good Train ones mind by skillful means This is the way to uphold the Vinaya 
Aṅgulimāla again spoke in verse If an evil bhikṣu against the Vinaya sabotages the Dharma or violates the precepts He should be stripped of a bhikṣus six things and all necessities of life He should be punished dispelled and tamed by skillful means The Brahma way of life precludes violation of the precepts 
As an analogy a great king treasures his saber used to protect his body If it falls into a slaughter house it should be forcefully retrieved The things treasured by a king should not belong to an evil man 
Likewise the things kept by those who practice the Brahma way of life Should not belong to someone who sabotages the Dharma and should be taken from him This is called the foremost way to uphold the Vinaya 
Do not commit any duṣkṛta or exhibit the wrong deportments Whoever upholds the Vinaya in this way fully upholds the Tathāgatas teachings 
The Tathāgata regards all as Rāhula  Alas Upāli practices the way of a mosquito And does not know how to well uphold the Vinaya 
Then Mañjuśrī the Dharma Prince came to the Buddha He bowed down at the Buddhas feet and stood aside When he saw Aṅgulimāla sympathetic joy rose in his heart and he praised in verse Very good 
He should train to realize the great emptiness to see that dharmas are nonexistent 
What is meant by seeing that dharmas are empty 
What is meant by seeing that their emptiness is empty 
Speak now to resolve my doubts 
Dharmas are like the open sky and are a Tathāgatas wondrous dharma body Wisdom is like the open sky and is a Tathāgatas great wisdom body A Tathāgatas hindrancefree wisdom cannot be grasped or touched 
Liberation is like the open sky which has no appearance of existence A Tathāgatas liberation is empty and nonexistent 
How can you Aṅgulimāla understand this 
Aṅgulimāla again spoke in verse As an analogy a fool sees hailstones and thinks deluded thoughts Mistaking them for aquamarine beads he takes them home He places them in a bottle and guards them as if they are treasures 
Then he thinks that true aquamarine is also empty Likewise Mañjuśrī trains to see the utter emptiness And constantly ponders their emptiness to destroy all dharmas Although liberation is actually not empty he thinks that it is utterly empty 
As that person sees hailstones disappear he indiscriminately decides that true treasures too will disappear 
Having seen their emptiness you declare that dharmas that are not empty are empty Some dharmas are empty some dharmas are not empty 
All afflictions are like hailstones And destroying all evil is like hailstones melting 
True aquamarine is like a Tathāgatas forever abiding True aquamarine is like a Buddhas liberation While Buddhas take the open sky as Their form riders of the Two Vehicles nonform While Buddhas take liberation as Their form riders of the Two Vehicles nonform 
Mañjuśrī should intently ponder and differentiate 
As an analogy in an empty village the river is dry and vessels contain no water However emptiness does not mean the empty space in a vessel 
A Tathāgatas true liberation is not empty Because liberation is free from all faults It is said to be empty 
Likewise a Tathāgata is actually not empty Because He has left behind all afflictions and the form of a god or human He is said to be empty 
Alas the way of a mosquito does not know the true meaning of emptiness Even nonBuddhists such as Nirgranthas attempt to realize emptiness and they should keep quiet 
Aṅgulimāla why do you intimidate voicehearers and scorn Buddhasons You wantonly display your atrocious behavior and roar like a ferocious tiger Who is practicing the mosquitos way and voicing such evil sounds 
Aṅgulimāla answered in verse As an analogy a poor and timid person wanders a wilderness When he smells a ferocious tiger he is terrified and scurries away 
Likewise a voicehearer or Pratyekabuddha who does not know the Mahāyāna Is terrified when he smells a Bodhisattva 
As an analogy when a lionking roams the mountain and roars All other animals are terrified 
Likewise when a Bodhisattva a hero among men roars a lions roar All voicehearers and Pratyekabuddhas are terrified Because through the long night they have trained to see that dharmas have no self Unaware that this is a veiled teaching 
Even if I howled a jackals howl no one could reply Not to mention replying to my unequaled lions roar 
Mañjuśrī asked in verse You are a puny mosquito that did evil If you were a Bodhisattva where could a māra be found 
Alas people in the world have no selfawareness Unable to reflect upon their own faults they see only others evil 
Aṅgulimāla how many sins have you committed 
Aṅgulimāla answered in verse Alas there are two kinds of people who sabotage the true Dharma Those who declare that all dharmas are utterly empty and those who declare that dharmas have a self 
These two kinds of people sabotage the Buddhas true Dharma Alas Mañjuśrī you do not know that some evil is not evil 
Nor do you know Bodhisattva actions or that a mosquito and a lion are different Amazing I can know the fearless Bodhisattvas Mañjuśrī listen intently 
The Buddha praises Bodhisattva actions as a skillful magicians illusory displays Such as sawing or eating a person as a show to the public 
All things done by Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are illusory manifests being born or entering parinirvāṇa 
During times of famine he gives away his body for others to eat kalpa he manifests fire that burns across the earth For those who perceive that dharmas are permanent he enables them to know their impermanence 
During times of war he manifests troops To devastate and kill innumerable bandits In truth he never harms anyone because his manifestations are illusory 
He puts all ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold Worlds into a mustard seed And not one sentient being is distressed or disturbed He puts the four oceans and Mount Sumeru into a pore and they are not crammed or squeezed After the show he returns them to their own places 
He uses a toe to shake worlds in the ten directions and no sentient being is distressed This is the way of Buddhas 
To comfort sentient beings he manifests himself as countless images such as a Brahmaking The godking akra and any of the four worldprotecting godkings 
To comfort sentient beings he manifests himself as a prince a great minister A merchant leader an elder or a layman He may manifest as a god to change gods wrong views Because He manifests the birth of all living things he is called the birth itself 
As an analogy when a magician sees the killing of a conjured sentient being He never laments that this is a tremendous evil Because he understands the nature of illusions 
Likewise I manifested killing sentient beings to tame those who sabotage the Dharma And did not actually harm anyone 
Just as a BuddhaBhagavān manifests the times of war I now excel in taking Bodhisattva actions 
Alas Mañjuśrī practices the way of a mosquito And does not aspire to the great wisdom of the hero in the world who is like a dragon elephant 
Then the WorldHonored One who is allknowing and allseeing spoke to Mañjuśrī in verse As Aṅgulimāla says such are Bodhisattva actions You should know that because he delivers sentient beings he is not an ordinary being 
He is a great Bodhisattva and his boldness equals yours 
Mañjuśrī you should know his merits 
After saying these words the Buddha praised in verse Very good The exceptional hero among men using skillful means To comfort sentient beings displays the great power of energetic progress 
I now will expound the merits good karmas and energetic progress required for whoever wants to quickly become an Arhat To bring all sentient beings eternal peace and joy 
āriputra said to the Buddha WorldHonored One I pray that out of pity for all sentient beings You will tell me what merits karmas and energetic progress are required for whoever wants to quickly become an Arhat to benefit all sentient beings and bring them eternal peace and joy The WorldHonored One answered in verse 
When parents are united a child enters the mothers womb The parents are delighted and acquire consequent benefits Such as radiant looks and prosperity 
The birth of the child brings huge wealth to the family and enemies become lovingkind At age seven the child enters school where teachers and students are in harmony The household servants are happy and do their work diligently 
At age twenty he and his family members have no disputes They regard one another as parents whose nurturance is like overflowing fragrant milk 
Great is this worthy and brilliant child who has no greed anger arrogance Fawning hypocrisy excessive chatter malice A childs misconduct or evil karmas With lovingkindness and filial dutifulness he makes offerings to dignitaries and to his parents and teachers 
When he sees elders he joins his palms to show respect He accommodates the middleaged and frolics with the young 
Respectfully he gives relief to those in urgent need and a childs love to those in pain He admonishes the evil to know shame and dishonor and to aspire to training according to the true Dharma 
He never studies magic for fun but delights in seeing Buddhas He engages in reciting sūtras and rules of conduct and in the five studies 
Staying far away from drinking and gambling he pays reverence to the supreme He knows how much sleeping and eating is enough and dislikes what is impure 
Gods love and remember him and all people respect him His countless great merits are beyond analogy 
As he makes energetic progress in doing meritorious karmas he will attain true enlightenment 
āriputra know that Aṅgulimāla Like that youth will quickly attain true enlightenment 
How can such a person be evil He has acquired countless extraordinary merits 
A majestic hero like Mañjuśrī he surpasses even the uncommon kind  He regards all sentient beings as his only son 
Aṅgulimāla know that a BodhisattvaMahāsattva Vows to deliver all in the world who have not yet been delivered There is nothing right about making an excellent vow To help all in the world then doing evil 
The WorldHonored One again spoke in verse Manifesting as a sunmoon god or a Brahmaking who is the ruler of sentient beings Through earth water fire wind and space A Bodhisattva a hero among men uses countless merits to deliver sentient beings Mahāmaudgalyāyana praised in verse 
Aṅgulimāla has such great merits that Although he has seen the BuddhaBhagavān only briefly he will deliver all in existence 
Aṅgulimāla asked in verse Mahāmaudgalyāyana why is it that some sentient beings Have not seen a BuddhaBhagavān but can know the true Dharma 
As the BuddhaBhagavān says there are three groups 
A Buddha cannot transform those in the first group 
Mahākāśyapa and his peers are in the second group 
Before the Tathāgata appeared in the world they entered the true Dharma 
Aṅgulimāla again spoke in verse Do not say that Mahākāśyapa the Elder Entered the true Dharma before the Tathāgata appeared in the world 
Why not 
Because a Tathāgata forever abides in the world If someone relies on the true Dharma a Buddha constantly abides in his house 
As an analogy a river flows when there is rain it does not flow when there is no rain The wise should use skillful means to observe well 
There is nothing right about a river flowing when there is no rain Know that because of rainfall a river flows endlessly 
Mahāmaudgalyāyana all excellent worldly and supraworldly dharmas Flow out of a Buddha Therefore Mahākāśyapa relied on the Buddha to renounce family life 
Mahāmaudgalyāyana asked in verse If Tathāgatas forever abide in the world Why do I and others not see Them 
Aṅgulimāla answered in verse Let Mahākāśyapa know that it is like the rains Therefore when no Buddha is in the world sentient beings cannot deliver themselves Only when they see Tathāgatas can they achieve liberation 
As an analogy someone enters a dark room And cannot see sunlight or moonlight 
Therefore Mahāmaudgalyāyana do not say that no Buddha is in the world Because all Tathāgatas forever abide in the world To deliver those who renounce family life and accept the complete monastic precepts 
Mahāmaudgalyāyana asked in verse There are the five precepts in the world Whether or not a Buddha appears in the world 
Aṅgulimāla answered in verse Know that all precepts and right deportments Whether worldly or supraworldly are pronounced by a Buddha 
Mahāmaudgalyāyana asked in verse Why are disease classified into three kinds 
Some are cured by a treatment some are cured without a treatment And some are not cured by any treatment Therefore there are three kinds of disease 
Aṅgulimāla answered in verse Not so Do not say that there are three kinds Because there are only two kinds curable and incurable 
Some voicehearers classify disease into three kinds And the Buddha says that the VoiceHearer Vehicle is the Mosquito Vehicle Because of their ignorance they classify disease into three kinds Those definitely on the wrong path are icchantikas 
Those definitely on the right path are Tathāgatas holy Bodhisattvas and riders of the Two Vehicles 
Mahāmaudgalyāyana know that the two extraordinary kinds Are BuddhaBhagavāns and icchantikas 
While a Tathāgata is the highest and no one is above Him An icchantika the vilest 
While a great Bodhisattva fully practices the ten pāramitās An icchantika fully does the ten evil karmas 
While a Bodhisattva gives away as alms his body head eyes blood brain marrow And his countless bones piled higher than Mount Sumeru An icchantika gives away as alms his evil karmas And is reborn as a hungry ghost with burning greed and desire 
Thought after thought his greed and desire are responded to by many women He sires many children but derives no happiness in the long night Driven by hunger and thirst he eats his own children 
A hungry ghost may manifest as a Brahmin Because of the evil karmas in his past lives he asks people for their children to eat With unbridled desire he even eats his own body Thus an icchantika finds gratification by doing evil karmas 
Therefore while a BuddhaBhagavān is the highest and extraordinary An icchantika is the lowest and extraordinary 
Those definitely on the wrong path are icchantikas Those definitely on the right path are Tathāgatas Bodhisattvas abiding on Bodhisattva grounds Pratyekabuddhas and voicehearers 
The WorldHonored One said to Aṅgulimāla in verse Aṅgulimāla renounce family life And take the Three Refuges  
Aṅgulimāla responded in verse The Mahāyāna is the vehicle that brings the hindrancefree wisdomknowledge And this One Vehicle brings the one refuge The Buddha is the refuge in the highest truth 
The Dharma means a Tathāgatas wondrous dharma body The Saṅgha means a Tathāgata because He is the Saṅgha 
While the Dharma and the Saṅgha are the two refuges of convenience The Tathāgata is not a refuge of convenience but the refuge in the highest truth 
Therefore today I take refuge in the Tathāgata Because He is the true refuge among refuges 
If someone wants to eat hiṅgu he should take the right plant If he discards the right one to eat the wrong one he can benefit neither himself nor others A thousand physicians cannot save such a fool 
Therefore if people abandon the one refuge to take refuges of convenience A thousand Buddhas cannot save such fools 
The WorldHonored One told Aṅgulimāla You should accept and observe the pure precepts for an innocent youth Aṅgulimāla asked in verse 
What is meant by the complete monastic precepts 
What is a true śramaṇa 
What are the fortune fields 
As the WorldHonored One abided in silence Aṅgulimāla again spoke in verse If someone does not know that the one refuge is the refuge in the highest truth And does not know that the two refuges are established for convenience He is an innocent youth 
If someone has not received the complete monastic precepts how can he be a śramaṇa 
If someone does not know the one refuge how can he take it as the pure refuge 
If someone does not know that the Tathāgata is the refuge in the highest truth And does not take a pure refuge how can he be a śramaṇa 
If someone does not know the true refuge how can it be his fortune field 
Therefore if someone does not know the difference between the true refuge and two refuges of convenience He is an innocent youth 
Then the WorldHonored One told Aṅgulimāla You now should accept and observe the precept against killing Aṅgulimāla responded in verse I definitely can neither accept nor observe the precept against killing I will always accept and observe the precept for ending sentient beings lives 
The socalled sentient beings mean countless afflictions Ending them is called observing the precept for killing 
The worldHonored One told him You now should accept and observe the precept against false speech Aṅgulimāla responded in verse I definitely can neither accept nor observe the precept against false speech I will always accept and uphold false words about dharmas Accepting and upholding false words are the Buddha Dharma 
What is false is that all dharmas are empty What is false is that voicehearers Pratyekabuddhas And Bodhisattvas take action to follow worldly ways 
What is false is that I appear in the world Accept and observe the complete monastic precepts and become an Arhat That I accept food and drink to establish someones almsgiving That I walk to and fro in meditation as my afflictions flow through the nine lifepaths That I accept and use shoes a willow tooth pick and medicine That I get hungry or thirsty sleep cut my nails and shave off my hair and beard That I take medicine to cure various diseases in my body That I will enter parinirvāṇa like the extinction of a fire when its firewood is burnt away 
Words such as these are false words However when I use skillful means to roam the world I never purify such false speech 
Now I reveal the real truth and Mahāmaudgalyāyana you should listen well 
The eternal body in the highest truth is a Buddhas inconceivable body What never changes in the highest truth is His eternal body The quiet body in the highest truth is the truly wondrous dharma body How does such an inconceivable body appear 
Buddhas teach that false dharmas arise  He who is free from all falsity is called a Buddha 
As an analogy when a calf dies to delight its mother the cow herder Takes its hide to cover other calves 
Likewise a Tathāgata follows worldly ways 
Like that cow herder He manifests as a deaf man In order to teach the deaf the Dharma Then sentient beings will think that a Tathāgata shares their world 
Like that cow herder He manifests countless images And uses various skillful means to guide sentient beings 
As that cow herder uses skillful means To coax the cow to produce milk for other calves It is the same with a Tathāgata 
If He revealed His selfnature body who in the world could see it 
Therefore he uses skillful means to manifest Himself to suit worldly perceptions In order to enable all to achieve liberation This is the way of Buddhas 
Therefore from now on I will always do false things And kill sentient beings as a false display I do not accept the precept against falsity so that my observance of the precepts will be pure 
The WorldHonored One told Aṅgulimāla You now should accept the precept against drinking alcohol Aṅgulimāla responded in verse I definitely can neither accept nor observe the precept against drinking alcohol 
I will always accept the precept for drinking alcohol and indulge in the long night I will shout throughout the five lifepaths that Extreme joy is called the alcohol produced by the Mahāyāna 
It is the alcohol of the unsurpassed Buddha store I now drink this alcohol to my fill and persuade sentient beings to do the same And to joyfully praise Very good 
It forever abides and never changes Eight times they should announce it aloud as their intoxication is endless 
The WorldHonored told Aṅgulimāla You now should accept the pure precept against having sex Aṅgulimāla answered in verse I definitely can neither accept nor observe the precept against having sex 
I will always accept and follow my lust for what others love And constantly visit the house of prostitutes to frolic with them 
I will take samādhi as my wife the truth as my son The lovingkind and compassionate mind as my daughter the emptiness of dharmas as my house And countless pāramitās as my high and wide bed Guarding afflictions I will take veiled teachings as my food Total retention as my garden the Seven Bodhi Factors as flowers Dharma words as trees and the wisdomknowledge of liberation as fruits These are called the foremost entertainment in the world The true nature of the wise is not the state of the foolish 
The WorldHonored One told Aṅgulimāla You now should accept the precept against taking things not given Aṅgulimāla responded in verse I definitely can neither accept nor observe the precept against taking things not given 
I will always take things not given and steal others things What can never be given is bodhi because there exists no giver Therefore I will take bodhi which no one can give me 
When a Buddha sits under the bodhi tree He neither gains nor loses it is ones true nature supreme and unsurpassed 
The Buddha told Aṅgulimāla You now should accept the precept against singing and dancing Aṅgulimāla responded in verse 
I will always enjoy the pleasure of dancing and of singing a gandharvas songs To proclaim the Tathāgata store and praise Very good I will hear from Buddhas that a Tathāgata forever abides 
I will constantly use wonderful tones to recite Mahāyāna sūtras Like the music played by kinaras and gandharvas 
I will use countless wonderful tones as an offering to sūtras 
If sentient beings constantly make such offerings Buddhas will bestow upon them the prophecy that they will become Buddhas with the same name 
 Sūtra of Aṅgulimālika Translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the Liu Song Dynasty by The Tripiṭaka Master Guṇabhadra from India Fascicle  Then the Buddha asked Aṅgulimāla What is meant by the one learning  Aṅgulimāla answered in verse 
According to the VoiceHearer Vehicle not the Mahāyāna All sentient beings lives are sustained by food and drink According to the Mahāyāna their lives are apart from food and drink and are always firm 
What is meant by one 
It means that the Tathāgata store of all sentient beings constantly abides 
What is meant by two 
According to the VoiceHearer Vehicle not the Mahāyāna It means ones name and form  
Riders of the VoiceHearer Vehicle and the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle Claim that name and form are different They believe that only ones name achieves liberation and do not say that it has a wonderful form 
All Tathāgatas liberation has wondrous form Observable like an āmra in ones palm 
What is meant by three 
According to the VoiceHearer Vehicle not the Mahāyāna It means the three kinds of sensory reception  
According to the Mahāyāna the three kinds of reception mean that A Tathāgata is foremost in permanence and is never born And that if the Dharma and the Saṅgha are destroyed they will be born again 
What is meant by four 
According to the VoiceHearer Vehicle not the Mahāyāna It means the Four Noble Truths  
According to the Mahāyāna It means that all Tathāgatas are foremost in absolute permanence This not suffering is a truth in the Mahāyāna 
It means that all Tathāgatas are foremost in absolute perpetuity This not accumulation of afflictions is a truth in the Mahāyāna 
It means that all Tathāgatas are foremost in changelessness This not cessation of suffering is a truth in the Mahāyāna 
It means that all Tathāgatas are foremost in absolute quietness This not the path is a truth in the Mahāyāna 
These are the four truths in the Mahāyāna which do not include suffering If suffering is a truth then those on the four evil lifepathshelldwellers hungry ghosts animals and asurasshould uphold this truth 
What is meant by five 
According to the VoiceHearer Vehicle not the Mahāyāna It means ones five faculties 
a Tathāgatas eyes are permanent As they definitely see with perfect discernment and are never impaired A Tathāgatas ears are permanent As they definitely hear with perfect discernment and are never impaired A Tathāgatas nose is permanent As it definitely smells with perfect discernment and is never impaired A Tathāgatas tongue is permanent As it definitely tastes with perfect discernment and is never impaired A Tathāgatas body is permanent As it definitely touches with perfect discernment and is never impaired 
What is meant by six 
According to the VoiceHearer Vehicle not the Mahāyāna It means ones six entrances 
a Tathāgatas eye entrance is permanent As His visual sense is perfect and never impaired A Tathāgatas ear entrance is permanent As His auditory sense is perfect and never impaired A Tathāgatas nose entrance is permanent As His olfactory sense is perfect and never impaired A Tathāgatas tongue entrance is permanent As His gustatory sense is perfect and never impaired A Tathāgatas body entrance is permanent As his tactile sense is perfect and never impaired A Tathāgatas mind entrance reveals ones Tathāgata store And those with pure faith and without rejecting it can enter it 
What is meant by seven 
According to the VoiceHearer Vehicle not the Mahāyāna It means the Seven Bodhi Factors 
These seven factors in the Mahāyāna are like udumbara flowers As a Tathāgata forever abides the seven bodhi flowers bloom 
What is meant by eight 
According to the VoiceHearer Vehicle not the Mahāyāna It means the Eightfold Right Path 
This path of the Mahāyāna leads to the teaching that a Tathāgata forever abides Through the power of hearing  one will eventually arrive at the city of nirvāṇa 
A Tathāgata is forever eternal supreme changeless pure and extremely quiet 
Thus the Mahāyāna fully encompasses the Eightfold Right Path 
What is meant by nine 
According to the VoiceHearer Vehicle not the Mahāyāna It means sūtras in the nine categories 
The Mahāyāna is the One Vehicle that leads to a Tathāgatas hindrancefree wisdomknowledge  
What is meant by ten 
According to the VoiceHearer Vehicle not the Mahāyāna It means the Ten Powers 
The Mahāyāna brings countless powers because a Buddha is inconceivable 
What is meant by the one path One vehicle one refuge one truth One reliance one realm one birth and one form 
Then the WorldHonored One praised Very good very good Aṅgulimāla 
Come bhikṣu And Aṅgulimāla immediately became a śramaṇa his deportment as perfect as that of a longtime bhikṣu 
Aṅgulimāla bowed down at the Buddhas feet and said WorldHonored One following Your voice I have immediately become an Arhat The Buddha told him You should come to Jetavana Park to widely deliver sentient beings Then like a full moon surrounded by stars the WorldHonored One was attended by Aṅgulimāla āriputra Mañjuśrī and all others in the multitude 
Aṅgulimāla together with gods dragons yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kinaras and mahoragas made huge offerings in Jetavana Park 
Like a gooseking the WorldHonored One entered Jetavana Park which had been donated by Anāthapiṇḍika the Elder and ascended onto a lion throne Then the ground of this ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World became as level as a palm and carpeted with soft grass as if it were Land of Peace and Bliss 
At that time all great Bodhisattvas in various directions wished to see Aṅgulimāla Their Buddhas told them You all should go 
ākyamuni Buddha is fighting a Dharma battle subjugating a great lion and delivering an innumerable multitude He is staying in Jetavana Park and will expound the unsurpassed Dharma to the multitude 
You Buddhasons should go to listen to and accept the Dharma and to look upon Aṅgulimāla with respect These Bodhisattvas who came from various directions showered down lotus flowers as large as carriage wheels 
Then gods dragon yakṣas gandharvas asuras kinaras mahoragas and goddessdaughters made celestial offerings and showered down various treasures With one mind and one voice they spoke in verse I now bow down to the one with the thirtytwo physical marks of a great man His countless merits are like a pure lotus flower in bloom 
The white hair between His eyebrows is brighter and purer than moonlight I now bow down to the muni with a sublime form 
His great lovingkindness and comforting virtues are like a pure lotus flower in bloom The white hair between His eyebrows is brighter and purer than moonlight 
I now bow down to the one with the foremost everabiding body The supreme muni is the unsurpassed one honored by gods and humans 
His comforting of sentient beings is like the blooming of a pure lotus The white hair between His eyebrows is brighter and purer than moonlight 
I now bow down to the one with the foremost eternal merits The supreme muni is the unsurpassed one honored by gods and humans 
His comforting of sentient beings is like the blooming of a pure lotus The white hair between His eyebrows is brighter and purer than moonlight 
I now bow down to the one with changeless merits that never dwindle The supreme muni is the unsurpassed one honored by gods and humans 
His comforting of sentient beings is like the blooming of a pure lotus The white hair between His eyebrows is brighter and purer than moonlight 
I now bow down to the one with quiet and extraordinary merits The supreme muni is the unsurpassed one honored by gods and humans 
His comforting of sentient beings is like the blooming of a pure lotus The white hair between His eyebrows is brighter and purer than moonlight 
Namo Aṅgulimāla who endures adversity and trains to observe the pure precepts and acquire countless merits 
Namo Aṅgulimāla who upholds the path of the One Vehicle and the Mahāyānas virtue of lovingkindness 
Namo Aṅgulimāla who uses his body and voice and their immeasurable secrets 
Namo Aṅgulimāla who uses the immeasurable wisdom light to give countless veiled teachings So I bow down to him 
Namo Aṅgulimāla who uses countless illusions to subjugate countless māras 
Namo Aṅgulimāla who abides in the immeasurable nirvāṇa to follow innumerable sentient beings in the world 
Then Aṅgulimāla asked the Buddha WorldHonored One You say I abide in the state of no birth What is meant by that 
Why does the WorldHonored One who abides in the state of no birth and on the ground of liberation also abide here 
Who can believe this 
I pray that You will explain The Buddha answered Aṅgulimāla You and Mañjuśrī together should go north passing worlds as numerous as the sands of one Ganges River to the world called Immeasurable Bliss Teaching there is a Buddha called Accumulation Ground of Immeasurable Wisdom and Merit Sovereign King the Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha You two should go there to ask that Buddha Why does ākyamuni Buddha who abides in the state of no birth also abide in this world called Sahā Mañjuśrī and Aṅgulimāla responded We gladly accept your instruction Using their transcendental powers like goosekings they went north to the world called Immeasurable Bliss and arrived at the place of Accumulation Ground of Immeasurable Wisdom and Merit Sovereign King Tathāgata 
They bowed down at His feet and said WorldHonored One we two came from the Sahā world because we are sent by ākyamuni Buddha to ask you Why does ākyamuni Tathāgata who abides in the state of no birth and on the ground of liberation not enter parinirvāṇa but abides in the Sahā world That Buddha told them Good men I am one of the bodies of ākyamuni Tathāgata 
You should go back and tell your Buddha Immeasurable Wisdom Buddha sent us back and said that You would explain to us Then like goosekings they came back from that world and bowed down at the Buddhas feet 
We two just saw Your amazing virtues because Immeasurable Wisdom Sovereign King Tathāgata said I am that Buddha who will explain to you We pray that the WorldHonored One will compassionately explain why He who abides in the state of no birth also abides here The Buddha told Mañjuśrī and all others Why do I who abide as Accumulation Ground of Immeasurable Wisdom and Merit Sovereign King Buddha in the world called Immeasurable Bliss also abide here 
Do not ask why I who abide in the state of no birth also abide here 
A Tathāgatas body is boundless and what He does is also boundless A Tathāgata is indescribable and what He does is also indescribable A Tathāgata is immeasurable and what He does is also immeasurable 
Aṅgulimāla you ask the Tathāgata why He displays the birth of a body that has no birth 
The Tathāgata will now explain to you Aṅgulimāla said to the Buddha Very good 
WorldHonored One I pray that you will explain to pity all sentient beings and bring them peace and joy The Buddha told Aṅgulimāla For countless hundreds of thousands of koṭis of kalpas I fully practiced the ten pāramitās to draw in innumerable sentient beings and enabled those who had not activated the bodhi mind to activate it Because I fully practiced countless pāramitās and planted roots of goodness for countless asakhyeyas of kalpas I display the birth of a body that has no birth Aṅgulimāla asked the Buddha WorldHonored One why does the Tathāgata display the birth of His body as He abides in the true reality  The Buddha told Aṅgulimāla You and Mañjuśrī together should go north passing worlds as numerous as the sands of two Ganges Rivers to the world called Unreal Lightning Garland Teaching there is a Buddha called Vairocana the Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha 
You two should go there to ask Him Why does ākyamuni Tathāgata who abides in the true reality  also abide in the Sahā world They acted upon His instruction and like goosekings soared away to the world called Unreal Lightning Garland and arrived at the place of Vairocana Buddha 
Mañjuśrī and Aṅgulimāla said to the Buddha WorldHonored One we pray that you will tell us how the Tathāgata came to abide in the true reality  The Buddha told Mañjuśrī and all others For countless hundreds of thousands of koṭis of kalpas I fully practiced the ten pāramitās to draw in innumerable sentient beings and established them in the joy they never before had 
Because I practiced asakhyeyas of pāramitās for countless hundreds of thousands of koṭis of kalpas I have realized this truereality body Aṅgulimāla asked the Buddha WorldHonored One how did the Tathāgata come to abide in the asaskṛta state The Buddha answered You and Mañjuśrī together should go north passing worlds as numerous as the sands of three Ganges Rivers to the world called Taking by Intention 
You two should go there to ask Him How did ākyamuni Tathāgata come to abide in the asaskṛta state They went there and asked that Buddha but He sent them back to ākyamuni Buddha

Aṅgulimāla for countless asakhyeyas of kalpas I who abide in all boundless places also abide here 
Aṅgulimāla nirvāṇa is liberation and liberation is a Tathāgata  Sūtra of Aṅgulimālika Translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the Liu Song Dynasty by The Tripiṭaka Master Guṇabhadra from India Fascicle  Then Aṅgulimāla said to the Buddha Amazing 
WorldHonored One pitying all sentient beings is the foremost difficult thing The Buddha told Aṅgulimāla For a Tathāgata that is not the foremost difficult thing 
During the remaining eighty years when the true Dharma abides in the world to say comforting words about this Mahāyāna sūtra on the eternal and changeless Tathāgata store will be very difficult 
For sentient beings to uphold this sūtra will also be very difficult 
For those who have heard a Tathāgatas teaching on the eternal and changeless Tathāgata store truly to follow it will also be very difficult Aṅgulimāla asked the Buddha WorldHonored One how difficult are these things The Buddha answered As an analogy the great earth bears four heavy burdens 
What are these four 
They are immense waters huge mountains grass and trees and sentient beings 
These are the four burdens that the great earth bears Aṅgulimāla agreed Indeed WorldHonored One The Buddha told Aṅgulimāla It is not just the great earth that bears four heavy burdens 
Because there are people who bear heavy burdens Aṅgulimāla asked the Buddha Who WorldHonored One The Buddha told Aṅgulimāla During the remaining eighty years when the true Dharma abides in the world every BodhisattvaMahāsattva who expounds to all sentient beings a Tathāgatas teaching on the eternal and changeless Tathāgata store should bear four burdens 
What are these four 
When the evil kind wants to harm him he should disregard his survival and even abandon his body and life to expound a Tathāgatas teaching on the eternal and changeless Tathāgata store This is the first burden which is heavier than the totality of all mountains 
When the evil kind slanders him as an icchantika and scolds him he should endure it This is the second burden which is heavier than the totality of all immense waters 
If he cannot stay in prosperous and pleasurable cities or places he should stay on their edges or in troubleridden places where necessities such as food clothing and medicine are coarse men are slanderous women have little faith and all his experiences are painful This is the third burden which is heavier than the totality of all grass and trees 
Whoever can bear these four heavy burdens is called a BodhisattvaMahāsattva capable of bearing huge burdens 
During the remaining eighty years as the true Dharma perishes for a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who can abandon his body and life to expound a Tathāgatas teaching on the eternal and changeless Tathāgata store will be very difficult 
For him to sustain sentient beings will also very difficult 
For those who have heard a Tathāgatas teaching on the eternal and changeless Tathāgata store to elicit belief and delight will also very difficult 
However Aṅgulimāla for a Tathāgata those things are not the foremost difficult things I now will tell you other difficult things 
Suppose that a man has an immeasurable lifespan For countless hundreds of thousands of koṭis of years he uses the tip of a hair to take a drop of water from the immense ocean until it is depleted like a puddle in a cows track Is that difficult Aṅgulimāla answered Very difficult WorldHonored One 
That is indescribably difficult The Buddha told Aṅgulimāla That is not difficult 
There are truly difficult things Aṅgulimāla asked Who  WorldHonored One The Buddha told Aṅgulimāla During the remaining eighty years when the true Dharma abides in the world for a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who can abandon his body and life to expound a Tathāgatas teaching on the eternal and changeless Tathāgata store will be very difficult However Aṅgulimāla for a Tathāgata that is not the foremost difficult thing 
Suppose that a man bears Mount Sumeru the great earth and the immense ocean for a hundred koṭi years 
Is that the foremost difficult thing for a strong man Aṅgulimāla said to the Buddha That is a Tathāgatas state and no voicehearer or Pratyekabuddha can match it The Buddha told Aṅgulimāla That would not be difficult for a strong man 
Suppose that he divides each dust particle in the immense ocean into a hundred thousand koṭi pieces and takes away one dust particle every hundred thousand koṭi kalpas until are depleted resembles a cows track 
And suppose that he can bear Mount Sumeru the great earth and the immense ocean for a hundred thousand koṭi kalpas However during the remaining eighty years when the true Dharma abides in the world he cannot expound a Tathāgatas teaching on the eternal and changeless Tathāgata store Only a Bodhisattva who is a hero among men can expound it to protect and uphold the true Dharma I say that he does the foremost difficult thing Moreover Aṅgulimāla suppose that a man can use water to extinguish the blazing fire of a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World 
Is that man doing a very difficult thing Aṅgulimāla answered WorldHonored One to extinguish the fire of even one world is very difficult much more a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World 
It is very difficult The Buddha said Indeed Aṅgulimāla 
During the remaining eighty years when the true Dharma abides in the world if a BodhisattvaMahāsattva abandons his body and life slaves and servants cows and sheep and material things propagates with purity the true Dharma and expounds a Tathāgatas teaching on the eternal and changeless Tathāgata store what kind of man is he Aṅgulimāla answered Only a Buddha not a voicehearer or Pratyekabuddha can know 
At that time supporting even worldly pure dharmas will be difficult not to mention a Tathāgatas supreme supraworldly teaching on the eternal and changeless Tathāgata store 
If that man can use water to extinguish the blazing fire of a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World it is very difficult 
In the future during the remaining eighty years when the true Dharma abides in the world if a BodhisattvaMahāsattva abandons his body and life to expound a Tathāgatas teaching on the eternal and changeless Tathāgata store he is a Tathāgata The Buddha told Aṅgulimāla Very good very good 
Good man I say the same 
All Tathāgatas say that all the difficult things done by that man cannot reach even the edge  Moreover good man as an analogy hundreds of rivers enter the immense ocean and no longer appear Likewise all men enter the wisdom acquired by one man and no longer appear 
To sustain his group and those who hear the Dharma is also very difficult Aṅgulimāla asked the Buddha WorldHonored One what things should a BodhisattvaMahāsattva achieve to indicate that he is not a novice The Buddha answered Good man if a BodhisattvaMahāsattva achieves the following eight things he is not a novice 
What are these eight 
They are know the Dharma ponder and uphold the Dharma support his parents acknowledge the kindness of his teachers reject the wrong views stay away from attitudes of disdain and from unruly evil or impure things do not entertain thoughts of desire  even in dreams and respect the precepts 
If a BodhisattvaMahāsattva achieves these eight things he is not a novice Moreover if a BodhisattvaMahāsattva achieves the following eight things he is not a novice 
What are these eight 
If a Bodhisattva achieves these eight things he is not a novice Moreover if a Bodhisattva achieves the following eight things he is not a novice 
What are these eight 
They are speak comforting words well do not be mischievous endure slight afflictions endure in hearing all sūtras conquer the need for sleep do not be indolent be diligent and exercise selfrestraint and delight in seeking the precepts 
If a Bodhisattva achieves these eight things he is not a novice Moreover if a Bodhisattva achieves the following eight things he is not a novice 
What are these eight 
They are be truthful delight in doing pure things be radiant be civil stay far away from women stay far away from kin feel terrified with body hair standing on end when hearing evil and think compassionately of sentient beings 
If a Bodhisattva achieves these eight things he is not a novice Moreover if a Bodhisattva achieves the following eight things he is not a novice 
What are these eight 
They are know well what the Buddha says about māras and their differences have respect for those who know the sūtras know the differences between code of conduct and the wrong code without concealment know well a Tathāgatas veiled teachings know a Tathāgatas secret know well how to follow worldly matters know well that a Tathāgata is eternal and changeless and know well that according to time and place a Bodhisattvas evil is not truly evil 
If a Bodhisattva achieves these eight things he is not a novice If a Bodhisattva achieves these forty things he is not a novice 
If a good man or woman can acquire only half of these forty merits it means that he or she neither abides in the Mahāyāna nor enters the status of a Bodhisattva 
Therefore Bodhisattva actions are very difficult What are a Bodhisattvas excellent virtues 
If he has no thoughts of desire  even in dreams know that he has the virtues of all bodhi elements Then Mañjuśrī said to Aṅgulimāla What is meant by the Tathāgata store 
If all sentient beings possess the Tathāgata store they all will become Buddhas even if they have track records of evil karmas such as killing stealing sexual misconduct lying and drinking alcohol 
Because all sentient beings have Buddha nature and will someday achieve deliverance 
Because one has Buddha nature should one commit the rebellious sins or become an icchantika 
If one had a self  its selfrealm could deliver all in existence 
Buddhas teach that all dharmas have no self The Buddha told Mañjuśrī All sentient beings possess the Tathāgata store However like a lamp in a bottle it is shrouded by countless afflictions 
For example Kāśyapa Tathāgata bestowed a prophecy upon a young trainee He prophesied After seven years you will become a WheelTurning King and use the true Dharma to rule and transform the world while after seven days I will enter parinirvāṇa After hearing His prophecy the young trainee exuberantly rejoiced and thought The one with all wisdomknowledge prophesied that I will become a WheelTurning King I have no doubt  He told his mother Get me various kinds of fine food such as fish meat milk cheese sesame and beans to build up my strength Then he ate all these things in a mixture and died an untimely death 
Mañjuśrī did that Buddha lie 
Did He not have all wisdomknowledge 
Did that young trainee not have the roots of goodness to deserve the good requital of becoming a WheelTurning King Mañjuśrī answered WorldHonored One his past evil karmas must have caused his death The Buddha told Mañjuśrī Do not say so 
Mañjuśrī how could that Buddha not know the requital for his past evil karmas and bestow upon him a prophecy  
He had no past evil karmas but lost his life because of his own doing 
Mañjuśrī a man or woman might think My body possesses the Tathāgata store Because I will achieve deliverance I now might as well do evil If someone does evil will he achieve deliverance because of his Buddha nature 
In that story the young trainee had the nature of a king but failed to use it 
Because he abandoned selfrestraint 
Likewise sentient beings fail to reveal their Buddha nature because they abandon selfrestraint 
Do sentient beings not have Buddha nature 
Was that Buddhas prophecy of the young trainees becoming a WheelTurning King a lie 
It is their own fault that they do not become Buddhas Mañjuśrī asked the Buddha Do not all sentient beings have past karmas The Buddha answered They have past karmas 
Because throughout countless asakhyeyas of kalpas the Tathāgata made a great vow I will deliver all sentient beings that have not been delivered and liberate all those who have not been liberated Because of this vow and His roots of goodness the radiance of the Tathāgatas wisdom sunlight can expunge countless asakhyeyas of sins 
Moreover Mañjuśrī as an analogy before sunrise clouds and fogs cover the world When the sun rises all darkness in the world is dispelled 
Likewise before this sūtrasun rises all sentient beings transmigrate through birth and death When this sūtrasun rises the darkness of asakhyeyas of ones accumulated huge evil is dispelled in a finger snap 
Even for someone who jokes about a Tathāgatas teaching on the eternal and changeless Tathāgata store or follows those on the wrong paths his asakhyeya sins such as parājikas and sins that would result in uninterrupted suffering in hell will be expunged in an instant 
Because whoever hears the name ākyamuni Tathāgata even if he has not yet activated the bodhi mind is already a Bodhisattva 
Because the Tathāgata made a great vow to deliver all in the world who have not yet been delivered to transform them by using the true Dharma and to enable them to come to realization  
Therefore Mañjuśrī whoever hears the name of the Tathāgata is a Bodhisattva He not only can quickly remove his afflictions but also will realize the body just as I have realized it 
Mañjuśrī I now speak in verse I have described the path That can pull out the poisonous thorns of care and sorrow You all should act the Tathāgatas words 
What is the path There are two paths the voicehearer path and the Bodhisattva path 
The voicehearer path is the Eightfold Right Path 
The Bodhisattva path is that all sentient beings possess the Tathāgatastore self and should step by step eradicate their afflictions and reveal their Buddha nature which is motionless delightful and lovable Those who do not eradicate transmigrate forever through birth and death I have described the path  That can pull out the poisonous thorns of care and sorrow care and sorrow mean afflictions and one who has pulled out poisonous thorns is a Tathāgata 
I have eradicated countless afflictions and become a great medicine king You should follow me and accept  and I will indicate to you your Tathāgata store You all should act means that you should act in accordance with the veiled teachings in the Tathāgatas words which never deceive you 
The appearing of a Buddha in the world is like the appearing of an udumbara flower Ones belief in Him is like a speck of gold in the sands of the Ganges also like a blind turtle chancing a hole in a piece of driftwood If you encounter a Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha who expounds a sūtra on the Tathāgata store and never deceives you about the consequences of ones birth and death then you can deliver yourselves from all your existences and affliction diseases 
This is what is meant by the Tathāgatas words Diligently do good dharmas And subjugate evil minds Whoever is tardy in acquiring merit Has intentions attached to evil dharmas I spoke this stanza for voicehearers sake 
the Tathāgata store are hard to obtain Nothing in the world is so hard to obtain as such teachings Quickly observe how ones intentions are attached to evils A bhikṣu who emulates the faults of evil learned ones is surrounded by many afflictions headed by the five filths that cover his inherent pure mind 
What five filths are the root of afflictions that surround him 
They are greed anger stupor restlessness and doubt 
These five filths taint his mind To remove these five filths and other afflictions he should diligently use the power of his inherent pure mind as skillful means in order not to malign sūtras nor to become an icchantika but to train to deliver himself  
Because of this meaning I say that he should quickly pull out the root of countless visitorlike afflictions in his mind Ones mind initiates  And ones excellent mind produces dharmas 
If ones mind has pure belief While speaking or doing things Joy follows one Like the shadow of a form 
This stanza explains to voicehearers that the Tathāgata store means ones inherent pure mind As ones Tathāgata store transcends all dharmas all dharmas are ones Tathāgata store If one does things with pure belief and intention it is because one has ended all ones afflictions and seen ones selfrealm 
As one has pure belief in ones Tathāgata store whenever one speaks or does things likewise after one attains Buddhahood one will speak or do things to deliver all in the world As one sees the shadow of a form likewise one sees ones Tathāgata store That is why I say Like the shadow of a form Ones mind initiates  And ones excellent mind produces intentions 
If ones mind does evil Through speaking or doing things Pains follow one Like wheels that follow a track This stanza explains what is meant by afflictions 
Ones mind does evil means that ones mind shrouded by countless afflictions initiates evildoing So it is called evil 
If one does not know that ones inherent pure mind is the Tathāgata store one succumbs to countless afflictions Because one is restless and confused whether one speaks or does things pains endlessly follow 
Like wheels that follow a track means that evils accumulate as one transmigrates through birth and death and that evils drive sentient beings to take the three evil lifepaths like wheels that follow a track That is why I say that whoever is tardy in acquiring merit delights in evil dharmas 
Moreover Mañjuśrī because one knows that milk contains butter one churns milk to get butter because water contains no butter one does not churn it 
Likewise Mañjuśrī because one knows that one possesses the Tathāgata store one diligently observes the pure precepts and practices the Brahma way of life 
Moreover because one knows that a mountain contains gold one excavates the mountain to get gold because a tree contains no gold one does not excavate it 
Likewise Mañjuśrī because one knows that one possesses the Tathāgata store one diligently observes the pure precepts and practices the Brahma way of life and declares I will definitely attain Buddha bodhi Moreover Mañjuśrī if one had no Tathāgata store practicing the Brahma way of life would be futile like churning water for a kalpa but never getting butter Mañjuśrī asked the Buddha WorldHonored One what is meant by the Brahma way of life 
Why has the Tathāgata discarded the pleasures of the five desires Aṅgulimāla said to Mañjuśrī Innumerable gods know that will cause them to fall so they stay away from thoughts of desire The Buddha told Aṅgulimāla Do not say so 
Therefore all men are brothers and all women are sisters Aṅgulimāla asked the Buddha WorldHonored One if King uddhodana and Queen Māyā were brother and sister how could they become the Buddhas parents The Buddha answered  was a skillful display to deliver sentient beings 
Otherwise sentient beings could not be delivered As an analogy a great king has two thousand strong men Then two men display skills and subjugate them all to delight the king and entertain the multitude Only they know  and others are unaware 
Likewise a Buddha displays that He has parents as do humans in order to deliver innumerable sentient beings and enable them to leave the boundless immense ocean of birth and death However sentient beings do not know this 
As an analogy an actor plays various roles to entertain the multitude 
Likewise BuddhaBhagavāns produce various manifestations to deliver sentient beings but sentient beings do not know this 
As an analogy a magician manifests severing his body parts to entertain the multitude but actually his body is unharmed 
Likewise BuddhaBhagavāns like a magician produce various manifestations to deliver sentient beings 
Mañjuśrī a Tathāgata possesses all wisdomknowledge and knows everything He observes all sentient beings in the world and sees that without a beginning each appears as someones parent brother or sister and repeatedly rises high or falls low  just like an actor playing various roles Therefore a Tathāgata lives the Brahma way of pure life 
How can they experience pleasure 
Know that such pleasure is an aggregate of tremendous suffering As a woman possesses the Tathāgata store so too does a man 
As they have the same nature why should they be attached to each other 
Having the same nature a Tathāgata lives the Brahma way of life and abides on His own ground the noregress ground the Tathāgata ground Mañjuśrī asked the Buddha WorldHonored One why does the Tathāgata not establish an upāsaka and an upāsikā in the Brahma way of life 
Why WorldHonored One do You say that a bhikṣu a bhikṣuṇī an upāsaka and an upāsikā are like four pillars of a hall 
How can they be established in the way of the true Dharma The Buddha answered This odd thought is called a worldly thought The Tathāgata regards all sentient beings as Rāhula and always wants to establish them on the Buddha ground without ranking or graduation A Buddhas thoughts are different from worldly thoughts 
Your question is called a nonquestion Mañjuśrī asked the Buddha WorldHonored One is it because the realms of all sentient beings are one realm that Buddhas refrain from killing The Buddha answered Indeed killing another in the world is like killing oneself because all are in the same realm Mañjuśrī asked the Buddha WorldHonored One why do You regard all sentient beings as Rāhula then teach people to tame and subjugate the evil kind in the same realm The Buddha told Mañjuśrī Good man do not say so 
The Tathāgata regards all sentient beings as Rāhula 
However because he loves the Dharma he eats only one meal a day which means starving  worms  His act should be called killing but it is not impure killing 
When his sexual desire blazes he should go to someone and say Because my desire has arisen I pray to be admonished to have a sense of shame lest I should disregard my survival and commit suicide Does it mean that he has destroyed his realm Mañjuśrī answered No WorldHonored One he has accumulated merits The Buddha told Mañjuśrī Indeed 
Mañjuśrī why do sages kill themselves 
It is because of their venomous affliction snakes not to mention other causes 
Buddhas teach that if ones afflictions are strong one should teach the evil kind and those who sabotage the true Dharma to do difficult things This would be an offering to ones realm When one discards the pleasures of desire  clothing food or even life in order to seek the ultimate bliss or lets oneself be harmed in order to tame another it means that one knows well ones Tathāgata store Mañjuśrī asked the Buddha WorldHonored One is it because the Tathāgata store that Buddhas do not eat flesh The Buddha said Indeed 
Without a beginning all sentient beings transmigrate through birth and death They have been parents brothers or sisters just like an actors various roles Ones flesh and others flesh are one flesh Therefore Buddhas do not eat flesh 
Moreover Mañjuśrī ones realm and the realms of all sentient beings are one realm and all flesh is one flesh 
Therefore Buddhas do not eat flesh Mañjuśrī asked the Buddha WorldHonored One are conch shells bee wax honey leather and soft silk not the flesh from some sentient beings realm The Buddha told Mañjuśrī Do not say so 
The Tathāgata stays away from worldly ways and does not eat flesh It is not right to say that He stays close to worldly things Using worldly things is a convenience 
One can touch anything that arrives through a chain of stations that do not involve killing Mañjuśrī said to the Buddha In this city there is cobbler who makes leather shoes If someone buys and gives them to You as an offering will the Buddha accept them because they arrive through a chain of stations 
Moreover if a cow dies from natural causes and if its owner has a caṇḍāla remove its hide and give it to a cobbler to make shoes can someone who observes the precepts accept the shoes given to him as alms because they arrive through a chain of stations The Buddha told Mañjuśrī You ask whether someone who observes the precepts should accept leather shoes made by a cobbler from the hide of a cow that died from natural causes and offered by that cows owner 
If he does not accept them he complies with a bhikṣus way of life 
If he accepts them he has no compassion but does not violate the precepts Mañjuśrī said to the Buddha WorldHonored One a bhikṣu should not accept food cooked with impure water The Buddha told Mañjuśrī This is called a worldly thought 
If a layperson is available he should use pure water to cook food 
If no layperson is available what can a Buddha do 
There are insects in the earth the water and the air If purity is evil how can the world cultivate purity 
Your question is called a nonquestion Mañjuśrī asked the Buddha WorldHonored One there are those in the world who decided long ago not to eat flesh The Buddha told Mañjuśrī Those in the world who follow my words know that they are a Buddhas words Mañjuśrī said to the Buddha WorldHonored One some in the world talk about liberation but their liberation is not liberation 
Only the Buddha Dharma leads to liberation Some in the world talk about renouncing family life but their renunciation is not renunciation 
Only the Buddha Dharma leads to renunciation of family life 
WorldHonored One some in the world talk about not eating flesh because they believe that they have no self that eats flesh Only the Dharma of the WorldHonored One reveals ones self which definitely does not eat flesh The Buddha asked Mañjuśrī Do you want to know the origins of the paths established outside the right path 
I will tell you Mañjuśrī answered Yes WorldHonored One I would be delighted to hear The Buddha told Mañjuśrī Countless asakhyeya kalpas ago a Buddha called Kucchandabhadra appeared in the world in this city 
At that time the world had no grit and no paths other than the Mahāyāna and all sentient beings were happy 
After that Tathāgata stayed in the world for a long time he entered parinirvāṇa After his parinirvāṇa the true Dharma abided in the world for a long time When it began to perish those who observed the precepts decreased and those who did nondharmas increased 
At that time in an araṇya lived a bhikṣu named Buddha Wisdom A benevolent man gave him as alms a priceless robe 
Out of pity for the almsgiver that bhikṣu accepted it and showed it to hunters When the hunters saw his fine garment they decided to steal it At night they took that bhikṣu deep into a mountain beat him bound his hands and hung him naked from a tree 
That night a Brahmin went to that araṇya to pick flowers When he saw a tiger he was terrified and ran into the mountain Then he saw that bhikṣu with a beaten body and bound hands hanging naked from a tree Astonished he said Alas 
He must know that wearing a kaṣāya is not the cause of liberation The ascetic practice of hanging himself from a tree is the right training to attain bodhi How could he have abandoned good dharmas This clearly is the liberation path Mistaking it for the true Dharma that Brahmin shed his clothes pulled out his hair and became a naked śramaṇa 
After that bhikṣu was released from his fetters to cover his body he took tree barks dyed them with red stone and made a grass duster to dispel mosquitoes 
Then another flowerpicking Brahmin saw him and thought This bhikṣu wore a fine robe and now he wears this 
How could he have abandoned good dharmas This clearly is the liberation path That Brahmin then followed suit This is the origin of Brahmins renunciation of family life 
At dusk that bhikṣu entered a river to bathe To wash the lesions on his head he used a wash cloth to cover them And he took the ragged clothes discarded by a cow herder to cover his body 
Then another Brahmin saw him and thought This bhikṣu wore a kaṣāya and now he has discarded it He must know that wearing a kaṣāya is not the cause of liberation Therefore he wears ragged clothes bathes three times a day and night and practices asceticism 
How could he have abandoned good dharmas This clearly is the liberation path That Brahmin then followed suit This is the origin of Brahmins practice of asceticism 
After that bhikṣu bathed he was plagued by flies biting the lesions on his body So he smeared white ash on the lesions and used a wash cloth to cover his body 
This is the origin of Brahmins smearing themselves with ash 
Then that bhikṣu used fire to cauterize his lesions When the pain became unbearable he committed suicide by jumping off a cliff 
The one who saw him thought This bhikṣu wore a fine robe and now he has ended up like this 
How could he have discarded good dharmas Jumping off a cliff must be the liberation path This is the origin of worshipping fire and jumping off a cliff 
Thus ninetysix paths arose because people saw that bhikṣu in various appearances entertained various thoughts and formed their own views 
As an analogy people in a country look at one another and entertain violent thoughts Then they kill one another Likewise ninetysix paths were established on peoples different thoughts 
As an analogy a thirsty deer chases a mirage that looks like water until the deer dies from exhaustion 
Likewise when the true Dharma is perishing some people took that bhikṣus nondharma behavior as the Dharma 
However Mañjuśrī people in the world hold wrong views and entertain strange thoughts about ones true self as they describe liberation and self Those who seek the supraworldly truth do not know a Tathāgatas veiled teachings but claim that a Buddha has taught no self  They ponder their words as did those who established the wrong paths 
The world follows ignorance and those who seek the supraworldly truth have lost the wisdomknowledge of making veiled statements 
Therefore a Tathāgata expounds the Middle Way of the One Vehicle  which is apart from the two opposites and reveals that ones true self the Buddha the Dharma and the Saṅgha are true 
Therefore the Middle Way is called the Mahāyāna Then Aṅgulimāla said to the Buddha WorldHonored One sentient beings do not know the Middle Way but fancy that they can expound it The Buddha told Aṅgulimāla Few people who have heard this sūtra believe it 
Most people in the future will malign this sūtra Aṅgulimāla said to the Buddha WorldHonored One I pray that You will tell us how many sentient beings from which directions will malign this sūtra and how many sentient beings will become icchantikas 
Where can one find those who can say comforting words to sentient beings 
I pray that the Tathāgata out of compassion will tell us The Buddha answered In the future in the central region  hundred thousand koṭi sentient beings will malign this sūtra and  koṭi sentient beings will become icchantikas in the east  thousand koṭi sentient beings will malign this sūtra and  koṭi sentient beings will become icchantikas 
In the west  hundred koṭi sentient beings will malign this sūtra and  koṭi sentient beings will become icchantikas in the south  koṭi sentient beings will malign this sūtra and  koṭi sentient beings will become icchantikas 
The Kophen Kingdom will preserve my remaining Dharma and my Dharma will not perish in the Bharukaccha Kingdom  nor the kingdom of the Vindhya mountain range  
Half of the bhikṣus in Kophen will practice the Mahāyāna and half of them will delight in the Mahāyāna and expound it 
In the south there will be those who free from the eight evil ways walk the firm path train in a Tathāgatas actions and expound that a Tathāgata is eternal and changeless in accordance with a Tathāgatas store of teachings BodhisattvaMahāsattvas bhikṣus bhikṣuṇīs upāsakas and upāsikās will walk the firm path and bear and uphold my Dharma Then Mañjuśrī said to the Buddha Amazing 
WorldHonored One the Buddha Dharma will abide in the south The Buddha told Mañjuśrī Indeed indeed 
When my Dharma abides in the south for a while you Bodhisattvas who practice asceticism should not spare your bodies and lives and to comfort all sentient beings should expound a Tathāgatas teaching on the eternal and changeless Tathāgata store As other Buddhas do not delight in being born here to bear innumerable sentient beings in this ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World I alone have come here to deliver them 
Likewise during the remaining eighty years as the true Dharma perishes BodhisattvaMahāsattvas will not delight in bearing and upholding the true Dharma 
Not sparing your bodies and lives you all will expound a Tathāgatas teaching on the eternal and changeless Tathāgata store At that time whether or not sentient beings believe it you Bodhisattvas should think Even if my body is chopped into pieces I will realize the everabiding body Therefore for you and innumerable other BodhisattvaMahāsattvas to bear and uphold the true Dharma in the south is the foremost difficult thing Therefore I often praise the south as the final place to expound the Dharma 
Because of the power of Mañjuśrī Bodhisattvas awesome virtue and renown or because of fear or a sense of shame sentient beings in Jambudvīpa and other continents will turn to  
As an analogy a king hears other kings ways in order to rule his country Likewise Khopen and Bharukaccha out of fear or a sense of shame will expound the secret store in the Mahāyāna However they will not expound a Tathāgatas teaching on the eternal and changeless Tathāgata store 
Mañjuśrī as an analogy when grassland is set on fire it burns in the middle not the edges 
Likewise the firm path in my birthplace is gone but my remaining Dharma will abide on the edges of the south because Bodhisattvas there will bear and uphold the true Dharma 
Know that a Tathāgata will be in their midst Then the godking akroDevānāmIndra and his retinue from the Thirtythree Heavens bowed down at the Buddhas feet 
After making great offerings he said to the Buddha WorldHonored One together we will protect and uphold this sūtra We request Your permission and pray that out of compassion for all sentient beings You will tell us the name of this sūtra The Buddha told the godking akra Kauśika this sūtra is called Aṅgulimālika 
Kauśika this sūtra is as hard to acquire as is an udumbara flower Then Abhimaru the godking akras eldest son bowed down at the Buddhas feet and said WorldHonored One when my fatherking battles asuras he tells his chariot driver You should gloriously subjugate the asura army The driver said to him Have no worry 
I will never let the king die before I die I am resolved to fight to my death 
Others will also do their best not sparing their bodies Likewise WorldHonored One during the remaining eighty years as the true Dharma perishes BodhisattvaMahāsattvas who will expound a Tathāgatas teaching on the eternal and changeless Tathāgata store might think When I expound the Dharma many sentient beings cannot endure hearing it 
So I will not expound it At that time do not allow good men who hear about difficulties to quit know how to drive well the majestic Dharma vehicle the Tathāgata store and know that a Tathāgata who is eternal quiet and changeless widely expounds in the world 
At that time if a good man will expound a Tathāgatas teaching on the eternal and changeless Tathāgata store I will become a bhikṣu to protect him not sparing my body and life Then the godking akras many children male and female and other gods bowed down at the Buddhas feet and vowed I will become a bhikṣu a bhikṣuṇī an upāsaka or an upāsikā to protect him not sparing my body and life Then the Buddha praised Very good very good 
You all should stand firm acknowledge a Tathāgatas kindness and widely expound a Tathāgatas permanence eternity quietness and changelessness Then King Prasenajit commander of the four types of troops told his ministers Now someone like a rākṣasa has killed nine hundred ninetynine people short of a thousand by only one made a garland with their fingers and smeared his body with their blood 
In this city men and women dare not leave their homes and even birds and animals are too scared of him to come forth 
You now should announce inside and outside  King Prasenjit is leading the four types of troops to crush that rākṣasa Aṅgulimāla All of you should take up arms and fight him with all your strength Whether or not you can kill him you will receive a reward according to your merit 
You will be given whatever you want However people were terrified of Aṅgulimālas evil name and no one responded to the announcement except the kings attendants who had no choice but to obey because of their respect for the king 
Then his queen and concubines wept and pleaded We would rather that you lose the position of a king than go to battle in person Then King Prasenajit summoned divinators and inquired about the favorable or unfavorable outcome 
He will perish Although the king received these words he still disbelieved them He took his four types of troops to visit the Buddha Upon arrival he bowed down at the Buddhas feet Looking fearful and with sweat flowing down his forehead he sat aside 
Although the WorldHonored One who possessed all wisdomknowledge knew everything He purposely asked Great King why do you perspire The King answered Now there is a rākṣasa called Aṅgulimāla 
I will lead these four types of troops to battle him The Buddha asked the king Does the great king want to battle him today The king answered I now singlemindedly place my faith at the Buddhas feet While the four types of troops were in huge fear the king withheld his fear because he relied on the Buddhas awesome virtue 
The king said to the Buddha If he comes he will be by himself Then the WorldHonored One pointed at Aṅgulimāla and said This is the evervictorious Aṅgulimāla The king stared at Aṅgulimāla without a blink 
Observing his body bloodshot eyes and commanding bearing the king was astounded and his hair stood on end as if he were seized by a nonhuman His courage dissipated and his saber fell to the ground He drew near the Tathāgatas lion throne earnestly taking refuge in the Tathāgata who regarded all as Rāhula 
Meanwhile the four types of troops were even more terrified In confusion and disorder they scurried away 
Then to comfort sentient beings the Tathāgata emitted the radiance of fearlessness illuminating sentient beings and bringing them peace and joy 
King Prasenajit his retinues inside and outside  and his people in the city thought Aṅgulimāla must have been subjugated by the WorldHonored One King Prasenajit praised Amazing 
WorldHonored One You are truly the foremost yoke  You are truly the unsurpassed teacher of gods and humans who has skillfully established in the true Dharma such a violent man who did huge evil karmas Then the WorldHonored One praised in verse 
If a BodhisattvaMahāsattva first displays abandonment of selfrestraint then displays his merit he illuminates the world like the moon after the clouds are gone He delivers innumerable sentient beings to display a Tathāgatas merit 
Great King know that he is not an evil man but a Bodhisattva versed in using skillful means The king asked the Buddha Why do You say that he is not an evil man 
He ravaged his teachers wife then followed his evil teachers command to act like a piśāca The Buddha told the king He did not ravage his teachers wife That teacher and wife were a manifestation to convert his mind because he delighted in learning from his teacher and in speaking pure words 
Great King know that this event is extraordinary As an analogy the thrust of a dragon elephant is beyond that of a donkey 
Indeed Great King a Tathāgata is a great elephantking He gives veiled teachings in secret words which are beyond voicehearers and Pratyekabuddhas Only Buddhas can do so 
Great King south of here past worlds as numerous as the sands of sixtytwo Ganges Rivers there is a world called Adorned with All Treasures whose Buddha is called Superior Great Energetic Progress That the World Is Delighted to See the Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha He teaches in that world where there is neither the VoiceHearer Vehicle nor the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle The Mahāyāna is the only vehicle and even the names of other vehicles do not exist 
The sentient beings there have no aging illness or suffering Enjoying only happiness they have an immeasurable lifespan and immeasurable radiance The wonderful things there are beyond analogies in all worlds That is why that world is called Adorned with All Treasures and why its Buddha is called Superior Great Energetic Progress That the World Is Delighted to See 
Great King you should express sympathetic joy and join your palms in reverence Is that Tathāgata a different person 
Aṅgulimāla is none other than that Buddha  
Know that Buddhas states are inconceivable Then King Prasenajit said to the divinators All you said is a lie You should quickly go far way 
Do not lie again Then gods humans dragons voicehearers Bodhisattvas King Prasenajit and people from all cities and villages through the Buddhas awesome spiritual power gathered there They bowed down at Aṅgulimālas feet and with one voice praised in verse Namo the Tathāgata with a boundless body Namo Aṅgulimāla who uses skillful means 
I now bow down at the holy ones feet And repent at the honored ones soft feet I now repent to the honored Tathāgata Aṅgulimāla Whose body lives a double life For our sake he has come here And manifested a Buddhas image in superb flaming radiance To illuminate sentient beings and give teachings I repeatedly repent to the immeasurable body of a SamyakSabuddha Who serves as the reliance for those without reliance And as the kin for those without kin 
Amazing Two Buddhas have appeared in the world What never before happened in the world has now happened It is extraordinary to see two Buddhas in the world Like a lotus flower born from fire 
Then the WorldHonored One told King Prasenajit North of here past worlds as numerous as the sands of fortytwo Ganges Rivers there is a world called Constant Joy whose Buddha is called Joy Store Jewel Accumulation the Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha 
The Mahāyāna is the only vehicle and even the names of other vehicles do not exist The sentient beings there have no aging illness or suffering Enjoying only happiness they have an immeasurable lifespan and immeasurable radiance The wonderful things there are beyond analogies in all worlds 
Is that Tathāgata a different person 
Mañjuśrī is none other than that Buddha  
If one reverently pays respects to Aṅgulimāla and Mañjuśrī and has heard their names one will see the world Constant Joy as if seeing ones own home Because one has heard their names one can close the door to the four evil lifepaths Even if one jokes follows others for fame and profit follows those on the wrong paths violates the grave prohibitions or commits sins that will result in suffering in the hell of the five no interruptions one also can close the door to the four evil lifepaths 
If good men or women use these two names for protection in their present and future lives they will be protected in wilderness and perilous or terrifying places and will have no fear anywhere Even gods dragons yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kinaras mahoragas and piśācas will not disturb them Then the WorldHonored One told King Prasenajit A Tathāgatas words have such great awesome virtues 
Great King you should make an offering to Aṅgulimālas mother 
Do not forget that his mother is protected by my skillful means Then Aṅgulimālas mother ascended into the sky to the height of seven tāla trees and spoke in verse 
After speaking this stanza she vanished 
Then King Prasenajit asked the Buddha WorldHonored One was that an illusion The Buddha told the great king It was a manifested mother 
As this manifested mother said likewise are Bodhisattva actions Then Aṅgulimālas teacher Maṇibhadra ascended into the sky to the height of seven tāla trees and spoke in verse Suppose that a jackal Often roams with a lion Although it stays near the lion Its voice can never compare with the lions As it is scared to death by the lions sound How can it mimic a lions roar 
I am like that small animal Although I have long been Aṅgulimālas teacher I can never emit The fearless sounds of a hero among men If he did not use skillful means I would be dead 
I am like a jackal How can I accept his offerings My actions are foolish And Bodhisattvas stay far away from me Regarding all sentient beings Equally as His only son The Buddha manifests countless illusions But sentient beings cannot know this 
Even if He manifests a hundred thousand koṭi Brahmin teachers Sentient beings cannot know this Only a Buddha knows another Buddhas illusions Know that a BuddhaBhagavān Is the king of illusions 
Then Maṇibhadras wife spoke in verse Sentient beings do not know a Buddhas virtues They say that the Ciñcāmānavika was real Because they do not know that she was manifested by the Tathāgata He manifested my body Which is an illusion 
Great King should know that A Buddhas body is inconceivable Caṇḍālas cannot get near the king Because they constantly fear death Not to mention speaking to the king 
Although they are humans They dare not get near another human Not to mention gods or a Buddha 
Innumerable gods dragons and other protectors of the Dharma Constantly make offerings to the Tathāgata They end the lives of Those who have evil intentions toward the Buddha 
The Buddha uses skillful means To display various illusions In order to restrain future sentient beings From doing countless nondharmas As a Buddhas manifestations are a great illusion So too is His skillfulmeans body 
After speaking these words she vanished 
King Prasenajit after hearing and seeing these extraordinary things exuberantly rejoiced 
He asked the Buddha Was that an illusion The Buddha said Great King know that Aṅgulimālas mother teacher and teachers wife were manifested by me 
The way I display manifestations is inconceivable as I teach and transform Aṅgulimāla in order to deliver innumerable sentient beings Then King Prasenajit said to the Buddha WorldHonored One I will give great alms for seven days because Aṅgulimāla Tathāgata is a fortune field The Buddha approved Indeed indeed Then gods dragons and other protectors of the Dharma spoke together in verse 
A Tathāgata has a boundless body Boundless wisdom Countless good names And countless strong guards As a Tathāgatas body is boundless So too are His secret marks As His words are boundless So too are His veiled statements As He boundlessly illuminates the world His radiance is boundless 
His merits are beyond number Description and measure With hindrancefree wisdom like the open sky And a body like the open sky The Tathāgata comforts Mañjuśrī And all of us 
Because of Aṅgulimāla The BuddhaBhagavān has come 
The Tathāgata regards all Equally as Rāhula 
After the WorldHonored One pronounced this sūtra all in the assembly such as gods dragons other protectors of the Dharma voicehearers Bodhisattvas and King Prasenajit admired the actions of Aṅgulimāla and Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva Wishing to be born in their Buddha Lands the multitude activated the anuttarasamyaksabodhi mind and exuberantly rejoiced 

BUDDHACARITA IN PRAISE OF BUDDHAS ACTS Composed by Bodhisattva Aśvaghoṣa Translated by the Indian Tripiṭaka Master Tan Wuchen  during the Northern Liang a Fascicle One Chapter I Birth  The unconquerable king of the ākyas the progeny of Ikṣvāku was endowed with virtue and pure riches and so his name was uddhodana Living beings happily looked up to him as to the moon which had just risen 
The king was like akra ruler of the gods and his wife was like acī Her steadfastness was as solid as the earth and her thoughts were as pure as a lotus flower By way of comparison she was called Māyā but she was beyond compare 
In that godlike queen a spirit descended and dwelled in her womb 
The mother was completely free from sorrow She did not have any illusory thoughts In her weariness she railed at the commonplace and longed to stay in a secluded forest in the excellent garden of Lumbinī where springs flowed and flowers and fruits were luxuriant 
She wanted to meditate in quietude and beseeched the king for permission to travel there 
The king understood her earnest wish and thought that it was wonderful He ordered that both her own and her external retinue should go to that garden 
Queen Māyā perceived that the time of delivery was at hand She lay down on an excellent couch with numerous ladies waiting upon her 
On the eighth day of the fourth month the moment was serene and the atmosphere harmonious She observed the fast and developed her pure qualities and the Bodhisattva was born from her right side Saving the world with his great compassion he did not let his mother suffer 
King Aurva was born from the thigh King Pṛthu was born from the hand King Māndhātṛ was born from the head and King Kakśīvat was born from the armpit 
The Bodhisattva was just like that born from the right side When in due course he had issued from the womb his light shone everywhere As if he had fallen down from the sky he did not pass through the portal of birth 
Having cultivated virtue for countless eons he was born fully conscious without any confusion Established and immovable in the truth his brightness was quite majestic 
With luster he appeared from the womb like the sun that was just rising While observing his utter brilliance ones sight remained uninjured 
Even though one looked at him his light did not blind one as when observing the moon in the sky The light of his person was shining just like the sun outshining the light of a lamp In the same way the Bodhisattvas body of true gold was shining all around 
Upright and clear of mind he walked seven steps with dignity On the bottom of his feet his level soles were well placed His brightness was as penetrating as the seven stars 
Stepping like a lion king of the animals he observed the four directions 
As this birth is a buddhas birth it is my last birth Just in this one birth I shall save all  
At this occasion two pleasant streams came pouring down from the sky One was warm and the other cool They poured down on his head so that he felt physically happy 
Dwelling in his precious palace he lay on his couch of beryl The celestial kings supported four legs of the couch with golden lotuses in their hands 
The gods waited upon him in the sky holding a precious parasol Acknowledging his majesty the spirits were full of praise and they urged him to complete the Buddhas path 
The dragon kings were filled with joy thirsting for the most excellent b Chapter I Law They had served the buddhas of the past and now they met the Bodhisattva 
They scattered mandāra flowers offering joyful worship with all their hearts As the Tathāgata appeared in the world the gods of the pure abodes rejoiced 
Having done away with the joy of desire they were pleased with the Law as it would let living beings who flounder in the sea of suffering obtain deliverance 
The king of the precious mountain Sumeru was holding this great earth in his firm grip but when the Bodhisattva appeared in the world it was swayed by the storm of his qualities It quaked heavily all around just like a boat struck by waves in a storm 
Fine powder incense of sandalwood and a multitude of precious lotus receptacles floated in the sky blowing in the wind They fell and scattered in profusion Celestial garments descended from the sky and upon touching them one was thrilled 
The sun and the moon were as usual but radiance doubled their light Fires flared up spontaneously without any fuel all over the world Cool wells with clean water sprang up here and there all by themselves 
The multitude of ladies in the inner palace were astonished at this wonder They rushed to compete with one another to drink from or bathe in them and all had happy thoughts 
In Lumbinī garden they thronged in the grove 
A multitude of wonderful fine flowers blossomed out of season The various kinds of fierce beings momentarily had friendly thoughts and diseases in the world disappeared by themselves without any cure applied 
The birds and animals with their confused cries fell silent not making any sound The ten thousand rivers all stopped flowing and muddy waters all became clear In the sky there were no clouds and celestial drums sounded all by themselves 
All the worldly beings were safe and happy just as when a country in upheaval suddenly has obtained a wise and able ruler 
The Bodhisattva was born to save the world from suffering Only the celestial king Māra was full of sorrow and did not rejoice 
When the king his father saw the birth of his son he was amazed in wonder Although ordinarily his disposition was serious he was startled and his usual countenance changed In his anxiety he had mixed feelings of both joy and distress 
When his wife saw that her son was not born in the usual waya woman being timorous by natureshe felt contradictory emotions in her distress 
The old women were confused and prayed to the spirits Each one of them beseeched the spirit that they usually served praying for the safety of the Crown Prince 
At that time there was a brahman in the grove a discerner of signs He had a dignified demeanor and was endowed with learning He was eloquent and had a lofty reputation He beheld the signs and rejoiced in his heart overjoyed at the wonder 
He knew that the king felt distress and he informed the king of the truth When one is born into the world wants only an excellent son 
O king you should feel great joy now as you would at the celebration upon a full month  You now have a wonderful son His light will most certainly make your clan famous 
Be assured and pleased and do not feel uncertain anymore Good luck will be concentrated in your house and country From now on you will be increasingly prosperous 
The excellent son born to you will certainly be the worlds salvation Yes this superior person is goldcolored and very bright With such excellent signs he most certainly will attain perfect awakening 
All around he will be a ruler of the great earth a brave and righteous ruler He will rule the four worlds governing over all kings just as the light of the sun is superior among any kind of light in the world 
If he dwells in the forests in the mountains and seeks deliverance with all his heart he will accomplish true wisdom and shine everywhere in the world 
Just as Mount Sumeru is the king among mountains and just as gold is superior among all precious things just as the sea is superior among all streams and  Just as the moon is superior among the stars and the sun is superior among all luminous bodies when the Tathāgata dwells in the world he is the most honored one among twolegged beings 
His pleasant eyes are long and wide opening and closing with long eyelashes His eyes are blue shaped like halfmoons How could these signs be negative as they are all causes of excellence  
The king then said to the twiceborn one If it is as you say why would such wonderful signs not be associated with a former king but be manifested in my progeny  
The brahman said to the king Do not speak like that 
Learning or wisdom fame or career for such four things there must not be any question of former or later 
The specific natures of things are each produced arising from a cause I shall now give you parallels O king listen carefully now 
In each of the families of the two seers Bhṛgu and Aṅgiras an excellent son was born after a very long period Bṛhaspati and ukra 
After the scriptures had long ceased the seer Sārasvata produced Parāśara who continued the scriptural texts of the Vedas 
The seer Vyāsa composed many scriptural texts The final heir Vālmīki extensively collected stanzas sections and verses 
The seer Atri did not understand medical treatises treya who was born later was well versed in curing the hundred illnesses 
Later King Gādhin completely understood the heretical doctrine 
The original family of King Ikṣvāku could not regulate the tide of the sea but when King Sagara raised a thousand princes he could regulate the tide of the great sea so that it did not exceed the usual limit 
The seer Janaka obtained the path of meditation without any teacher 
Every attainment of fame is produced by ones own efforts Either the former ones were excellent and the later ones weak or the former ones were weak and the later ones excellent 
Kings and divine seers do not need a family inheritance Therefore there should not be any question of former and later in any world 
The same now applies to you great king You should have joyful thoughts As your thoughts are joyful you will always be free from suspicion  
When the king heard the seers exposition he became joyful and his worship increased 
The excellent son born to me now will succeed to the position of wheelturning  In my years of decline I will go forth and develop pure conduct I will not let my noble prince renounce the world and wander in mountain forests  
At that moment in the garden nearby there was an ascetic seer His name was Asita and he was skillful in the interpretation of signs When came to the gate of the kings palace the king thought Applied to brahmadeva he practices asceticism and finds happiness in the Right Law 
These two characteristics are both obvious  The king then greatly rejoiced as was endowed with the signs of pure conduct 
The king immediately invited him into his palace and made offerings with reverence As he was led into the inner palace was happy just to see the prince 
Even though there was a multitude of ladies he behaved as if in a secluded forest When was seated on the seat of the Right Law increased his reverence and respectfully waited upon him just as King Antideva had waited upon Vasiṣṭha 
The king then said to the seer I am most fortunate now 
You deign to come and receive me I ask for your timely instruction about all that should be done  
Thus urged the seer was very happy Splendid ever victorious king You are completely endowed with a multitude of qualities I am happy that you have come with a request 
You are generous and full of respect for the Right Law You are kind and wise of a most excellent family humble and very courteous 
You have previously planted many fine causes and their excellent fruition is now seen Listen to my explanation of the present causality 
I heard a celestial voice in the sky coming from the path of the sun It explained that you King will have a crown prince who will complete the path of right awakening 
Moreover having seen previous auspicious signs I have come here now on purpose I would like to see the ākya king who will raise the banner of the Right Law  
When the king heard the seers explanation he became certain and free from the net of doubt He asked the Crown Prince to be summoned to be shown to the seer 
The seer observed that the Crown Prince had a wheel with a thousand spokes his feet His fingers and toes had membranes and between his eyebrows was a white tuft of hair He was characterized by cryptorchidism like a horse and his complexion was ablaze with light Seeing that had these wonderful signs let his tears flow and sighed deeply 
When he saw the ascetics tears the king trembled in his heart as he held his son dear Sadness filled his heart He felt alarmed and ill at ease 
spontaneously rose from his seat bowed at the feet of the seer and addressed him This sons birth is wonderful His complexion is utterly majestic almost like that of a celestial being As he shows promise of superiority among humans why would he cause grief 
My son must not be shortlived causing me grief 
I have been thirsting for a long time to obtain immortality but will it yet be rejected 
He must not lose my wealth bring my family to ruin and destroy the country 
If I have an excellent son who will stay I have someone to whom to entrust the countrys inheritance When I die I will be joyful in my heart I shall happily be reborn in another world I will be like someone who has one eye closed and the other in awakeness 
One must not be like a flower in the autumn frost Even though it may open it cannot achieve fruition Concerning ones close family the depth a of ones love for a son is unsurpassed 
It is the proper time to give me an explanation so that I may again breathe freely  
The seer knew that the king the father was very sorrowful in his heart and immediately said to the great king Do not be afraid now King I have told you before Great King Do not have any doubt The presentsigns are as before 
I consider that the evening of my life is worse than my earlier sad tears 
Now that my end is drawing near this son will rule the world He is born in order to end birth Such a person is rarely encountered 
He will give up his position of noble king unattached to the objects of the five desires He will strenuously develop asceticism open up to awakening and obtain the truth 
He will permanently dispel the darkness of delusion for living beings Always ablaze in the world his wisdom is the light of the sun 
Beings drown in a sea of suffering and their illnesses are as heaps of froth Decay and old age are giant waves and death is the biggest wave in the sea 
In his light boat of wisdom he will cross the difficulties of these currents His wisdom will go against the current and his pure morality will be the shore 
His samādhi will be a cool pond rightly receiving wondrous birds So very deep and wide is the great river of the Right Law 
When thirsty beings drink from it they are revived Deeply attached to the objects of the five desires one is harassed by suffering Lost in the wilderness of birth and death no one knows where to turn 
But the Bodhisattva has arisen in the world opening the path of deliverance 
As the fire of worldly desires burns and as the firewood of the objects is ablaze he raises the clouds of his great compassion The rain of the Law will fall and cause its extinction 
The gate of delusion has two parts and desire is the bolt It confines living beings The way to escape is the gate of deliverance 
With the pincers of his adamantine wisdom he will pull out the adverse awl of lust 
Entangled in the web of delusion one suffers without anything to rely on 
When a king of the Law has stood up in the world he can undo the bonds of beings b Chapter I  
Do not give rise O King to the calamity of grief because of this son You should feel sorrow for the beings who are attached to desire and who disregard the Right Law 
I am destroyed now by old age and death far removed from any noble quality I may have obtained the trance states but I did not obtain their benefits 
I will never hear the Right Law from this Bodhisattva When my body is destroyed after my lifes end I shall certainly be reborn in the three difficult heavens  
When the king and his retinue heard the seers explanation he knew that he was distressed for himself His fear was completely eradicated 
Having this wonderful son my heart is completely at ease 
his going forth giving up worldly splendor his practice of the path of a seer and the fact that he will not succeed to the throne of the land still make me unhappy  
Then the seer spoke the truth to the king It certainly will be as you O King anxiously think He will complete the path of right awakening  
Having appeased the minds of the king and his retinue himself ascended into the sky through his divine power and departed 
Having seen the wonderful characteristics of his son and having heard Asitas decidedly truthful explanation King uddhodana then held his son in reverence 
He issued a general pardon in the world and all prisons were thrown open 
When a person of this world has a son he may accept or reject the fact according to what is proper Everything is done relying on the instructions found in the scriptural texts 
When ten days after the birth of his son had passed the king felt secure and calm at heart He made all the sacrifices to the celestial spirits and he gave liberal offerings to the virtuous 
The śramaṇas and brahmans offered incantations and prayed for good fortune for close family and for all his ministers and also for the poor of the land 
A group of women from villages and towns cows horses elephants money and material goodsall were provided according to everyones needs c  
selected an auspicious time through divination and moved his son back to his own palace The white tusks of the elephants the chariot adorned with the seven precious things and precious stones of variegated colorstheir brilliance was utterly bright 
His wife held the Crown Prince in her arms and did obeisance to the celestial spirits all around 
She then mounted her precious chariot with a multitude of ladies waiting upon her The king and his ministers all accompanied her like akra the ruler of the gods surrounded by a multitude of gods 
Just as Maheśvara to whom was unexpectedly born a sixfaced son  and who then arranged for every kind of preparation and provision and asked for blessings likewise the king whose crown prince was now born arranged for all the preparations in the same way 
When the celestial king Vaiśravaṇa had Nalakūbara the whole multitude of gods was filled with great joy 
The Crown Prince was now born to the king and the whole population of the land of Kapilavastu was likewise filled with joy Chapter II Life in the Palace  
In the royal house of uddhodana as he had a noble son his close family and namesake brethren and his ministers were all devoted then 
Elephants horses and precious chariots national riches and vessels with the seven precious thingsthese steadily increased day by day and were accordingly amassed 
Countless hidden treasures spontaneously emerged from the earth A herd of maddened white elephants arrived on their own without any call from the pure Snowy Mountains and became subdued by themselves not curbed by any person 
All kinds of horses of variegated colors their bodies utterly majestic with red manes and delicate long tails soared as swiftly as if they were flying 
Born in the wilds at dawn they arrived on their own at this occasion 
Unspotted calm fine cows strong sturdy and beautiful of body all gathered in great numbers with gentle steps and gave fragrant milk at this occasion 
Enemies became peaceful and neutrality gradually turned into pure friendship The sincere became close friends Any rebellion was completely eliminated 
It rained in due time with a gentle breeze and the thunder did not roll Plants did not wait for their time  and at the harvest the yield was double 
The five types of grains were fresh and fragrant light and easy to digest All who were with child were content and physically at ease 
Except for those who experienced the fourfold attitudes of the noble for all other people in the world goods were freely produced for each one They did not have any further needs 
There was no arrogance stinginess or envy and no noxious thoughts either All men and women were as adept as anyone in the eon 
The temples of the gods and the monasteries gardens springs and ponds were all like heavenly things emerging spontaneously on this occasion 
No one went hungry Weapons disappeared and epidemics ceased The whole population in the land was like a close family with mutually affectionate reverence 
With love for the Law indulged in mutual pleasures and did not have any tainted desire They sought after riches with righteousness free from any covetous thought 
They practiced generosity for the sake of the Law and did not think of seeking for any reward They practiced the fourfold pure conduct  dispelling any noxious thought 
In the past when the crown prince ditya was born to King Manu the whole country met with good fortune and all evil was at once appeased 
When the Crown Prince was born to the present king his virtue was also like this Because was endowed with the meaningfulness of all virtues he was called Siddhārtha 
Then when Lady Māyā saw that the son she had given birth to was as beautiful as a celestial youth completely endowed with everything beautiful she was overcome with an excess of joy Her life ended and she was reborn in heaven 
Mahāprajāpātī Gautamī saw that the Crown Prince was a celestial youth that his virtuous appearance was wonderful in the world After the life of his natural mother ended she raised him with affection as if he were her own son and the child respected her as if she were his own mother 
Just as the glow of the sun and moon begins faintly but gradually shines more brightly the Crown Prince grew up daily renewed The same applied to his virtuous appearance 
Priceless was his fragrance of sandalwood and his famous treasure of jāmbūnada  Medicines of divine seers protected him and necklaces adorned him 
When the dependentstatesin the region heard that the king had a crown prince they offered precious things oxen and sheep deer horses and carts 
Precious objects and ornaments help make the mind of a crown prince joyful but even though he had ornaments and the amusing toys of an infant b Chapter II  the Crown Princes nature was serious His body was young but his mind was mature 
His mind was fixed on a higher excellent object untainted by splendor When he studied arts and various skills he surpassed his instructors after hearing only once 
Seeing his intelligence the king his father was deeply worried about the revelation that would go beyond the worldly inquired far and wide among the famous nobility about a family with propriety and righteousness instructed in deportment 
The maiden with the finest appearance was called Yaśodharā She was fit to become his wife the consort of a crown prince alluring him and holding his attention 
The beauty of the worthy consort and her attractive and fair disposition were as captivating as a celestial queens While dwelling together they were joyful night and day 
They had a pure palace put up for them spacious and beautiful and with the utmost in adornment It rose high in the sky just like a white cloud in autumn As its temperature was adapted to the four seasons chose the best dwelling for each season 
He was surrounded by a group of singing women playing celestial music He did not have any fondness for vulgar music and women which would raise a notion of disgust for the world 
Lady musicians played celestial sounds just like celestial gandharvas in their natural precious palace Their singing and beauty were dazzling to the mind and eyes 
Their music was like this while the Bodhisattva dwelled high in his palace 
The king his father developed pure qualities for the sake of the Crown Prince dwelling in tranquility Kind and friendly he was converted by the Right Law He befriended the worthy and kept away from bad influences His mind was not tainted by lust 
His pronouncements converted heretics and he put a stop to any rebellious plotting He taught the way to save the world that all people might obtain happiness 
Just as my son is happy now may all people be the same  He made offerings to fire and served the spirits He held his palms together and drank soma 
He bathed in the waters of the Ganges and cleansed his mind with the water of the Law His prayers for good fortune were not for his own preservation but indeed for his son and for all people 
His pleasant words were not untrue and his true words were not unpleasant 
If he could not speak truthfully because he was ashamed he did not concerning anything pleasant or unpleasant rely on any notion of covetousness or anger 
His purpose was to maintain silence He was just and put a stop to contentious disputes not by means of a gathering to bring sacrifices to the gods but by excelling in merit when deciding a matter 
When he saw beings with many aspirations he gave abundantly beyond their expectations In his mind there was no thought of hostility He subdued the enemy with virtue 
By disciplining one he protected the seven Free from the seven he guarded the five Having obtained the three he understood the three Knowing the two he gave up the two 
He did not speak harshly but gave instructions with soft words In his compassion he was generous with his riches pointing out the way to depend on them Trained in the path of divine seers he dispelled any angry thought His fame and virtue were known all around and his worldly ties were forever severed 
When a master craftsman develops his bright virtue the entire land carries on the practice In the same way when someones mind is tranquil his four limbs and his faculties follow 
As the years passed Yaśodharā the worthy consort of uddhodanas Crown Prince eventually and gave birth to Rāhula 
King uddhodana thought to himself My crown prince has a son My posterity will continue The right changes will never end 
Because the Crown Prince has a son his love for his son will be the same as mine He will no longer consider going forth but will determinedly develop goodness 
My mind is now greatly at ease just like the happiness rebirth in heaven  Similar to the path on which the seer kings at the beginning of the eon dwelled he observed pure actions and when offering sacrifices he brought no injury to any living creature 
The king mastered the excellence of pure conduct 
His clan and its wealth were excellent He was valiant and possessed great skills He shone brightly in the world just like the suns thousandrayed brightness 
The way in which he was a king of humans was only to reveal his son Revealing his son was for his clan bringing splendor to his family through his fame When ones fame is great one obtains rebirth in heaven and being reborn in heaven ones happiness is complete Being happy wisdom increases 
wished only that the Crown Prince would love his son and not renounce his family While a son is still young no king lets him rule the land considering that mind may yet be negligent 
When one gives reign to ones emotions and is attached to worldly happiness one cannot continue the royal lineage 
But now that the king had a crown prince he indulged him in the five desires at his whim He wished only that would enjoy worldly splendor He did not want to let him apply himself to the path 
The bodhisattva kings of the past even though their path was very firm wanted to develop the happiness of worldly splendor and have sons to continue their posterity Only then did they enter a mountain forest and practice the path of silence b Chapter III Disgust  
Outside there were gardens flowing springs and cool ponds Various trees with flowers and fruits were planted in rows casting deep shade 
Wondrous birds of different kinds flew and sported about Four kinds of flowers on water and land gave out their fine wafting fragrance with blazing colors 
Singing women accordingly played music and their music and songs attracted the Crown Prince While the Crown Prince was listening to these sounds he admired the gardens 
Inwardly he felt profound joy and he wanted to make an excursion and have a look just as a chained maddened elephant constantly longs for the wilderness 
When the king his father heard that the Crown Prince wanted to make an excursion to the gardens he ordered his ministers to display ornamentation and prepare ceremonial plumes 
He had the main royal road made level and anyone offensive removed the aged the sick and deformed the weak and those suffering in poverty He did not want his young happy son see anything that would raise disgust 
When the adornments were duly prepared stated his request and asked to take leave On the Crown Princes approach the king patted his head and gazed long at his face feelings of sadness and joy were intermingled He gave his verbal permission but in his mind he held back 
He was worthy and virtuous and had expert skills He was youthful with a beautiful appearance He wore a fine pure garment with fresh flowers and riding in the same chariot was the one who held the reins 
The streets were strewn with flowers and precious drapery covered the sides of the road Trees lined the road forming a fence adorned with precious objects A profusion of silken parasols and pendant streamers waved in the wind 
Spectators crowded all along the road bowing Their eyes were bright and they gazed without blinking resembling lines of blue lotuses 
entire retinue of subjects followed him just as stars follow the ruler of the constellations From many mouths came the same sound of admiration extolling the wonder in the world 
Noble and base rich and poor young and old and middleagedall reverentially did obeisance and wished only for good fortune 
When in the villages and in the fields they heard that the Crown Prince was going out both the worthy and those of low status did not wait to take leave and those who were awake did not notify those who were asleep 
One did not waste time gathering the six domestic animals Material possessions were not important enough to safeguard and no one made fast the doors They hurried to the side of the road 
In the high pavilions and in the trees on the embankments in the windows and at the crossroads pressing together to see his face they gazed steadily tirelessly watching 
Spectators on high thought they had been dropped to the ground and those on foot thought they had ascended into the sky In their singlemindedness they did not realize that both body and spirit were flying as it were 
They reverently watched  full of respect for his appearance without any thought of negligence His round members and straight limbs their color is like a lotus in full blossom Now he has left the grove where he lives wishing to become a seer of the noble Law  
When the Crown Prince saw the wellkept roads the adornments and the crowds of attendants the fresh brightness of the garments and the carriages he was pleased and joyful at heart 
When the people of the land gazed at the Crown Prince at his dignified deportment and his excellent attendants who were like a crowd of royals they saw that a god had been born as their crown prince 
Then the king of the gods of the pure abodes suddenly transformed by the side of the road into an old person inducing thoughts of disgust c Chapter III When the Crown Prince saw the old man he was startled and questioned his charioteer What kind of a person is this 
His hair is white and his back bent His eyes are bleary and his body trembles He is weak and walks with a stick 
The charioteer hesitated and did not dare answer truthfully The god of the pure abodes increased his divine power so that revealed the words of the truth His beauty has gone and he has lost his vigor He has many sorrows and few pleasures 
The Crown Prince gave a deep sigh and asked the charioteer Is he just the only one who has old age or shall we also be like that  
The charioteer replied Your Highness will also know this fate As time changes ones appearance naturally changes It will certainly happen without any doubt There is no strong youth who does not age 
The Bodhisattva had long developed pure actions of wisdom and had widely planted roots of merit Their agreeable fruition was now ocurring 
Hearing the explanation about the suffering of old age he trembled and his hair stood on end When thunder makes a loud sound animals flee in fear 
The same was true for the Bodhisattva Shaken by fear he sighed deeply Steadily and intently gazing on the suffering of old age he shook his head With this suffering of old age in mind what happiness can a worldling know 
One may possess youth beauty and strength yet there is no one who does not change 
Seeing these characteristics realized in front of ones eyes how can one not feel disgust a  
The Bodhisattva said to his charioteer Quickly turn the chariot and go back As old age is constantly approaching what joy could these gardens afford My life rushes on like the wind 
Turn back to my palace with flying wheels With thoughts dwelling upon that object of decay he returned to an empty tomb as it were 
Touched by the matter and unable to hold back his emotions he found no rest at all within his home 
When the king heard that his son was unhappy he urged him to make another excursion He immediately ordered his ministers to make the adornments even more excellent than before 
The god further transformed into a sick person barely clinging to life by the side of the road He was emaciated but his belly was swollen As he breathed he gasped deeply His hands and feet were spasmodic and the skin was parched 
The Crown Prince asked his charioteer What kind of a man is this then He replied This is somone who has disease 
When the Crown Prince heard the explanation he immediately felt grief in his heart He asked Is just this man sick or would others also be like that  
replied For all in this world it is the same Having a body one must endure ailment Yet in ones foolishness one may enjoy the joys of the court  
When the Crown Prince heard this explanation he immediately became very afraid His body trembled and his mind was disturbed just as the moon appears in rippling waves 
Dwelling in this receptacle of great suffering how can one be at ease 
People in the world are misled by foolishness and impeded by delusion Even though the thief of illness may arrive at any time they have happy thoughts  
Thereupon he turned the chariot and went back in sadness thinking of the suffering of illness was like a man who is badly beaten and who curls up and waits for the next blow He went to rest in his secluded palace and wanted only to turn his back on worldly happiness 
b Chapter III  When the king again heard that his son had returned he asked why 
He was told He has seen a sick person The king was afraid as if he might lose his life 
After severely reprimanding the one who was supposed to have cleared the road his heart was constrained and he was unable to speak Again increased the number of singing women Their music was twice as excellent as before 
Rejoicing in those sounds and sights might experience common pleasures and not become weary of family life Night and day he was offered music and women but his heart did not even begin to rejoice 
The king went out on an excursion himself and sought even harder for excellent fine gardens He selected ladies who were charming and who had an utterly licentious manner 
Then the god of the pure abodesfurther transformed into a dead person The funeral bier carried by four men appeared in front of the Bodhisattva No one else noticed anything but the Bodhisattva and his charioteer saw it 
He asked What kind of a bier is this 
Streamers and flowers and various decorations The attendants are all grieving walking along with disheveled hair and bitterly weeping  
A celestial spirit instructed the charioteer to reply This is a dead person 
His faculties are ruined and his life has ended His mind and consciousness have departed His spirit is gone and his body is parched as rigid as a dead log 
His relatives and friends were bound by their love before but now no one is happy to see him They will abandon him in an empty tomb  
When the Crown Prince heard the word dead he felt grief and his thoughts were constrained 
He asked Is only this person dead or does the same apply to all in the world too  
The reply came All are the same everywhere With a beginning there certainly will be an end Old and young and middleaged having a body they all go to ruin c  
The Crown Prince was startled and leaned against the front of his chariot His breathing almost stopped and he sighed How mistaken are the people in the world 
They openly see the obliteration of the body yet negligence arises 
In ones mind it is neither a dead log nor a stone yet no one ever considers its impermanence  
He immediately ordered to turn the chariot and go back There is no more time for excursions Life is fragile and death unexpected Why indulge in an excursion  
But the charioteer had received an order from the king He was afraid and did not dare turn back He drove on and swiftly urged on  He went straight to the gardens 
The streams in the grove were majestic and clean and the fine trees were all blossoming Divine birds and wondrous animals flew and ran about singing joyfully and harmoniously Their radiance was a joy for ones ears and eyes It looked like the Celestial Nanda Garden 
Each one exhausted her ingenious poses waiting upon him as was fitting Some grasped his hands and feet and some fondled him all over Others laughed in response and some showed a sad countenance They planned to please the Crown Prince so that he would have happy thoughts 
When the multitude of maidenssaw the Crown Princes bright complexion and his appearance which was that of a celestial figure and which did not require any ornamentation but whose plain person surpassed all adornment they all looked on and thought that Candramas the celestial son had come 
They devised all kinds of means but they did not move the Bodhisattvas mind Looking at each other they became ashamed and fell silent not uttering a word 
There was the son of a brahman called Udāyin He said to the ladies You are all beautiful You are intelligent and very skillful but the power of your beauty is not permanent You fully understand the worldly and its secret ways to comply with desire 
When gods see you they may reject their queens and divine seers would waver because of it Why would it be impossible for the son of a human king to be moved by his emotions 
Even though this royal crown princes selfcontrol may now be firm he may be pure and just and endowed only with virtue he is not superior to the power of women 
Long ago Sundarī was able to destroy a great seer  She led him to indulge in desire and stepped on his head with her foot 
The brahman seer Viśvāmitra cultivated the path for tens of thousands of years He became deeply attached to a celestial queen and was suddenly destroyed in one day 
If the power of those beautiful maidens overcame pure conduct all the more can your skills move the prince 
Apply yourselves even more diligently and do not let the royal succession be interrupted A woman may be low by nature yet the worthy will subsequently be overcome by her 
Why do you not exhaust your tricks so that he may have tainted thoughts  
Then when the crowd of ladies had merrily heard Udāyins explanation they increased their joy just as when a fine horse is flogged with a whip They went before the Crown Prince and each one presented several kinds of tricks 
They sang and danced or talked and laughed raising their eyebrows and showing their white teeth They glanced sidelong at him with their beautiful eyes and their sheer garments made their white bodies visible 
Daintily moving with a mincing gait feigning affection one after the other attended to him In their desire they were genuine at heart and fully carried out the words of the great king With dissolute appearance irreverent and vulgar they forgot their sense of shame 
But the Crown Princes mind was firm He was unyielding and did not change his countenance He was like a great dragonelephant surrounded by a herd of elephants They could not confuse his mind 
He dwelled among the multitude as if he were residing in solitude just like akra ruler of the gods surrounded by celestial maidens While the Crown Prince was in the garden he was surrounded in the same way 
Some arranged their dress for him and some washed his hands and feet Some applied perfume and some adorned themselves with flowers 
Some strung necklaces and some embraced him closely Some rested on their couches and some murmured confidentialities with heads inclined 
Some engaged in common diversions and some talked of a multitude of amorous things Some assumed a lustful appearance trying to move his heart 
The Bodhisattvas heart remained pure firm and difficult to change Hearing the words of the ladies he felt neither sorrow nor joy He doubled his considerations of disgust 
He sighed thinking all this was strange He knew for the first time that lustful thoughts of women were so abundant 
They do not know that youthful beauty is ruined in a moment by old age and death Such great delusion Foolishness obscures their minds 
They should consider old age illness and death and night and day apply and exert themselves While a sharp sword hangs over their neck how can they still have fun 
They see the old age illness and death of others but do not know how to observe themselves They are people of mud and woodwhat anxieties would they have 
When for instance there are two trees in the wild both with luxuriant flowers and leaves when one is cut down the other one does not know fear These people are just as unwitting  
Then Udāyin came to where the Crown Prince was He saw that he was quietly meditating in silence his mind free from any notion of the five desires He then said to the Crown Prince Earlier I was ordered by the great king to be a good friend for his son I shall offer you some honest words now 
There are three kinds of friends One may do away with what is unprofitable One may accomplish what is profitable for someone else And one will not abandon you in adversity 
If after having been called your good friend I were to abandon my duty as a man and if my words do not fully reveal my feelings why use the term three gains 
I shall therefore speak true words now in order to show my sincerity 
If ones years are in a time of abundance and one is fully endowed with a beautiful complexion but does not esteem women this is not the style of a superior man 
They may just bring about unreal thoughts but you should strive to be receptive 
You should have yielding thoughts and captivate them with courtesy Desire increases pride and nothing surpasses that of a woman 
When you are courteous to a maiden her heart is happy Courtesy is an ornament If one forsakes courtesy one is like a tree without flowers and fruits 
Why the need for courtesy 
Do not give rise to any idea of contempt Desire is first and foremost Even the gods cannot forget about it Even Lord akra had an illicit affair with the wife of the seer Gautama 
The seer Agastya practiced asceticism for a long time but because he wanted a celestial queen his wishes were consequently unrealized 
The seer Bṛhaspati and the celestial son Candramas the seer Parāśara and Kapiñjalāda all such out of many others were ruined by women In addition regarding your own sense objects now would you be unable to enjoy them 
Having planted meritorious roots in your past lives you have obtained these numerous beauties The whole world is attached to happiness but your heart on the other hand does not value this  
Then when the royal Crown Prince had heard the specious words and fluent eloquence of his friend Udāyin skillfully explaining the characteristics of the world  
He answered Udāyin I am moved by your sincere explanation I will say something to you now 
I do not despise fine sense objects and I know that they give people in the world happiness but because I see that they are characterized by impermanence I am weary of them in mind 
If would permanently stay this way without the suffering of old age illness and death I too would experience happiness and never feel any disgust 
If one might the beauty of the maidens without final decay even though desire is an error I might yet entertain my human feelings 
If someone experiences old age illness and death he himself should not be happy much less feel any attachment for someone else 
Impermanent are the objects of the five desires and the same also applies to ones own person But if one lets thoughts of happiness arise one is on a level with birds and beasts 
The seers you mentioned were attached to the five desires One a Chapter IV should immediately be weary of them They were ruined because they indulged in desire 
You have further extolled that excellent king who was attached to the objects of the five desires but he too was ruined in the same way Know that he was not excellent 
If you skillfully say that one should pretend make an effort and attend to them out of courtesy if one indulges in them then one really is attached Why use the term effort 
A devious mind with idle courtesyI do not see that it is right 
Know that old age illness and death are a mass of great suffering Advising me to fall into thatthese are not the words of a good friend 
Alas Udāyin 
You really are very sincere The ailments of birth old age illnesss and deaththis suffering is very dreadful The eyes see that all decays yet one finds happiness in their pursuit 
I am utterly wearied now and this heart of mine is constrained too Considering that old age illness and death suddenly arrive unanticipated night and day I forget to sleep Why would I indulge in the five desires 
Old age illness and death are ablaze They will surely arrive without any doubt If one still does not know any sadness ones heart really is made of wood or stone  
While the Crown Prince was explaining to Udāyin with all kinds of ingenious means that desire is a profound ailment he did not notice that the sun was setting 
As their music and ornaments all were useless the multitude of ladies then felt shame and returned to the city 
When the Crown Prince saw that the decorations in the garden were all withdrawn and that the singing women had all returned home the place completely deserted he doubled his thoughts about impermanence and quickly returned to his palace 
When the king his father heard that the Crown Prince was averse to the five desires he was utterly and deeply grieved as if a sharp dart had pierced his heart 
He immediately summoned his ministers and asked them to devise a means 
They all said It is not the case that what the five desires are capable of will hold his attention Chapter V Leaving the City  
The king further increased all kinds of exquisite provisions for the five desires He hoped to gladden the Crown Princes heart with pleasures night and day 
The Crown Prince was profoundly weary and completely without any feeling of happiness He considered only the suffering of birth and death like a lion struck by an arrow 
The king had the famous brethren of the nobility and of his chief ministers young in years and of excellent appearance intelligent and with dignified manners accompany the Crown Prince night and day in order to capture his heart And so after a little while informed the king that he would go out on another excursion 
Mounted on a swift horse decorated with a multitude of precious things and surrounded by the sons of the nobility they all left the city 
Just as the four kinds of flowers all open when the sun shines the Crown Prince dazzled the divine scene and his attendants all received his brightness 
As he left the city and traveled through the gardens the long road was wide and level The flowers and fruits on the trees were luxuriant He was happy at heart and consequently forgot to return 
He saw plowmen by the side of the road As they cultivated the soil they killed insects He felt sad at heart and the pain was greater than that of a dart piercing his heart 
He further saw the farmers toiling their appearance drawn Their hair was disheveled and they dripped with sweat their bodies foul with dirt 
The plowing oxen were exhausted too with lolling tongues panting heavily The Crown Princes nature was compassionate and he felt utter pity in his heart 
Deeply sighing with sadness he dismounted stooped to the ground and sat down While observing all this suffering he considered the law of birth and extinction 
Alas for the entire world One is foolish and absolutely unable to wake up He comforted the crowd of people and bade each one sit down where they were 
He himself was sitting upright in the shade of the jambū tree given to right consideration He observed that all birth and death origination and extinction were changing through impermanence 
His mind was concentrated firmly established The wide cloud of the five desires had dissipated With adjusted and discursive thinking he entered the first trance without impurity 
Free from desire he produced joy and happiness rightly experiencing samādhi The world is very painful ruined by old age illness and death 
Ones whole life is experiencing great suffering yet one still does not realize this Disgust with the old age illness and death of others this is a serious ailment 
I will now seek for the excellent Law I must not do the same as the world I myself am entangled in old age illness and death but I find others rather worse 
Such is the observation of the truth Youth beauty strength and long life are constantly and ceaselessly renewed In the end they disappear the law of destruction  
Neither joyful nor sorrowful neither doubting nor confused neither sleepy nor attached to desire without aversion or contempt for others he was quiet free from any hindrance The light of his wisdom steadily increased its brightness 
Then the god of the pure abodes transformed into the appearance of a bhikṣu He came to where the Crown Prince was and the Crown Prince respectfully rose to welcome him The Crown Prince asked Who are you He replied I am a śramaṇa 
In fear of old age illness and death I have gone forth in search of deliverance Beings grow old fall ill and die Their ruin does not stop even for a while 
Therefore I seek the happiness of permanence without either extinction or birth 
I am only at ease in a mountain forest living in isolation and managing nothing My unclean notions have stopped and I am quietly engaged in seclusion 
I beg in order to support myself In front of the Crown Prince then suddenly ascended into the sky and departed 
The Crown Prince was joyful at heart thinking only of the buddhas of the past They had established this dignified demeanor their bequeathed likenesses visible in the present 
Sitting upright and given to right consideration he obtained mindfulness of the Right Law 
What means should I apply myself to for a lasting goingforth as I wish to Controlling his feelings and restraining his faculties he slowly rose and returned to the city His whole retinue followed thinking he would stop and not go far 
While sympathy internally arose he strived to surpass the worldly external Even though his body followed the way back his mind really remained in a mountain forest just like a chained maddened elephant who constantly thinks of wandering through the wilderness 
When the Crown Prince then entered the city men and women welcomed him jamming the road The elderly wished he were their son and the young wished to be his wife Some wished to be his brothers his friends or his inner retinue 
If I were to comply with their wishes their accumulated expectations would be annihilated The Crown Prince was joyful in his heart suddenly hearing the words annihilation and accumulation  I am happy with these words This expectation will be accomplished He profoundly considered the happiness of annihilating accumulation and increased his thoughts about nirvana 
His body was like a peak of the golden mountains and his straight arms were like an elephants He sounded like the thunder in spring and his blue eyes were like an ox kings 
The Law without end was on his mind and his face was as bright as the full moon With the gait of a lion king he slowly entered his palace 
Resembling a son of Lord akra his mind was respectful and his appearance was reverential too He went to the king his father prostrated before him and asked him if he was well He also stated his fear of birth and death and entreated him wishing to go forth 
All the worldly when united certainly will be separated 
Therefore I wish to go forth and seek true deliverance  
When the king his father heard that would go forth he immediately started trembling inside just as when a large maddened elephant moves a saplings twig 
He approached and seized the hands of the Crown Prince His tears flowed and he said Stop this talk It is not yet the right time to rely on the doctrine 
Wonderful are the objects of the five desires Your mind is still not disgusted with them If you go forth and practice asceticism you will not yet be capable of a settled mind 
In the wilderness in seclusion your mind will not yet be tranquil Even if your mind were happy with the Law you would not yet have reached my stage  
You should direct affairs of the state so that I may go forth first It is wrong to abandon your father and interrupt our posterity 
The Crown Prince declined with reverential submission and further said to the king his father Only if you will preserve four things will I relinguish my intention to go forth 
If preserving me your son my life will always be maintained if I will be without any illness and free from aging and if none of my possessions will be destroyed I will accept your command and desist from going forth  
The king hisfathersaid to the Crown Prince Do notsay these words Such four things who could preserve one so that one does not have them 
If you seek for these four wishes you will rightly be ridiculed by others 
Now put a stop to your intention to go forth and submit to the five desires b Chapter V  
The Crown Prince further informed the king If the four wishes cannot be preserved you must allow me your son to go forth I wish you would not make any difficulties 
When your son is in a house on fire why not allow him to leave 
Since my analysis is the eternal truth who could not honor my request 
In escaping the coming selfdestruction there is nothing like transcending it with the Law If one did not transcend with the Law who could maintain onself in the face of death  
The king the father knew that his sons mind was certain and could not be changed He just had to do his utmost to hold him back Why the need for more words  
He increased the exquisite happiness of the five desires with the ladies even more Night and day suffering was warded off so that the Crown Prince would certainly not wish to go forth 
The ministers in the land came to the Crown Prince and extensively spoke of the rules of propriety urging him to comply with the kings command 
When the Crown Prince saw that the king his father was sad and wept his tears flowing he momentarily returned to his palace Sitting upright he pondered in silence 
The ladies in the palace held him dear They surrounded him and waited upon him They observed him gazing at his face 
They gazed at him unblinking just like a deer in the autumn forest looking straight at the hunter The Crown Princes whole complexion was like a mountain of real gold 
The singing women all looked at him and listening for his instructions waited for the expression of his voice They observed his thoughts with reverence just as that deer in the forest 
Gradually sunset arrived The Crown Prince dwelled in the dark night but his light was very bright just as the sun shining on Mount Sumeru 
While he was sitting on his seat with the seven precious things perfumed with fine sandalwood the multitude of ladies surrounded him and played gandharva music It was just like the son of Vaiśravaṇa and the many fine sounds of celestial music 
What the Crown Prince had on his mind was the highest happiness of renunciation Even though brought many fine sounds they still were not in his heart 
Then the celestial sons of the pure abodes knew that the Crown Princes time had come and that he would surely go forth They suddenly transformed and descended Disdainful of the multitude of singing women they caused them all to fall asleep 
The bearing was uncontrolled bent and lax they showed their ugly appearance They were numb their faces alternately turned downward or upward Their musical instruments were scattered in disarray 
Some leaned sideways or had fallen over and others looked as if they had been dropped into an abyss Their necklaces were like dragging chains and their garments were swathed around their bodies 
Their yellow and green garments were spread out just like broken karṇi flowers 
With loose limbs they leaned against the walls eyes closed their shape like a hanging hornbow Some held on to a window with their hands and looked like strangled corpses 
They groaned incessantly and gasped deeply They were repugnant sniveling and salivating With disheveled hair they showed their ugly appearance They looked like mad people 
Flower garlands were hanging across their faces Some were lying face down on the floor and some were trembling all over just like a lone shivering bird 
Their bodies bent they leaned on each other like pillows hands and feet entwined Some knit their brows and frowned and some closed their eyes and opened their mouths All kinds of bodies were dispersed scattered about like corpses after an untimely death 
The Crown Prince then sat up and observed the ladies They had all been utterly majestic before talking and laughing their thoughts ingratiating and clever They had been bewitching and ingenious in seduction but now they all were repugnant 
If the nature of woman is such how can one hold them dear 
When bathing and making use of ornaments they deceive the minds of men 
I have understood now I will certainly go forth without any doubt  
Then the gods of the pure abodes came down and opened the gate for him 
The Crown Prince then slowly rose and left the room of the ladies He hesitated in his inner chambers and said to Chandaka a Chapter V  My mind is thirsty now 
I am fully conscious and my mind has decided It is firm and adorned with a solemn oath The ladies once were beautiful but now they all show an ugly appearance 
The doors were closed before but now they have all opened of themselves I observe that these auspicious signs are a snare for the highest meaning  
Chandaka pondered whether he should obey the Crown Princes instructions If he did not inform the king the father he would then be charged with a serious fault 
The gods increased their divine power and brought the horse unobserved The swift fine horse usual mount was equipped with gear inlaid with precious things 
long bright blue and a long mane and tail a curved back and short hair and ears the belly of a deer and the neck of a goose king Its forehead was wide and its nose round like a gourd the throat of a dragon Its kneecaps and chest were square 
It was endowed with the marks of a thoroughbred The Crown Prince stroked the horses neck and patting it he said The king my father has often mounted you and descending on his enemies has swiftly overcome his foes I now want to rely on you to cross the distant ford to immortality 
In battle one has numerous troops and in the happiness of prosperity one has many companions When a merchant seeks for precious things those who happily follow him are numerous too 
But when one encounters suffering a good friend is hard to find When striving for the Law one certainly has few friends He who is supported by these two friends will obtain peace in the end 
I now want to go out to save suffering beings If you now want what is good for you and also to save the people you should exert yourself and gallop away Do not be tired  
Having urged it on he slowly mounted his horse He took control of the reins and at once rode off into the morning His human shape was floating like the suns palace and the horse floated like a white cloud b  
Controlled and without exertion with bated breath it did not neigh Four spirits came and held up its feet in secret silently without a sound 
The heavy gates and their firm bolts were opened by the celestialspiritsthemselves 
Their reverence for the father was unsurpassed but their affection was deeper for no one than for the son They and their external retinues were bound by love too 
Leaving his feelings behind but without leaving his memories he swiftly went beyond the city walls 
With eyes like pure lotuses springing from the mud he looked back at the palace of the king his father and spoke the words of his farewell If I do not cross over birth old age and death I will never have a reason to travel here  
The multitude of all the gods dragons and spirits in the sky rejoiced and they said in praise Splendid Yes these are true words  
The gods and the host of dragons and spirits rejoiced at his acquisition of a mind that is difficult to acquire Each guided him with the light of his power assisting him with their brightness 
Man and horse both were keenspirited and hurried on like a shooting star Before it dawned in the east they had advanced three yojanas c Fascicle Two Chapter VI Chandakas Return  
The forest and the rivers were utterly clear and birds and animals were kind to people The Crown Prince was glad at heart when he saw this and his physical suffering was naturally appeased 
This then is a lucky sign I shall certainly obtain wonderful benefit  He further saw that the seer was someone he should worship and keeping his dignified demeanor he dispelled any trace of pride 
He stepped down from his horse and patted it on the head 
You have taken me across now With friendly eyes he looked at Chandaka as if bathing him with cool water My swift horses speed is like the fast flight of a bird but you have always been close behind the horse 
I am moved by your profound reverence and diligence My other concerns may be countless but yes I recognize your sincerity 
Your heart is respectful and you appear is very diligent These two I now see them for the first time Some are utterly sincere but their corporal strength is inadequate or their strength is adequate but their heart is not sincere 
You are endowed with both now You have rejected splendid worldly recompense You have walked out and followed me 
Who does not turn toward benefit 
If there is no benefit relatives separate But you have followed me now for nothing You did not seek for any recompense in the present world 
All seek benefit but you alone have traveled with me unconcerned about benefit 
What is there to understand with more words I shall now summarily tell you Your service to me has ended Mount the horse now and return 
The place that I have wanted for a long time I have now obtained it  
immediately took off his precious necklaces and gave them to Chandaka I take these and present them to you to soothe your grief  
The light of the maṇi atop of his precious crown shone He immediately took it off and placed it in his palm It was like the sun lighting up Sumeru 
Chandaka take this pearl and return to the king my father Do obeisance at the kings feet with this pearl in order to show my respect 
State my request to the king for me I wish that he would give up his feelings of love In order to do away with birth old age and death I have entered the forest of asceticism but I do not seek rebirth in heaven 
It is not the case that I do not have a loving heart Nor do I feel any dislike I want only to give up grief 
Having accumulated love for a long time one will certainly know separation Because there is always separation I seek the cause of deliverance 
When I am delivered I shall never be separated from my relatives 
The five desires are the root of sorrow 
One should feel sorrow for those who are attached to desire The purpose of the excellent kings our ancestors was firm and did not change I have now inherited all their riches except for the Law and I reject that which is not proper 
When someones life has ended his riches are all left to his son Sons mostly covet mundane profit but I am happy with the riches of the Law 
If one says that the strength of youth is not the right time to go out to study know that the search for the Right Law is without any right time It is not the case that there is a right time 
Impermanence does not know any fixed period The enemy death is always in pursuit Therefore I have decided that today is the right time to seek the Law b Chapter VI  
All such statements pronounce them all for me I do wish that you would free the king my father from any further love for me 
If you were to defame me because of my appearance so that the king would give up his loving thoughts do not be sparing of those words and do not let the kings affection remain uninterrupted  
When Chandaka had received his instructions he was filled with sadness and his emotions were in turmoil He held his palms together knelt down and replied to the Crown Prince If I make a full pronouncement as you have ordered I am afraid I may increase his grief even more His grief will become even deeper just like an elephant sinking deeper into the mud 
When ones love decidedly has left who among those who have a heart would not grieve 
Even metal and stone break down 
How much more so when one is sunk into grief You have grown up within your palace O Prince Your youth was happy and your person is soft 
When you initially ordered me to bring your horse I was already uneasy in my mind A celestial spirit forced me and ordered me to quickly adorn it 
What could I have had in mind when I let you Crown Prince decide to give up your inner palace 
The people of Kapilavastu the whole land will grieve 
The king your father is already old He holds his son dear and his love is deep If you decide to give up your family this is not as it should be 
If in your wrong view you have no parents then there is no further discussion Gautamī has nourished you 
She has suckled you leaving her body dried up Her kindness is hard to forget Do not be ungrateful The meritorious mother of your infant is of an excellent family and she has served you well 
If one has obtained her excellence but abandons her one is not an excellent person 
The excellent son of Yaśodharā will inherit the country and rule according to the Right Law He is still young You should not abandon him either 
You have already disregarded the king your father and also your family and retinue And do not abandon me I do not wish to leave your worthy feet 
My feelings are like boiling water on a fire I cannot bear to return to our country alone 
If I would now abandon you in the wilds Crown Prince and return I would be the same as Sumantra who abandoned Rāma If I now return to the palace alone what shall I say to the king 
When the whole palace reprimands me with what words shall I answer then 
You told me Crown Prince that as a means I may defame your appearance 
But how could I speak falsely about the qualities of a muni 
Because of deep shame my tongue would be unable to utter a word Even if it could utter a word who in the world would believe it 
If I were to say that the light of the moon is hot some in the world would believe it 
But there are none who would believe that their crown princes acts do not constitute right behavior 
Your heart Crown Prince is tender You have always been compassionate for all Being deeply affectionate yet abandoning usthis goes against your past thoughts 
I wish that you would consider returning to the palace as a comfort to my foolish sincerity  
When the Crown Prince heard Chandakas sad words and earnest admonitions his mind was stable and increasingly firm He further said You now have given rise to the suffering of separation because of me You should give up this sadness and soothe your mind 
Even if it would not let me give up my family today death will arrive and my body and spirit will be separated How then would I be held back 
When my kind mother bore me she loved me profoundly constantly embracing her suffering 
But when she had given birth to me her life immediately ended She could never raise her own son Preservation and destruction each take a different road Where would I seek her now 
On a prominent tree in the wilderness a flock of birds gathers to roost They assemble at sunset and scatter at dawn The worldly separates in the same way 
When floating clouds rise on a high mountain they accumulate on the four sides in the sky 
The worldly actually separates by itself One meets for a while entangled in love One gathers and is scattered like a dream One must not rely on ones own relatives 
For instance a tree that comes to life in spring gradually grows branches and leaves But in the frost of autumn they consequently fall down They are physically the same but still they are separated 
Do appease your grief Comply with my instructions and return Your purpose in returning may yet preserve me Return and I may still go back later 
When the people of Kapilavastu have heard that my mind is made up you must pronounce my words to those who care for me and who hold me dear I will come back only after I have crossed the sea of suffering of birth and death 
If my earnest wish is not fulfilled my body will be extinguished in a mountain forest  
When the white horse heard the Crown Prince say these true words it knelt down and licked his feet Breathing deeply it was given to tears 
Do not feel any grief I now apologize to you The merits of your efforts my fine horse are now completed The suffering of your woeful destination is long appeased and a fine fruition appears now  
Chandaka always followed him with his sword adorned with precious things When the Crown Prince drew the sharp sword it was shining bright like a dragon His dark hair contained in his precious crownhe shaved it off and placed it in the sky 
It ascended into the freezing sky floating like a soaring phoenix The celestial sons of the Trāyastriṃśa returned with the hair to their celestial palace 
They had always wanted to serve him at his feet All the more now that they had obtained the hair of his head 
They wholeheartedly increased their worship all the way till the end of the Right Law 
The Crown Prince then thought to himself Even when all my ornaments are removed and I have only a garment of plain silk I still do not have the deportment of someone who has gone forth a  
When he knew the Crown Princes thoughts a celestial son of the pure abodes then transformed himself into the image of a hunter He held a bow and carried sharp arrows at his waist With his body covered by a kāṣāya garment he went before the Crown Prince 
The Crown Prince thought that this garment a dyed pure robe was the exquisite ornamentation of a seer and was not fit for a hunter 
He immediately gave a shout before the hunter and with soft words said to him Concerning this garment you look untainted by covetousness Let me trade my own clothing with you  
The hunter said to the Crown Prince It is not the case that I do not feel for this garment I have used it as a decoy with deer to lure and kill them 
But if it is what you need I shall trade it with you now  
When the hunter had received the fine garment he returned to his celestial body When the Crown Prince and Chandaka saw this they thought that it was wonderful This garment certainly is correct 
It is surely not the clothing of a worldling Their inner feelings greatly rejoiced and they doubled their reverence for the garment 
It was like an ochre cloud surrounding the disk of the sun or moon With dignified and careful steps he entered a seers cave 
As Chandakas gaze followed him he disappeared and was not seen any more My master has given up the king his father his retinue and me too Wearing the kāṣāya garment he has entered the forest of asceticism  
raised his hands and called out to the gods In low spirits he fell to the ground He rose and clasped the neck of the white horse His hopes gone he turned back on his way 
In his hesitation he frequently looked back His body went but his mind hurried back He was lost in thought and was distracted he looked up and down leaning over he fell over and rose again Sadly weeping he went on his way back 
b Chapter VII Entry into the Forest of Asceticism  As the Crown Prince was about to enter the place of seers having sent Chandaka away his majestic person was radiant shining all around in the forest of asceticism 
Being endowed with all that was meaningful he complied with the meaningful and went there He went like a lion king of the animals entering among a herd of beasts His common appearance was completely abandoned He showed only the true appearance of the path 
The anchorites unexpectedly saw the wonder and they were discerning and pleasantly surprised They held their palms together and stared straight at him Men and women gazed directly at him as they managed their affairs without any change in their deportment 
When the gods observe Lord akra they gaze at him without blinking and the seers looked at him in the same way not moving a foot 
As they managed their heavy burdens with their hands they kept looking not stopping their activities Just like an ox in shaft and yoke their bodies were bound but they relied on the mind 
And the divine seers full of application all said they had never seen such a thing Flocks of birds peacocks and others soared and cried out in confused voices 
Brahmans who kept the precepts of deer followed the deer and wandered into a mountain forest Deer glance about by nature but seeing the Crown Prince they looked straight at him The brahmans who were following the deer likewise looked directly at him 
The lamp of Ikṣvāku was twice as bright like the first light of the sun It caused the milk cows to give more sweetscented milk 
The brahmans were pleasantly surprised and said to each other Is he the eighth Vasu god Is he one of the two Aśvins c  Is he the sixth King Māra Is he a brahmakāyika god Is he the celestial son of the sun or of the moon who has descended here 
In short we should respect him Let us hurry and strive to bring worship The Crown Prince still remained humble He respectfully declined and made polite inquiries 
The Bodhisattva observed the brahmans all over the forest They were practicing all kinds of meritorious actions They were all seeking for the happiness of rebirth in heaven 
He asked elder brahmans about the true path he should practice I have just now arrived here I do not yet know which way to practice 
Then the twiceborn consequently and in due order spoke about the austerities they were practicing and about the fruition of their asceticism 
Some ate roots stalks and leaves things that were not produced in a village or things that grew in clear water Others ate flowers and fruits 
Several paths each one different and the food they consumed was not the same either Some cultivated the life of birds They pecked their food like twolegged creatures 
Some followed deer and ate herbs Serpentseers inhaled the wind Some did not eat things that were pounded with wood or a stone Biting with two teeth they made lesions 
Some begged for their food and gave it to others accepting remnants as their own food Some constantly submerged their heads in water and some worshiped fire Seers who practiced like fishes dwelled in water Such were the various kinds  
When a brahman practices asceticism he is reborn in heaven when his life has ended Because of his asceticism he will obtain a pleasant fruition 
When the worthy one the most honored one among twolegged beings heard about these austerities he did not see their real meaningfulness and his inner feelings were not pleased In his consideration he felt grief for them 
Alas for your great austerities You seek only for recompense as a human or god As the wheel revolves you turn to birth and death The suffering will be plentiful but the happiness little 
When one disregards relatives gives up excellent objects and decides to seek celestial happiness even if one may avoid some small suffering one will finally be bound by great suffering 
You let your bodies wither and practice austerities but while seeking to experience rebirth you increase the cause of the five desires 
Because you do not contemplate birth and death you seek suffering by means of suffering All kinds of beings are constantly afraid of death in their heart 
If you strenuously seek to experience rebirth you will being reborn meet with death Even though you may be afraid of suffering you will be submersed in the sea of suffering for a long time 
This life is utterly wearying and in a future life one will not rest either While you endure suffering you seek happiness in the present but the search for rebirth in heaven is wearisome too A mind that seeks happiness is inferior In both cases one falls into meaninglessness 
Exertion is excellent but it is still better to develop knowledge When one rejects both one is forever unconditioned 
If one is happy after the practice of what is right the result that relies on what is right is wrong 
Origination and extinction in ones corporal practice all come from the minds strength If it is without a mind this body is like a dead log Therefore subdue the mind If the mind is subdued the body is naturally right 
If eating something pure brings merit then birds and animals and poor persons who usually eat fruits and herbs should thus be meritorious 
If one says that austerities are the cause of merit when a fine mind has come into existence why are the happy practices not produced by a fine mind 
If happiness is not produced by a fine mind that which is fine is not the cause of suffering either 
If heretics consider water to be a purification the evil actions of the beings that enjoy dwelling in water should constantly be pure 
The place where a seer with fine basic qualities dwells is held in esteem by the wider world because a seer with qualities is living there One should honor the qualities One should not hold the place in esteem b  
Thus gave an extensive explanation of what was right and eventually came the sunset He saw that some were making offerings to fire Some were using friction or blowing a fire 
Some were sprinkling ghee and some were chanting incantations with raised voices It was like that all night and day He observed those practices but as he did not see their real meaningfulness he then wanted to reject them 
The brahmans then all came and invited him to stay They had regard for the Bodhisattvas qualities and fondly and diligently urged him 
You have come from a place of the wrong law to the forest of the Right Law yet you want to abandon it So we urge you to stay  
The elder brahmans had disheveled hair and wore garments of vegetation As they followed behind the Bodhisattva they beseeched him to pay attention for a while 
When the Bodhisattva saw that the elder ones were pursuing him and they were physically tired he stopped underneath a tree comforted them and sent them on their way back 
The brahmans young and old surrounded him held their palms together and beseeched him You came here unexpectedly and the grove was filled in a fine way but now you abandon us and go away It will consequently become a wilderness 
Just as someone who loves life does not want to give up his body we are like that too Please stay for a while 
The brahman seers here royal seers and celestial seers all rely on this place It is furthermore near the edge of the Snowy Mountains 
Many anchorites were reborn in heaven along this way 
All anchorites seeking merit have turned to the north from here Having received the Right Law the wise do not go south 
If you believe that we are lazy and not vigorous and practice unpleasant ways and if you do not want to stay we should all go away but you may stay here 
If you are excellent in asceticism why would you abandon them 
If you can stay here they will serve you as Lord akra and as the gods serve Bṛhaspati c Chapter VII  
The Bodhisattva explained to the brahmans what he himself wished for in his heart By developing right application I want only to extinguish all existence 
Your intentions are upright and in your practice of the Law you were tranquil and silent You are kind to a visitor and I am really happy in my heart 
Beautiful words may move ones heart They bathe all who hear them Upon hearing your words they increase my feeling of happiness with the Law You have all turned to me thinking that I am your good friend of the Law 
But abandoning you now I feel very sorry Previously I disregarded my own relatives and now I am separating from you The suffering of uniting and separatingthat suffering is equal and without any difference 
It is not the case that my heart is not happy And I do not see any other error either but the fact is that  In your asceticism you all seek only the happiness of rebirth in heaven I seek to extinguish the three existences  rejecting form and contrary to the minds  
As for the Law you are practicing you yourselves practice the actions of your former teachers I will extinguish all accumulation in my search for the Law without accumulation So it will never be right to stay longer in this grove  
When the brahmans heard the Bodhisattvas explanation his true and meaningful words eloquent in expression and eminent in principle they were very joyful at heart then and profoundly increased their feeling of respect 
There then was a brahman who was constantly lying down in dirt With twisted locks he was clothed in tree bark yellow eyes and a long high nose 
And he said to the Bodhisattva Your purpose is firm and your wisdom is bright You will decidedly complete your passage beyond birth Knowing how to be free from rebirth one is at ease 
a  Offering sacrifices praying to celestial spirits and with all kinds of austerities everyone seeks the happiness of rebirth in heaven but they are not yet free from objects of desire 
If one can fight desire and earnestly search for true deliverance one is a human being certainly a person of right awakening 
It will not do to stay in this place Go to the Vindhya Mountains There is a great muni called rāḍa Only he has obtained final certitude the highest and most excellent eye 
Go to him and you will hear the true path He can make your heart rejoice 
But when I observe your resoluteness I am afraid you may not be assured either You will give up on him too and go away seeking for more learning 
Red lips and white sharp teeth Light skin and a face that is bright The red tongue is long soft and thin Those with such fine characteristics will all drink jñeya water 
You will cross an unfathomable depth and be unequaled in the world You will obtain that which the elder seers will not obtain  
The Bodhisattva accepted his words and left the seers The multitude of seers circumambulated him to the right and each took their leave and returned 
Chapter VIII The Whole Palace in Grief  As Chandaka led the horse back his hopes were lost and his heart was filled with sadness He wept all along the way unable to come to his senses 
Previously with the Crown Prince it had been a straight road for one whole night but now having abandoned the Crown Prince and returning and because his celestial protection had been taken away from his life he walked to and fro with an anxious heart and reached the city after eight days 
It had exerted itself and was characterized by majesty As it staggered along it looked behind but it did not see the Crown Prince appear let its tears flow and its four limbs hung loose It was distressed and had lost its brightness 
It walked in circles mourning and neighing sadly Night and day it forgot about water and grass Having lost their ruler who would save the world they returned to Kapilavastu 
The land was completely desolate as if they had returned to an empty village When for instance the sun is screened off by Sumeru the whole world is obscured in the heavy darkness 
Springs and ponds were not clear and flowers and fruits did not flourish Men and women in the alleys and streets were sad and had lost their joyful appearance 
Chandaka and the white horse were dispirited and unable to move forward When asked about the matter he could not answer They walked slowly like corpses 
When the crowd saw that Chandaka had returned and when they did not see the ākya prince loudly wept with raised voices as if he returned having abandoned Rāma 
Some people came to the side of the road and heads bowed asked Chandaka The prince isloved by the world He isthe life of the people in the whole world 
Chandaka restrained his sad thoughts and he answered the people I pursued him with affection I did not abandon the prince The prince abandoned me and he has rejected his mundane deportment He has taken the tonsure wears the garment of the Law and has entered the forest of asceticism  
When the crowd heard that had gone forth they were startled and amazed They sobbed and cried Mucus and tears came down in mixed streams One said to the other What shall we do They all talked it over 
If someones life faculty is ruined the form and the spirit separate when the person has died 
The prince is our life Having lost our life how shall we live 
This city has lost its majestic quality as if one had killed Vṛtra  
When it was falsely reported to the men and women in the city that the prince had returned they hurried out to the head of the road but they saw only that his horse had returned alone Nobody knew whether he was alive or dead and they wept in all kinds of voices 
Leading the horse on foot Chandaka returned sobbing and letting his tears fall He felt grief at the loss of the Crown Prince The fear in his heart increased just as when a warrior has destroyed the enemy and sends his captured foe before the king As he entered the gate his tears came down like rain 
He looked up to heaven and bitterly wept The white horse neighed sadly too When the various birds and animals in the palace and the horses in the inner stables heard the sad neighing of the white horse they cried out in response They cried out thinking that the Crown Prince had returned but when they did not see him they ceased their cries 
The ladies of the palace heard the horses birds and animals cry out Their hair was disheveled their faces were pallid Their figures became emaciated and their lips dry 
Their torn clothes were unwashed and they were dirty and unbathed Their ornaments were all dispensed with spoiled and dull 
Their whole bodies had lost their brightness just like stars fading at nights close c Chapter VIII Their garments were ruined and ragged They looked as if they had been robbed 
When they saw Chandaka and the white horse they wept and went back without any hope They were moved and wailed bitterly as if they had just lost a relative They were disordered and disturbed like a herd of cows that had lost its way 
When Mahāprajāpātī Gautamī heard that the Crown Prince had not returned she flinched and fell to the ground her four limbs all bruised She was like a goldcolored plantain tree broken by a gale of wind 
When she further heard that her son had gone forth she sighed deeply and her sadness increased His soft hair turning to the right grows one hair per pore 
It is black and pleasant fresh and bright It lies scattered on the ground flowing evenly Now lying shaven on the grassy ground to what purpose was it fitted with a celestial crown 
 straight arms and the gait of a lion the long and wide eyes of an ox king a body bright like a golden blaze a square chest and a pure voice 
With these exquisite characteristics he has entered the forest of asceticism What little merit did the world have that it has lost this noble ruler of the earth 
His soft feet with fine membranes have the color of a pure lotus A thorny forest with earth and rocks how could they walk on it 
He has grown up within his palace dressed in warm and soft clothes He bathed in fragrant warm water and his body was powdered with incense 
Now he is exposed braving the wind How could he bear the cold or heat 
As a great man of nobility he is prominent and superior in learning Endowed with virtue his fame is great He is always generous without wanting anything Why would he suddenly beg for his food to live on 
He lay on a pure precious couch awakened from his sleep by music How can he lay himself down on the grassy ground in a mountain forest  
Holding her son dear she felt grief in her heart and fell to the ground in low spirits Her servants helped her up and wiped away her tears 
The other ladies let their four limbs hang with grief Inwardly upset they were miserable in their hearts They stood still just like painted figures a  
Then Yaśodharā severely reprimanded Chandaka This person on my mind where would he be now 
The three of you men and a horse went together but now only two have come back I am utterly fearful in my heart trembling and ill at ease 
You are an improper person You are not close to me and you are not a good friend Even though my misfortune is very grave you laugh 
Your reversal is not fitting 
You were held dear a companion of my sovereign but you have an indulgent mind following your liking So you did not let the noble prince return once he was gone 
You must be very glad now Having done evil its result is already accomplished 
It would be better to approach a wise enemy than to frequent a foolish friend You were falsely called a good friend Inwardly you really feel enmity 
You have now suddenly and completely destroyed this excellent royal house These noble ladies are mournful and have spoiled their beauty They are out of breath from weeping and tears stream down all across their faces 
His mind was as firm as the great earth They are almost saddened to death Even more so for those who are sadly weeping and loudly crying in the windows Life and death their proper place is natural but how could they bear this suffering  
She said to the horse You are not righteous You have taken away someone whom people esteem in their hearts just like an evil thief who has stolen precious things in the dark 
When he rode you into battle he could endure all swords spears and sharp arrows But what is there he cannot endure now 
The most excellent one of my noble family You have taken away my heart by force You are a noxious creature You have done improper actions 
Today you cry out loudly and your cries fill the royal palace But when you previously took away the one I hold dear why then were you mute 
If you had let out a sound then the whole palace would have woken up If it had woken up then I would not be suffering now  
When Chandaka heard these painful words he swallowed his breath and his breathing froze He rubbed away his tears held his palms together and answered Please listen to my plea Do not disparage the white horse and do not hate me either We are both without fault 
It was the doing of a celestial spirit I was utterly afraid of the kings law but I was compelled by celestial spirits 
They quickly led the horse to him and they both went away as swiftly as if they were flying calmed breathing so that it did not make a sound and its feet did not touch the ground either 
The gate of the city opened by itself and the sky was naturally bright All this was the doing of celestial spirits How could this be through my efforts  
When Yaśodharā heard his words she thought it was astonishing It had been the doing of celestial spirits and it was not the case that they were to blame 
Our former excellencies of the past King Mahāsudarśana and others all applied themselves to the path together with their wives wandering through the forests and the wilds but you have now abandoned me 
The duties they perform together are a cause and in the end they experience the result together Why are you alone miserly of the Law abandoning me and wandering on your own 
Either you see me as jealous and still seek someone who is not jealous or you must feel contempt for me and further seek a pure celestial maiden 
Why do you not take Rāhula on your knee 
Your appearance is gentle but your heart is hard The abundant light of your excellent family issplendid Even an enemy respects it 
But when a son is born but no infant yet one can discard it forever I do not feel any sympathy either You my husband have abandoned me and are wandering through a mountain forest You cannot destroy yourself 
She wailed or talked frantically Or she gazed lost in thought She was choked with sobs and could not control herself She was mournful and lying in the dirt her breathing almost stopped 
When the group of ladies saw her they felt grief They were like flourishing lotuses broken by storms and hail and made pale 
The king the father had lost his crown prince and night and day his heart sadly yearned He observed the fast and requested the celestial spirits Please let my son quickly return  
After he had uttered his wish and his plea he left through the gate of celestial sacrifices When he heard the weeping voices he was startled and bewildered like a herd of elephants stampeding in disarray when there is great thunder and lightning in the sky 
After he had seen Chandaka and the white horse and after extensive questioning he knew that had gone forth His body fell to the ground just like the crumbling of the banner of Lord akra 
His ministers slowly helped him up and as was right they urged him to be at ease After a long while he returned to consciousness and said to the white horse I have frequently ridden you into battle I remember that you were meritorious every time but now I detest you twice as much as when I held you dear 
My beloved meritorious sonyou unexpectedly carried him away You discarded him in a mountain forest and came back alone by yourself 
Quickly go to him with me If not go and bring him back If you do not do either of these two my life will not be preserved 
There is no other cure left Yes the expectation of my son is my medicine a Chapter VIII  Just like the brahman Saṃjaya killed himself over the death of his son the loss of my son who is practicing the Law will naturally make me lose my life 
The ruler of the beings Manu also felt constant sorrow for his son How much less could I an ordinary man feel at ease with the loss of my son 
In ancient times when his dear son was wandering through a mountain forest King Aja was deeply affected and his life ended He was immediately reborn in heaven 
But I am unable to die now For a long time I will dwell in grief The whole palace held my son dear but I long for him in vain just like a hungry ghost I am like someone who is thirsty and looking for water 
I will keep my thirst and die with it I will certainly be reborn in the destination of hungry ghosts 
My thirst is completely in vain now Having obtained water my son I have lost it again Quickly tell me the whereabouts of my son before my life ends Do not let me die of thirst and fall among the hungry ghosts 
My determination and strength once were strong I was as hard to move as the great earth But having lost my son my heart is troubled just like King Daśaratha in the past  
The royal preceptor a scholar of learning and the chief minister wise and intelligent both admonished the king with neither laxity nor coercion Please calm your emotions Do not hurt yourself with sorrow The excellent kings of old abandoned their countries as if they were scattered flowers 
Your son is now applying himself to the path Why would this make you suffer grief 
In celestial happiness or as a wheelturning king he will be quiet and not afflicted How could a worldly ruler change his precious mind 
You should let us search for him now and go to him We will make an effort and earnestly reprove him in order to show our sincerity We wish to lessen his determination in order to soothe your royal grief b  
The king was glad and immediately answered Yes go quickly Like a large bird circling in the sky for his son my anxious mind is just like that holding my crown prince dear now  
After the two men received order the minds of the king and his retinue were somewhat cooler felt relieved and food and drink were circulated 
Chapter IX The Search for the Crown Prince  As the king told his preceptor and his chief minister of his grief they were moved As if lashed to fine horses they rushed out like a swift current They became fatigued but did not stop their efforts 
Giving up their customary five ceremonial ornaments and keeping their faculties well under control they entered the pure dwelling of brahmans and respectfully did obeisance to the seers 
The seers invited them to sit down expounded the Law and comforted them 
We have some inquiries in mind We are preceptor and minister to King uddhodana extolled as pure and a famous descendant of Ikṣvāku 
We dutifully instruct him in matters of canonical rules The king is like akra lord of the gods and his son is like Jayanta 
In order to cross over old age illness and death he has gone forth and he may have come here You should know worthy ones that we are here because of him  
The replied There was such a man with long arms and the characteristics of a great man He chose some of our practices which follow the law of birth and death 
He has gone to rāḍa to seek excellent deliverance  
After had obtained certainty about the princes whereabouts they honored their kings urgent command not daring to consider it tiresome They asked the way and hurried there 
They saw that the Crown Prince was dwelling in a forest He had completely given up his customary ceremonial ornaments His actual body was still radiant like the sun emerging from a black cloud 
The national preceptor who serves celestial spirits and the chief minister who holds the Right Law abandoned their usual dignified demeanor dismounted and advanced on foot 
They were like the royal Vāmadeva and Vasiṣṭha the seer  who went to a mountain forest to see Prince Rāma Each reverently did obeisance complying with their actual duty and made polite inquiries 
They were like ukra and ṅgirasa  who waited upon akra lord of the gods wholeheartedly and with great respect 
The prince was respectful to the royal preceptor and the chief minister too just like Lord akra comforting ukra and ṅgirasa 
then ordered the two men to sit before him just like the twin stars of Punarvasu waiting upon the moon at its side 
The royal preceptor and the chief minister stated their request to the prince just like Bṛhaspati addressing Jayanta 
The king your father holds his crown prince dear A sharp dart has pierced his heart as it were He is in disarray and disordered lying in the dirt 
Night and day his sad thoughts increase and his tears flow constantly like rain He has given me his command Please listen attentively to his words 
The feeling for which I have traveled far hoping to be at easelessen my sense of being far away from it Do not let the waters of my grief make the banks of my heart crumble 
It is like the calamities of a storm of the sun of fire and hail for clouds water grass and mountains My grief means four ailments it sways dries up burns and destroys the heart 
If you do not care for your relatives and also reject your parents how could this be called the compassion that covers all 
The Law is not necessarily in a mountain forest One may practice in seclusion while remaining part of the family too Gaining insight and diligence in ones application this is called going forth 
Suppose one takes the tonsure wears a dyed garment and wanders in a mountain refuge yet feels fear How could such a person be called an anchorite a Chapter IX  
When I have let water rain down on your head have crowned you with a celestial crown and have placed a parasol over you once I have observed you with my own eyes only then might I leave the family 
Druma the Senajit kings Anuja ṣāḍha Vajra Bāhu Vaibhrāja Antideva Janaka of Videha Nārāyaṇa and ālvadruma  Such kings all wore a celestial crown They adorned themselves with necklaces and they wore pearls and rings on their hands and feet They enjoyed a multitude of ladies but did not disregard the cause of deliverance 
After you have heard this command heed my instructions and return  
The king your father is drowning in a sea of grief because of you without any rescue without any support and without a way to console himself You must be his boatmaster and ferry him to a safe place 
Upon hearing their fathers command Prince Bhīṣma and the two Rāmas respected his command 
You should now also be like that The love with which your kind mother has brought you up for your whole life your gratitude should be endless Like a cow that has lost her calf she cries out sadly and forgets to sleep or eat 
You should quickly return now to save her life When a solitary bird is separated from the flock it grieves When a dragonelephant wanders alone it suffers 
When someone who is reliant has lost her protection one should think about coming to the rescue Your only son is like a young orphan No one knows how to express the suffering he experiences Spare him from the grief of being left alone like someone who is saved from a lunar eclipse 
The suffering of separation felt by the men and women in the whole country is burning The smoke of their sighs rises to the sky It fogs their wisdom and their eyes are obscured I want only to see that the water that is you extinguishes this fire and that their eyes see clearly  
When the Bodhisattva heard the urgent instructions of the king his father and heard that he was utterly full of sorrow he sat up making right consideration and courteously answered as was fitting b  
I too know that the kind thoughts of the king my father are more than genuine but I have disregarded his endless love because I fear birth old age illness and death 
Yes the living may hold on to one another but death will come No one can stay Therefore knowing what to esteem I have long since taken leave and gone forth 
Hearing of the grief of the king my father a greater longing cuts through my heart But we meet only for a while just as in a dream and we at once turn to impermanence 
You most certainly know that beings are by nature not the same Grief does not necessarily come from a son or a relative As for the reason why the suffering of separation is brought about it arises in any case from delusion Suppose some people are walking along a road 
Profoundly comprehending that relatives pretend to be united one should not give rise to grief 
Having disregarded ones beloved in this generation one still wishes for relatives in another generation But relatives for a while one is separated again Nowhere is there no relative 
One is constantly united and constantly parts  How would it do to grieve for every parting 
While dwelling in the womb one gradually changes With every separation one dies and is born again 
There is death at any time How could it be a wrong time for a mountain forest 
At any time one may experience the five desires and the same applies to the time to seek for riches Because one may die at any time there is no right time to seek the way to do away with death 
As you wish to make me your king it is hard to disregard your kindness but it is just like taking the wrong medicine when sick Therefore I am not fit for that 
My whole life I would constantly be afraid anxious that my body and spirit will grow tired By complying with the crowd my mind would disregard the Law A wise one does not do that 
In a fine palace with the seven precious things a great fire is ablaze and in the food of a hundred flavors a celestial kitchen there are various poisons In a cool pond with lotuses there are many insects A high position is an abode of calamities The wise do not dwell there 
When the previous excellent kings of the past saw many transgressions while dwelling in the land increasing hardship for beings they felt disgust and went forth 
So know that the contentment of practicing the Law is better than the suffering of royal rule It would be better to dwell in a mountain forest and eat herbs like the birds and animals than to endure dwelling deep in a palace sharing the pit with black venomous snakes 
If one gives up a royal position and the five desires and wanders in a mountain forest enduring suffering this then is fitting Happy with the Law one gradually increases ones understanding 
If I now abandon the forest of solitude return to my family and experience the five desires night and day the law of suffering will increase This is not fitting 
A great man of a famous family finds happiness in the Law and goes forth He forever turns his back on his famous family establishing the determination of a great man Abandoning his appearance and wearing the robe of the Law he finds happiness in the Law and wanders in a mountain forest 
If I were now to abandon the robe of the Law I would have to disregard the shame in my heart Even a celestial king must not do this How much less could I return to my excellent human family 
If one has vomited up greed anger and delusion then returns and partakes of them he is like someone who again eats his own vomit How could he bear this suffering 
When I saw the passing of birth old age and death I was disgusted and went forth If I were now to return and reenter that my foolishness would be the same 
If one tries to develop deliverance while dwelling in a palace one is not in the right place Deliverance is produced by quietude Kingship adds to hardship 
Quietude dispenses with royal majesty Royal rule is separate from deliverance Movement and tranquility are like water and fire How could one have the two principles together 
I have decided to develop deliverance and I will not dwell in a royal position 
If you say that one may dwell in a royal position and develop deliverance this would be a wrong decision Deliverance is certainly not like that 
I have now made my decision to break with the enticements of relatives Having correctly applied myself to go forth why would I return  
The chief minister inwardly considered the resolute determination of the Crown Prince He was very conscious that virtue would be in compliance and that his explanation made sense 
He said to the Crown Prince It is as you Prince have explained The search for the Law should be that way But now is just not the right time The king your father is aged and feeble 
Though you say I find happiness in deliverancestill you do what is wrong 
Even though you find happiness in going forth it is without wisdom You do not consider a very fine principle While you do not see the cause yet you seek for the fruition You merely reject contemplating the present 
Some say there is a later world on the other hand some say there is not As that existence is not yet decided on why reject present happiness 
If there will be a later world one will endure what will be obtained If one says that a later world is nonexistent its nonexistence means deliverance 
Some say that there is a later world but they do not explain a cause for deliverance Just like earth that is firm fire that is warm water that is moist and wind that moves a later world is like that too It is by nature thus a Chapter IX  
Some explain that pure and impure both arise through their specific natures It would be a foolish explanation to say that one may strive for change 
Water can extinguish fire and fire causes water to dry up One specific nature causes the destruction of another but when natures are harmonious they complete a being 
If one dwells in the womb hands feet the limbs and consciousness are naturally produced Who has to do that  
Who causes a thorn to be sharp 
It is naturally like that And all the birds and animals do not wish themselves to be as they are 
Every birth in the heavens is caused by the god śvara as well as by other creators There is no one who is how he wishes by his own power 
If there is a cause for birth that could also cause extinction Why the need to strive and seek deliverance 
Some say that a self causes birth and further that a self causes extinction too Some say there is no cause of birth and one is extinguished if one strives 
If one raises ones child and is not burdened by ones ancestors if one studies the scriptures bequeathed by the seers and serves the gods with great sacrificial offerings if one is not burdened by these three things one is called delivered 
One may seek deliverance with these three as transmitted in the past and present If through any other effort one toils in vain and without fruition 
If you want to seek deliverance just develop superior application The grief of the king your father will be appeased and your path of deliverance will be immediate You have given up your family and wander in a mountain forest but returning is still not wrong 
In the past King Ambarīṣa dwelled in the forest of asceticism for a long time He had given up his crowd of followers and his retinue but he returned home and resumed his royal position b  
Rāma son of the king of the land left the kingdom and dwelled in a mountain forest When he heard that the customs of the land were being forsaken he returned and maintained the right changes 
The king of the ālvas was called Druma Father and son wandered through mountain forests but in the end both returned to their country 
The munis Vasiṣṭha and Antideva practiced pure conduct in a mountain forest but after a long time they returned to their country 
The right ways of such previous excellent ones are very famous They all returned to their royal territories and shone in the world like lamps 
Therefore it is not wrong to give up the mountain forest and to be converted to the right way  
When the Crown Prince had heard the chief ministers kind words and his exposition for his own good he answered him with the constant truth without any confusion unhindered and dignified with firm determination and tranquil words I am doubtful about existence or nonexistence My doublemindedness is increased by suspicion I will decidedly not accept your theory about existence and nonexistence 
In the world doubtful argumentation is spread and handed down I am not at ease with your true meaning of existence and nonexistence Someone who sees clearly distinguishes true from false How could belief come from someone else 
It is as if a person who was born blind takes a blind man as his guide Where would he go to in the absolute darkness of the night 
Concerning the way of purity or of impurity the world has its uncertainties If one does not see the truth one should practice a pure path It is better to practice the austerities of a pure way than to enjoy the practice of what is impure 
Contemplating the theories received from someone else not one is marked by certainty When true words are accepted with an open mind one is forever free from any wrong A wise one does not pronounce erroneous words or false theories 
You mention that Rāma and the others gave up their families and developed pure conduct but in the end they returned to their countries and indulged in the five desires This is lowly behavior and a wise one does not rely on that 
I will now briefly explain to you the essential meaning 
The sun or moon may fall to the ground and Sumeru and the Snowy Mountains may change but I myself will never change and retreat to the wrong place 
Rather than returning to my country and entering the blaze of the five desires if my goal is not accomplished it would be better to throw myself into a great fire  
Having revealed this important solemn oath he slowly rose and took his leave 
The sharpness of the Crown Princes eloquence was as blazing as an abundance of sunlight There was no way the royal preceptor and the chief minister could be victorious in the discussion 
Telling themselves that they had tried everything they could only withdraw and return They felt deep reverence for the Crown Prince and did not dare bring any stronger pressure on him but out of respect for the kings command they did not dare return quickly and paused halfway 
As they walked along the way they went slowly while looking back 
They chose a clever person a careful and ingenious man to conceal himself and secretly observe  
a Fascicle Three Chapter X King Bimbisāra Goes to the Crown Prince  
Its base hidden among the five mountains it was magnificent standing alone among the peaks Its trees had luxuriant flowers and fruits and rivers and springs separated warm from cool entered the city of the five mountains as quietly as if it were beyond the heavens 
When the people of the land saw that the virtues in the Crown Princes appearance were profound and bright that the figure of the youth was bright with an unequaled manly appearance they all thought it was wonderful as if they were seeing śvaras banner 
Those who passed him stopped and those who were behind all quickly rushed on Those who were advancing in front all turned back and watched him tirelessly and with wideopen eyes 
As they saw the primary and secondary marks of his four limbs their eyes did not move They reverently came to welcome him They did obeisance with palms held together and made polite inquiries 
They were all very joyful and made worship as fitting They looked up to his worthy and excellent countenance and they looked down in shame at their own different appearances 
They adjusted their former impetuous deportment and increased their respect in silence They wished to undo their dislikes and their kind feelings suddenly increased 
Men and women all at once withdrew from their public or private occupations Full of respect for appearance they honored his qualities and completely forgot to return as they watched 
The mark of the white tuft of hair between his eyebrows his long and wide blue eyes the golden radiance of his whole person his pure webbed hands Even though he had the appearance of someone who had gone forth he had the marks associated with a noble king 
The men and women of the city of Rājagṛha both young and old all felt ill at ease 
At that moment King Bimbisāra sat high on an observation pavilion He saw that the people were agitated not behaving as usual He summoned someone from outside and asked him details about the reason  
respectfully knelt below the kings pavilion and fully informed him of what he had seen and heard It has been made known in the past that the ākya clan has a wonderful and excellent son His divine wisdom surpasses the worldly external and as a king he would lead in the eight directions He has gone forth and is here now 
When the king heard this he was pleasantly surprised in his heart His demeanor was unchanged but his spirit was already racing He ordered a messenger to go quickly and secretly observe the propriety of the Crown Princes destination After had received his instructions he secretly followed  observing his behavior 
gaze was tranquil and he looked straight ahead Walking with dignity he showed his true deportment When he entered a neighborhood on his almsround he was first among the beggars He controlled his appearance his mind unconfused 
He accepted what he received whether fine or coarse With his bowl in his hands he turned to a secluded grove After his meal he rinsed his mouth in a clear stream Enjoying the tranquility he felt at ease on Mount Pāṇḍava 
Green groves lined the high cliffs and red flowers grew among them Birds peacocks and other kinds flew about crying in confusion Chapter X  
His robe of the Law helped the morning freshness arise just as when the sun is shining from the mulberry tree  When the messenger saw that was staying  he gave a full report in due order 
When the king heard  his mind quickly became respectful He immediately had his carriage adorned and went on his way With his celestial crown his girdle with pendants and his ornamented garments he walked like a lion king 
He selected several elders tranquil and careful gentlemen and led a large crowd Like a rising cloud they ascended Mount Pāṇḍava 
He saw the dignified demeanor of the Bodhisattva who had quieted his sense faculties He was sitting upright in his hut on a cliff just like the moon in the blue sky 
His fine beauty was pure and majestic like a transformed body of the Law Respectful thoughts reverently arose and he gradually drew near with reverential steps just like akra ruler of the gods who went to Maheśvara 
With controlled appearance and dignified manners he respectfully asked if he was well 
The Bodhisattva moved with care and repaid him the courtesy 
When the king had completed his polite questions he then sat down on a clean rock He gazed and stared at divine deportment His countenance was serene and his feelings were mixed with joy 
I have humbly heard that you have inherited the abundant qualities of your famous family My feelings of esteem have been accumulating for a long time but now I want to settle some doubts 
While ditya is your original ancestor your position has been high for ten thousand generations so that their qualities have continually been bequeathed widely collected in the present 
You are wise and able but you are yet youthful Why have you gone forth 
As a noble prince who surpasses the worldly you beg for alms and do not abide in splendor Your fine person should be perfumed Why do you wear the kāṣāya 
Your hand should control the land but you receive despicable food with it c  If you will not succeed the king your father and receive his land I will now divide my country in half It is my earnest hope that I may somehow entertain your interest 
As you avoid compelling likes or dislikes with the passing of time one will comply with what should be followed Show consideration to my sincere words When ones wish is obtained one is a good neighbor 
If you would not wish to subdue your noble character or if you yield and accept the goodness of others I shall provide you with valiant men weapons and resources for a military 
When a bright person knows the right time and makes his choice his duty his riches and his five desires are increased If one does not obtain these three gains one will always toil in vain 
One may respect duty and reject riches and beauty but riches are for people in the whole world If one is wealthy and has given up duty and desire one will preserve ones wealth 
But if one is poor and forgetful of ones duty who could find joy in the five desires 
Therefore if the three things go together virtue spreads and the path is propagated 
When one is endowed with duty riches and the five desires one is called a great man in the world 
The wheelturning king Māndhātṛ ruled over the four worlds and Lord akra shared half his throne with him but his power could not rule over heaven 
Your straight long arms are quite sufficient to seize the regions of humans and gods now Not relying on my royal power I wish to compel you to stay with us 
I see that you have abandoned any fondness for your appearance and that you wear the garment of someone who has gone forth I have respect for your virtue but I grieve and feel for you as a man You now go begging for alms 
I wish you would accept the land In youth one may experience the five desires and in middle age one may indulge in riches to enjoy When ones faculties have matured in old age that is the time to comply with the Law 
One may hold on to the riches of the Law in ones youth but one will certainly be destroyed by desire When older ones vigor is lessened and one may be courteous and seek silence When one is in old age and ashamed of ones desire for riches and practices the Law one is honored by the whole world 
In youth ones mind is fickle and rushes to the objects of the five desires One is bound by the plight of ones associates and in the exchange of feelings ones affection for others is deep As one grows old one has fewer sentimental attachments and one is honored by those who comply with the Law The five desires have all withdrawn and one increases ones thoughts of happiness with the Law 
Respect the law of the ruler and serve the celestial spirits in a great gathering You will ride upon a celestial dragon and ascend to heaven experiencing happiness The previous excellent noble kings adorned themselves with precious necklaces 
They arranged for great gatherings offering sacrifices In the end they took refuge and experienced the good fortune of heaven  
Such was the explanation of King Bimbisāra using all kinds of means but the determination of the Crown Prince remained firm as immovable as Sumeru 
b Chapter XI The Reply to King Bimbisāra  After King Bimbisāra had urged in a courteous and comforting way the Crown Prince respectfully expressed his appreciation deeply moved by the words addressed to him You have worldly propriety Your exposition is not baseless 
The common in the world cannot dwell in kindness and righteousness Having few qualities they approach the facts with foolishness 
How would they comprehend anything famous and excellent But carrying on your excellent ancestral tradition you revere propriety and practice respectful deference In the middle of hardship you can bring rescue for all without abandoning anyone This is the characteristic of a true virtuous friend in the world 
When the riches of a good friend bring relief for all that person is called a secure treasure When one is parsimonious and hoards ones own profits they will certainly quickly disappear 
The riches of the land are an impermanent treasure Generosity is a meritorious action If one is also generous toward ones virtuous friends one will not have any regrets later even after they have been scattered 
Because I know that you are generous in your heart I will not argue against you I shall tell you now with all my heart what I have seen 
I am afraid of birth old age illness and death and I wish to seek true deliverance I have given up my relatives and left my loved ones Why would I return to indulging in the five desires 
I am not afraid of venomous snakes freezing hail or fierce fires yet I am afraid of the objects of the five desires As they proceed they weary my mind 
The thieves of impermanence the five desires steal ones finest precious things They are deceitful fake and unreal just like apparitions 
They make a man deluded when he considers them even for a while 
The five desires are a considerable hindrance always impeding the Law of tranquility 
When even celestial happiness is impossible how much more so when one dwells in human desires 
The five desires bring about a thirst that will never know a moment of satisfaction just like a fierce fire in the wind 
One may throw on firewood but it will not be enough Of all meaningless things in the world none surpasses the objects of the five desires 
Because beings are foolish and covetous they are attached to them and do not realize it A wise one is afraid of the five desires and does not fall into their meaninglessness 
Even if one would rule within the four seas one would still strive for more beyond them Desire is like the great ocean It never has a moment of satiety 
As for the wheelturning king Māndhātṛ the wide heavens rained gold and he ruled the four worlds but he further strove for Trāyastriṃśa Heaven sharing Lord akras throne His intentions caused his life to end 
Nahuṣa practiced asceticism and ruled over the thirtythree gods Indulging in his desire his mind became haughty and seers draw his chariot Because of this negligent behavior he immediately fell among the serpents 
The wheelturning king Aiḷa went out to Trāyastriṃśa Heaven He chose a celestial maiden as his queen and he demanded gold from the seers The anger of the seers was like a curse His country was destroyed and his life ended 
Bali  and the great Lord akra the great Lord akra and Nahuṣa from Nahuṣa back to Lord akrahow could a celestial ruler know permanence 
His land is not firm even though great power may dwell there 
Wearing a garment of herbs eating fruit and drinking from a stream having long hair as if hanging down to the ground remaining silent without any aspiration 
Practicing asceticism in this way one may be destroyed by desire in the end 
The very powerful king with a thousand arms was valiant and hard to confront but he was killed by the seer Rāma also because of his desire 
Desire for tasteless objects and a lasting increase in posterity are detested by the wise Who would partake of the poison of desire 
Through all kinds of suffering one seeks benefit all caused by covetousness If one is without desire hardship does not arise 
A wise one sees that suffering is wrong while dispelling desire The world may think it is good but in any case it is a bad way That which is coveted by beings brings every reason for negligence and the negligent hurt themselves When dead they will fall into a woeful destination 
Without diligence they are naturally lost but it is not the case that through effort one can detain them 
They are like borrowed objects and a wise one is not attached to them When desire is sought for through hardship once obtained it increases attachment When scattered by impermanence it increases suffering more and more Holding its torch one may yet burn oneself 
A foolish and mean person burns his mind with the poison of stinginess Throughout his whole life he experiences lasting suffering and never obtains happiness 
Covetousness and hatred are like the poison of a snake Why would a wise one approach them 
In hardship one may chew on a dry bone but it has no flavor and one is not nourished One wears out ones teeth in vain A wise one does not try to taste it 
Kings and robbers are different like water and fire but evil sons equally share in the riches which are like a putrid piece of meat fought over by a gathering flock of birds The same applies when coveting riches A wise one does not feel joy for that 
A place where riches are accumulated often raises enmity Night and day one guards it as if in fear of a great enemy a  An execution underneath a banner in the eastern marketplace one detests this 
The long banners of covetousness hatred and delusion a wise one always keeps away from them When entering a mountain forest rivers or seas one has little ease and is often destroyed 
If for instance one wants to pick the fruit of the highest branch of a tree most often one will fall to ones death The same applies in case of the object of desire One may see it but it is hard to grasp 
One may earnestly apply oneself to the search for riches but they are hard to accumulate and easy to scatter as if obtained in a dream Why would a wise one protect them 
If one deceivingly covers over a fiery pit he who steps on it will certainly be burned to death The same applies to the fire of desire A wise one does not wander there 
In the cases of the Kauravas the Vṛṣṇis the Andhakas the Mekhalas and the Daṇḍakas  the appearance of their desire was just like the knives and block of the butcher 
If one ties up oneself and throws oneself into water or fire or if one throws oneself from a high cliff to seek celestial happiness one suffers in vain and does not obtain any benefit 
The asura brothers Sunda and Upasunda lived together and held each other dear but they destroyed each other because of their desire They perished and their names were both destroyed all because of desire 
Desire brings low expectations and for a long time body and spirit are wearied 
Deer die while coveting songs birds on the wing follow their covetousness for beauty and fishes in the deep covet bait They all suffer from their desire 
When one observes the provisions one depends on they are not sovereign ways With food one cures the ailment of hunger and one drinks water to do away with thirst 
Covered in clothes one withstands the cold wind One remedies sleepiness by lying down Because it is tiresome to walk one wishes for a conveyance Tired of standing up one wishes for bedding and a seat 
One bathes to do away with impurity This is all to put a stop to suffering b Chapter XI  Therefore one should know that the five desires are not sovereign 
For example if someone falls ill with fever he asks for a cooling medicine When he wants to stop suffering a fool thinks he is a sovereign yet the provisions he depends on certainly will not stop his suffering 
They still may let the way of suffering increase Therefore these are no sovereign ways 
Warm clothes are no constant happiness As the season passes they may yet bring suffering Moonlight is cool in summer but in winter it increases the suffering of the cold 
Up to the eight worldly factors  none are characterized by certainty The painful and pleasant characteristics are not certain Slavery and kingship why would they be separate 
His instructions are accepted by all and one considers a king to be someone superior but giving instructions means suffering as when one bears the heavy burden of responsibility He must always gauge the weight of the world 
As a king one has many enemies Even those dear to him may become a calamity Without any dear ones he stands alone What joy is there in this 
Even if he rules the four worlds what he enjoys is in any case not more than one part 
It is better to stop wanting Appeasement means great contentment 
Dwelling in kingship the five desires may mean happiness but when not ruling solitude means joy As joy and happiness are of the same kind what is the use of having a royal position 
Do not make any effort to lead me into the five desires What I in fact wish for is a cool and open road 
If you want to bring me any benefit help me accomplish my aspiration I am not afraid of an enemy and I do not seek the happiness of rebirth in heaven 
My heart does not cherish common profit and I have given up a celestial crown Therefore I must go against your feelings I cannot follow your proposal 
If one has avoided the mouth of a venomous snake why would one go back and take hold of it 
If one holds a torch and burns oneself how could one not quickly drop it c  
When someone who has eyes envies a blind person when one is set free but wishes to be bound again when a rich person wishes to be poor and when a wise one indulges in foolishnesswhen there are people like this in the world then I will find happiness in my country 
If one wants to cross birth old age and death restrains oneself and goes begging for alms has little desire and keeps ones seclusion and if one avoids a woeful destination in the later world one is content in two worlds Do not grieve for me now 
Grieve for him who is king His thoughts are constantly craving in vain He does not obtain contentment in the present world and in the later world he will experience a painful retribution 
You have attended to me with your generous feelings with the propriety and righteousness of the great men of your family and you would like me to share in your worldly pleasures 
I should recompense your virtue yet I urge you to share in my benefits If one indulges in the three happinesses  he is called a man of the world 
This is not yet meaningful because one is constantly seeking without any satisfaction If one is free from birth old age and death then one may be called a great man 
You have said that one is unsettled when young and that one may go forth when old But I see that the strength of someone of advanced age is weak unfit for anything It is better that ones decision is made when ones determination is fierce when one is healthy 
The thief of death follows one with a sword in his hand constantly looking for his opportunity Why would he allow one to reach old age to fulfill ones determination and go forth 
Impermanence is a hunter Old age is his bow and illnesses are his sharp arrows He is constantly on the lookout for deerliving beings in the wilderness of birth and death Getting his opportunity he puts a stop to their lives 
In a persons behavior concerning the matter of birth or extinction young old or middleaged all should diligently apply themselves 
One holds a large gathering when one offers sacrifices This is all because of foolishness One should respect the Right Law and oppose any a Chapter XI killing to offer sacrifices to heaven When one seeks good fortune by injuring the living he is an unkind person 
Even if the fruition were permanent when one injures the living still one should not kill How much less when one injures the living and offers sacrifices seeking for an impermanent  
Even if one practices meditation and quietude without any morality learning or wisdom one should not comply with the world and arrange for a large gathering to offer sacrifices 
Even if he might obtain happiness in the present by killing the living a wise one should not kill How much less would he seek good fortune in a later world by killing beings 
I do not find happiness in any conditioned fruition of the three realms  The fluidity of the destinations is just like grass tossed about by wind and water So I have come far to seek true deliverance 
I have heard of one called rāḍa who explains the path of deliverance well I shall now go to him to the place of the muni the great seer 
May your suffering be allayed by my sincere words I apologize to you now I wish that your country be safe Protect it well just like Lord akra 
May the light of your wisdom shine in the world like abundant sunlight 
Excellent ruler of the great earth protect your life with an upright mind 
Ice and snow take fire to be the enemy Because of fire the banner of smoke arises The banner of smoke becomes a floating cloud and the floating cloud brings heavy rain There are birds in the sky that drink from the rain  but it has not rained for them 
If you make your abode having killed your serious enemies the serious enemies in your residence are done away with But if there is someone who kills your serious enemy you should hide him now so that he may go free as if it had not rained on him when he took a drink  
The king then held his palms together  He respected virtue and was joyful in his heart 
I wish that your result may quickly be accomplished just as you want But once you have accomplished a result you should quickly return and accept me b  
The Bodhisattva made the promise in his heart I agree to comply with your wish He took leave and followed his way He went to rāḍa 
The king and his retinue held their palms together and saw him off They all thought it was amazing and returned to the city of Rājagṛha Chapter XII Visits to rāḍa and Udraka  
When the moonlight descendant of Ikṣvāku arrived in that quiet grove he respectfully went to the muni the great seer rāḍa 
When the adept son of the Kālāma family saw the Bodhisattva coming from afar he praised him from the distance in a loud voice He comforted him and said Welcome  
Holding their palms together they exchanged reverences and asked after one anothers wellbeing 
After they had made mutual inquiries about their troubles they sat down in a dignified way 
When the brahman saw the Crown Prince his appearance and his careful deportment washing he bowed down to his virtue as if he were thirstily drinking the nectar of immortality 
He raised his hand and said to the Crown Prince I have known that you have gone forth for a long time You have broken with the bonds of your beloved ones like an elephant who has shaken off his hobbles Your profound knowledge your insight and your wisdom are bright capable of avoiding this poisonous fruition 
The bright excellent kings of the past gave up their thrones and handed them over to their sons just as someone wearing a garland discards it when it is withered 
It is still better not to desire the position of a noble king when you are in your prime 
I see that your determination is very firm You are fit to be a receptacle of the Right Law You will board the ship of knowledge and cross the sea of birth and death 
When a common person is enticed to come and study I only teach him after I have investigated his ability I now know your firm and resolute determinationJuststudy as you wish 
When the Crown Prince heard these instructions he was glad and responded You may instruct me well with an impartial mind without any love or hate Just accept me with an open mind and my wish will be fulfilled c  
When one obtains a torchlight while walking at night when someone who has lost his direction receives guidance or when one obtains a light boat when crossing the sea the same applies to me now 
I have now received your merciful permission and I dare ask you about my inner doubts The calamities of birth old age illness and death how can one avoid them  
When rāḍa had heard the Crown Princes question he briefly gave his explanation using scriptural texts You are an ingenious gentleman the highest among the intelligent Now listen to my explanation of birth and death the meaning of origination and extinction 
Nature change birth old age and deaththese five are sentient beings Nature is a pure  and as for change faculties and objects secondary to the five great elements to self to intellection and to seeing are called change 
Matter sound smell taste and the tactilethese are called objective elements 
Hands feet speech and the two paths  these are called the five faculties of action Eye ear nose tongue and bodythese are called faculties of intellection 
For the faculty of mind the two meanings are combined both action and that called intellection Nature and change are a cause and the knower of the cause is the self 
The seer Kapila and his retinue of disciples studied the important meaning of this self and obtained deliverance 
That Kapila is Prajāpati  now That which knows birth old age and death is called the seen 
 The opposite of the above is called the unseen Foolishness action and desire are said to turn the wheel  
If one dwells in these three one is not free from sentient being 
Nonconfidence self doubt random nondistinction absence of means profound attachment to objective elements being bound to what is mine 
I explain and I know I come and go and I stay Such counting on a self is called the process of the activity of a self 
Being doubtful about the nature of things and not obtaining the truth about right or wrongsuch uncertainty is called doubt 
If one says that the right way is the self and that is nothing but mind saying that it is intellection and action and if one says that fate is further called the self  
such nondistinction is called random Not understanding foolish or clever nature and change is called nondistinction 
One may do homage and recite the scriptures kill living beings and sacrifice them to heaven consider water and fire as purifications and have the notion that these things mean deliverancesuch views are called absence of means 
When mind speech intellection and action are attached to foolishness and also to the objective elements this is called attachment 
Everything is mine This is called grasping 
Such eight kinds of delusion engulf one in birth and death The fools in every world are in the grasp of five nodes 
darkness delusion great delusion anger and fear Laziness is called darkness Birth and death are called delusion 
Desire is called great delusion because even a great person may be misled by it Resentment is called anger Mental distress is called fear 
The foolish common person is attached to the five desires the basis of the great suffering of birth and death As the wheel turns he is reborn in five destinations 
He keeps turning in rebirth  I have seen and heard and I know that I am caused Because of this counting on a self he follows the flow of birth and death 
This cause is not his nature and the result is not the possession of his nature either He namely considers correctly when four factors direct him toward deliverance the clever and the foolish the seen and the unseen 
If he knows these four factors he can be free from birth old age and death 
When birth old age and death have ended he has reached a place without end All brahmans in the world practice their pure conduct relying on the meaningfulness of this and they have widely explained it to the people b  
When the Crown Prince heard this explanation he further asked rāḍa What are the means of application and what place does one finally reach 
What pure conduct should one practice and further for how long 
Why would one practice pure conduct and what place will one reach in this way 
Do fully explain such important things to me  
rāḍa then gave an explanation according to his scriptural texts With his wisdom and means he briefly made further distinctions for the Crown Prince First one leaves the common and goes forth relying on alms Extensively concentrated on dignified demeanor he keeps his right morality 
He has little desire and knows satisfaction with whatever he obtains fine or coarse Happy to be alone he practices residing in solitude and diligently studies the scriptural texts 
He sees desire as fearful and renunciation as purification Controlling the dwellings of his faculties he puts his mind at ease in quietude 
He renounces desire evil and the unwholesome the afflictions of the realm of desire Having renounced he brings forth joy and happiness and he obtains the first trance  with adjusted and discursive thinking 
After he has obtained the happiness of the first trance and also adjusted and discursive thinking he brings forth the notion that this is wonderful and in his foolishness his mind is attached to happiness When he relies on the happiness of renunciation and his life ends he is reborn in the Brahma Heaven 
The wise one is fully conscious that he has expediently produced adjusted and discursive thinking He strenuously seeks to advance to what is associated with the second trance 
When he is attached to the flavor of that joy and happiness he obtains rebirth in the bhāsvara Heaven 
Expediently renouncing joy and happiness he further develops the third trance If he is content and does not seek for excellence he is reborn in the ubhakṛtsna Heaven 
If he gives up that happiness of mind he reaches the fourth trance 
When both suffering and happiness are stopped he may give rise to the notion that he is delivered 
With the retribution of the fourth trance he is reborn in the Bṛhatphala Heaven Because one has a long life it is called with extensive fruition  
Emerging from that trance he sees the possession of a body as wrong While advancing he develops wisdom and becomes weary of the fourth trance 
He decides to advance in his search and expediently does away with his desire for matter He begins with the cavities of his own body and gradually develops an understanding of emptiness 
 In the end he completely accomplishes the contemplation of solid parts as space He cuts short the objective element of his contemplation of space and advances to the contemplation of unlimited consciousness 
Skilled in inner quietude he is free from I and mineThe observation of nothingness is the sphere of nothingness 
Just as the stalk and sheath of muñja  are separated and just as a wild bird leaves its cage his deliverance is like that free from an objective element 
He is a superior brahman free from his physical appearance permanently and without end The wise one must know that this is true deliverance The means you have asked about and the deliverance you seek these are as I have just explained 
The seers Jaigīṣavya and Janaka Vṛddha Parāśara  and the others who have sought the path have all obtained true deliverance following this path  
When the Crown Prince had heard this explanation he pondered over its purport Motivated by his previous causality he again asked I have listened to your excellent wisdom to the subtle and very fine meaning but if it does not reject the knower of the cause it is not the final path 
The knower of the cause of nature and change may be said to be delivered but your contemplation of a self has a way of coming into existence and it also has a way of being a seed 
You may think that when the self is purified it is truly delivered 
But if it meets with a combination of causes and conditions it will return to its bonds 
For example when the proper season soil water fire and wind for the seed are separated its reasons for growth are separated But when it meets with the conditions the seed will grow again 
They may be called freed when ignorance the cause of action and desire are rejected but beings who maintain a self do not have final deliverance 
One may reject these three everywhere and further obtain three superiorities but because the self always exists it subtly follows Because a subtle fault follows the mind does not apply itself 
Life becomes longlasting yet you think that one is truly delivered You may say that one is free from any mine but if one were free then even that would not exist 
As you are not free from any enumeration  how would one be free from any attribute So know that one is not delivered when one has an attribute 
The meanings of a possessor of an attribute and of attribute may be different but they are essentially one 
If color and heat are separate from fire distinct fire cannot be obtained For example before a body there is no possessor of the body In the same way before an attribute there is no possessor of an attribute either 
So one may have been delivered at first but then one is bound to a body 
Furthermore when the knower of the cause is without body he is either knowing or unknowing If one says he is knowing he must have something to know and if there is something to be known he is not delivered 
If one says he is unknowing then a self is useless 
If one is free from a self but is still knowing the self then is the same as a log or a rock 
Being in possession of the knowledge of fine and coarse one may turn ones back on the coarse and respect the subtle 
But if one is capable of giving up everything what may be caused is finished  
rāḍas explanation could not please mind He knew that he was no allknower and that he should practice and further seek for excellence 
He went to the seer Udraka but he too relied on an existing self Although he observed a subtle object he saw that it was beyond perception and nonperception 
 Dwelling in the absence of perception and nonperception he still did not have the road to escape 
a Chapter XII  As beings reach that they will certainly fall back again Because the Bodhisattva was seeking to escape he also rejected the seer Udraka He searched further for an excellent fine path and ascended Gaja Mountain to the forest of asceticism called Nagarī where five bhikṣus dwelled 
He saw that the five bhikṣus were well in control of their sense faculties They dwelled in that forest of asceticism keeping the precepts and practicing austerities 
The bank of the Nairañjanā River was quiet and very pleasant In that very place the Bodhisattva immediately pondered in tranquility 
When the five bhikṣus knew that was seeking deliverance with a fine mind they wholeheartedly came to worship him as if paying respect to the god śvara 
They humbly treated him as their teacher and never left his side whether going or staying just as the faculties of a practitioner proceed following the mind 
In his diligent application the Bodhisattva had to cross old age illness and death He wholeheartedly practiced asceticism and restraining himself he forgot to eat 
Purifying his mind he observed a fast that any practitioner would find unbearable He meditated in silence for a full six years 
He ate one sesame seed and one grain of rice a day and his body became utterly emaciated In his search to cross birth and death his grave delusion became even more serious 
The path will be accomplished through understanding Not eating will not be the cause Although his four limbs were weak his wise mind became increasingly clear 
His spirit was empty and his body was shrunken but his famous virtue became widely renowned It was like the opening up of a kumuda flower when the moon has just risen 
His excellent fame spread all over the land Men and women rivaled to come and see him His suffering body was like a dead log for almost six years 
Fearful of the suffering of birth and death he wanted only the cause of right awakening b  He thought to himself Not through this will I be free from desire or will quiet contemplation arise 
The wonder I previously obtained beneath the jambū tree is better still 
The path will not be obtained by an exhausted body It must be sought after with corporal strength When food and drink fulfill the faculties the faculties rejoice so that the mind is at ease 
When the mind is at ease it complies with quietude Tranquility is the snare for trances Through meditation one knows the Right Law and with the power of the Law one may obtain what is hard to obtain 
In quietude one may leave old age and death in the highest form free from any impurity Such fine ways all come from food and drink  
Having considered the meaningfulness of this he washed himself on the bank of the Nairañjanā After bathing he wanted to come out of the pond but he was weak and could not pull himself out A celestial spirit pressed down the branch of a tree and he raised his hand held on to it and came out 
At the same time on the other side beyond the forest there was a cowherd chief The chiefs daughter was called Nandā A god of the pure abodes came to tell her The Bodhisattva is in the forest Go and worship him  
Nandā Balajā happily went to where was She wore bracelets of white shells on her arms and a garment that was dyed dark blue 
The dark blue and the white reflected one another just like something immersed in purifying water Her trusting mind increased her joy She bowed at the Bodhisattvas feet and respectfully offered fragrant milkrice considering that he would deign to accept it seeing her concern 
The Bodhisattva accepted and ate it and obtained a present fruition Having eaten his faculties rejoiced and he was fit to experience bodhi 
His body became brighter and the reputation of his virtue became ever more lofty just as the hundred rivers increase the sea and the new moon daily increases its light 
When the five bhikṣus saw  they were startled and thought it was contemptible They thought he had withdrawn c Chapter XII from his spiritual path 
They abandoned him and moved to a better dwelling place just as when one is delivered he is free from all five great elements The Bodhisattva wandered alone and went to the auspicious tree Underneath that tree he would accomplish the path of perfect awakening 
The ground was wide and level and smooth with soft grass growing there With dignity he walked like a lion and at every step the earth shook 
The movement of the earth moved the dragon Kāla He rejoiced and his eyes saw clearly He said When I saw the former buddhas the earth moved just as it does now 
Your virtue muni is very worthy unsurpassed on the great earth As your feet tread on the ground with every step it makes a thundering sound 
Your fine light shines in the world just like the light of the morning sun A flock of five hundred blue tits hovers in the sky making circles to the right A gentle and cool breeze follows and blows all around 
All these auspicious signs were the same for the buddhas of the past That is why I know that the Bodhisattva will accomplish the path of right awakening  
From another man who was cutting grass obtained pure and soft grass He spread out the grass underneath the tree and sat down his body upright He sat crosslegged and did not move like the coiling body of a dragon 
I will not rise from this seat until I fully achieve what I have to do When he made this true and solemn oath the gods and dragons all rejoiced A cool and gentle breeze came up yet the twigs of the bushes and trees did not rustle All the birds and animals were quiet none gave a sound All these were signs that the Bodhisattva would certainly accomplish the path of awakening 
a Chapter XIII Māras Destruction  When the great seer of a family of seer kings made his firm solemn oath beneath the bodhi tree that he would certainly accomplish the path of deliverance  
demons dragons and the multitude of gods all greatly rejoiced But the celestial king Māra enemy of the Law alone was sorrowful and did not rejoice 
The sovereign king of the five desires was endowed with every skill in battle Because he detested socalled deliverance he was called Pāpīyas 
King Māra had three daughters They had a beautiful appearance and fine bearing Possessing all kinds of wiles to delude people they were the best among celestial maidens The first was called Rāgā 
The three daughters came forward at the same time and said to Pāpīyas their father We are wondering why you are sad  
Their father fully described the situation according to the facts and informed his daughters In the world there is a great muni His person bears the armor of his great solemn oath He holds the bow of his great resolution and the sharp arrow of wisdom He wishes to battle and subdue beings and to destroy my realm 
Soon when the beings come to believe in him I will not be as before When they all turn to his path of deliverance my land will be empty When for instance someone offends against morality his person is then empty 
As long as his eye of wisdom is not open my land is still all right I must go and destroy determination break down his bridge  
With bow in hand and five arrows along with his retinue both male and female went to that aśvattha grove wishing beings to be ill at ease b  
He saw the quietude of the muni who was about to cross the sea of the three existences  With his left hand he seized his strong bow and with his right hand he made ready to shoot a sharp arrow And he said to the Bodhisattva You kṣatriya  rise quickly Death is very dreadful 
This path is very famous practiced by your excellent ancestors 
If you do not rise now make your purpose firm Beware do not give up on your solemn oath Dare me to let loose my arrow 
At the mere touch of this arrow of mine the grandson of the moonlight Aiḷa  was as if blown away by a storm His mind became disordered 
When the seer practicing asceticism in quietude heard the sound of my arrow he immediately became very afraid at heart He was confused and lost his basic nature 
All the more so if you hope to be free from this arrow of mine during your last days 
If you rise quickly now you may yet be fortunate and obtain safety 
This arrows poison is fierce It will cause you to shiver and tremble If someone relies on his strength to endure my arrow even his own safety may be difficult  
All the more so if you cannot endure it How could you not be frightened  As Māra explained this fearful matter to intimidate the Bodhisattva the Bodhisattvas mind was complacent He had no doubts nor was he afraid 
The Bodhisattva did not look at the arrow and he did not care for the three daughters either King Māra stood in awe and became suspicious He said to himself deeply in his heart Once I shot at Maheśvara for the maiden of the Snowy Mountains  I could make his heart change but I cannot move the Bodhisattva 
It is not the case that I can move his heart with this arrow or with my celestial three jade daughters so that he may bring about love or hatred 
I must further gather my army and put forceful pressure on him with its strength c Chapter XIII  
While he was considering thus Māras troops suddenly assembled They were of all kinds and each had a different appearance Some grasped a trident or held a sword Others carried a tree or grasped an iron boltall kinds of implements for battle 
faces of boars fishes donkeys and horses the appearances of camels oxen rhinoceroses and tigers and the heads of lions dragons and elephants and other kinds of birds and beasts 
Some had one body and many heads Some had faces each with one eye Others had many eyes and some had large bellies and long bodies 
Some were weak and emaciated without a belly and some had long legs and large knees Some had large legs and fat calves and some had long teeth and sharp claws 
Some had no head chest or face and some were bipeds but had many bodies Some had large faces and faces sideways and some were of an ashgray color 
Some resembled the light of a bright star and the bodies of others emitted smoke Some had the ears of an elephant and were burdened with mountains Some had disheveled hair and were naked 
Some wore leather and their faces were colored half red and white Some wore tigerskin clothes and others wore snakeskin 
Some wore large bells around the waist and some had twisted locks or spiral headdresses Some had disheveled hair covering their bodies and some sucked in the human vital essence 
Some took away mens lives and some leaped wildly about crying out loud Some hurried in pursuit of others again and again injuring one another 
Some circled in the sky and some flew up among the trees Some roared and shouted their evil voices shaking heaven and earth 
Such evil beings surrounded the bodhi tree Some wanted to rip up body and others wanted to swallow him 
All four sides were ablaze with fire and the smoking blaze reached to the heavens above A gale of wind rose violently on the four sides and the mountain forest shook all around 
Through the combination of wind fire smoke and dust it was dark and one could not see a thing The gods and humans who loved the Law and a dragons and spirits were all angry at Māras crowd In their anger tears of blood flowed 
When the multitude of gods of the pure abodes saw that Māra was trying to confuse the Bodhisattva who was free from desire and without anger they felt grief and sorrow for him They all came and saw the Bodhisattva sitting upright unmoving 
Countless Māras surrounded him and their evil voices moved heaven and earth The Bodhisattva was established in quietude His bright complexion was without any peculiar sign 
He was like a lion king dwelling among the herd of animals They all sighed crying out Ha Amazing 
Wonderful But Māra lashed his crowds on and each presented their awful powers Again and again they pressed each other on to immediately cause his destruction Their eyes wide open they gnashed their teeth They flew in disarray and leaped wildly about 
The Bodhisattva watched in silence as if he were watching children playing The Māras became more and more angry and doubled their fighting strength 
When they tried to carry a rock they could not lift it and those who could could not put it down Flying spears tridents and sharp lances froze in the sky and did not come down As thunder shook there was a shower of large hail but it changed to flowers of five colors Evil dragonsnakes spat out poison which changed to a fragrant breeze 
Beings of all shapes tried to injure the Bodhisattva but they were unable to make him move and consequently they hurt themselves 
King Māra had an elder sister called Meghakālī Holding a skull vessel in her hands she stood in front of the Bodhisattva Exhibiting all kinds of strange deportment she tried to debauch and confuse the Bodhisattva 
Such hosts of Māra wanted to frighten the Bodhisattva with their various hideous bodies and by raising all kinds of evil voices But they could not move one hair The Māras were all distressed 
A spirit  in the sky had rendered himself invisible and he raised his voice I see that the great munis mind is without thought of resentment b Chapter XIII  Your evil poisonous minds Māras try to bring resentment where there is no resentment 
Foolish evil Māras you toil in vain There is nothing you can do Give up your noxious thoughts Be quiet and stay silent 
You cannot blow away Mount Sumeru with your breath Fire may become cold and water may become a blaze the earths nature may become evenly soft but you cannot destroy the Bodhisattva For eons he has practiced asceticism 
The Bodhisattva practices right consideration and diligently strives with zeal His pure wisdom is bright and he is compassionate for all 
No one can affect or break down these four fine qualities or make difficulties for him to accomplish his path of right awakening just as the sun shining with its thousandfold light is certain to remove the worlds darkness As one obtains fire by rubbing sticks together and as one obtains water by digging in the earth he strenuously applies right application 
There is nothing he will not obtain in his search No one comes to rescue the world all are affected by the poisons of greed anger and delusion Because he is merciful toward beings he seeks for the fine medicine of wisdom 
He will do away with the suffering of the world Why do you trouble him 
The deluded in the world are all attached to wrong paths The Bodhisattva is studying the right road He wishes to guide beings 
As if one would deceive the merchants guide through the wilderness As beings have fallen into great darkness and no one knows the place to go he lights the lamp of wisdom for them Why would you want to extinguish it 
As beings are all tossed about in the great sea of birth and death he repairs the ferryboat of wisdom for them Why would you want to let it sink 
Forbearance is a shoot of the Law and firm determination is the root of the Law The precepts of discipline are the flowers and the thoughts of awakening are the branches and the trunk As for the great tree of wisdom the unsurpassed Law is its fruit It gives shelter to beings 
The cangue and chains of greed anger and delusion are a yoke for c beings For long eons he has practiced asceticism to deliver beings from their bonds He will certainly accomplish this in the present sitting in this exact place Just as the buddhas of the past did he has firmly established his adamantine moment 
Practice forbearance and wait upon him  When Māra heard the voice in the sky and saw that the Bodhisattva remained tranquil he felt shame and lost his pride He turned back and returned to his heaven 
Māras hosts were all in distress They were defeated and had lost their might They abandoned their weapons of war scattered in the wild forest just as when one has killed the enemy ruler the gangs of enemies are all destroyed 
After the Māras had withdrawn the Bodhisattvas mind was still The sunshine doubled its light and the dusty mist dissipated 
The moon was bright and the stars were clear There was no more darkness Celestial flowers fell down like rain from the sky to worship the Bodhisattva 
Chapter XIV Abhisaṃbodhi  After the Bodhisattva had subdued Māra his determination was firmer and his mind tranquil The eternal end being most meaningful he entered the profound and fine trances Sovereign in the samādhis he would realize them in due order 
During the first watch he entered concentration and remembered his past lives 
From Suchandsuch a place called Soandso I came to be reborn here That way he completely understood his hundreds thousands and tens of thousands of births and deaths 
The births and deaths he had experienced were countless All kinds of living beings had all been his family once and he had great compassion in his heart 
Having recollected with great compassion he further observed that living beings revolved in six destinations and that their births and deaths never ended 
were false and not firm at all like a plantain tree or an illusion In the second watch he then obtained the pure divine eye 
Seeing all beings it was as if he observed their images in a mirror As the beings generated births and deaths they were noble or low poor or rich 
According to their pure or impure actions they experienced painful or happy retributions He observed that evildoers would be reborn in woeful destinations and that those who practiced wholesome actions would be reborn among humans or gods If they were reborn in hell they experienced countless kinds of suffering 
They swallow liquid copper or iron skewers pierced their limbs thrown into boiling hot cauldrons or forced into great masses of fire 
Packs of dogs devoured them with their long teeth or crows with sharp beaks pecked at their brains Afraid of fire they went to dense forests with a leaves that were swords cutting their limbs 
Sharp knives cut open their bodies or sharp axes chopped them up Experiencing these utterly painful poisons their actions did not let them die 
They had happily performed unclean actions but their retribution was the experience of utter suffering They had savored their attachments for only an instant but the painful retribution lasted for a very long time 
Laughing they had planted the cause of suffering but they experienced the punishment in tears If the beings that do evil were to see their retribution they would sever their vital arteries collapse in fear and bleed to death When they performed the actions of animals their actions were of several kinds each one different 
After death they fell into the animal destination with several kinds of bodies each one different Some died for their skin and flesh for their fur horns bones tails or feathers 
They massacred one another and their relatives still devoured them They carried a heavy burden or pulled a yoke They were lashed and stabbed with goads and awls 
Bloody pus dripped from their wounded limbs No one could stop hunger or thirst As they proceeded they massacred others and they did not have the power of autonomy  In the sky in water or on dry land they had nowhere to escape from death 
Those whose stinginess was great were reborn in the destination of hungry ghosts Their huge bodies were like big mountains but the openings of their throats were like the eye of a needle As the fiery poisons of hunger and thirst were ablaze they burned themselves 
If they had been stingy and had not given to those who asked or if they had kept others from being generous they were reborn among the hungry ghosts When they asked for food they could not obtain any They might try to eat impurities rejected by others but it was transformed and lost 
If one would hear that the painful retribution of stinginess is such he would slice his flesh to give it to another just like King ibi 
Some were reborn in the destination among humans physically dwelling in walking latrines 
movement was utterly painful and as it left the womb it gave rise to fear When a soft body touched an external object it was as if cut by a sword b Chapter XIV  
As they dwelled in the lot of their previous actions they did not have a single moment free of death Suffering hardship they sought rebirth and being reborn they experienced suffering for a long time 
If they were reborn in heaven because of their merit their thirst constantly burned them When their merit was exhausted and their life was at its end the five signs of decay and death arrived 
Just as the flowers of a tree become pale and withered they became drawn and lost their brightness The lot of their retinue was life or death Suffering in sadness no one could make them stay 
Their palaces became desolate and empty and the jade ladies all departed Sitting or lying in the dirt they wept sadly and longed for them 
The living felt grief about their miserable fall and the dead were sad longing for life Through strenuous practice of asceticism one wishes for the happiness of rebirth in heaven but because one has such suffering how base is this What is there to covet 
What is obtained through great application will not avoid the suffering of separation Gods and humans tall or short there is no difference 
Practicing asceticism for eons and forever free from desire one may think one will surely abide a long time but in the present all miserably fall 
In hell one experiences various suffering and animals kill each other Hungry ghosts are forced to suffer hunger and thirst and humans are exhausted from craving One might mention the happiness of rebirth in heaven but separation is a very great suffering 
Being misled one is reborn in the world and does not have any place to rest In the sea of birth and death the wheel turns without end Beings drown in an unceasing current They are tossed about without anything to rely upon 
Thus observed the five destinations with his pure divine eye They were false and not firm like a plantain tree or like bubbles Then during the third watch he entered profound concentration and observed that the suffering of the turning of the wheel in the world was its specific nature 
One is frequently reborn grows old and dies The number of rebirths is countless Desire and the darkness of delusionno one knows how to escape them c  
In his right mindfulness he inwardly considered the origination of birth and death 
He knew with certainty that old age and death had to be brought about by birth If a person has a body for that reason physical pain must follow 
He further observed how birth was caused and he saw that it was through the action of existence His divine eye observed that the action of existence was not produced by the god śvara 
It had no specific nature and no self and neither was it without a cause If one cuts through the first knot of the bamboo the other knots then pose no difficulty 
After he had seen the cause of birth and death he gradually saw the truth The action of existence was produced by grasping as when fire consumes firewood 
Grasping had craving as its cause just as a small fire may set a mountain ablaze Knowing that craving is produced by experiencing one understands unpleasant and pleasant seeking contentment 
Hunger and thirst seek drink and food Experiencing produces craving in the same way Any experiencing has contact as its cause Its three classes mean the production of suffering or of happiness 
If one works at rubbing sticks one may obtain fire and use it Contact is produced by the six sense faculties because a blind person does not have clear perception 
The six sense faculties originate from nameandform just as a shoot grows into a stalk and leaves Nameandform are produced by consciousness just as a seed means the production of the shoot and leaves 
But consciousness comes from nameandform Nothing is omitted from such transformation Because of consciousness one produces nameandform and because of nameandform one produces consciousness 
Just as a man and his boat advance together there is mutual transportation on water and on dry land Just as consciousness produces nameandform nameandform produces the faculties 
The faculties produce contact and contact further produces experiencing Experiencing produces craving and craving produces grasping 
Grasping produces the existence of actions and existence then produces birth a Chapter XIV  Birth produces old age and death The turning of the wheel is endless for all 
The conditioned origination of the beings is completely known in right awakening right awakening was certain to be completed The end of birth meant the extinction of old age and death 
When existence is extinguished birth is extinguished When grasping is extinguished existence is extinguished When craving is extinguished grasping is extinguished When experiencing is extinguished craving is extinguished 
When contact is extinguished experiencing is extinguished When the six sense faculties are extinguished contact is extinguished The extinction of all sense faculties comes from the extinction of nameandform 
When consciousness is extinguished nameandform is extinguished When formation is extinguished consciousness is extinguished When delusion is extinguished formation is extinguished  The great seers right awakening was accomplished 
When right awakening was thus accomplished the Buddha appeared in the world The eightfold pathright view and so onis a smooth level and right road In the end there is no mine just as fire is extinguished when the firewood is consumed What I had to do is done 
I have obtained the path of right awakening of our ancestors had completely achieved the highest meaning and entered the house of the greatest seer 
As darkness passed and the light rose movement and tranquility were both silent He had reached the Law without end and his omniscience was clear 
The virtue of the great seer was pure and the earth quaked all around The whole universe was clear and bright and gods dragons and spirits gathered in great numbers In the sky they played celestial music to worship the Law 
A gentle breeze brought coolness and celestial clouds brought fragrant rain Fine flowers blossomed out of season and sweet fruits became ripe in spite of the season 
Mahāmāndārava and all kinds of celestial precious flowers came down in profusion in worship of the worthy muni 
Beings of different species all turned to one another with friendly thoughts Fear was completely eliminated There was no longer any thought of anger or arrogance 
All in the entire world accompanied the one whose impurities had ended The gods were happy with deliverance and the woeful destinations were calm for a while Affliction gradually ceased and the moon of knowledge gradually increased its light 
When the seers of the Ikṣvāku family who were reborn in heaven saw that the Buddha had appeared in the world they were filled with joy In their celestial palace it then rained flowers in worship 
The gods dragons and spirits praised the Buddhas virtue with one voice When people in the world saw the worship and heard the sounds of praise they all rejoiced and they were overcome with joy 
Only the celestial king Māra felt great grief in his heart 
The Buddha meditated seven days and his mind was pure He observed the bodhi tree gazing without blinking 
Relying on this place I have fulfilled my previous wish 
I am established in the Law without self With his buddha eye he observed beings and this gave rise to merciful thoughts He wished to let obtain purity 
Greed anger delusion and wrong views are floating and sinking into their minds Deliverance is very profound and fine How can I propagate it He gave up his diligent application and stayed silent 
He thought back to his previous solemn oath He again thought about expounding the Law and observed the strength of the afflictions of living beings 
Brahmadeva knew what was on mind that he should be invited to turn the Law Releasing his pure light all around for the rescue of suffering beings he came to see the worthy muni and the signs of a great person who would expound the Law 
As the fine meanings were all seen was established in true knowledge 
was reverential and rejoiced in his heart He held his palms together and urged him How fortunate the world is in meeting you worthy one with great compassion b Chapter XIV  
All kinds of beings are unclean and have impure thoughts Some have serious afflictions and the afflictions of others are insignificant 
Worldhonored One you have escaped the great sea of the suffering of birth and death Please save those beings who are sunk in it 
Just as a righteous person in the world shares the benefit he has obtained with others the benefit of the Law that you Worldhonored One have obtained should indeed save beings Common people mostly benefit themselves 
Please deign to be compassionate and do the most difficult thing in the world Having urged him in this way took his leave and returned to the Brahma Heaven 
The Buddha was pleased in his heart at Brahmadevas invitation and increased his sincerity He nourished his feeling of great compassion and strengthened his intention to expound the Law 
Remembering that would go begging for alms the four kings all offered their almsbowls The Tathāgata accepted the four for the sake of the Law and combined them into one 
At that time some merchants were traveling A celestial spirit a good friend told them The great seer the worthy muni is in that mountain forest As he is a fine field of merit in the world you should go and worship him  
When heard this command they greatly rejoiced and offered his first meal 
After the meal he looked back and thought Who should hear the Law first 
Yes there are rāḍa and Udraka Rāmaputra They are fit to receive the Right Law but their lives have now come to an end 
Next there are the five bhikṣus who should hear the first exposition of the Law  
He wanted to expound the Law of tranquility just as the sunlight does away with darkness He went to Vārāṇasī the place where the seers of the past had dwelled 
With the steady gaze of the eyes of an ox king and with the dignified gait of a lion he went to the city of Kāśi to save beings At every step the animal kings looked at him but he looked back at the bodhi grove 
c Chapter XV Turning the Wheel of the Law  The Tathāgata was in complete quietude and his light was manifestly shining With dignified deportment he walked alone but as if followed by a large crowd 
On his way he met a brahman whose name was Upaga Maintaining the deportment of a bhikṣu he respectfully stood by the side of the road 
answered I have no teacher nor any teaching I am unsurpassed I have my own insight into the very profound Law I have obtained what others could not obtain 
I now have complete understanding of what others should understand but that no one in the whole world has understood So I am called one with right awakening 
Afflictions are like enemies I have subdued them with the sword of my knowledge And so extolled in the world I am called superior 
I shall go to Vārāṇasī and beat the drum of the law of immortality I am without arrogance nor do I dwell upon fame nor do I seek for the happiness of any benefit 
Indeed I will propagate the Right Law and rescue suffering beings Because I have made a great solemn oath in the past I shall save those who are not yet saved 
The result of my oath will be accomplished now I will fulfill that previous vow a  When one has provided riches for oneself one is not extolled as a famous righteous person but if one benefits the whole world then one is called a great person 
If one does not bring rescue from drowning in the face of danger why would one be called a valiant person 
If he does not cure the sick how would he be called a good doctor 
If he sees someone who is lost but does not show him the way who would call him a good guide 
When for instance a lamp shines in the darkness it is a natural light for the unwitting When the Tathāgata lights the lamp of wisdom there is no feeling of desire 
When rubbing sticks one is sure to obtain fire In the sky wind is natural When digging in the ground one is sure to obtain water All this is reasonable and natural 
The accomplishment of the path by all munis is sure to occur in Gayā and they have also been turning the wheel of the Right Law in the land of Kāśi  The brahman Upaga said Ha in praise and amazement 
The Tathāgata gradually traveled ahead and reached the city of Kāśi The land was excellently adorned like the palace of akra ruler of the gods In the place where the two rivers the Ganges and the Vārāṇasī both flow trees flowers and fruits were luxuriant 
Birds and animals roamed together It was silent without any noisy commoners The ancient seers had dwelled there 
The Tathāgatas light was shining and doubled its brightness The son of the Kauṇḍinya family and the second one Daśabala Kāśyapa the third one called Vāṣpa the fourthAśvajit and the fifth one called Bhadrika had been practicing austerities rejoicing in the mountain forest 
Gautama is tainted by worldly happiness and he has abandoned any asceticism Now he returns here Do not rise to welcome him and do not do obeisance or make polite inquiries either providing him with what he needs b Chapter XV Because he has abandoned his former oath he should not receive any worship  
When a common person has a visitor he should perform a sequence of proprieties He should arrange for bedding and seating and make him feel at ease 
One offered to give up his seat and another took his garment and bowl for him One begged to wash his feet and another asked after his needs In such different ways they honored him and were of service as if to a teacher But they did not give up his family and still called him Gautama 
The Worldhonored One said to them Do not call me by my former surname and utter a contemptuous word for an arhat 
My mind is completely equal concerning respect or disrespect If you are not respectful in your heart it is you who will incur the blame 
Because a buddha can save the world one calls him a buddha 
He has an equal mind toward all beings thinking of them as his children as it were But to call him with his former name is like an offense of arrogance against ones father  
The Buddha had told them in his mercy with great compassion but they followed their foolish minds and did not believe his right awakening 
You say that in your previous practice of austerities you had not yet obtained anything Now that you have indulged in the pleasures of the body and mouth how could you have become a buddha  
With such doubts they did not believe that he had obtained the path of a buddha that he had completely achieved the meaning of the truth and was endowed with omniscience 
One may practice asceticism with an exhausted body but the mind will still rush on in confusion 
If one lights a lamp with water one will never remove the darkness One may try to develop the lamp of wisdom with an exhausted body but one will not be able to destroy foolishness 
If one wants fire with decayed wood one toils in vain and will not obtain it But if one rubs a stick and makes effort one may immediately obtain fire and use it 
In onessearch for the path one does not obtain the law of immortality through asceticism Attachment to desire is meaningless and foolishness is an impediment to the light of wisdom 
If one has a grave illness but does not eat the food that helps cure that illness how could the grave illness of ignorance be done away with while one is attached to desire 
If one sets fire to dry grass in the wilderness and it is increased by a fierce storm who could extinguish the blaze The same applies to the fire of greed 
I have left the two extremes My mind stays in the middle path All my suffering is finally appeased I am tranquil free from any error 
Right speech is my abode and I am on an excursion in the forest of right action Right livelihood is a rich disposition and application is the right road Right mindfulness is the city wall and concentration is bedding and seating The eightfold path is level and right the escape from the suffering of birth and death 
For those who embark on this road what they have to do will be completely achieved 
They will not fall into a painful fate in the two worlds yonder and here The three worlds are but a mass of suffering and only this path can extinguish it My pure eye of the Right Law formerly unheard of has fully seen the path of deliverance Yes I have for the first time given rise to it now 
Birth old age illness and death are suffering separation from what a Chapter XV one loves or meeting with enmity not attaining something one wants and so on are kinds of suffering If one renounces desire or does not yet renounce it has a body or is without a body if one is without any pure quality one may briefly say that all this is painful 
When for instance a great fire is appeased it does not give up its heat even though it may have become smaller Even in a self that is quiet and subtle by nature great suffering still exists The afflictions of greed and the others and all kinds of wrong actionsthese are the causes of suffering If one gives them up suffering is extinguished 
When for instance seeds are without earth water and so forth when all conditions are not combined shoots and leaves do not grow 
Existences continue by nature from heaven to the woeful destinations The wheel keeps turning and does not stop This is produced by desire Demotion differs according to weak intermediate or strong but all kinds of actions are the cause 
If one has extinguished greed and so forth there is no continuation of existence When all kinds of actions have ended different kinds of suffering know longlasting appeasement 
Absence of birth old age illness and death absence of earth water fire and wind and both absence of beginning middle and end and condemnation of a deceptive lawthese mean tranquility without end abodes of the noble 
The expounded eightfold right path and no other is the right means When the world does not see it are misled for a long time 
I know suffering and the annihilation of its accumulation I have realized its extinction and I have developed the right path I have contemplated these four truths and I have gained perfect awakening 
I tell you that I know suffering that I have annihilated its impure cause that I have caused the realization of its extinction and that I have developed the eightfold right path 
Knowing the four truths my pure eye of the Law was achieved When I had not yet brought about my universal eye concerning these four truths I was not called delivered 
I was not said to have done what b I had to do and it was not said that my complete understanding of the truth was accomplished 
Because I knew the truths I perceived that I was delivered I perceived that what had to be done was done and I perceived that I was perfectly awakened  
When he expounded this truth the son of the Kauṇḍinya family and the multitude of eighty thousand gods completely achieved true meaningfulness Free from any impurity they achieved the pure eye of the Law 
When the teacher of gods and humans knew that he had done what had to be done he rejoiced and asked with a lions roar Kauṇḍinya do you know yet Kauṇḍinya immediately said to the Buddha I know your Law great teacher  
Because he knew the Law he was called jñāta Kauṇḍinya Among Buddhas disciples he was the first to gain the highest insight 
As he knew the sound of the Right Law he heard the spirits of the earth all raise their voices and call out Splendid is the profound Law you have seen 
You Tathāgata have turned today what has never yet been turned For gods and humans everywhere you have widely opened the gate of immortality 
Pure morality is the spokes Selfdiscipline and quiet concentration are the axle cones Firm knowledge is the felloe and shame cleanses the axle hubs 
Right mindfulness is considered the hub completing the wheel of the True Law You are right having left the three worlds You will not fall back and follow a heterodox teacher  
When the spirits of the earth called out in this way the spirits in the sky transmitted the call The gods proceeded with praise which penetrated up to the Brahma Heaven 
The celestialspiritsin the three worlds heard the exposition of the great seer for the first time As it spread they were surprised and said to each other We have heard all around that the Buddha has appeared in the world 
For the kinds of living beings he widely turns the wheel of the Law of quietude  A breeze cleared the sky dissipating the mist and celestial flowers rained from the sky The gods played celestial music in praise of the wonder 
The Tathāgata then very skillfully caused them to enter the Right Law The first and last of the five bhikṣus obtained the path having subdued their faculties They were like the five stars in the sky attending the bright moon 
Then Yaśas the son of an elder from Kuśinagara woke up suddenly from his sleep at night and looked at his retinue men and women lying around naked and immediately felt disgusted at heart He thought this was the basis of affliction deceiving fools 
Wearing his ornaments girdle and necklaces he left his house and went to the mountain forest While seeking his way he called out Troubled I am troubled 
Confused The Tathāgata was walking up and down in the night and heard the voice calling out Troubled  He immediately said Welcome Here is a tranquil place Nirvana is utterly cool 
When Yaśas heard the Buddhas words he was very joyful in his heart Because of his previous revulsion noble wisdom opened up in a cool way As if having entered a cool pond reverently arrived where the Buddha was 
His person still had its common appearance but his mind had obtained the end of impurities Through the power of his previously planted wholesome roots he swiftly accomplished the fruition of arhatship 
His pure knowledge was going over both the hidden and the clear and after he had heard the Law he immediately obtained insight just as easy as it is to apply color to a fresh white fabric 
He had come to the realization that he had done what he had to do When he looked at his body which was still adorned he felt shame in his heart 
The Tathāgata knew what was on his mind and expounded the verses You are adorned with necklaces but your mind has subdued your faculties You impartially observe beings and in your practice of the Law you do not consider their appearance 
When on his body one wears the garment of someone who has gone forth but his mental bonds are not yet forgotten when he dwells in the forest yet covets worldly splendor is then a common person 
Even though he may apparently have a commoners deportment if his mind is fixed on the most eminent object and he lives at home in the same way as in a mountain forest he is free from any mine The undoing of the bonds exists in his mind 
How could his appearance give any certainty 
Wearing armor clothed in a heavy gown one is thought to be able to control a strong enemy A change in appearance wearing a dyed garment is to subdue the enemy of affliction  
then said Come bhikṣu and at these words his common appearance changed He was endowed with the deportment of someone who had gone forth and entirely became a śramaṇa 
Previously he had common companions fiftyfour in number Looking for their good friend they left home and subsequently entered the Right Law 
Because of their previous wholesome actions the fine fruition was now accomplished When something has been imbued with potash for a long while it quickly becomes bright on contact with water 
Hearers of superior behavior sixty arhats were all following the Law of the Arhat He courteously instructed them You have now crossed over to the other shore of the river of birth and death What you had to do is finished 
The suffering of beings burns and for a long time they have not had anyone come to their rescue You should each travel alone be merciful and receive them b Chapter XVI  
I shall go alone now too and return to Gaja Mountain There are great seers there royal seers and brahman seers They are all staying there honored by the whole world 
The Kāśyapa seers who practice asceticism the people of the land all serve them Those who receive their training are very numerous I shall go now and save them  
The sixty bhikṣus then accepted his instruction and widely propagated the Law In agreement with their previous causality they each went at will in different directions 
The Worldhonored One walked all alone to Gaja Mountain He entered the quiet forest of the Law and went to the seer Kāśyapa 
There was a cave where he made offerings to fire and an evil dragon dwelled there The mountain forest was utterly clear and nowhere would he be ill at ease but in order to convert the Worldhonored One spoke to him and asked for lodging 
Kāśyapa informed Buddha There is no place to stay There just is a cave to make offerings to fire The very pure may dwell there but an evil dragon lives there He can certainly hurt people  
The Buddha said Allow me and I will stay one night Kāśyapa made all kinds of excuses but the Worldhonored One kept asking 
Kāśyapa further said to Buddha In my heart I do not want to permit you  but you may think I am being ungenerous Therefore do as you wish  
The Buddha immediately entered the dwelling for fire  Sitting upright he practiced right consideration 
Then when the evil dragon saw the Buddha it became angry and let loose a poisonous fire The whole cave dwelling was ablaze but it did not touch the Buddhas body When it had been completely released the fire was extinguished by itself and the Worldhonored One still sat at ease 
When the fire of the eon arises and when the cave palace of Brahmadeva is ablaze King Brahma in the same way sits on this exact place unafraid and fearless 
When the evil dragon saw that the Worldhonored Ones bright countenance did not change poison stopped and wholesome thoughts arose He bowed and took refuge 
When Kāśyapa saw the light in the night he sighed Alas Astonishing Such a moral person but he is burned by the dragons fire  
Kāśyapa and his retinue all came to have a look in the morning The Buddha had subdued the evil dragon and had placed him in his bowl 
understood the Buddhas qualities and thought it was amazing Because he had been indulging in pride for a long time he said My path is most worthy  
The Buddha showed all kinds of supernatural transformations as were suited to the occasion As observed what was on his mind he transformed in response so that his mind became gentle and he was fit to be a vessel of the Right Law 
He became fully conscious that his path was shallow inferior to the Worldhonored Ones He decided to be humble of mind and courteously accepted the Right Law 
The five hundred disciples of Uruvilva Kāśyapa accepted the Right Law in due order as their teacher had been completely subdued 
After Kāśyapa and his multitude of followers had all accepted the right changes the seer threw into the water all the objects he had relied on and all implements to make fire offerings They were tossed about and carried away with the current 
His two younger brothers Nadī and Gaja  dwelled downstream When they saw the clothes and other items tumbling in disorder in the rivers current they thought had met with an awful fate 
They were fearful and ill at ease Their two groups of five hundred people searched the river and looked for the elder brother 
When they saw that the elder brother had gone forth along with his disciples they knew he had obtained a wonderful Law and were amazed Our elder brother has now submitted to the path 
We too must follow him The Worldhonored One expounded the Law to the three brothers and to their retinue of disciples and then presented a comparison to making a fire offering As the black smoke of foolishness rises and confused thoughts are brought about rubbing a stick the fires of desire and anger burn beings 
The fire of such afflictions burns ceaselessly c Chapter XVI  One is engulfed in birth and death but the fire of suffering is constantly ablaze 
One can see the two kinds of fire but while one is burning one is without any support Why would a person with high aspirations not bring forth disgust 
Disgust removes desire When greed has ended one obtains deliverance If one has obtained deliverance understanding from deliverance arises 
Observing the flow of birth and death I have begun my pure conduct When all that one must do is done one will no longer experience a later existence  
When those thousand bhikṣus heard the Worldhonored Ones exposition of the Law no impurity arose and their minds were all delivered 
When Buddha had expounded the Law to the Kāśyapas and their thousand bhikṣus what they had to do was done and they were well adorned with pure wisdom The entire meritorious retinue purified their actions with generosity and morality 
As the reverend seers followed their way the forest of asceticism lost its splendor just as someone who has lost the virtue of morality is merely living in futility 
The Worldhonored One and his great retinue went to the city of Rājagṛha He remembered the king of Magadha and the solemn oath he had previously made 
After the Worldhonored One arrived he stayed in the Yaṣṭivana When King Bimbisāra heard this he went together with his great retinue to where the Worldhonored One was followed by men and women from the whole country 
From afar he saw the Tathāgata sitting with a subdued mind and subdued faculties He had done away with any common expression descended from his chariot and advanced on foot just as akra ruler of the gods approached King Brahmadeva 
He advanced and bowed deep at the Buddhas feet He respectfully asked after the Buddhas wellbeing When the Buddha had in turn reassured him he ordered him to sit down at one side 
The king then silently thought in his heart The ākya has an awesome power The Kāśyapas with their excellent qualities are all his disciples now a  
The Buddha knew others thoughts and asked Kāśyapa What meritorious gain did you see when you abandoned the practice of making offerings to fire  
When Kāśyapa heard the Buddhas request he was startled and rose in front of the great multitude He knelt on his right knee held his palms together and informed the Buddha in a clear voice When one develops merit making offerings to the spirit of fire the fruition in any case means that the wheel keeps turning In births and deaths afflictions increase 
That is why I have abandoned it When one strenuously makes offerings to fire to seek for the objects of the five desires the desires one experiences increase without end That is why I have abandoned it 
Making offerings to fire and practicing the method of incantations one experiences rebirth but no deliverance Experiencing rebirth is the basis of suffering That is why I have given it up further seeking contentment 
I once thought that asceticism offering sacrifices and arranging for a great gathering were foremost and of the highest excellence but these still go against the right path 
That is why I have abandoned now further seeking excellent tranquility Freedom from birth old age illness and death is a cool place without end 
Because I know this is meaningful I have abandoned the practice of making offerings to fire  
The Worldhonored One heard Kāśyapas explanation about the facts he understood and wanting to make the whole world all around give rise to thoughts of pure faith he said to Kāśyapa Welcome great person Having distinguished all kinds of paths you follow the most excellent path 
In front of the great multitude show your excellent qualities now  just like an elder with huge riches shows his precious treasures Let the poor suffering beings increase their thoughts of disgust  
I will follow your instruction In front of the great multitude immediately controlled himself and entered right mindfulness He swiftly rose into the sky He walked up and down stayed sat or lay down or his whole body was like a cave Left and right he emitted fire and water but was not burned b Chapter XVI nor did he become wet 
From his body came clouds and rain and thunder and lightning moved heaven and earth The whole world all looked up at him and indulging their eyes they watched tirelessly 
With different mouths but with the same sound they extolled the wonder 
Only then did he control his divine power and respectfully did obeisance at the Worldhonored Ones feet 
You Buddha are my great teacher and I am your disciple Following your instructions I have made this behavior known 
What I had to do is finished  As the whole world all around had seen this and knowing that Kāśyapa was disciple they were certain and knew that the Worldhonored One was truly omniscient 
The Buddha knew that the whole gathering was a fit vessel to receive the Law He said to King Bimbisāra Listen very carefully now 
The mind and the faculties all these have the law of birth and extinction The understanding that birth and extinction are wrong is a universal observation 
Such a universal observation means that one understands the body Understanding that the body has the law of birth and extinction one is without grasping and without experiencing 
Know the body and its faculties as a mental conception without any I or mine simply a mass of suffering born as suffering and extinguished as suffering 
Having understood that corporal characteristics are without any I or mine one goes to the highest pure place without end 
The afflictions view of a self and so on bind every world After one has seen the absence of any I or mine all bonds are undone 
One is bound by the view of untruth but viewing the truth one is delivered If the world is in the grasp of precepts it is in the grasp of what is wrong 
If one had a self it would be either permanent or impermanent The view of the two extremes in birth and death that error is the greatest and even worse 
If it were impermanent ones practice would be fruitless and as c one would not experience a later existence one would be delivered without any effort 
If it were permanent without death rebirth or an inbetween  it would be the same as space without birth and without extinction 
If there were a self it would be the same for all and as all would have a self without any action its fruition might be naturally accomplished 
If there were the activity of a self one should not earnestly practice 
If a self were permanent in principle it would not allow any change Seeing that one is characterized by suffering and happiness how could one say it is permanent 
By understanding that one comes into existence one is delivered and becomes free from any impurity If all were permanent what would be the use of being delivered from it 
Absence of a self is not just a word The principle is true that it has no true nature Not seeing that the self causes anything how could one explain that a self is active 
Because the self does not cause anything and one is without a causing selfbecause one is without these two thingsin reality there is no self 
Without one who causes or one who experiences and without a ruler one constantly returns Birth and death keep flowing like night and day Listen to my explanation now 
Through the causality of the six faculties and their six objects six consciousnesses arise The three things in combination produce contact Awareness volition and action subsequently proceed 
When dried herbs are placed under a convex gem fire is then produced by the sun As for the faculties their objects and the consciousnesses a personality is produced in the same way 
A shoot grows because of a seed but the seed is not the shoot Not exactly like that yet not different beings come into existence in the same way  
When the Worldhonored One had explained the truth the universal and highest meaning King Bimbisāra was joyful 
When the kings retinue the population and the numerous spirits had heard the explanation of the law of immortality they too were subsequently free from any impurity 
Chapter XVII Conversion of the Great Disciples  Then when King Bimbisāra bowed and invited the Worldhonored One to come live in the Veṇuvana he felt merciful and kept silent 
After the king had seen the truth he paid his respects to and returned to his palace The Worldhonored One and his great multitude changed their residence and stayed in the Veṇuvana 
He established the light of the lamp of wisdom in order to save living beings He dwelled there with those of the brahma abodes with those of the celestial abodes and with those of the abodes of the noble 
Then as Aśvajit had subdued his thoughts and controlled his faculties and as it was time to go on almsrounds he entered the city of Rājagṛha 
His complexion was outstanding in the world and his demeanor was at ease and dignified All the men and women in the city were joyful when they saw him Passersby stopped coming forward to welcome him or following behind him 
The seer Kapila had saved many disciples but the most excellent and learned among them was called āriputra 
When he saw the dignity of the bhikṣu  who having quieted his faculties had a quiet and refined bearing paused and waited for him to approach He raised his hand and asked Your youthfulness and quiet bearingI have never seen such 
What exquisite law did you obtain and which teacher do you serve as his principles 
Who has expounded your teachers teaching 
Please tell me and settle my doubts  
The bhikṣu was pleased with questions and humbly answered with a serene countenance He is endowed with omniscience born in the excellent family of Ikṣvāku He is most excellent among gods and humans He is my great teacher 
Because my age is young my time of study is still limited How could I propagate the very profound and subtle meanings of my great teacher 
With my shallow knowledge I will now briefly explain the Law taught by my teacher 
The arising of any existing factor comes from causality The factors in birth and extinction may all be extinguished the exposition of the path is the means  
As Upatiṣya the twiceborn heard this his mind knew inner harmony He was free from any impurity and his pure eye of the Law arose 
What he had previously practiced assuredly was the the knower of the cause and the uncaused All was inactive all coming from the god śvara 
When had made the Law of causality known the knowledge that there is no self was clear All afflictions strong or weakno one had been able to finally do away with them 
Only through the teaching of the Tathāgata were they forever ended leaving nothing behind It is not the case that by being in the grasp of any mine one can be free from a self 
Light appears because of the sun or a lamp But what can cause the absence of light 
If one cuts down the stalk of the lotus its fine fibers are still connected 
But the Buddhas teaching does away with affliction as if it were completely annihilated by a rock 
respectfully did obeisance at the bhikṣus feet then withdrew and returned home 
After the bhikṣu had begged for alms he returned to the Veṇuvana too 
In the distance he saw āriputra his countenance and deportment very joyful He said When I see you now your expression is different than usual Your ordinary disposition is quite serious but now your joyful appearance is obvious You have certainly obtained the law of immortality 
This appearance is not without cause  
answered with what the Tathāgata had said 
Invited to explain it he immediately did so to  When had heard it his mind c Chapter XVII opened up All impurity was removed too and he subsequently produced the eye of the Right Law 
As the fine fruition of a cause they had long ago planted they observed as it were a lamp in their hands They attained unshakable faith in the Buddha 
Both went to where the Buddha was together with a crowd of followers two hundred and fifty disciples The Buddha saw the two worthies from afar and said to his multitude The two who are coming will be my chief disciples The wisdom of the one will be peerless and the supernatural power of the other will be the highest  
He immediately announced in his profoundly pleasant and pure voice Welcome Here is the law of purity Having gone forth you may completely achieve its path  
In their hands they held tridents they had twisted locks and carried pitchers for cleansing When they heard Buddhas welcoming voice they immediately changed into śramaṇas 
The two teachers and their disciples all adopted the deportment of bhikṣus They bowed at the Worldhonored Ones feet withdrew and sat to one side He courteously expounded the Law to them and they all obtained the path of arhatship 
At that time there was a twiceborn one the bright lamp of the Kāśyapa family He was learned and endowed with the physical marks His riches were abundant and his wife was utterly worthy  but he had given them up and had gone forth earnestly searching for the path of deliverance 
On his way he approached the Bahuputraka Shrine and unexpectedly met ākyamuni whose bright deportment manifested his brilliance like a banner when bringing sacrifices to the gods 
Reverently his whole person was respectful made obeisance and bowed at his feet You worthy one are my great teacher I am your disciple 
For a very long time I have been accumulating the darkness of delusion Please bring me the light of your lamp  
The Buddha knew that the twiceborn one was joyful in his heart holding deliverance in high esteem In his pure and soft voice he welcomed  
Upon hearing the command was relieved at heart and the fatigue of his body and spirit was alleviated His mind was a fixed on excellent deliverance and he was quiet free from any impurity 
As befitting great compassion gave a brief explanation He understood all profound factors and accomplished the four unhindered analytical knowledges  Because his great virtue was renowned everywhere he was called Mahākāśyapa 
He had formerly seen the body and a self as different or believed that the self is the body The view of an existing self and mine was forever done away with He saw only a mass of suffering When free from suffering there is nothing left 
Keeping the precepts and practicing asceticism were no cause but they had been viewed as a cause He universally saw the nature of suffering and was forever free from clinging to anything 
Whether seeing existence or nonexistence the two views give rise to doubtfulness but universally seeing the truth he was certain free from any doubt 
Profoundly attached to riches and beauty one is infatuated and desire arises but with their impermanence and the notion of their impurity one is forever without covetousness 
With a mind of friendliness he thought in an impartial way He did not think of friend and foe differently As he felt compassion for all he had dispelled the poison of anger 
Relying on matter all was remedied and all kinds of various notions arose As his reflection destroyed all notions of matter he could put a stop to desire for matter 
Even if he was born among the gods of no form their lives still would certainly come to an end In their foolishness about the four attainments they had the notion that meant deliverance Tranquil and free from any notion his covetousness for the immaterial was forever removed 
Restless thoughts are disturbing just like a strong wind whipping up the waves He deeply entered firm concentration and quieted his excited mind 
He contemplated that factors have no mine and that in birth and extinction they are not solid Not seeing any weak intermediate or strong his arrogant thoughts were naturally forgotten 
Having lit the lamp of wisdom he was free from any darkness of delusion He saw the law of destruction and absence of destruction and absolutely nothing remained of his ignorance 
Considering the ten qualities the ten kinds of affliction were extinguished  He was at rest having done what he had to do Deeply moved gazed at the Honored Ones countenance 
Free from the three and having obtained three  the three disciples had removed the three  Like the three stars lined up in the Trāyastrimśa Heaven waiting upon the thirtyfive  the three attended the Buddha in the same way b Chapter XVIII The Conversion of Anāthapiṇḍada  
Then there was an important elder called Anāthapiṇḍada He was enormously wealthy and his riches were countless but he freely gave donations saving the poor 
He came from far to the north from the country of Kośala and was staying in the home of a good friend His host was called ūla 
When he heard that the Buddha had appeared in the world and was staying nearby in the Veṇuvana he went to the grove that very night having received his name and full esteem for his virtues 
The Tathāgata knew that his faculties were mature and that his pure faith had arisen As fitting he called him by his real name and expounded the Law to him 
You have given up your sleep to come and salute me 
Today I will fully perform my initial duty of hospitality to you 
The basis of the virtue you have planted in the past makes my pure expectations firm Your joy upon hearing the Buddhas name makes you fit to be a vessel for the Right Law 
When one widely practices kindness in an impartial manner and provides for the poor all around ones famous virtue becomes widely renowned 
I shall now practice the gift of the Law giving earnestly and sincerely Then I will give the gift of quietude 
Fully keep pure morality Morality is an ornament It can change the woeful destinations and it allows one to ascend to heaven bringing the reward of the celestial five happinesses 
Any aspiration means great suffering and desire accumulates all wrongs 
Know that the suffering of old age illness and death is the greatest calamity in the world Through right contemplation of the world one leaves birth old age illness and death 
You have seen that humans have the suffering of old age illness and death The same applies to rebirth in heaven There is no one who permanently stays 
The impermanent means suffering and the painful is without a self What is painful in impermanence is not a self How could there be an I or mine 
Know that the painful is nothing but suffering When it is accumulated it is a cause The extinction of suffering means quietude and the path is the place of tranquility 
Disgusted with the end and trying to block its origin one may not wish for any existence or nonexistence 
The great fires of birth old age and death are burning all around in the world Seeing that birth and death is unsteady one should develop freedom from its notion Samādhi completely achieves the quiet place of immortality Empty and without I or minethe whole world is like an illusion 
When the elder heard the exposition of the Law he immediately obtained the first fruition  The sea of birth and death was eliminated There was just one drop left 
 It is better to be truly delivered by seeing the truths now as a common person 
If one is not free from the suffering of the formations and from the net of all kinds of strange views one does not see the meaning of the truth even though one may reach the highest existence 
When the elder heard the exposition of the Law the darkness of obscuration opened up in a bright way He consequently c Chapter XVIII obtained the right view and all wrong views were forever removed just as a strong autumn wind scatters heavy clouds 
He did not consider śvara as the cause for the production of the world nor was it the case that it was produced by a wrong cause neither was it uncaused 
If were produced by śvara there would be no old or young first or last There would be no wheel of the five destinations The born would not be extinguished 
And there would be no calamities Doing evil would not be wrong Pure or impure actions would come from the god śvara 
If the world were produced by the god śvara he would not be doubted just as the son is produced by the father Who would not be conscious of his honored one 
When one met with suffering one would not on the other hand resent the god All would honor śvara and would serve no other spirit 
If śvara were the maker he would not be called Sovereign But as a maker he would constantly have to produce If he were constantly producing he would himself toil 
Why then call him Sovereign 
He would either produce unwittingly as the action of an infant or produce intentionally If he had the intention he would not be sovereign If suffering or happiness came from beings then these are not made by śvara 
If śvara produces suffering or happiness he would have love or hate Because he would have love or hate he should not be called Sovereign  
Confiding in his sovereign power what would be the use of practicing good 
One just might practice good or evil but would not have the retribution of the action If sovereignty were produced by actions all would be actions in common  
If śvara were uncaused all would be nonexistent too 
If he would rely on anothersovereign then the number ofsovereigns would be without end That is why beings all have no maker 
Know that the meaningfulness of a sovereign is destroyed in this discussion All meanings are mutually contradicted If there is no explanation there is an error 
a  If furthermore a specific nature were to produce the error would be the same Those who understand the theories of causality have never given such explanation 
One could have things that are made without any basis or cause but they all come from a cause as if relying on a seed 
Therefore know that nothing is produced by a specific nature All that is made is not just produced by one cause But because one specific nature is mentioned it is not the cause 
Or one says that the specific nature completely fills all places If it were to completely fill all there would be no maker or that which is made And if there is no maker or that which is made it is not a cause 
If it were in all places and all would have a maker it would be the case then that at all times constantly there is something being made 
If one mentions a constant maker there would be no waiting for the right time to produce an object Therefore know that it is not the case that a specific nature is the cause 
When they further explain that this specific nature is free from any attributes  all things that are made should be free from attributes too 
But all the worldly is seen to possess attributes 
Therefore know that the specific nature again is no cause If one explains that the specific nature is different from an attribute its nature should not be different since one would consider something permanent as cause Because beings are different from their attributes the specific nature is no cause 
If the specific nature were permanent things would not be destroyed Considering the specific nature to be a cause cause and effect would in principle be the same 
If it were caused by a specific nature one would notseek deliverance Asit would have a specific nature it would allow its birth and extinction Even if one had obtained deliverance the specific nature would yet produce bonds 
If the specific nature wasinvisible but wasthe cause for visible factors it would not yet be a cause because cause and effect would in principle be different For all visible things in the world both cause and effect are visible 
b Chapter XVIII  If a specific nature were unwitting it would not be the cause of something with an intention Just as upon seeing smoke one knows of the fire cause and effect are mutually dependent 
It is not the case that the cause is invisible but that it would produce something visible When for instance gold is made into vessels and robes throughout they are not separate from gold If the specific nature were a cause for something why would it be different throughout 
If time were a maker one should not seek for deliverance Because time is permanent one should let time be The world would be endless and the same would apply to time And so a practitioner should not apply himself to it and strive 
Entities and attributesthe world discusses them as being the same or different Even though there are several kinds of theories know that they are not one cause 
If one says that a self is active it should produce according to ones wishes yet it now does not follow ones wishes Why would one say a self is active 
What one does not want is still obtained and what one wants on the other hand is still disregarded As suffering and happiness are not sovereign why say that a self is active 
If a self were active one would be without any action for a woeful destination Because several kinds of results of an action are produced one knows that it is not the case that a self is active 
One might say that a self is active complying with the occasion but in response to an occasion it would do only what is good Because good and evil are caused by conditions one knows that it is not the case that a self is active 
If absence of a cause were active one should not develop application As all would be spontaneously fixed why would one develop any cause 
With several kinds of actions in the world one obtains several kinds of results Therefore know that all is not made as uncaused With or without any intention all arises from causes and conditions 
No factor in the world is produced uncaused  
His meritorious virtue and fame are renowned He is honored near and far I do wish to establish a pure abode 
I do wish you would mercifully accept it I know that in your mind O Buddha is equal You do not seek comfort where you dwell but may you not disregard my invitation out of sympathy for beings  
The Buddha knew the elders intention A great donation would now be made Untainted and unattached he skillfully guarded the intention of beings 
One should quickly donate it When for instance ones treasury burns down what has been taken out is precious A bright person knows about impermanence and by donating his riches he extensively practices kindness 
The stingy are parsimonious They do not enjoy for fear of its extinction and they are not afraid of impermanence Simple loss increases their mournfulness 
When donating at the right time and to a proper recipient one is like a vigorous man facing an enemy Able in generosity and able in battle he is a valiant and wise person 
One who donates is loved by all He is well praised and widely renowned The virtuous are happy to be his friend and when his life ends his thoughts are always joyful 
Free from regret and fear he is not reborn in the destination of hungry ghosts Here he is recompensed with flowers but his fruition is hard to conceive 
While revolving in the six destinations no finer companion surpasses generosity If one is reborn among gods or humans one is served by all 
Reborn in the animal destination generosity is recompensed and one will accordingly experience happiness Even though one may obtain the path of immortality when ones wisdom has developed quiet concentration and when one is without support a Chapter XVIII and without counting on anything  it is completed through the donation of resources Because of ones generosity one develops the eight mindfulnesses of a great person 
Following the mindfulnesses one has joyful thoughts and certainly gains samādhi As samādhi increases wisdom one can correctly contemplate birth and extinction Having correctly contemplated birth and extinction one in due order obtains deliverance 
If one is generous giving up ones riches one does away with attachment If one is compassionate and gives reverentially one completely removes jealousy and pride One clearly sees the result of generosity but without generosity one is deluded and insight is done away with The extinction of all fetters and afflictionsthis comes from generosity 
Know that generosity is a cause for deliverance Just as someone grows plants or flowers and fruits for their shade the same applies to generosity The happiness of its reward is great nirvana 
When riches which are not solid are donated the reward one obtains is a solid fruition When donating food yes one gains strength and when donating clothing one obtains beauty When one establishes a pure abode all fruitions are fully accomplished 
Some donate seeking the five desires and some wish for greater riches Some donate for fame There are those who seek the happiness of rebirth in heaven Some want to avoid poverty 
You came deluded and with desire in your heart but you will return after the eye of purity has opened up  The elder accepted the Buddhas instruction and his generous mind became increasingly clear 
He invited Upatiṣya his worthy friend to return with him When he had gone back to Kośala he went all around to choose a fine site 
He saw the garden of Crown Prince Jeta the grove and the streams utterly clear and quiet b  He went to the crown prince and asked for permission to buy the grounds 
The crown prince greatly valued the place and at first did not have any intention to sell 
If you were to cover it entirely with gold still the land would not be given The elder with joy in his heart immediately spread out gold all around Jeta said I will not allow it 
Why do you spread out all this gold The elder said If you will not permit it why did you say to cover with gold  
As both men contended thus they went to the magistrate to decide the matter 
All sighed thinking that it was amazing and Jeta too knew that was sincere Having made extensive inquiries about his reasons it was said that He will establish a pure abode and offer it to the Tathāgata and the order of bhikṣus  
When the crown prince heard the Buddhas name his mind immediately understood He accepted only half the gold and peacefully negotiating they established together 
Let us together bring offerings to the Buddhayou the land and I the grove The elder handed over the land to āriputra and Jeta the grove planned and began construction of a pure abode Night and day they worked and it was quickly completed was prominent and excellently adorned like the palace of the four celestial kings 
They followed the rules and complied with the propriety of the path in accord with what was fitting for a Tathāgata A wonder in the world the place increased the brilliance of the city of rāvastī Asthe Tathāgata showed his divine shelter all noble ones gathered for the summer retreat The one without attendants mercifully descended and having attendants the contributed to the propriety of the path 
Because of this merit the elder ascended to heaven when his life ended His sons and grandsons continued his inheritance planting the field of merit for generations 
c Chapter XIX The Meeting of Father and Son  The Buddha converted all kinds of people of different paths in the land of Magadha They all followed the unique Law just as the sun is reflected by the stars 
He left the city of the five mountains together with a thousand disciples Surrounded by his retinue he went to the gilded mountains 
Approaching Kapilavastu he wished to show his gratitude I will offer the Law to serve the king my father  
The royal preceptor and the chief minister had sent ahead some scouts to investigate the attendents presence and observe advance 
When they knew that the Buddha wanted to return to his country they hurried to inform in advance The Crown Prince has traveled far to study His wish has been fulfilled 
He is returning now The king was overjoyed on hearing this He adorned his carriage and immediately left to welcome  The whole country nobles and commoners all followed the king 
Gradually approaching he saw the Buddha from a distance His appearance was twice as bright as in the past Among his great multitude the Buddha was like King Brahmadeva 
descended from his chariot and slowly advanced careful not to make any difficulty concerning the right of way Gazing at the Buddhas countenance he felt delighted but did not know what to say 
Being covetous dwelled among the bonds of the common but his son had surpassed that and had ascended to become a seer Although his son was among worthies of the path did not know by what name to call him 
considered that he had been longing for this for a long time yet now he did not know how to make a pronouncement His son sat in silence was tranquil and his expression did not change 
Absence of affection after a long separation makes my heart lonely and sad Suppose for instance someone who has been thirsting in vain comes across a cool spring on his way 
He hurries to drink from it but when he approaches the spring it is unexpectedly dry Now I see that you my son still have your former bright appearance but your mind is distant and your manner remote without any hidden impulses 
While you restrain your feelings my vain hopes are dashed just as encountering a dry spring when thirsty 
When I did not see you multiple thoughts rushed on but when I look you in the eye there is no joy just as when someone who has been remembering a distant dear one suddenly sees his painted image 
You should rule the four worlds just like King Māndhātṛ but you now go begging for alms What splendor would this path have 
You are as tranquil as Sumeru and your bright appearance is as bright as the sun You walk with the dignified step of an ox king with the roar of a fearless lion but you do not accept the fiefdom of the four gods You support yourself begging for alms  
The Buddha knew that in the mind of the king his father there still existed the notion that he was his son In order to open up his mind and also out of mercy for the entire crowd he rose in the sky through his supernatural power and with both hands held up the sun and moon He wandered through the sky and made all kinds of transformations He divided himself into countless bodies and united again in one  
The king his father was overjoyed and his feelings of father and son were all done away with Seated on a lotus in the sky expounded the Law to the king I know that your heart O king is kind Because of me your son your grief has increased 
You are bound by love for your son but you should quickly remove that Stop your love quiet your thoughts and accept that I your son cares for the Law a Chapter XIX  That which other sons have never offered I offer this now to the king my father 
That which a father has never received from a son you will now obtain from your son Amazing for a human king and wonderful for a celestial king the exquisite path of immortality I now offer this to you great king Any specific action is an action for rebirth 
The basis of an action causes its fruition Know about the cause and effect of an action Diligently develop actions to cross over the worldly When one carefully contemplates the world only action is ones good friend 
Relatives and oneself with deep affection they long for one another But when life stops the spirit goes on alone Only the good friend action follows 
As the wheel revolves in the five destinations ones three actions are produced by the three  But craving is their cause while all kinds of species are different 
You must exert yourself now and purify your corporal and verbal actions Diligently practice night and day Appease your confused mind and become quiet Only this will benefit oneself 
Without this there is nothing for me Know that the existences of the three worlds are like the waves of the sea 
They are difficult to enjoy and hard to attend to You should practice the fourth action  In birth and death the wheel of the five destinationsturnslike the stars 
As even the gods change how could one obtain permanence among humans 
Nirvana is the greatest happiness and the quiet of meditation is the most excellent among pleasures 
The happiness of the five desires of a human king is dangerous fraught with fear As if dwelling with poisonous snakes how could one have an instant of joy 
A bright person sees the world as if he were surrounded by a great fire His fear is extraordinary and he does not have any contentment even for a little while He seeks to leave birth old age and death 
The place of quietude without end is where a wise one dwells One does not need sharp weapons elephants horses and troops with chariots Having subdued greed anger and delusion there are no more enemies in the world b  
Know suffering and annihilate the cause of suffering Realize its extinction and develop the means Through right awakening to the four truths ones fear of a woeful destination is removed  
The previous display of fine divine power had made the kings heart joyful His feelings of resolute faith were already profound and he was fit to be a vessel for the Right Law He held his palms together and said in praise Wondrous is the accomplishment of the result of your solemn oath 
Wondrous is the benefit for me Even though increased my grief I have obtained benefit because of the sadness Today is a wondrous day for me The fruition for having given birth to a son is accomplished 
It was proper to reject exquisite happiness It was proper to strenuously practice austerities It was proper to forsake the splendor of your family It was proper to give up feelings of love 
The seer kings of old suffered greatly but without any merit In a pure and tranquil place you have now obtained all At ease yourself and putting others at ease your great compassion saves beings 
Those who in the past once dwelled in the world as wheelturning kings did not have any sovereign divine power that could open up my mind and neither did they have this fine Law which makes me joyful today 
If you were a wheelturning king the cycle of births and deaths would not end Now you are spared from birth and death and the great suffering of the turning of the wheel is extinguished You widely and ably expound the law of immortality for the kinds of beings 
Such is your divine power and your wisdom is extremely profound and extensive You have forever extinguished the suffering of birth and death and are the highest among gods and humans 
Even if you had occupied the position of a noble king I would never have obtained this benefit  
Having spoken such praise love of the Law increased his reverence Though he occupied the worthy position of king and father he humbly bowed and made obeisance  
When the whole population in the land observed the Buddhas divine power when they heard his exposition of the profound fine Law and saw their kings reverence c Chapter XIX  they held their palms together and made deep obeisance and all thought that it was wonderful Weary of staying in their common bonds they all produced the thought of going forth 
The princes of the ākya lineage gained insight into the path coming to fruition They all became weary of the happiness of worldly prosperity gave up their relatives and went forth 
nanda Nanda Kṛmila Aniruddha Nanda and Upananda and also Kuṇṭhadhāna Such chiefs and also other sons of the ākya lineage all followed the Buddhas teaching They accepted the Law and became his disciples 
The son of the chief minister who puts the country straight Udāyin and others subsequently went forth together with the princes 
Furthermore when the son of Atri called Upāli saw that the princes and the son of the chief minister had gone forth he was moved in his heart his affections opened up and he accepted the law of going forth 
When the king the father had seen the divine power and qualities of his son he too entered the clear stream himself the gate of the Right Law of immortality 
He gave up his royal throne and his land and was succeeded by Amṛtodana  Residing in solitude practiced quietude Dwelling in the palace he practiced like a royal seer 
After the Tathāgata had subsequently received all his own family and good friends his countenance was kindly as he went on his way and his relatives joyfully followed him 
When the time had come to go begging for alms entered Kapilavastu The men and women in the city were pleasantly surprised and called out in raised voices  
In the doors and windows they stood shoulder to shoulder 
In sidelong glances they saw the primary and secondary marks of the Buddhas body and the light was very bright Outwardly wore a kāṣāya garment but the brightness of his body inwardly had a penetrating shine just as the round disk of the sun casts its light both inside and outside a  Those who observed this felt sadness and joy in their hearts 
They saw that the Buddha was walking in a dignified way his appearance restrained and with controlled faculties his fine figure manifested the meaningfulness of the Law They were startled and their sad sighing increased By taking tonsure he has ruined the loveliness of his appearance and his body is covered with a colored garment 
His deportment and refined appearance are stately With selfcontrol he proceeds gazing at the ground 
His head should bear a feathered crown and he should hold the reins of a flying dragon Why must he brave the floating dust and go begging with a bowl in his hand 
Why does he turn his splendid countenance downward restraining his mind and controlling his appearance and having given up desire and fine clothes wear a dyed garment on his unadorned body What sign did he see and what does he seek He has become an enemy of the five worldly desires 
He has given up his worthy wife and his dear son and wanders alone happy all by himself Difficult indeed it is for that worthy consort For a long time she has been feeling sorrow and now she hears that has gone forth 
We are wondering whether King uddhodana will ever see his son 
He has seen his finelooking figure but has gone forth ruining his appearance An enemy may yet be more bitterly regretted but when his father sees  how could he be all right 
His dear son Rāhula is in tears and feels a constant longing Does not think of soothing him when he sees him because he has applied himself to this path 
All those who understand the way of signs have said that when the Crown Prince was born he was endowed with the signs of a great person that he would enjoy the four seas 
But contemplating what he has done now that was all empty talk b Chapter XIX  
Such among many others were their confused and disorderly pronouncements 
But the Tathāgatas mind was unattached without any delight or grief In his compassion he felt sympathy for the beings and wished to free them from their poverty He increased their wholesome roots and for the sake of the future world he showed them the path of little desire and removed the mist of common impurity 
He entered a poor neighborhood and begged for alms fine or coarse whatever he could obtain He did not single out any family big or small and his bowl full he returned to the mountain forest 
Chapter XX Acceptance of the Jetavana Pure Abode  After the Worldhonored One had converted the people of Kapilavastu and when their salvation had been completed according to circumstances he went on his way together with his great multitude He went to the land of Kośala to King Prasenajit 
The Jetavana had been decorated and its halls and dwellings were all fully prepared Its streams and springs poured forth and all the flowers and fruits were blossoming Many wondrous birds in the water and on land flocked together according to their kind and sang harmoniously many charms were matchless in the world just like the palace of Mount Kailāsa 
The elder Anāthapiṇḍada and his retinue welcomed the Buddha and his multitude as they were seeking their way They scattered flowers burned famous incense and invited them to enter the Jetavana 
With his golden dragonpitcher in his hand knelt and poured superior water and offered the Jetavana pure abode to the order of the ten directions 
The Worldhonored One accepted with the solemn wish May your country be in peace making it safe for a long time May your good fortune O Elder Anāthapiṇḍada increase without end  
When King Prasenajit heard that the Worldhonored One had arrived he then adorned his carriage and left for the Jetavana He bowed at the Worldhonored Ones feet He withdrew and sat to one side held his palms together and said to Buddha I had not imagined that great good fortune would unexpectedly come to my small country 
Now that I have seen your noble countenance may I bathe in and c drink from your bright grace 
Even though I dwell among the common I have met with the noble one entering his excellent stream When for instance the wind passes through a fragrant forest it becomes a perfumed eddy in combination with the air When the birds come together on Sumeru their different colors all adjust to its golden light 
When one has met with a bright person one becomes equally splendid upon receiving his shelter When the countryman brought worship to the seer he was reborn as the constellation Triśaṅku 
All worldly gain comes to an end but your noble benefit is forever without end A human king has many faults but when he meets a noble one his benefit is permanent contentment  
The Buddha knew that the kings mind was earnest and that he would find happiness in the Law like Lord akra But he still had two kinds of attachments he could not forget about riches and female beauty 
Knowing it was the right time and knowing his mental behavior expounded the Law to the king When an evildoer a lowly person sees good he still feels respect 
How much more then would a sovereign king who has accumulated merit availing of his past causality To have greater reverence upon meeting the Buddhathis is not difficult 
When the land is quiet and its people content meeting the Buddha does not increase these 
I shall now briefly expound the Law Listen carefully great king Accept my exposition and see the result of my merits 
When life has ended the body and the spirit are separated and ones relatives are all separated There are only the wholesome and evil actions that throughout follow one like a shadow 
When you hold the actions of a righteous king in high esteem and when you care for all people in the present world your fame will spread and at your lifes end you will ascend to heaven 
If you indulge your feelings and do not comply with the Law you suffer now and later you will be without joy 
In ancient times King Kṛśāśva complied with the Law and experienced celestial good fortune King Nikumbha performed evil and when his life ended he was reborn in a woeful destination a Chapter XX  
I have now briefly expounded the Law about good and evil to you great king As a great requirement you must be kind at heart Observe your people as you would an only child 
Do not harass or injure and control your faculties well Reject the wrong path and take the right road Do not elevate yourself and put down others 
Be a friend of ascetics and do not frequent friends who hold wrong views Do not rely on your royal power and do not listen to artful talk Do not trouble any ascetic and do not transgress the code of royal rule Be mindful of the Buddha and consider his Right Law 
When for instance someone likes sweet fruit he should plant fine saplings 
There are those who from brightness enter darkness and there are those who from darkness enter brightness There are those whose one darkness is continued by another darkness and there are those whose one brightness is cause for another brightness 
A wise one must reject three categories and throughout apply himself to brightness 
When one speaks evil all echo it but when good is being called out those who go along have difficulties There is nothing that does not cause fruition and what one has caused is not lost If one undertakes something but is not diligent one will in the end be unable to do anything 
If one did not once develop wholesome causality one will later bring about a period without happiness Having gone there will be no period of rest Therefore one should develop what is wholesome 
Just as beings have no place to escape when the four rocky mountains come together beings have no way to do away with the mountains of birth old age illness and death 
Only those who practice the Right Law escape these heavy mountains of suffering 
All the worldly is impermanent The objects of the five desires are like lightning  Old age and death are the sharp ends of an awl Why would one practice what is wrong 
The excellent kings of old were like the god śvara They were valiant and determined to conquer the sky but having been illustrious for a while they were ruined 
The fire of the eon will melt Sumeru and the waters of the sea will all dry up All the less may ones body which is like a bubble hope to stay long in the world 
A fierce wind may be stopped by a violent whirlwind  sunshine may be screened off by Sumeru and a great fire may be extinguished by water All existing things turn to extinction 
This body is an impermanent object painstakingly guarded for a long time One extensively enjoys riches and female beauty with it and in ones negligence one becomes proud 
When the moment of death suddenly arrives is as rigid as a dead log An intelligent person seeing this change should diligently practice How could he sleep 
Birth and death alone move the mechanism   One ceaselessly continues to fall If one does not indulge in a happiness that will be discontinued its painful retribution will not be brought about 
One must not be close to any friend who is not excellent If one does not apply oneself and ceaselessly practices in ones application one will not experience knowledge about existence 
Even if one were born among the immaterial gods one would not be spared from change in time 
You should train in a body that will not change If it does not change you are without any fault 
As there is this body it is the basis of all suffering 
That is why the wise ones put a stop to the fundamental through the absence of a body 
All kinds of beings bring forth suffering through their desire Therefore one should produce thoughts of revulsion concerning b Chapter XX the existence of desire If one is disgusted with the existence of desire one will not experience any suffering 
Even if one is born in form or noform changing is a great calamity as one is not in quietude 
All the more so if one is not free from desire Thus one should contemplate the three realms as impermanent and without any ruler While all suffering is constantly ablaze how could the wise wish for happiness 
When for example a tree is ablaze with many flames why would the birds swarm to it 
He who understands this is an intelligent person Without this there is no understanding 
Having this  one is an insightful person and being without this means no understanding 
This then is what one should do and being without this is not fitting 
With this one is close to the teaching and without this one is separated from the right principle 
If one says that this excellent Law is not fit for householders this is a wrong pronouncement 
When one suffers from heat and enters cold water all becomes cool When a dark room is lit by the flame of a lamp all see the five colors 
The same appliesto the practice of the path There is no different way for mendicants and for common people Those who dwell in the mountains may fall committing an offense while a householder may rise to be a seer 
Delusion is a vast ocean and wrong views are its waves Beings follow the currents of desire They are tossed about and no one can cross over 
Wisdom is a light boat Firmly hold on to the correctness of samādhi The drum of application and the oars of mindfulness can save one from the ocean of ignorance  
When the king had attentively listened to the explanation of the Omniscient One he despised common splendor and knew that kingship was without any joy He had been like a maddened elephant running loose which had sobered up and returned well proven 
There were the heretics who had seen that the king had put his serene faith in the Buddha They all requested the great king to decide about the Buddha on the basis of his divine power 
The king then said to the Worldhonored One Please comply with their request c  
The Buddha immediately agreed in silence 
All kinds of people with different views and the divine seers with the five supernatural powers all came to where the Buddha was The Buddha immediately manifested his divine power sitting in the sky in his proper place 
He emitted a great light all around as bright as the morning sun The heretics were all subdued and the people of the land widely turned to his teaching 
In order to expound the Law to his mother he immediately ascended to the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven Three months he dwelled in his celestial palace and converted gods and humans all around 
After he had saved his mother and shown his gratitude he returned after the summer retreat had passed As all the attendants of the gods mounted a staircase of seven precious things descended to Jambudvīpa to the place to which buddhas have always descended 
Countless gods and humans saw him off in their palaces The rulers and their people in Jambudvīpa held their palms together and gazed up at  a Chapter XXI Subduing the Maddened Elephant Dhanapālaka  
After had converted his mother in heaven and also the other multitude of gods he returned among humans and went on converting according to circumstances

The demon Haimavata and also Sātāgra were subdued on Mount Vipula  and they were converted 
The brahman Pārāyaṇika was subdued on Mount Pāṣāṇaka by the subtle meaning of half a gāthā and was brought to resolute faith 
In the village of Sthāṇumatī  there was Kūṭadatta He was a head of the twiceborn and killed many living beings to offer as sacrifices but the Tathāgata made an effort to convert him and caused him to enter the right path 
A celestial spirit of great majesty on Mount Vaidehaka called Pañcaśikha  accepted the Law and entered certainty 
In the village of Veṇukaṇṭakī  converted the mother of Nanda  and in the city of Aṅgapura he subdued very powerful spirits 
Pūrṇabhadra and the wicked very powerful dragons roṇa and Daṇḍa the king and his concubines all accepted the Right Law thereby opening the gate of immortality 
In a village of dwarfs Kenya and ela earnestly sought the happiness of rebirth in heaven but they were converted so that they entered the right path 
In a village of the Suhmas showed his divine power to Aṅgulimāla  He converted him so that he was immediately subdued 
There was the son of a great elder Prajīvana   He was very wealthy and had many riches and possessions just like Pūrṇabhadra Before the Tathāgata he was instantly converted and widely practiced generosity 
In the village of Bhadrika converted the brothers Bhadravālin and Bhadra two spirits 
In Videhapura there were two brahmans One was called Mahāyus  and the other was called Brahmāyus subdued them in a debate and caused them to enter the Right Law 
Upon his arrival in the city of Vaiśālī converted rākṣasa demons and also the Licchavi Siṃha and a multitude of Licchavis and Satyaka Nirgranthaputra  He caused them all to enter the Right Law 
In Alakāvatī  there were the demons Bhadra Bhadraka and Bhadrakarma  He later arrived at Mount Aṭavī and saved the demon ṭavika a second one called Kumāra and a third one Hastaka 
returned to Gaja Mountain and saved the demon akana and the yakṣa ūcīloma and his sisters son 
He later went to Vārāṇasī and converted Kātyāyana 
After that he went to ūrpāraka using his divine power converted the merchants there and Stavakarṇin He accepted the Sandalwood Hallwhose fine fragrance spreads even now 
Upon reaching Mahīvatī he saved the seer Kapila While the muni was staying there he stepped upon a stone and the two wheel with a thousand spokes became visible  They were preserved 
Upon reaching the place of Vāraṇa he converted the demon Vāraṇa and upon reaching the country of Mathurā he saved the demon Gardabha 
When he arrived in the village of Vairañjā he saved the brahmans 
In the village of Kalmāṣadamya he saved Bṛhadvājin and further converted Agniveśya there 
again returned to the land of rāvastī and saved the gautamaka Jātiśroṇi and the māgaṇḍika treya 
Having returned to the land of Kośala saved heretical teachers Puṣkarasārin and the crowd of brahmans 
When he arrived in the quiet and secluded place of etavika he saved the heretical seers so that they entered the path of the seer Buddha 
Upon his arrival in the land of Ayodhyā saved a crowd of demons and dragons 
When he arrived in the land of Kumbhīra he saved two evil dragon kings One was called Kumbhīra and the other was called Kālaka 
Further upon his arrival in the land of the Bhārgas converted the yakṣa demon called Bheṣaka the parents of Nakula and also the great elder so that they had resolute faith in the Right Law 
Upon his arrival in the land of Kauśāṃbī converted Ghoṣila and the two upāsikās Prajā and Uttarā Their companions a multitude of upāsikās were also saved in due order 
Upon his arrival in the land of Gandhāra he saved the dragon Apalāla 
All such  those who walk in the sky and those who have the nature of water or of dry land he went to convert them all in due order just as the sun illuminates the darkness 
At that time when Devadatta saw the excellence of the Buddhas qualities deep in his heart he felt jealous and withdrew from the trances 
He used evil means to destroy the order of the Right Law ascended Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa let a rock fall and tried to hit the Buddha with it but the rock split in two and fell to the Buddhas left and right On the level and straight royal road let loose a maddened evil elephant 
His rolling roar was like thunder His ferocity burst forth forming a cloud He rushed on like a storm mighty as a fierce wind His trunk tusks tail and four feetcoming into contact with them would absolutely bring destruction 
In the alleys and streets of the city of Rājagṛha those he had killed and injured lay scattered about After their violent deaths the corpses lay spread out in the streets Brains and blood were spattered all around 
All the men and women were afraid to go out The whole city trembled  One heard only voices calling out in panic Some left the city in a hurry and others hid in caves 
a  The Tathāgata and a group of five hundred then arrived and entered the city The people in the windows high on the pavilions advised the Buddha not to proceed 
The Tathāgata was composed at heart and complacent and his countenance was free from distress He was mindful only of the suffering of envy His compassionate mind wished to put at ease 
As a multitude of gods and dragons followed all around gradually approached the place where the maddened elephant was All the bhikṣus had fled so he was accompanied only by nanda 
Just like the one specific nature of all kinds of characteristics of the Law he did not move The maddened elephant burst forth in a rage but when he saw the Buddha his mind immediately became calm 
He threw himself down and made obeisance at the Buddhas feet as if Mount Tai had crumbled With his lotuslike palm patted on the head just like the sun shining on a dark cloud 
As knelt at the Buddhas feet he expounded the Law to him saying No elephant may injure the greatest dragon 
It is hard for an elephant to fight a dragon but if an elephant wants to injure the greatest dragon he will never be reborn in a wholesome destination 
The infatuations of greed anger and delusion are difficult to subdue but the Buddha has subdued them That is why you should now reject greed anger and delusion If you do not reject them sunk in the mud of suffering and they will further increase  
When the elephant had heard the Buddhas exposition his madness was destroyed and his mind immediately gained insight He was content in body and in mind as when one is thirsty and drinks the nectar of immortality 
When the elephant had been converted by the Buddha the people in the land all rejoiced They all exclaimed in admiration that it was wonderful and arranged for all kinds of worship 
Those of a lesser goodness changed to an intermediate  and those of intermediate goodness advanced to a superior  Nonbelievers gained faith and believers faith was very firm 
When the great king Ajātaśatru saw that the Buddha had subdued the maddened elephant he thought that it was amazing He rejoiced and doubled his respect Chapter XXI  
The Tathāgata being skillful in means showed all kinds of divine power and subdued the beings He caused them to enter the Right Law according to their capacities The whole country developed wholesome actions just like people at the beginning of an eon 
Devadatta was entangled in his own evil Previously he had the divine power to fly but now he was certain to fall into the Avīci  Hell 
b Chapter XXII Lady mras Meeting with the Buddha  After the Worldhonored One had made extensive conversions the thought of his nirvana arose He set forth from the city of Rājagṛha to the district of Pāṭaliputra 
After arrival he stayed there in the Pāṭalī Caitya There was a dependent state a border district of Magadha 
The brahman who ruled that land was learned and understood the scriptural texts Looking at the signs concerning the welfare of the land he served as the national oracle 
The king of Magadha sent a messenger to notify the oracle that he had to erect a secure wall to protect against violent neighbors 
The Worldhonored One predicted that the land would be protected by celestial spirits If one were to erect a wall there it would forever be firm and free from danger 
The augur rejoiced in his heart and brought worship to the Buddha to the Law  and to the order  The Buddha left through a gate in the wall and went to the shore of the Ganges River 
Out of profound respect for Buddha the augur called the Gautama Gate The whole population on the shore of the Ganges River came out to welcome the Worldhonored One They brought all kinds of offerings and all adorned their boats so that he might cross 
Because there were numerous boats the Worldhonored One could not be impartial in accepting one and disregarded the others intention He immediately rendered himself and his great multitude invisible through his divine power He suddenly disappeared from one bank and emerged on the other bank 
Riding the boat of knowledge extensively saved beings Because of the power of his qualities he crossed the river without relying on a boat 
The population on the shore of the Ganges River called out with one voice that it was amazing They all called this ford by the name Gautama Ford 
The Gautama Gate the gate in the wall and the ford called Gautama Ford these names spread in the world and the fame of both was transmitted for generations 
The Tathāgata proceeded on and arrived in the village of Kuṭi Many were converted by his exposition of the Law  He later arrived in the village of Nādikā 
Many people had died in an epidemic and their relatives all came out to ask Where will our relatives who died in the epidemic be reborn at lifes end  
The Buddha knew the retribution of their actions well and gave his explanation in compliance to all their questions 
He went on to Vaiśālī and stayed in the mra Grove 
Lady mrapālī was pleased to hear that the Buddha had come to her garden Followed by her retinue of servants she went out to welcome him with dignity 
She was well in control of her faculties On her body she wore a light garment She gave up decorated clothes and desisted from perfuming herself with fragrant flowers when bathing 
She was as pure and simple as any chaste maiden in the world when bringing sacrifices to the gods Her beautiful and fine complexion was like the celestial appearance of a jade lady 
When the Buddha saw the lady coming from afar he said to his multitude of bhikṣus This woman is utterly beautiful capable of keeping the attention of any practitioner You should apply right mindfulness and pacify your mind with wisdom 
It would be better to be in the jaws of a fierce tiger or under the sharp sword of a madman than to have feelings of desire for a woman 
A woman shows her licentious attitude whether walking standing sitting or lying down Even painted images reveal their seductive appearance They steal ones wholesome thoughts Why not guard oneself 
One may see them weeping or laughing glad or angry they may be relaxed with lowered shoulders or their disheveled hair may tumble c Chapter XXII still they confuse ones mind 
All the more so when they have adorned themselves to manifest a fine appearance Their adornments conceal their lowly bodies enticing a fool 
In his bewilderment he has evil ideas and does not perceive her offensive appearance 
Look carefully at the truth and dispel any notion of desire Correctly contemplate her as a specific object Even a celestial maiden is not pleasant 
All the less could desire for any human keep ones attention Grasp the bow of zeal and the sharp arrow of wisdom Wear the heavy armor of right mindfulness and choose to battle the five desires 
It would be better to pierce both eyes with a hot iron skewer than to observe female beauty with desire in mind 
Desire confuses the mind and one is deluded by female beauty When ones life ends with confused thoughts one will certainly fall into the three woeful destinations  Be afraid of the suffering of the woeful destinations and do not be deceived by a woman Ones faculties should not be bound to her as their object and as an object she should not be bound to ones faculties 
Thoughts of desire for her come from ones faculties which are bound to her as their object 
When for instance two plowing oxen share a single yoke and martindale the oxen cannot be bound any further The same applies to ones faculties and their objects 
That is why one should control ones thoughts Do not let them be negligent  
As the Buddha expounded the Law in all kinds of ways to the bhikṣus Lady mrapālī eventually arrived before the Worldhonored One 
She saw the Buddha sitting underneath a tree meditating and reflecting in tranquility and cherished the thought that the Buddha in his great compassion had mercifully accepted her grove 
With an upright mind she controlled her bearing and corrected her former seductive feelings Purely endowed with a reverential body and mind she bowed and made obeisance at his feet 
The Worldhonored One bade her to sit down and expounded the Law to her as she wished Your thoughts are pure and tranquil and you reveal an outwardly virtuous appearance When one is in the prime of life and has abundant a wealth when one is endowed with virtue combined with a beautiful appearance and when one is able to have resolute faith in the Right Law that is difficult in the world 
When a man dwells in wisdom his happiness with the Law is not something wondrous That a woman whose determination is weak whose wisdom is shallow but whose desire is profound is capable of being happy with the Right Law this is even more difficult  
When one is born in the world one should just find ones pleasure in the Law Riches and beauty will not be permanently preserved Only the Right Law is precious 
Women all depend on another and they bear the suffering of anothers child Therefore reflect and feel revulsion toward a female body  
When Lady mrapālī heard the Law she rejoiced in her heart Her firm wisdom increased its brightness and she was able to break with desire She immediately felt revulsion toward her female body and was not tainted by any object 
Even though she felt ashamed of her lowly body the power of the Law urged her mind on She bowed and said to Buddha You have received me worthy one Mercifully accept my offerings tomorrow and let me fulfill my earnest wish  
The Buddha knew that she was sincere at heart and considering also the benefit of all beings he accepted her request in silence 
consequently rejoiced As she listened with affection her understanding steadily increased She made obeisance and returned home b Fascicle Five Chapter XXIII Staying Alive through Divine Power  
Blue red yellow or greeneach had a different appearance in their multitude 
Their attendants led in front and behind Competing for the road they advanced while jostling for the way Their celestial crowns ornamental garments adorned with precious ornamentation the great brilliance of their majestic appearanceall increased the brightness in that grove 
They removed their fivefold majestic apparel  dismounted and advanced on foot Having put a stop to pride their demeanor was reverential and they bowed at the Buddhas feet The great multitude surrounded the Buddha just asthe sun casts a circle of light all around 
His virtuous appearance was like a lions and he held the position of a lion minister Having dispelled his lionlike pride he was instructed by the lion of the ākyas You have great majesty a famous family and a beautiful appearance yet you have done away with worldly pride 
Your lands abundance and happiness are due only to your splendor Bringing splendor to ones person and happiness to ones people resides in a controlled mind 
When increased with a feeling of happiness with the Law it makes ones virtue steadily loftier 
Lead the multitude wisely and correctly just like an ox king crossing a ford 
If one can be mindful in the present world and in a later world one should indeed develop right morality and ones welfare will be firm in both worlds 
One will be revered by all and ones fame will spread widely Kind will be happy to be your friends and the spread of your virtue will be eternal and limitless 
Precious jade and stones in a mountain forest all come into existence relying on the earth The virtue of morality is just like the earth from which all that is good comes 
Without wings one may wish to rise into the sky and one may try to cross a river without a good boat If one does not have the virtue of morality as a human escape from suffering is really difficult 
Just as a tree is hard to climb when its beautiful flowers and fruits sting the same applies to the one who though learned and having the power of beauty destroys morality 
Sitting upright in an excellent pavilion one may be adorned with a kings mind but when in possession of the quality of pure morality one may follow the great seer and be converted 
Even if one has dyed ones garment wears fur or feathers or a spiral headdress or has shaven ones head if one does not develop the virtue of morality then it is difficult to cross over all suffering 
One may bathe three times night and day make offerings to fire and practice asceticism one may leave ones body for the filthy animals in the wilds one may rush toward water or fire or throw oneself from a cliff  
one may live on fruits eat herbs and roots inhale the wind and drink from the water of the Ganges one may swallow air and thereby cease ailmentsif one practices these paths of birds and animals far removed from right morality one is not a vessel of the Right Law 
By ruining morality one incurs slander and one is not held dear by kind  
One constantly feels fear in ones heart and is followed by a Chapter XXIII an evil reputation just like a shadow In the present world there is no benefit How could one obtain happiness in a later world 
That is why a wise person should develop pure morality In the wilderness of birth and death morality is the best guide 
Keeping the precepts comes from ones own effort This is not difficult Pure morality is a stairway that lets one ascend to heaven 
The establishment of pure morality comes from the weakness of affliction Ones faults ruin the mind and one loses ones fine qualities 
First forsake any mineAny mine covers all that is wholesome just as ashes conceal a fire Only when one steps on it does one notice the burning 
Pride covers over the mind just as the sun is concealed by a heavy cloud Insolence extinguishes shame and grief weakens strong determination Old age and illness ruin youthful appearance Arrogance extinguishes all that is wholesome 
The envy of the gods and of asuras raises contention The loss of any merit comes from a feeling of arrogance 
Desire is a huge calamity It pretends to be your friend but is a secret foe The fiercest fires come from within This also applies to the fire of desire 
The blaze of desire is worse than any fire in the world A fire may be great but water can extinguish it Desire is hard to extinguish 
When a fierce fire is set in the wilderness the grass is destroyed but it will grow back When the fire of desire burns the mind it is hard for the Right Law to come into existence 
Desire seeks worldly happiness and happiness increases impure actions Through evil actions one falls into a woeful destination Among ones enemies none surpasses desire 
It is impermanent painful impure without self and without any mine A truthful observation with wisdom can extinguish that wrong desire 
That is why one should develop truthful observation of the object When a truthful observation has arisen desire is undone 
Seeing qualities one produces desire and seeing faults one gives rise to anger When both qualities and faults become nonexistent desire and hatred are removed 
It can ruin fine beauty Anger is a screen for the brightest eyes It harms the meaning of the Law when one wishes for learning It ceases the meaningfulness of affection as one is held in contempt by the world 
That is why one should reject hatred Do not comply with angry thoughts He who can control his rage is called a skillful charioteer The world may praise one who controls his chariot well but he is a passenger holding the reins 
When one gives in to hatred and does not stop it from burning the fire of mournfulness subsequently flares up If someone gives rise to anger he first burns his own mind Afterward when is increased by a breeze it may also burn  
The suffering of birth old age illness and death oppresses beings but one may further add the harm of hatred Having many enemies one further increases enmity 
Seeing that the world is oppressed by all suffering one should give rise to compassionate thoughts When beings produce afflictions they are strong or weak with countless differences  
The Tathāgata being skillful in means gave a brief explanation according to illness just as a good doctor in the world prescribes medicine according to the illness 
When the Licchavis had heard Buddhas exposition of the Law they immediately rose and made obeisance at the Buddhas feet and joyfully accepted on their heads c Chapter XXIII  
They invited the Buddha and his great multitude to an offering to be arranged for the next day but the Buddha told the Licchavis that mrapālī had already invited him 
The Licchavis felt embarrassed Why does she take away our benefit But knowing that the Buddhas mind was impartial they again rejoiced 
The Tathāgata was skillful in comforting  as was fitting and caused them to be joyful at heart Humbly converted returned well proven just like a snake after a stern incantation 
When the night had passed and the signs of dawn had arisen the Buddha and his great multitude went to the house of mrapālī and accepted her offering went to Veṇugrāmaka and stayed there for the summer retreat 
When the threemonth retreat was over he returned to Vaiśālī He was staying on the shore of Markaṭa Pond sitting in a grove 
He emitted a great light all around Moved  Māra Pāpīyas came to where the Buddha was held his palms together and entreated him saying In the past on the shore of the Nairañjanā  you made a truthful pledge When the thing I have to do is completed I will enter nirvanaWhat you had to do is now done 
You must comply with your former intention  The Buddha then said to Pāpīyas The moment of my extinction is not far off Later after three full months I will enter nirvana  
Māra knew then that the time for the Tathāgata s extinction had been set His earnest wish was fulfilled and he joyfully returned to his celestial palace 
While he was sitting underneath a tree the Tathāgata rightly experienced samādhi He abandoned his life of karmic retribution and remained alive through his divine power 
As the Tathāgata abandoned his life the great earth quaked all around In the ten directions and in the sky all around a great fire blazed 
The top of Sumeru crumbled and stones rained from the sky A violent gale arose in the four directions The trees were all broken apart Celestial music brought a mournful sound 
The Buddha rose from his samādhi and said to the beings all around I have abandoned my life now Yet through the power of my samādhi I maintain myself My body is like a dilapidated chariot without any further cause to come or go I am freed from the three existences like a bird born after it has shattered its egg a Chapter XXIV Farewell to the Licchavis  
When the venerable nanda saw that the earth and the heavens all around were shaking he was startled in his heart and the hair on his body stood on end He asked the Buddha why  
The Buddha said to nanda I will remain alive for three months All remaining life formations have been abandoned That is why the earth quakes  
When nanda heard the Buddhas explanation he felt sad and his tears flowed Just as for instance when a very powerful elephant disturbs a sandalwood tree and its wood is damagedits fragrant gum flows down like tears 
As a relative  as someone who held his worthy great teacher in esteem possessing profound goodness but not yet having renounced desirebecause of these four things could not overcome his pain 
Now that I have heard the instructions of the Worldhonored One that his nirvana is certain my whole body has completely withered away I have lost my direction and my usual bearing I have completely forgotten the Law I have heard In my disarray I have lost heaven and earth 
Astonishing how the extinction of my master savior of the world In freezing cold about to die the fire I have encountered is suddenly extinguished again 
Confused by the wilderness of afflictions I have lost my direction I unexpectedly met an expert guide but before I am saved I suddenly lose him again 
I am like someone who has traveled a long road and who exhausted by the heat has thirsted for water for a long time Suddenly coming across a cool pond he hurries to it but finds it all dried up 
His eyes gazing with blue eyelashes clearly examines the three worlds 
Suppose for instance during a drought a cloud appears and one anticipates the rain for the plants But the cloud is quickly dispersed by a fierce wind Hope ceases and one is left with an empty field 
In the great darkness of ignorance beings have all lost their direction The Tathāgata has lit the lamp of wisdom but it will be suddenly extinguished 
When the Buddha had heard nandas exposition his bitter complaint and his sorrowful feelings he softly spoke comforting words and explained the True Law to him 
When someone understands his specific nature he will not dwell in grief All that is conditioned will all go to ruin 
I have already explained to you that what is united will by nature be separated Love is impermanent in principle Give up thoughts of longing The conditioned keeps flowing 
One may wish for a longlasting existence but will never achieve that state 
If the conditioned were to permanently remain nothing would change This would be deliverance What more would one want 
What could you and other beings now want from me 
I have already expounded to you what you should obtain What use is this body of mine 
I may remain or exist in quietude what you require will indeed be here 
Develop a notion of revulsion  well established in your own territory 
When you know the territory of the Law you are certain to clearly see the lamp of wisdom It can dispel delusion and one may observe the four ranges 
 Having obtained the excellent Law one is free from any self and free from mine  The bones of the skeleton are plastered with skin and flesh dipped in blood and tied by sinews 
After careful contemplation this is all impure Why be content with this body 
Any experiencing comes from its conditions just as bubbles on water Birth and extinction are impermanent and painful far removed from any pleasant notion Thoughts come into existence exist and are extinguished 
When considering tranquility the notion of permanence is forever abandoned 
All formations are produced by causes and conditions They gather and scatter and are not constantly together 
A fool produces the notion of a self but a wise one is without any mine  
Reflect on these four ranges and correctly contemplate them This is the path of the unique vehicle by which all suffering is extinguished 
If one can dwell in it and truthfully contemplate it correctly this Law is permanent and without end even while the Buddhas body may be dead or alive  
When the Buddha had expounded this fine Law and comforted nanda the Licchavis heard about it They were fearful and gathered together 
They all abandoned their mundane deportment and rushed to where the Buddha was After they had made obeisance they sat to one side They wanted to question him but could not utter a word 
The Buddha knew what was on their minds He anticipated and gave them a skillful explanation As I observe you now you have exceptional notions in your mind You have abandoned the affairs that are the common lot  
If you now wish to receive learning and knowledge from me do not grieve for me whether I am alive or dead 
Impermanence is the nature of the conditioned It is fickle and changeable Neither firm nor beneficial it is not characterized by longlasting duration 
The seer kings of old the seer Vasiṣṭha and others the wheelturning king Māndhātṛ among many others  
such former excellent ones were as powerful as the god śvara They have all long since gone to ruin Not one presently exists 
Suns and moons akras rulers of the godstheir numbers were very great too but all these have also turned to ruin No one has existed for a long time 
c  The number of buddhas in the past worlds has been the sands on the banks of the Ganges Their wisdom shone in the world but they have all been extinguished like a lamp 
The same will apply to the future extinction of the buddhas of future worlds Why would I now be any different 
I shall enter nirvana 
Vaiśālī has been pleasant 
Do feel at ease There is not any support in the world and one should not enjoy the three worlds Stop the suffering of grief and give rise to the thought of renunciation 
Having decided on a long separation I will travel north I will slowly travel the long road just like the sun nears the mountains in the west  The Licchavis moaning sadly complied as went on his way 
How astonishing His appearance is like a mountain of real gold fully adorned with all the marks but before long he will crumble 
How unkind is impermanence We have thirsted in vain for a long time in birth and death The Tathāgata is our mother of wisdom but suddenly abandons us now Not having any rescue what of our suffering 
Beings have been in darkness for a long time but through his light they may proceed in wisdom Why does the sun of wisdom suddenly hide its light 
Ignorance is a swift current tossing beings about Why will the bridge of the Law soon and so suddenly be destroyed 
The fine medicine of the unsurpassed knowledge of the compassionate great physicianking can cure the suffering of beings Why does he abruptly depart 
The fine celestial banner of compassion adorned with wisdom and covered with adamantine thoughtsthe world would tirelessly observe it But why will the banner of excellence our sacrificial ornament soon collapse 
How little merit do beings have 
They will continue to turn in the stream of birth and destruction The gate to deliverance has suddenly closed We will suffer for a long time without any hope of escape 
The Tathāgata is skillful at giving a Chapter XXIV comfort but he has abandoned us to our feelings and has bade us farewell for a long time  
Controlling their thoughts endured their longing They were like pale karṇikāra flowers Hesitantly and slowly they went on their way dispirited They were like those who had lost a relative and returned when the burial was over after a long farewell 
While Buddha was approaching his place of nirvana Vaiśālī was empty as if the stars and the moon had lost their light in the darkness of the clouds at night 
The land had been happy before but now it suddenly languished like an orphaned daughter who has lost her kind father and is always lonely and sad 
Like someone who is beautiful but has no learning who is intelligent but has little virtue who is eloquent at heart but stammers in speech who has bright wisdom but lacks talent  
who has divine power but lacks dignified demeanor who is compassionate but false at heart eminent but without any power with dignified demeanor but without any Law  
the same applied to Vaiśālī Once flourishing it was now in decline just like plants in an autumn field Lacking water they wither away 
either stopped making cooking fires all smoke extinguished or needing nourishment forgot to eat They all abandoned their public and private activities and did not engage in the common lot of human beings 
Mindful of the Buddha they were deeply moved by their love Each was silent not saying a word 
The Licchavi Siṃha was then forced to bear his grief He let his tears fall and made sounds of grief to show his affection He has destroyed any wrong path and has shown the Right Law He has subdued the heretics 
He will finally go away never to return The world will cease when he has left the ways of the world Impermanence is a grave illness When the Worldhonored One has entered great tranquility will be without any support and without salvation 
The Worthy One superior in expediency will hide his light in the final place and we will lose our strong determination just like fire without firewood 
b  When the Worldhonored One gives up his protection of the world beings are very pitiable When he has lost his divine power as a human the whole world will all grieve for him 
To escape the heat one jumps into a cool pond if one meets with cold one relies on fire  When all will soon be desolate what then can beings resort to 
With his thorough insight into the excellent Law he is a master craftsman in the world but the world is losing its ruler When a person loses his path he is destroyed  has been sovereign over old age illness and death but when his path is lost a wrong path will be taken 
How could the world have two who are able to destroy the mechanism of great suffering 
Extreme fires may burn with fierce heat but the rain of a great cloud will extinguish them When the fire of desire burns who will be able to extinguish it 
When the one who can be compared with what is most firm has given up the heavy burden of the world who with the power of wisdom could then be its uninvited friend 
Just as a prisoner facing punishment may become drunk with wine but executed beings with misled consciousness are born only to die With a sharp saw one cuts wood and impermanence cleaves the worldly 
Delusion is deep water and desire is a huge wave Afflictions are floating froth and wrong views are a makara fish  Only with the boat of wisdom one can cross over this great ocean 
Illnesses are the blossoms of a tree and old age is a delicate twig Death is the deep root of the tree and the actions of existence are its shoots The sharp sword of wisdom can cut down the trees of the three existences 
Ignorance is a rubbingstick and desire is the flame The objects of the five desires are fuel One may extinguish with the water of knowledge Endowed with the excellent Law has destroyed delusion 
Having seen the right road of tranquility he has ended afflictions His compassion has converted beings Friend or foe are no different  His omniscience has thorough insight but now all will be abandoned 
A soft and pure voice a right body and delicate long arms When the greatest seer has an end who could be immortal 
One must understand that time changes quickly One should diligently seek the Right Law just as when on a dangerous journey one comes across water one should drink quickly and advance along the road Impermanence is very adverse bringing destruction all around whether to the noble or the low 
When right contemplation exists in the mind one is constantly awake even while asleep  
The Licchavi Siṃha was then constantly mindful of the Buddhas wisdom Feeling revulsion for birth and death he admired the lion among humans 
He abandoned his worldly love and had profound respect for the quality of renunciation He subdued his fickle mind and fixed his thoughts on the state of quietude 
He diligently practiced generosity and was free from pride He found happinessin solitary practice resided in solitude and reflected on the True Law 
The Omniscient One turned around and looked back like a lion He saw Vaiśālī and pronounced a gāthā for his longlasting farewell This has been my last excursion to this Vaiśālī Staying in the land where the Mallas live I will enter nirvana  
Gradually and in due course traveled on and reached Bhoganagara He stayed in the śāla grove and instructed his bhikṣus I will now enter nirvana in the middle of the night You must rely on the Law 
If is not recorded in the sutras and does not comply with the discipline if it goes against the true meaning then it should not be accepted 
What is not the Law and what is not the discipline and furthermore when is not what I have proclaimed  then it is the teaching of darkness You should quickly reject it Hold fast to my clear expositions  They are not wrong 
They are my expositions agreeing with the Law and with the teaching of the discipline 
What is accepted as agreeing with my Law and disciplinethat may be believed If someone says that my Law and discipline are wrong that must not be believed a  
When someone does not understand the subtle meaning and is mistaken about the wording that person is a fool He falsely proclaims what is wrong 
He does not distinguish true from false He sees nothing and experiences darkness Suppose for instance brass and gold are displayed together one deceives the world 
A fool indulges in shallow knowledge He does not understand the true meaning He accepts a similar law and assumes that the True Law has been accepted 
Therefore carefully observe the True Law and discipline just as a goldsmith ascertains the genuine by heating and pounding it Ignorance about the scriptural texts is not wisdom 
What is not fitting is explained as fitting and what one should do is seen as not fitting 
Perform an equal acceptance when the meaning of a verse is practiced as it is expounded If one does not skillfully grasp a sword one will instead hurt ones hand 
When the words are not ingenious the meaning is hard to understand just as when one searches for a house while walking at night If the house is remote one does not know where it is 
If one loses the meaning one forgets the Law If one forgets the Law thoughts rush on in disarray That is why a wise person does not contradict the true meaning  
Having expounded these instructions arrived in the city of Pāpā and the multitude of Mallas arranged for all kinds of offerings 
There was then an elders son called Cunda He invited the Buddha to come to his house and served him his last meal 
When the meal was over expounded the Law He then went to Kuśinagara he crossed two rivers the Kukustā River and the Hiraṇyavatī River 
There was a śāla grove a tranquil and secluded place entered and bathed in the Hiraṇyavatī River and his body resembled a mountain of real gold 
He instructed nanda Sweep clean the space between two trees there and put up a charpoy 
I will now enter nirvana in the middle of the night b Chapter XXV  
As nanda heard the Buddhas instructions his breathing became difficult and he felt sad at heart He let his tears flow and followed the instructions After he had made the arrangements he came back to inform the Buddha 
The Tathāgata went to the charpoy and lay down on his right side his head turned north He used his hand as a pillow and rested one foot upon the other just like a lion king Once he lay down his last body whose suffering had ended he would never rise 
The group of his disciples surrounded him and cried out in grief The eye of the world is extinguished  The wind stopped and the streams in the grove went quiet Birds and animals were silent and did not make a sound 
The sap of the trees flowed like tears Flowers and leaves fell down out of season Humans and gods who had not yet renounced desire were all very fearful just like those who are traveling through a vast marsh 
The road is dangerous and they have not yet reached a village Afraid they will not make it their minds are distressed as they plod along 
When the Tathāgata had finally laid himself down he said to nanda Go and tell the Mallas The moment of my nirvana has arrived 
If they have not seen me they will always be regretful and feel great suffering  
nanda accepted the Buddhas instructions Sadly weeping he went on his way and told the Mallas about the Worldhonored Ones final end 
When the Mallas heard this they became utterly fearful Men and women left in a hurry and in tears arrived where the Buddha was With torn clothes and disheveled hair their sweating bodies coated in dust they went to that grove wailing just like gods whose merit had ended They let their tears fall and made obeisance at the Buddhas feet pale with grief 
The Tathāgata spoke in a comforting way Do not be mournful Now is a moment to rejoice You should not feel distress 
What has been planned for eons not until now do I obtain it a pure state without end saved from the objects of the faculties 
Free from earth water fire and wind I am in quietude and will not be reborn or extinguished I have forever done away with sorrow Why feel sorrow for me c  
In the past on Gaja Mountain I wanted to give up this body but because of my former causality I remained in the world until now 
Holding on to this brittle body is like dwelling with a poisonous snake I will now enter great tranquility All my painful causality has ended 
I shall not experience a body again and future suffering will be appeased for a long time Do not be afraid for me anymore  
When the Mallas heard the Buddha explain that he would enter great quietude their thoughts were confused and their eyes became bleary as if gazing into a great darkness 
They held their palms together and said to the Buddha You O Buddha are free from the suffering of birth and death You will forever go to the happiness of tranquility We are really pleased 
When for instance a house is on fire and ones loved ones escape from it even the gods rejoice How much more would the people in the world 
But after your extinction O Tathāgata beings will have no one to observe Because we will forever be far from any salvation we feel grief 
Suppose for instance a group of traveling merchants is crossing a remote wilderness with just one guide and suddenly dies halfway Since the group now has no one to rely on how could they not feel grief 
One may have realized some understanding in the present world but when one has observed the Omniscient One but has not yet gained his excellent benefit one would be ridiculed by the whole world just as when a fool passes by a mountain full of precious things yet remains in poverty  
Thus the Mallas lamented to the Buddha just as an only child laments to his kind father 
The Buddha showed them the highest meaning with skillfully enticing words He said to the multitude of Mallas It really is as you say One needs rigor in ones search for the path 
If you practice according to what I have expounded you will be free from the net of all suffering 
The practice of the path exists in the mind It does not necessarily come from meeting me 
When for instance a sick person relies on a remedy and takes a good medicine all illness is naturally removed He does not wait to see a doctor a Chapter XXV  
If one does not practice according to what I have expounded one meets me in vain without any gain 
Even if one is far away from me practicing the Law one is near me 
If one dwells with me but does not follow the Law know that he is far away from me 
Do not be negligent in controlling your mind Strenuously develop right action 
When one is born in the world one is for a long time oppressed by all suffering One is disturbed and not at ease like a lamp in the wind  
When the crowd of Mallas heard the Buddhas compassionate instructions they were inwardly moved and wiped away their tears They forcefully restrained themselves and returned  
Chapter XXVI The Great Parinirvāṇa  There was then a brahman called Subhadra He was completely endowed with worthy qualities and with pure morality he protected living beings 
In his youth he had received wrong views and had gone forth to follow a heretical path He wanted to come and meet the Worldhonored One and said to nanda I have heard about the Tathāgatas path that its meaning is very difficult to fathom With his unsurpassed insight in the world he is the highest teacher to give training 
He is about to enter parinirvāṇa now and it will be even more difficult to meet him again While it is difficult to meet him encountering those who have met him is most difficult just like the moon in a mirror 
I now want to meet the unsurpassed skillful guide In my search to cease allsuffering he will let me cross over to the othershore of birth and death 
The Buddhas sun is about to hide its light Please let me meet him for a while  
nanda felt sad and thought that was going to disparage  or that he was pleased with the extinction of the Worldhonored One I must not let him meet the Buddha  
But the Buddha knew about wish and that he was fit to be a vessel for the Right Law and said to nanda Allow the heretic to approach I will save him from human life Do not make any difficulties  
When Subhadra heard this he felt great joy in his heart His feeling of happiness with the Law became more and more profound Increasing his reverence he came before the Buddha 
At this occasion courteously speaking with soft words he made polite inquiries He held his palms together with a serene countenance and made his request I would now like to ask you a question 
In the world there are those who know a law like myself and many others Yes we have heard about what you O Buddha have obtained a different and essential path to deliverance b  Please briefly explain it to me 
I am imbued only with the feeling of longing and do not debate and I am without any thought of winning or losing  
The Buddha briefly explained the eightfold right path to the brahman Upon hearing it immediately accepted it with an open mind as if he had been lost and had found the right road 
He knew that what he had previously applied himself to was not the final path 
He immediately obtained what he had never obtained He gave up the wrong path and turned his back on the darkness of delusion He reflected on what he had previously practiced Both anger and delusion nourish unwholesome actions 
When desire is equally practiced with anger and delusion it can give rise to wholesome actions Learning wisdom and zeal are yet produced by desire for existence 
When anger and delusion are stopped then one is free from their actions When their actions have been done away with one is said to be delivered from their actions 
But by being delivered from their actions one is not associated with the meaningful All the worldly is explained as having a specific nature 
If desire for existence anger and delusion have a specific nature they should permanently exist How could one be delivered 
Yes if anger and delusion are extinguished desire for existence returns one to birth By comparison As its specific nature water is cold but it becomes hot fire When the heat has diminished the water again turns cold because its specific nature is permanent 
One always experiences the nature of desire for existence Learning wisdom and zeal do not increase it They do not increase it and they do not diminish it How could one be delivered 
had previously thought that birth and death were actually produced by nature but now contemplating that meaning no one could be delivered 
If a nature namely permanently remains how could one have a final end 
When for instance one lights a bright lamp how could one make it lose its light 
The Buddhas path is really meaningful Because of craving one produces the world When craving is extinguished one knows tranquility Because of its extinction its result is nonexistent 
He had once thought that the self was different from the body unseen and uncaused Now he had heard the Buddhas right teaching that the world is without any self 
All factors are produced by causes and conditions because nothing is sovereign Because produced by causes and conditions are painful The same applies to the extinction of causes and conditions 
Observing that the world is produced by causes and conditions the brahman Subhadra extinguished his view of annihilation When free from any causality the world is extinguished one is free from the view of permanence 
 completely gave up his former views and had profound insight in the Buddhas Right Law 
Having planted wholesome causes in his previous lives he immediately gained insight upon hearing the Law He had obtained fine tranquility the pure state without end 
His mind opened up and his faith was very extensive as he respectfully gazed at the Tathāgata lying there It is unbearable to watch the Tathāgata give up the world and enter parinirvāṇa Before the Buddhas final end I should be extinguished first  
held his palms together and made obeisance to the Buddhas noble countenance sitting in his proper place to one side He abandoned life and entered nirvana just as rain extinguishes a small fire 
The Buddha said to the bhikṣus My last disciple has entered nirvana now Worship him  
The lonely grove was quiet without a sound The Buddha gave rise to thoughts of great compassion He bequeathed his instructions to his disciples After my parinirvāṇa you must respect the prātimokṣa  It is your great preceptor the bright lamp in the vast darkness 
Follow them just as you would serve me no different 
Purify your actions of body and speech and abandon all efforts at livelihood Raising living beings in a field or dwelling accumulating riches and collecting the five grainskeep away from all that just as one avoids a great fiery pit a  
Cutting plants and trees to open up new soil treating and curing any illness consulting the calendar ones fate casting horoscopes for portents of ones destiny observing signs for any profit or lossall this should not be done 
Restrain oneself and eat at the proper time Do not accept or cause arts to be practiced Do not concoct herbal potions Keep away from any crookedness 
The provisions one depends on in compliance with the Law one should accept these in moderation One may accept but must not amass them This is a brief explanation of the precepts 
 is the basis of all precepts and the basis for deliverance Relying on this Law one can produce all right experiencing 
All true knowledge obtains final certitude because of this That is why you must keep  Do not let it be broken 
When pure morality is not broken one has all good qualities Without it one does not have any  as they are established only by morality 
If dwelling in pure morality one controls ones faculties well he is like someone who tends his herd well and does not let run loose 
If one does not control the horses of the faculties and if one allows the six objects one brings about calamities in the present world and will fall into a woeful destination 
If for instance one does not train a horse it will cause one to fall into a pit Therefore a wise one should not set his faculties loose The faculties are very evil 
Though beings may like their faculties they are hurt by them yet 
A sworn enemy an extremely poisonous snake a dangerous tiger or a fierce firea wise one does not fear the worlds great evils 
He fears only that a fickle mind will lead him to a woeful destination as it is made happy by something small and sweet and does not observe the deep precipice 
A fickle mind is like a maddened elephant that has lost his sharp goad like a monkey who has taken over the grove A wise one should control  b Chapter XXVI  
If one sets the mind loose so that it is sovereign one will never obtain tranquility 
Know moderation in food Regard it as a way of taking medicine Do not have any covetous or angry thoughts over food 
Food stops hunger and thirst just as grease is for a dilapidated cart Just as a bee chooses flowers and does not ruin their color or fragrance a bhikṣu should go begging for alms Do no harm to others faith 
If is generous with an open mind one should assess what he can bear  If one does not calculate the strength of the ox heavy a load will hurt it 
Develop right actions in due course at the three times morning midday and afternoon During the two parts of the night the first and the last watch do not be attached to sleep either Lie down in the middle of the night with upright thoughts 
Remain in concentrated mindfulness until the first sign of light Do not sleep too much letting your physical life pass by in vain As the fire of time constantly consumes ones body why sleep long 
The enemies of the afflictions will harm you due to your idleness If the mind is numb from sleep who will notice when death arrives 
If a poisonous snake hides in your dwelling a skillful incantation can make it leave But if a black venomous snake is in your mind it is done away with by the skillful incantation of clear perception One who just sleeps a lot is a shameless person Shame is an ornament 
Shame lets the mind be concentrated Shamelessness ruins any wholesome root Those with shame are praised as worthy in the world The shameless are equal to birds and animals 
Even if someone were to cleave your body joint by joint with a sharp knife you should not harbor resentment nor should you speak evil words Evil thoughts and evil words hurt oneself They do not harm another 
When one restrains the body and practices austerities nothing surpasses the excellence of forbearance There must only be the practice of forbearance the most firm strength difficult to vanquish Therefore do not harbor resentment or say evil words to others c  
Anger destroys the Right Law and it destroys beauty It ruins ones good reputation The fire of anger burns ones own mind Anger is the enemy of virtue 
If you love virtue do not harbor resentment As a householder to come to anger is not surprising because of the many troubles  But if having gone forth one harbors anger that deviates from the right principle as if a large fire were lit in cold water 
If pride arises in your heart pat yourself on the head with your hand You have taken the tonsure and wear a robe You hold an almsbowl in your hand and you have decided on this life as your last birth Why be proud 
When an ordinary person is proud on the basis of his fine family he may yet consider it an error 
Seeking much means suffering but little desire means happiness 
The stingy are afraid to seek for more for fear of losing their wealth He who likes to be generous is afraid too ashamed of his riches of which he may not provide enough  
From having little desire one obtainsthe path of deliverance 
The heart is always joyful when satisfied Joy is nothing but the Law Even if the provisions one depends upon are lowly one is always content and satisfied 
Even if someone who is unable to feel satisfied obtains the happiness of rebirth in heaven the fire of suffering permanently burns his mind because he is not satisfied 
If wealthy but not satisfied this too is poverty When you are satisfied even though poor this is the highest wealth a Chapter XXVI  
If one is not satisfied the objects of the five desires become even larger One seeks even more and tirelessly hurries toward suffering for a long time 
In his effort he feels anxiety and on the other hand he is pitied by those who are satisfied If one does not often accept ones retinue ones mind is always tranquil 
Because of tranquility and quietude all humans and gods serve him That is why one should give up both of the two retinues of close and distant loved ones 
For instance suppose many birds and monkeys live on a lone tree in a vast marsh The same applies to a large retinue one may care for For a long time one experiences much suffering A large crowd means many entanglements like an old elephant that is sunk in the mud 
If one applies oneself with zeal there is no benefit one will not obtain One should therefore be strenuous night and day not lazy 
As the small streams in the valley continuously flow they hollow out a rock If one is not strenuous when trying to make a fire with a stick one toils in vain and does not obtain it Therefore always be vigorous like someone in his prime making a fire 
A good friend may be fine but he is inferior to right mindfulness If right mindfulness exists in ones thoughts no evil will enter them 
That is why a practitioner should always be mindful of his body If he loses mindfulness of his body all wholesome may be forgotten 
When for instance a brave leader wears armor he can withstand a strong enemy With right mindfulness as ones heavy armor one can restrain the thieves of the six objects Right concentration regulates an insightful mind and it contemplates birth and extinction in the world That is why a practitioner should practice samādhi 
In samādhi one is quiet able to extinguish all suffering  When wisdom can shine brightly one is far from any grasping It equally contemplates ones inner considerations 
The householder and the one who has gone forth both should follow this path 
If one accomplishes the three kinds of wisdom his eye of wisdom is open even though he may be blind When without wisdom ones thoughts are false one is not someone who has gone forth 
Therefore know and leave any false factor and reach subtle happiness the quiet and tranquil state Honor heedfulness Negligence is a skillful enemy 
If one is not negligent one will obtain rebirth in the place of Lord akra If one is remiss and negligent one will fall among the asuras I have completed the comforting and compassionate actions I had to do 
Diligently exert yourselves so that you will not feel remorse later 
For instance a fine doctor in the world offers a prescription that is fitting for the illness If one is ill but does not take  this is not the fault of the fine doctor 
I have expounded the truth and I have shown the level road If one hears but does not accept it the one who has expounded it is not to blame 
If there is anything you do not understand about the meaning of the four truths you should all ask me now Do not conceal your feelings anymore  
As the Worldhonored One taught in his merciful way the whole gathering remained silent 
Then Aniruddha saw that the great multitude was silent free from any doubt He held his palms together and said to the Buddha That the moon is warm and the sunshine cold the wind quiet and the earth unstable by naturesuch four kinds of delusion have not existed at all in the world 
The truths of suffering of its cause of its extinction and of the path are true never contradicted They are as you have expounded Worldhonored One The whole assembly is completely free from any doubt Chapter XXVI  
We are all saddened indeed by your nirvana Worldhonored One We do not have the idea that your explanation O Worldhonored One does not mean final certitude 
Yes if someone has recently gone forth and has no profound understanding of the situation yet as he has heard your courteous instructions now his doubts have all been done away with 
Having crossed over the sea of birth and death one is free from desire and without any aspiration Yet all feel sad longing now How soon is the Buddhas extinction we sigh  
The Buddha appeased Aniruddhas several kinds of mournful words further with his compassionate mind and said Yes even if one would stay for an eon one would finally turn to separation One may be united with a different person but in principle one will not permanently be together 
Having benefited myself and others my remaining would be in vain What would I have to do 
Those of the gods and humans who were to be saved have all obtained deliverance 
You my disciples spread and maintain the Right Law Know that existence will certainly be ruined Do not feel grief anymore Diligently apply yourself to arrive at the place without separation 
I have lit the lamp of knowledge It is shining and removes the darkness in the world 
When you know that the world is not secure you should rejoice just as when a friend who has met with a serious illness is cured and freed from his suffering I have given up my vessel of suffering going against the current of the sea of birth and death I have forever left all suffering 
Guard yourselves well Do not be negligent All that exists has turned to extinction I am now entering nirvana 
This then is my final teaching  
He followed the concentrations in reverse order and again entered the first trance c  He again rose from the first trance and he entered the fourth trance As he left concentration and his thoughts had nowhere to resort to the Buddha immediately entered nirvana 
Because of Buddhas nirvana the great earth quaked all around From the sky firebrands rained all around The blaze was without any fuel 
Furthermore rose from the earth and the eight directions were all ablaze Even the celestial palaces were ablaze in the same way Thunder moved heaven and earth 
The sound of the thunder shook the mountains and rivers like the sounds of battle between gods and asuras 
A violent gale arose in all four directions Mountains crumbled and ashes and dust rained down The sun and moon lost their brightness All clear streams boiled 
Flying dragons ascended in the black clouds Thier five heads hung down and their tears flowed The four kings and their retinues generated worship in their sadness 
The gods of the pure abodes descended and waited upon the Buddha in the sky As they observed the development of impermanence they were neither sorrowful nor glad 
They sighed that the world was separated from its celestial teacher How quick is his destruction  
The celestial spirits of the eight classes thronged in the sky Scattering flowers to bring worship they felt anxious and were not joyful at heart 
Only King Māra was glad He played music to amuse himself 
Jambudvīpa had lost its splendor as if a mountain had collapsed and its peak had crumbled as if the white tusks of a great elephant had snapped and as if both horns of an ox king were broken 
In the sky there was no sun or moon and the lotuses met with severe frost The world was downcast like this by the Tathāgatas parinirvāṇa a Chapter XXVII The Eulogy of Nirvana  
There was then a celestial son who had ascended to his palace with a thousand white geese High in the sky he observed the Buddhas parinirvāṇa and for the multitude of gods all around he widely proclaimed gāthās about impermanence 
All is by nature impermanent It is quickly born and quickly extinguished 
When born it is accompanied by suffering Only tranquility means happiness 
While the fuel of actions is amassed the fire of wisdom has been ablaze 
When the smoke of his fame rises to the heavens a timely rain falls and brings extinction just as when the fire of the eon arises it is extinguished by a flood  
There was also a god a brahman seer a seer of the highest meaning as it were who dwelled in the exquisite happiness of the gods but who was not attached to his celestial reward He praised the Tathāgatas tranquility With his mind concentrated he spoke When I observe the factors of the three worlds throughout there is none that is not destroyed 
His wisdom is the highest of any understanding A savior of the world All are destroyed by impermanence Who can remain long 
Beings in the whole world fall into wrong paths  
They quickly arise and are quickly extinguished A wise one does not protect them The adamantine bolt of impermanence has destroyed the muni the seer king 
How base is the worlds fickleness It will be destroyed and is not b firm The fierce lion of impermanence has harmed the dragonelephant the great seer 
When even the adamantine banner of the Tathāgata is destroyed by impermanence how much more so would one who has not renounced desire be fearful 
Six seeds and one shoot rained on by all waters Deep roots of four stretches  Two boughs and five kinds of fruits Consisting of three divisions but one and the same trunk 
He was like the crested bird that enjoys the water and swallows poisonous snakes Suddenly meeting a great drought he lost the water and died 
A swift horse is valiant in battle but when the battle is over it returns well proven A fierce fire burns because of firewood but when the fuel is all used up is extinguished by itself 
The same applies to the Tathāgata When his task was over he turned to nirvana When for instance bright moonlight removes the darkness all around for the world and when all beings receive its light it is concealed again by Sumeru The same applies to the Tathāgata 
It removed the darkness for beings but it is concealed by the mountain of nirvana The excellent light of his fame has shined all over the world 
It has dispelled all darkness unstopped like a swift current While he skillfully drives his seven swift horses his army and his attendants travel on 
But the celestial son who is the sun in all its brightness still enters Yanzi Mountain When the sun and moon are blocked five times beings lose their light 
After offerings to fire and sacrifices to the gods there remains only burning black smoke After the Tathāgata hid his brightness the world likewise lost its splendor 
When the expectations of beings are fulfilled after the completion of his task he stopped any expectation 
He abandoned his personal bonds of affliction and obtained the path of truth He left his mass of troubles and entered the place of quietude 
Through his divine power he ascended in the sky and wanders His vessel of suffering has therefore been abandoned The light of his knowledge has dispelled the heavy darkness of delusion 
The dust of affliction was washed away by the water of his knowledge so that he was purified He will not return time and again He has forever gone to the place of quietude 
He has extinguished all birth and death and is respected by all He has made all happy with the Law and has imbued all with his wisdom He has completely comforted all and all his qualities have widely spread 
His fame shines again and again all over for all up to this day 
For those who emulated his qualities he had merciful thoughts He was not made happy by the four benefits and was not grieved by the four losses 
He controlled his feelings well and all his faculties were thoroughly clear He impartially observed with a pure mind and was not attached to the six objects What he has obtained is wonderful 
While they thirsted in vain he has fully satisfied them with the waters essential for salvation 
He donated what others had not donated and did not expect any recompense He has quieted his body with fine marks and completely knows all thoughts 
He was moved neither by pleasant nor foul and his strength has overcome all enemies The fine medicine for any illness is yet destroyed by impermanence 
All kinds of beings have a different end when they are pleased with the Law but he has widely responded to their aspirations He has completely fulfilled their wishes 
Once the great generous giver of noble wisdom has gone he will not return just as a fierce fire in the world will burn no more when the fuel is consumed 
Not tainted by the eight factors he subdued the group of five that is hard to subdue  With the three he has seen the three  and free from a the three he has accomplished the three 
 Retaining the one he has obtained the one  Having surpassed the seven  he will sleep for a long time He has completely achieved the path of tranquility honored by the noble 
He has ended the impediments of affliction and saved those who have respectfully served it Those who have hungered in vain and who have been weary with thirst he let them drink the nectar of immortality 
Wearing the heavy armor of forbearance he has subdued any anger With the subtle meaningfulness of his excellent Law he has caused rejoicing in the minds of his multitude 
In those who developed goodness in the world he planted the seed of nobility Those who developed what is right or what is not right he equally received them and did not abandon them 
He turned the wheel of the unsurpassed Law and the world all around accepted it with joy If they had previously planted a cause to find happiness in the Law they were all delivered 
Wandering among the people he saved all those who had not yet been saved Those who had not yet seen the truth were all made to see the truth 
To those who practiced a heretical path he gave them his profound Law He expounded that birth and death are impermanent without any ruler and without happiness in any existence 
He erected the great banner of his fame and destroyed the armies of Māra He had no delight or grief about advance or retreat and making light of life he praised tranquility 
He caused those who were not yet saved to be saved He caused those who were not yet freed to be freed He caused those who were not yet quiet to become quiet He caused those who were not yet awakened to awaken 
The muni received beings with his path of quietude While beings disregard the noble path and indulge in wrong actions as if at the end of a great eon the one who knows the Law is in the long sleep While dense clouds roll and crash and bring destruction to the forest they let the rain of immortality fall down 
A young elephant may destroy a thorny forest but when his consciousness is trained he can benefit others The when the clouds have parted and when the elephant has grown oldall this is unbearable 
The destruction of one view can accomplish another view bringing salvation by saving the world Having destroyed wrong argumentation he obtained the path of sovereignty 
He has now entered the great tranquility and the world is without salvation 
When the forces of the great army of King Māra shook heaven and earth wanted to harm the worthy muni but he could not make the Buddha move Why is he unexpectedly at once destroyed by the māra of impermanence 
Gods and humans are gathered in great numbers all around they fill the sky Afraid of birth and death without end they feel great fear in their hearts 
Whether far or near in the world his celestial eye clearly sees all He truly understands the retribution of actions as if observing an image in a mirror 
His celestial ear excels in intelligence There is no fardistant thing it does not hear Ascending in the sky he instructs the gods and as he walks he converts the regions of humans He may divide himself and unite his parts 
When he crosses over water he is not immersed He remembers his past lives not forgetting any part of an entire eon 
When the faculties roam their objective fields they each have different memories but with his supernatural knowledge that knows the thoughts of others is omniscient With the pure fine knowledge of his supernatural power he impartially observes all He has completely ended all impurities and completed all his tasks His knowledge has abandoned his remaining elements of existence 
When beings with dull faculties meet him their intelligence becomes sharp As countless evildoers pass him by they each gain the road to insight upon meeting him Suddenly and unexpectedly he is in the long sleep Who will further show these qualities 
The world is without salvation Hope has ended and lifes breath has stopped Who will sprinkle cool water over it so that it will breathe again His own task that he had to do is completed 
Who will rend the net of the worlds foolishness 
Facing the swift current of birth and death who will explain it and make it turn back 
Who will expound the path of quietude for the deluded minds of beings 
Who will show the place of tranquility and who will show the true meaningfulness 
While beings experience great suffering who will bring salvation as a kind father 
When a horse changes its territory it loses its majesty When the ruler dies he loses his country The same applies to a world without the Buddha 
The learned are without eloquence Being a doctor one is without wisdom Human kings have lost their bright appearance When the Buddha is extinguished the common lose their splendor 
When a fine chariot loses its skillful charioteer and when the boat one is on loses its boatmaster when the three armies lose their brave general and when merchants lose their guide  when the sick lose their good physician and when a noble king loses his seven precious things when the stars lose the bright moon and when one loves a long life but loses his life when the Buddha is extinguished the world likewise loses its great teacher  
In this way the arhat  who had completed all he had to do and whose impurities had all ended spoke to show his gratitude conscious of the kindness and bound by sad longing He praised qualities and related the suffering of the world 
Those who had not yet renounced desire were overcome by sorrowful tears Those whose impurities had ended just sighed at the suffering of birth and extinction 
Then when the multitude of the Mallas heard that the Buddha was in nirvana they mourned with confused cries and wept sadly just like a flock of snow geese when encountering a hawk They all came to the twin trees and saw that the Tathāgata was in the long sleep and it did not appear that he would wake up again They beat their breasts and cried out to heaven just as all the cows cry out in confusion when a lion has seized a calf c Chapter XXVII  
Among them was one Malla whose mind had found happiness in the Right Law He truly observed that the noble righteous king had entered the great tranquility 
He said Beings were asleep when the Buddha opened up their minds so that they woke up He has entered the great tranquility now He finally is in the long sleep 
He erected the banner of the Law for all but now it has suddenly collapsed The sun of the Tathāgatas wisdom his great awakening has shined brightly 
His zeal has been a sweltering heat and his wisdom has dazzled with a thousand rays He has dispelled all darkness Why a long darkness again 
His unique wisdom has been shining in the three worlds for the eyes of beings all around But now they are suddenly blind No one in the whole world knows the way 
As the great river of birth and death flows greed anger and delusion are giant waves The bridge of the Law has suddenly collapsed and beings will drown for a long time  
Some in that crowd of Mallas wept sadly and wailed bitterly Some felt moved in secret without making a sound Some threw themselves down to the ground Some meditated in silence and some moaned deeply with disappointment 
They prepared a precious bier with gold and silver fully adorned with fragrant flowers and placed the Tathāgatas body on it A precious curtain covered it over They prepared hanging streamers and a flower parasol and all kinds of music The men and women of the Mallas led the way and brought offerings 
The gods scattered fragrant flowers and in the sky there was the celestial music of drums Humans and gods sighed sadly in unison Their cries combined as they shared a common grief 
They entered the city and after worshiped by young and old men and women left through the DragonElephant Gate and crossed the Hiraṇyavatī River They arrived at the place of the caitya for the extinction of the buddhas of the past 
They accumulated oxhead sandalwood and famous aromatic wood a  They placed the Buddhas body on and poured many fragrant oils over it Then they tried to light the fire underneath 
At that time the great Kāśyapa had been staying in the city of Rājagṛha but when he knew that the Buddha was about to go to his nirvana he came along with his retinue 
With a pure heart made a fine wish wishing to see the body of the Worldhonored One 
Because of that sincere wish the fire was extinguished and did not catch fire 
When Kāśyapa and his retinue had arrived they sighed sadly as they all gazed at his appearance Only after they had saluted him at his feet did the fire light up 
Inwardly had stopped the fire of affliction and an external fire could not burn him Even though it burned his external skin and flesh his adamantine actual bones were preserved 
After the fragrant oil was all burned up they kept the bones in golden pitchers Just as the realm of the real was not destroyed in the same way his bones were not destroyed 
chanted As the result of his adamantine wisdom he was as difficult to move as Sumeru The very powerful Garuḍa could not move him but in the precious pitchers he has shifted with the world 
Wondrous is the power of the world could turn the wheel of the Law of tranquility and the fame of his qualities has spread widely completely filling the ten directions 
Complying with the world he is in the longlasting tranquility Just the remaining bones are preserved His great light has dazzled the world and shined on all beings but suddenly he hid his brightness and left his relics in pitchers 
His adamantine sharp wisdom destroyed the painful mountain of affliction 
All suffering was assembled in his person but his adamantine determination put it at ease For beings who experience great suffering he removed it all 
Such an adamantine person is now consumed by fire  
The multitude of Mallas was valiant peerless in the world They repressed the suffering that is the enemy and could escape from suffering b Chapter XXVII by taking refuge 
When their loved ones met with hardship their determination was strong and they could free them from sorrow Now they had seen the Tathāgatas extinction and all felt grief in their hearts 
They were ablebodied and their vigor was strong but their pride was idle as they walked like gods Grief heavy on their minds they entered the city as if it were a vast marsh Carrying the relics they entered the city In the alleys and streets everywhere people brought offerings 
Chapter XXVIII The Division of the Relics  The crowd of Mallas made offerings to the relics They brought unsurpassed worship with exquisite fragrant flowers 
Then the kings of seven countries heard that the Buddha was extinguished They sent messengers to the Mallas requesting the Buddhas relics 
The multitude of Mallas revered the Tathāgatas body but completely relying on valiance they had proud thoughts They would rather give up their own lives than give up the Buddhas relics 
The messengers all returned emptyhanded and the seven kings became very angry They raised armies and like clouds and rain they came to Kuśinagara 
The people who were outside the city all returned in fear They notified the multitude of Mallas that the armies and horses of the countries were coming that their chariots with elephants and horses and their multitudes on foot had surrounded Kuśinagara 
The groves outside the city the springs and ponds the flowers fruit and trees were all trampled by the armies The splendid observation towers were all smashed 
They prepared their weapons for battle in order to aim them at the enemy outside Bows and crossbows carriages for catapults and flying torchesall came forth 
The seven kings surrounded the city and each of their armies were elite troops Their ceremonial plumes were very bright just like the light of the seven luminaries  Their bells and drums were like thunder and their ferocity formed a profuse cloud The Mallas were very rash 
But the valiant men were wearing their heavy armor They wielded their battleaxes and brandished their long swords As bells and drums sounded in confusion they grasped their weapons though they had not yet crossed them in battle 
There was a brahman called Droṇa He was learned and possessed superior cleverness His modesty was honored by all 
He said to the kings Observe the state of these walls Even one man is enough to withstand you 
How much less could you subdue them with their singleminded vigor 
Yes if you destroy them what meritorious fame would there be 
After you have crossed your sharp weapons the conditions would not be good for either of you If you harm others because of this both will be hurt 
In battle there is much volatility and the conditions are difficult to predict The strong may overcome the weak or the weak may overcome the strong 
When a man in his vigor makes light of a poisonous snake how could he not hurt himself 
Some men are gentle by nature praised by women and children but when facing the enemy they become warriors as if oil had been poured onto a fire Do not make light of a weak enemy in battle thinking he is fit for nothing His physical strength may not be sufficient to rely on but the force of his strategy may be stronger 
Once there was an excellent king called Karandhama Sitting upright he gave rise to friendly thoughts yet he could subdue his enemies 
Even though he ruled over the four worlds and his fame and riches were abundant eventually all was destroyed just as an ox turns back when he has had enough to drink 
A victory in war increases resentment but after a victory of harmony there is no distress 
Your present bloodthirsty hostility this is absolutely not possible a Chapter XXVIII As you wish to bring worship to the Buddha you should follow the Buddhas forbearance  
Thus the brahman decidedly expressed his sincerity As his way was proper and his meaning was in agreement with what is reasonable he had spoken out without fear 
The kingsthen said to the brahman You have now skillfully responded to the occasion You are clever and makes much sense Your friendly and utterly honest words comply with the Law and rely on a strong principle 
Do listen to our explanation of our duty as a ruler One may feel contempt for a clash of strong forces competing due to the five desires or one must not hurry off to fight seeking some diversion 
We are fighting for the Law now What is astonishing about that 
When one is proud and disregards righteousness people in the world still humbly comply All the more so in the case of the Buddha who is free from pride and converts others to humility But we cannot bring him worship if we destroy ourselves 
In the past the rulers of the great earth the Vṛṣṇis and the Andhakas fought over a beautiful maiden and destroyed each other 
How much more should we now bring worship to our teacher who is in quietude free from desire Holding oneself dear and valuing life do not strive with force The former kings the Kauravas fought with the Pāṇḍavas and in the process they destroyed each other all due to their greed 
How much more do we further wish for life for the sake of our teacher who is without greed 
The son of a seer Rāma was angry at the thousandarmed king He destroyed the land and killed its people just because he was angry 
How much more should we value life for the sake of our teacher who is without anger 
Rāma killed the demons for the sake of Sītā 
The two demons Alāyudha and Baka were steadfast enemies Due only to their foolishness they greatly harmed beings 
How much more should we further value life for the sake of the wise teacher 
Among many others such ones senselessly ruined themselves How much more should the teacher of gods and humans now be revered by the b world all around Should we not diligently strive to bring worship considering ourselves and valuing life 
If you want to stop the fighting enter the city for us and urge them to open up  so that our wish is fulfilled 
You have appeased our minds for a while because of your right words just as a venomous snake is stopped for a while by the power of an incantation  
The brahman then accepted the kings instructions He entered the city and went to the Mallas He made polite inquiries and expressed his sincerity to them The kings among people outside all want to destroy this city 
But because of the Law they are still afraid of wrong behavior That is why they have sent me here Their purpose is to inform you of something 
 your land and neither do we seek cash possessions Nor out of pride and neither do we feel resentment in our hearts We have come here because we respect the great seer 
Since you know our intention why take pains to oppose us 
As both parties are the same as to whom they respect we are brothers in the Law Let us with all our hearts bring worship together to the bequeathed spirit of the Worldhonored One Stinginess concerning money is not the greatest fault 
Those who have decided not to be open should develop a way of hospitality But if you do not have the ways of a kṣatriya close the gates and guard yourselves  
They are all like this in expressing the way of their destiny 
I have my personal feelings but I have expressed their sincerity 
When the Worldhonored One was in the world he always taught forbearance If one does not comply with his noble teaching why would one use the term worship c Chapter XXVIII  
People in the world argue about the five desires about riches and lands and dwellings If one acts according to the Right Law one should follow its noble principle When one tries to act according to the Law but feels enmity this contradicts reason 
The Buddha is quiet and compassionate and he always wishes to put all at ease Yet by worship the One with Great Compassion you may bring great harm 
By complying with the Law your fame will spread 
If others behave wrongly you should bring harmony to them with the Law That then is happiness with the Law so that the Law may abide for a long time 
The Buddha has said that of all gifts the gift of the Law is most excellent People perform the giving of riches but it is difficult to perform the gift of the Law  
Your words which show friendliness and which comply with the Law are spoken in a refined and correct way in agreement with reason 
You have skillfully brought harmony to the contentions of both parties and have shown us the essential path just as when one controls a horse which has lost its way and returns to the correct way 
We should adopt this as reasonable and follow your explanation If we do not accept your sincere words we would certainly feel regret later  
They immediately opened the the Buddhas relics and divided them equally into eight parts They themselves brought worship to one part and the seven other parts were handed over to the brahman 
When the seven kings obtained the relics they rejoiced and accepted them to their heads  They took the relics and returned to their own countries There they erected stupas and brought worship 
He further asked the seven kings about the division of the eighth share a He took it  back and enshrined it in a caitya calling it the Shrine of the Golden Pitcher 
The people of Kuśinagara collected the remaining ashes and erected a caitya called the Ashes Shrine 
The eightstupas erected by the eight kings the Golden Pitcher and the Ashes in this way ten stupas were initially erected in Jambudvīpa 
The men and women of the whole country all held up a precious flowered parasol and brought worship to their stupas decorating them like the golden mountain  Night and day they brought lasting praise with all kinds of music 
At that time five hundred arhats had forever lost the protection of their great teacher They were afraid having no one on whom to rely and returned to Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa 
They gathered at the cliff of Lord akra and assembled the treasury of scriptural texts All together they promoted the elder nanda From the first to the last expositions of the Tathāgata great and small you have heard them all Vaideha muni proclaim them for the great assembly  
In the great assembly nanda ascended the lion throne Just as the Buddha had expounded his expositions he declared Thus have I heard  
They were moved by the sound  I have heard It was written down as expounded as to the doctrine as to the time as to the place and as to the persons present at the time of the teaching 
Finally they completed the treasury of the scriptural texts Through diligent application and study they all obtained nirvana The same applies to the nirvana one now obtains or will obtain 
When King Aśoka appeared in the world as an imposing person he could well cause sorrow As a gentle person he removed sorrow just like a blossoming aśoka tree 
Ruling over Jambudvīpa his mind was steadfastly without any worry and he deeply believed in the Right Law That is why he was named King Aśoka 
Progeny of the Mauryas he was born endowed with the correct nature He saved the world all around and erected shrines His former name was Caṇḍāśoka but his present name is Dharmāśoka 
b Chapter XXVIII  He opened the stupas of the seven kings to collect the relics He divided them and erected eightyfour thousand stupas in a day 
Only the eighth stupa situated in Rāmagrāma was guarded by divine dragons The king could not take those  
Even though he did not obtain its relics he knew that the Buddhas bequeathed spirit was there worshiped by divine dragons and his serene faith increased 
While the king ruled over the land he obtained the first noble fruition  He let all in the world everywhere bring worship to the Tathāgatas stupas In the past in the future and in the present all may obtain deliverance 
Those who respectfully brought worship to the Tathāgata when he was in the present world when he was in nirvana and to his relicstheir merits are equal and without any difference 
When a wise one profoundly observes the Tathāgatas qualities with a supreme mind when he cherishes his path and brings worship his merits will be excellent too 
When the Buddha had obtained his worthy excellent Law he was worthy of receiving everyones worship After he had reached the deathless place his believers were at ease too That is why all gods and humans should always bring worship 
The highest and most compassionate one has thorough insight into the highest meaning and saves all beings 
The suffering of birth old age illness and deathno suffering in the world surpasses these The suffering of death is the greatest suffering feared by gods 
When he is forever free from the two kinds of suffering  why not bring him worship 
The happiness of not having to experience a later experience is unsurpassed among any worldly happiness The endless round of birth is the greatest suffering This suffering is unequaled in the world 
The Buddha is free from the suffering of rebirth and neither will he experience the happiness of a later existence He has extensively shown this to the world Why not bring him worship c  
I have praised the most worthy of the munis and his acts throughout  I did not manifest my own understanding nor did I seek fame I have followed the explanations of the Buddhas scriptural texts in order to rescue the world 

The kings principal wife bore him a son called Rama 
His second wife had a son called Laksmana 
Crown Prince Rama who had the power of Narayana was very brave He also had candra  Hearing his voice or seeing his appearance could be harmful None could equal him 
Then the third wife bore a son called Bharata 
The fourth wife bore a son named Satrughna 
The king was very fond of his third wife He said to her Now as far as you are concerned I do not begrudge you any of my possessions 
If you need anything you have but to wish for it His wife replied I do not seek anything 
He immediately installed the crown prince Rama as king in his place So he tied hair and put the celestial cap on his head The ceremony was held according to the regulations pertaining to the enthronement of a king 
Then seeing that had recovered somewhat from his illness the kings younger wife became selfwilled Seeing that Rama had succeeded his father she grew jealous and so she told the king that she wanted him to fulfill the b promise he had made I want you to make my son king and dismiss Rama Upon hearing these words the king felt as if choked he could neither swallow nor spit 
He felt bound to dismiss his elder son but having installed him as king he quite rightly did not want to dismiss him 
However he had agreed earlier to grant her wish 
Never since his childhood had King Dasaratha gone back on his given word 
Moreover the kings rules did not allow double standards Once he had given his word he could not go back on it 
Bearing this in mind he dismissed Rama taking garment and cap away from him 
Then his brother Laksmana said to his eldest brother Brother you have great strength and you also have candra 
Why did you not use them in the face of this shame and  Parable  disgrace He replied to his younger brother I cannot be called a pious son if I go against my fathers wish 
Yes even though this mother may not have borne me my father treats her with respect She is like my own mother I am on very good terms with my brother Bharata We really have no disagreements 
I may have great strength and candra but I would rather agree with an improper action of my parents and brother than want to harm them When his younger brother heard these words he became silent 
Then King Dasaratha sent his two sons to a remote place in the mountains After twelve years they were to be allowed to return 
Rama and his brother complied with their fathers order Without resentment they took leave of their parents and went deep into the mountains 
Then Bharata who had been staying abroad until then was summoned back and made king 
But Bharata always was at peace with and obliging towards his two elder brothers He remained deeply deferential to them 
Only after his return home and after the king his father had died did he know that his mothers trickery had caused the dismissal of Rama from the throne and that it had expelled his two brothers to a faraway place He objected that his mothers action was against his principles Not making obeisance or kneeling before her he said to his mother Mother why did you in your action demand the contrary of what is right and why did you bring distress to our family Making obeisance before his eldest mother he showed respect and filial obedience twice as profound as usual 
Then Bharata led an army to the foot of the mountains He left his troops behind and went on by himself 
While his younger brother was coming Laksmana said to his elder brother In the past you have always praised our younger brother Bharatas righteousness and respect but today he leads his soldiers here and wants to exterminate us his brothers The elder brother said to Bharata Brother why do you now lead these troops here Bharata answered his elder brother I led my troops here because I was afraid of an encounter with bandits on the way 
I do not have anything else in mind but the wish that you O brother return home and take charge of the government Rama replied to his younger brother I was once ordered by my father to move to this faraway place 
Why should I now return so precipitously 
If I return too quickly it will not be called the righteousness of a benevolent son and a pious relative Such steadfastness did not deter Bharatas heartfelt request but his brothers mind was unshakable and his determination fixed 
When the younger brother knew that his brothers mind would never change he asked him for his shoes Disappointed and sorrowful he returned home with them Taking control of the government he always kept the shoes on the throne 
Day and night he called on to make inquiries just as if they were his brother himself 
He also sent messengers to the mountains to invite his brother to return 
But because their father had ordered them to return after twelve years the two brothers being utterly pious and completely loyal did not dare disobey the order the appointed time having not yet come 
Later when the years had gradually passed they knew that their younger brother had diligently sent invitations time and again and they also knew that he paid respect to the shoes as if they were a real person Convinced of the genuineness of their brothers feelings they returned home 
Upon their arrival Bharata even abdicated in favor of his elder brother 
The elder brother then resigned and said My father once gave you the throne 
It is not fitting for me to accept it The younger brother then resigned and said Brother you are the eldest son of the first wife The one to bear the burden of care and responsibility for his fathers affairs should rightly be his eldest son Thus they talked back and forth each bowing compliantly to the other 
The eldest brother could not counter the argument and so he became king after all 
The brothers were cordial and friendly and their virtuous example was widely followed Influenced by their morality the masses relied on them Influenced by their loyalty and piety people spurred themselves on to do their filial duty 
Even though Bharatas mother had devised a most evil plan they did not harbor  Parable  any resentment 
Because of this loyalty and piety wind and rain came in the right seasons and the five cereals were abundant Men suffered no epidemics and all the people in Jambudvipa were ten times more numerous and prosperous than usual Parable  
The Prince Who Saved His Parents with His Own Flesh Thus have I heard Once when the Buddha was in SravastI Ananda entered the city to beg for food wearing his robe and holding his alms bowl 
He saw a boy whose parents were blind When the boy had obtained some food by begging he offered the fine food to his parents and ate the coarse food himself 
Ananda said to the Buddha O Worldhonored One this boy is truly wonderful 
He presents the fine food he has begged to his parents and he picks the coarse food for himself The Buddha said This is not so hard 
When I supported my parents in the past that was extremely hard indeed Ananda said to the Buddha O Worldhonored One how was it that you supported your parents in the past The Buddha said Long ago there was a great king who ruled over the land 
The king had six sons Each one ruled over one state 
There was a high official then called Rahulagupta who schemed and raised an army He killed the great king and five of his sons 
the sixth the youngest son a spirit came who a told him Your father the great king and your five brothers have all been killed by the high official Rahulagupta He will come for you next On hearing this the prince returned home 
The princes wife saw that he did not look the same as usual but that he appeared distressed 
She asked her husband Why are you like that The husband replied to his wife Its a mans business I cannot tell you His wife said O prince I now share life and death with you 
What anxiety afflicts you that you do not speak to me The husband replied to his wife Recently a spirit came to me and said  Chapter I Your father the great king and your five brothers have all been killed by someone He will come for you next That is why I am distressed 
They took provisions for seven days calculating that this would suffice to reach their destination 
Led by their fear they followed a wrong road by mistake They traveled for ten days but still they had not arrived 
Their food was used up They were weary and starving their death was imminent 
The prince thought If all three of us remain alive the suffering will be enormous It would be better to kill one and to keep two alive He immediately drew his sword and was about to kill his wife when the son turned his head and saw his father 
He brought his palms together and said O father please do not kill my mother now I prefer that you kill me instead of taking my mothers life Because of the boys words the father wanted to kill his son 
The son then said Do not take my life If you take my life my flesh will rot before long I doubt whether mother will have reached her destination by then If you do not take my life I shall instantly slice a piece of myself 
Eat a little every day They had not yet reached a village and there were only three slices left of his bodys flesh The son said to his parents O father and mother eat these two slices of flesh Leave me the remaining slice Rejecting their child and leaving him on the ground his parents traveled on Then Sakra devanam indra his palace shaking saw this why 
Seeing this boys extraordinary behavior he took the form of a starving wolf and came to demand meat from him 
The boy thought If I eat this meat my life will end but if I do not eat it I shall die as well So he left the meat to the starving wolf Sakra devanam indra then took the form of a man and he said to the boy You sliced up your flesh and gave it to your parents 
Do you feel any regret now He answered that he did not regret it then said You are in pain now Who would believe that you do not feel any regret The boy then spoke the true words If I feel no regret then may my flesh grow again becoming as it was before 
Sakra devanam indra leading the son and his parents saw to it that they had a place to stay He saw that the heart of the king was filled with grief and joy Moved by this extreme piety and admiring its uniqueness he provided him with an army and gave him back his former country 
With the gradual support of Sakra devanam indra he became king of Jambudvipa 
I was that boy then 
The parents at that time are my present parents The Buddha said It is not only today that I praise compassion and piety 
For immeasurable kalpas I have always praised them The bhiksus said to the Buddha O Worldhonored One how was it that you supported your parents in the past The Buddha said Long ago in the land of the king of Kasi there was a high mountain 
His parents were old and they were both blind He used to offer them delicious fruit fresh blossoms and fine water He arranged a quiet place for them where they would not be afraid 
Whatever he did in his every movement whether going or staying he first told his parents 
Then king Brahmadatta went on a hunting trip When he saw a deer drinking water he pulled his bow and shot at it The poisoned arrow hit Syamaka by mistake Suffering from the poisoned arrow he called out loudly One arrow has killed three people 
How severe is this pain When the king heard his voice he threw his bow and arrows on the ground and went over to have a look at the one who had spoken these words 
I hear that in these mountains there is a sage called Syamaka who is compassionate benevolent and pious and who supports his blind parents He is praised everywhere in the world 
Now are you not Syamaka He replied Yes I am He said to the king My body does not think of pain now I only worry that my parents are old and see darkness Henceforth they will suffer hunger having no one to support them The king then asked Where are your blind parents now They are in yonder thatched hut Syamaka said pointing it out to the king 
 Chapter I The king went to where the blind parents were Syamakas father then said to his wife My eyes twitch 
Is our pious son Syamaka in some trouble The wife then said to her husband My breast is alarmed too 
Has some misfortune befallen our son Then the blind parents heard the king coming They were apprehensive and frightened in their hearts It is not our sons step 
Who is it The king came in front of them and he greeted them in a clear voice 
The blind parents said Our eyes see nothing 
Who greets us He answered I am the king of Kasi Then the blind parents bade the king to sit down If our son were here he would offer you O king fine blossoms and fruit 
We have waited for a long time but he has not come The king then wept sadly and spoke the stanzas I am the king of this land Hunting in these mountains I only wanted to shoot birds and beasts Without realizing it I hit a man 
Please do not feel any sorrow The blind parents replied to the king with the stanzas The compassion and pious obedience of our son does not exist in heaven or among people O king you may show pity but how can you be like our son 
Thereupon the king led the blind parents to Syamaka When they had reached the place where their child was they beat their breasts in grief 
They said with bitter tears Our son was compassionate and benevolent 
His pious obedience was beyond compare The spirits of heaven and of earth the spirits of mountains and of trees the spirits of rivers and of lakes all spirits spoke the stanza  Parable  O Sakra Brahma and Ruler of the World why do you not bring assistance You let our pious son suffer so 
Be deeply moved by our pious son and quickly save his life 
Then Sakra devanam indra his palace shaking heard with his heavenly ear the sad words of the blind parents and he descended from heaven 
He went to where they were and said to Syamaka Do you have ill feelings toward the king He answered Truly I do not have ill feelings Sakra devanam indra said Who would believe that you do not have ill feelings Syamaka answered If I have ill feelings toward the king may the poison spread through my body 
That is how I shall die If I do not have ill feelings toward the king may the poisoned arrow leave my body and the wound heal Then just as he had said the poisoned arrow came out by itself and he recovered becoming as he had been before 
The king was very glad His joy was endless He then issued an order announcing it throughout the country that one should cultivate compassion and benevolence and piously serve ones parents Syamaka had always supported his parents with compassion benevolence and pious obedience 
If you want to know who the blind father at that time was he is the present king Suddhodana 
The blind mother at that time is a his wife Maya 
Syamaka is now I 
The king of Kasi is Sariputra 
The one who was Sakra devanam indra is Mahakasyapa Parable  
The Little Parrot That Supported Its Blind Parents When the Buddha was in Rajagrha he told the bhiksus There are two kinds of misbehaving people who will fall into hell as swiftly as one can hit a ball 
Which two 
The first kind do not support their parents and the second kind commit evil acts against their parents 
There are two kinds of people who conduct themselves properly and who will be born in heaven as swiftly as one can hit a ball 
The first kind support their parents and the second kind perform beneficial acts for their parents The bhiksus said It is wonderful O Worldhonored One that you the Tathagata so highly praise parents The Buddha said Not only now 
In the past in the Snowy Mountains there was a parrot whose parents were both blind He used to bring fine blossoms and fruit and offer them first to his parents 
Then there was a farmer When he had just sown his grain he made a vow that he would share the grain he had sown with all beings But while that farmer started out with generous thoughts the little parrot often came and picked grain out of the field in order to give it to its parents When the farmer examined his crop and saw where insects and birds had been at his grain he became angry and vexed 
The little parrot said O farmer you started out with good intentions being generous and not stingy That is why I ventured to approach to pick the grain 
Why am I now caught in your net 
Suppose that a field were a mother that the seed were a father and that their fruit were the son If the farmer were a king he should protect them When the parrot had spoken these words the farmer was glad He asked the parrot When you take this grain for whom is it really The parrot answered I have blind parents 
I wish to give the grain to them The farmer answered From now on you can always have the grain 
Do not expect any more trouble The Buddha said Parrots enjoy the seeds of many fruits and so does a field 
At that time I was that parrot 
The farmer was Sariputra 
The blind father was king Suddhodana 
The blind mother was Maya Parable  
The Country Called RejectionoftheAged The Buddha was in Sravastl 
Then the Worldhonored One said these words Honoring the aged is very beneficial You may never have heard this but you will understand it 
Ones fame reaches far  Parable  and one is respected by the wise The bhiksus said O Tathagata b Worldhonored One you always praise respect for ones parents for the old and the aged The Buddha said Not only now 
In past immeasurable kalpas I have always honored my parents the old and the aged The bhiksus said to the Buddha How is it that you honored them in the past The Buddha said In the past long ago there was a country called RejectionoftheAged 
There was a high official whose father had grown old and according to the law of the country he had to send him away 
But the high officials pious obedience could not allow that So he dug deep into the earth and made a secret room He placed his father in it and cared for him at all times Then a heavenly spirit seized two snakes put them in the kings palace and said If you can tell the male from the female your country will be at peace 
If you cannot do that you and your whole country will be destroyed after seven days Upon hearing this the king felt distressed and consulted his ministers about this matter All apologized for not being able to tell them apart 
Then he made an appeal to the country saying Who can tell them apart We shall generously reward him with high rank The high official returned home and went to ask his father 
The father answered his son It is easy to tell them apart 
Catch them with something fine and soft 
The one who makes trouble know that he is the male one 
The one who does not move know that she is the female one The son did as he had been told and he could indeed tell the male from the female The heavenly spirit then asked Who is called awakened by the sleeping 
Who is called asleep by the awakened The king and his ministers again could not give an explanation He again appealed to the country but nobody could answer the question The high official asked his father What do these words mean His father said This refers to the one in training 
By the common people he is called awakened and by the arhats he is called asleep In accordance with these words he then replied to the heavenly spirit who further asked What is the weight of this big white  Chapter I c elephant The ministers talked it over but no one knew 
He appealed to the country too but again they did not know The high official asked his father and his father said Put the elephant on a boat and place it on a great lake Draw a mark on the boat at water level how deep it is Then measure the displacement by placing rocks in the boat 
When it sinks into the water down to the mark you will know the weight With this knowledge he then gave the answer to the heavenly spirit who further asked With one scoop of water one has more than the ocean 
Who knows this The ministers talked it over but again they could not solve it Again he appealed everywhere but no one knew The high official asked his father What do these words mean His father said These words are easy to solve 
If someone who is very devout and pure gives a scoop of water to the Buddha and his Sangha to his parents and to the sick in distress this meritorious deed counts for an indefinite number of kalpas The merit he will experience is inexhaustible 
There may be a great deal of water in the sea but that does not surpass one kalpa 
It follows from this that one can say that one scoop of water is infinitely bigger than the ocean The high official then gave these words as a reply to the heavenly spirit The heavenly spirit then changed to a starving man Laboriously dragging his weary limbs he asked Are there any people in the world hungrier and leaner than I The ministers thought it over but again could not answer 
With these words the official then answered the heavenly spirit The heavenly spirit then changed to a man whose hands and feet were in shackles and who had chains around his neck Fire emerged from his body and his whole figure was scorched He asked Are there people in the world who suffer more than I The ministers were in a flurry and no one knew the answer 
The high official again asked his father and his father answered In the world there are people who are not pious toward their parents and who hurt their masters They rebel against their husbands and defame the three honorable things In a future world they will fall into hell where there are mountains that are swords trees with swords a blazing wagon burning coals a salty river bubbling excrement a bladestrewn path and a blazing path 
Thus is their suffering immeasurable endless and untold 
The official then answered the heavenly spirit with these words The heavenly spirit then changed into a woman She was upright and admirable excelling everyone She asked Is there anyone in the world more upright than I The ministers were silent 
The official then asked his father a and his father replied That is easy to find out 
Put it in water The root end will surely sink and the tail end will surely come up The official gave these words as a reply to the heavenly spirit The heavenly spirit then asked about two white mares that looked identical Which is the mother and which is the child The ministers again could not answer 
again asked his father and his father replied Give them grass to eat The mother will surely refuse the grass and give it to her child He answered all these questions and the heavenly spirit was pleased 
He left a large amount of valuables and wealth for the king and said to him I shall protect your country now so that no foreign enemy can raid it When the king heard this he was extremely happy and asked his official Did you know all this yourself or did someone instruct you 
Relying on your vast knowledge my country will remain at peace I have obtained riches and I also have a promise that we will be protected This I owe to you The official answered the king It is not my knowledge If you will please see to it that I do not have to be afraid I will be so bold as to give a full explanation The king said Even if you had committed a crime ten thousand times punishable by death it still would not matter let alone a small transgression The official informed the king In our country there is a regulation that does not allow us to take care of the aged 
I have an old father I could not bear leaving bim behind I have offended against the kings law and I have kept him hidden under the ground 
When I came to give you the answers they were all my fathers knowledge You do not owe it to me 
I wish that you O great king would allow the whole country to take care of the aged The king immediately gave his consent His heart was glad and he respectfully took care of his officials father He respected him as his master You have saved my nation and the lives of all its people 
Such beneficence is beyond my knowledge He immediately proclaimed and announced everywhere in the world that one  Parable  b must not leave the aged behind 
Those who lacked piety toward their parents or who did not respect their masters had to undergo heavy punishment At that time I was that father 
The official was Sariputra 
The king was Ajatasatru 
The heavenly spirit was Ananda Parable  
The Buddha Expounds the Doctrine to His Mother Maya in the Trayastrimsa Heaven When the Buddha was in Sravasti he informed the bhiksus I now want to go to the Trayastrimsa Heaven and stay there for the summer retreat to expound the Doctrine to my mother 
He stayed underneath a tree for the summer retreat expounding the Doctrine to his mother Maya and to countless gods When they had all gained insight into the Truths he returned to Jambudvipa 
The bhiksus said Wonderful O Worldhonored One that you can stay in the Trayastrimsa Heaven for ninety days for the sake of your mother The Buddha said Not only now but also in the past have I removed suffering from my mother Then the bhiksus said to the Buddha What is it that you have done in the past The Buddha said In the past long ago in the Snowy Mountains there was a monkey king who ruled over five hundred monkeys 
Then a monkey hunter spread his nets surrounded them and captured them 
The monkey king said Dont be afraid now I shall destroy these nets for you 
You monkeys all come with me He immediately broke the nets and all were released 
There was an old monkey who lost her footing while carrying her child and fell into a deep pit 
The monkey king searching for the mother did not know where she was Seeing a deep pit he went over to its edge to have a look He saw that the mother was down below and said to the monkeys You should all make the effort  Chapter I together we can help the mother to get out The monkeys then grasped each other by the tail and reached the bottom of the pit They pulled the mother up and she got out freed from her hardship 
How much more have I now pulled my mother out of her hardship 
At that time they pulled her out from the hardship of a deep pit but now I have pulled my mother out of the hardship of the three unwholesome destinations The Buddha informed the bhiksus Saving ones parents has great merit 
Because I have pulled out my mother I shall always be free from hardship having brought about my realization of Buddhahood 
Therefore O bhiksus you must all take care of your parents with pious obedience Parable  
The Buddhas Explanation about His Former Mother Kacangala At that time the Buddha was on a journey When he arrived in Chuhelo he sat down under a tree along the road 
There was an old woman called Kacangala who was dependent on someone else She was drawing water from a well 
The Buddha told Ananda to go and ask her for water 
When the old woman heard that the Buddha had asked for water she took the pitcher herself When she reached the Buddhas place she put the pitcher on the ground and went straight to the Buddha to take him in her arms 
Ananda wanted to block the way but the Buddha said Do not block her way 
This old woman was my mother for five hundred births She has not yet stopped loving me That is why she takes me in her arms 
If you block her way the blood will come gushing from her mouth and her life will end immediately After she had taken the Buddha in her arms she touched his hands and feet and stood aside 
The Buddha told Ananda to go and call her master 
When her master arrived he made a deep bow and withdrew and stood aside 
The Buddha said to the master Let this old woman go so that she can become a nun 
If she becomes a nun she will attain arhatship The master then let her go 
The Buddha told Ananda to hand her over to the bhiksuni Prajapatl so that she  Parable  would be converted to the homeless state 
Soon after she obtained the path of arhatship Among bhiksunis she had the best understanding of the sutras 
c The bhiksus wondered about this and said to the Buddha O Worldhonored One for what reason was she dependent on someone else and why did she obtain arhatship The Buddha said At the time of Kasyapa Buddha she left her home to study the path 
At that time she was at the head of a crowd scolding noble and excellent nuns as though they were servants For this reason she is now dependent on someone else 
Through five hundred births she has always remained my mother stingy and envious checking my generosity For this reason she always lives in poverty 
It is not only now that I have pulled her out of her poverty The bhiksus said We are wondering how you pulled her out of poverty in the past The Buddha said In the past in Benares there was a poor family 
The son used to support his mother with his wages They had some wealth and could meet their everyday expenses 
Then the son said to his mother I now want to go on a far journey with merchants to trade His mother agreed Thereupon he left 
After the son had left bandits came and destroyed the house They stole the familys possessions and also drove the old woman out to sell her to someone else 
After the son had returned he made inquiries about his mother When he found out where she was he offered a large sum of money for her and redeemed her with great effort Now back in their homeland they had sufficient wealth twice as much as before 
The mother at that time is now Kacangala 
I was the son 
That was the time I pulled my mother out of misery Parable  
Maitrakanyaka Once the Buddha was in Rajagrha and he told the bhiksus If one supports his parents even a little the merit obtained is immeasurable 
If one is even a little disobedient the evil obtained is immeasurable  Chapter I The bhiksus said to the Buddha O Worldhonored One what are these evil or meritorious retributions The Buddha said When I lived in the past a long time ago in Benares there was a child of a venerable person called Maitrakanyaka 
As his plans and devices gradually improved he got four cash per day and offered them to his mother 
Thereupon he again improved little by little He got eight cash a day and presented them to his mother 
He gradually became trusted by everyone From far and near they went to him and the profits he made grew more and more When he had sixteen cash a day he presented them to his mother Everyone saw that he was bright and virtuous and they advised him When your father was alive he used to go to sea to gather riches 
Why do you not go to sea now   ia Having heard these words he said to his mother When my father was alive what used to be his occupation His mother said When your father was alive he went to sea to collect riches He then said to his mother If my father went to sea to collect riches then why dont I go to sea now Seeing that her child was compassionate and benevolent that he was pious and obedient the mother thought that he would not go so she said jokingly Its alright for you to go Hearing these words from his mother he told her that his mind was made up 
When the preparations were finished he took leave of his mother 
The mother then said My only child wait until I have died 
How can I let you go The son replied to his mother If you had not given me your permission first I would have presumed my plan to be wrong 
I hope I shall die having established my trustworthiness in this life Since permission has been granted I do not have to stay any longer The mother saw her childs determination Clasping his feet and weeping she said How can you go away without waiting for my death But the child was determined 
He pulled her away from  Parable  b his feet with his hands pulling out dozens of his mothers hairs 
The mother feared that her child had committed an offense and let him go 
Together with merchants he then went to sea 
They reached a wealthy island and obtained a great many precious things Together with his companions he then started on his way back There were two routes 
One way went by sea and one way went over land 
Everyone said to take the overland route and so they followed the way over land 
There was a rule in that country that when brigands robbed merchants and captured their leader all the merchants and their goods would belong to the brigands 
If they did not capture the leader of the merchants even though they had taken the goods they would return all the goods when the merchants leader had returned 
For that reason Maitrakanyaka always left their camp and lodged elsewhere for the night When the merchants got up in the morning they came to meet him and took him along 
One night there had been a storm and the merchants got up in a hurry forgetting to take him along 
The leader of the merchants stayed behind and was left unaccompanied He did not know the way 
Seeing that there was a mountain he went to its top and saw that in the distance there was a town its color that of dark lapis lazuli Exhausted by hunger and thirst he hurried to it 
In that town there were four beautiful girls They all came out to welcome him with wishgranting gems songs and music He experienced great joy for four times ten thousand years 
Then he naturally grew weary and wanted to leave 
The beautiful girls said You people of Jambudvipa are so ungrateful Having lived with us for four times ten thousand years how can you abandon us one morning and go away He did not care for their words and left 
He saw a crystallike town There were eight beautiful girls who welcomed him also with wishgranting gems and music He was extremely happy for eight times ten thousand years but he became bored and abandoned them and went away 
He reached a silvercolored town There were sixteen beautiful girls who welcomed him as before with sixteen wishgranting  Chapter I gems He experienced great joy for sixteen times ten thousand years Yet he abandoned them too 
He reached a golden city There were thirtytwo beautiful girls who welcomed him as before with thirtytwo wishgranting gems Again he experienced great joy for thirtytwo times ten thousand years Yet he wanted to abandon them too 
You had better stay Upon hearing these words he thought them over saying The beautiful girls say these words because they are fond of me If I keep going there shall certainly be a nicer place He then went away In the distance he saw an iron city He became suspicious and thought It may be iron on the outside but it may be very nice inside He went on slowly and approached the city 
When the barrier of the gate had come down there was someone inside with a burning wheel on his head He took this burning wheel off put it on the head of kanyaka and immediately went away 
Maitrakanyaka asked the jailer When can I get rid of this wheel I am carrying The jailer answered When there is someone in the world who has done evil as well as meritorious acts as you have done when he has gone to sea to gather riches and has passed through cities no matter whether this was long ago or recently as in your case only then will he come here and experience this evil instead of you 
This iron wheel will never fall on the ground Maitrakanyaka asked What merits did I perform and what evil did I do The jailer answered Formerly in Jambudvipa you supported your mother with your two cash a day 
For four times ten thousand years you experienced their delights Because you supported your mother with four cash you got a crystallike town eight wishgranting gems and eight  Parable  beautiful girls For eight times ten thousand years you experienced their joys 
Because you supported your mother with eight cash you got a silvercolored city sixteen wishgranting gems and sixteen beautiful girls For sixteen times ten thousand years you experienced happiness 
Because you supported your mother with sixteen cash you got a golden city thirtytwo wishgranting gems and thirtytwo beautiful girls For thirtytwo times ten thousand years you experienced great joy 
Because you pulled out your mothers hair you now have to carry a burning wheel of iron that has never fallen on the ground 
When someone comes to take your place then you may discard it  further asked Are there now in this prison some who experience their own evil the way I do The jailer replied Countless hundreds and thousands Their number is incalic culable Having heard these words he thought I shall never escape I wish that all who have to experience suffering would put their entire burden on myself When he had had this thought the iron wheel fell on the ground 
Maitrakanyaka said to the jailer You said that his wheel has never fallen 
Why did it fall now The jailer became angry and he beat Maitrajkanyaka on the head with an iron prong His life subsequently came to an end and he was reborn in the Tusita Heaven 
If you want to know Maitrakanyaka was myself  bhiksus you must know that a small unwholesome deed done to ones parents leads to a considerable unpleasant retribution 
The merit one obtains for giving them a little support is immeasurable 
bring offerings to your parents diligently and with all your heart Parable  
The Lady Padmavati When the Buddha was in SravastI he told the bhiksus The angry thoughts one produces toward his parents or toward the Buddha and his disciples will make one fall into the Kalasutra Hell 
The suffering one will experience is immeasurable and without end  Chapter I The bhiksus asked the Buddha O Worldhonored One one may respect ones parents but if one is disrespectful toward ones parents and does something unwholesome what then The Buddha said Countless ages ago in the past there was a sage in the Snowy Mountains called Dvaipayana 
This Brahman used to urinate on the rocks Containing semen the urine dripped into a rocky cave 
There was a doe that came to lick the place and she became pregnant 
When the time had come she came to the foot of the sages cave dwelling and gave birth to a daughter She left her mothers womb wrapped in flowers She was upright and very beautiful 
When the sage realized that she was his daughter he took her in and fed her Gradually she grew up When she could walk lotus flowers sprang up wherever her feet touched the ground 
It was a rule for Brahmans always to keep a fire burning at night One night by accident the fire went out and disappeared The girl went to another house to ask for fire 
When the neighbor saw that there were lotus flowers in her footprints he said If you go seven times around my house I shall give you fire She then made seven rounds and returned home with the fire When King Udayana went on a hunting trip he saw that that mans house had seven rows of lotus flowers Finding this strange he asked him Why does your house have these lotus flowers The man then replied to the king The daughter of the Brahman in the mountains came to ask for fire 
These lotus flowers sprang up under her feet Following her footprints to where the sage was the king saw that the girl was upright and very beautiful 
He said to a the sage Give me this girl So he gave her and said to the king She will bear you five hundred sons whereupon the king installed her as his wife Among the five hundred ladies of the palace she was the best by far 
The first wife of the king was very jealous of the daughter of the doe and she said O king you love her now but if she bears you five hundred sons you will respect her twice as much Not long  Parable  thereafter the daughter of the doe produced five hundred eggs and put them in a basket 
Then the first wife took five hundred lumps of wheat flour and put them in place of the eggs She sealed up a basket marked it and threw it into the River Ganges 
When the king asked his wife what the daughter of the doe had produced she answered that she had produced only lumps of wheat flour 
The king said The sage has lied He relieved his wife of her official duties and she did not meet the king anymore Then downstream King Saptabhu was enjoying himself with his court ladies on the banks of the river 
He saw the basket coming and said This basket belongs to me The ladies said O king take the basket now We shall take what is in the basket He sent someone to take the basket To each of his five hundred ladies he gave an egg The eggs opened by themselves and in them there were fine looking boys 
The sons said Why do you feel sad The king said The world I live in now is oppressed by someone The sons asked By whom is it oppressed The king said King Udayana 
He always persecutes me with demands for tribute The sons said If you want to demand tribute from all the kings of Jambudvipa we can make them pay tribute to you O king Why O king should you pay tribute to someone else Thereupon the five hundred warriors led their army to attack King Udayana 
King Udayana was afraid and he said I could not withstand even one warrior let alone five hundred warriors Then he made an appeal in the country for someone who might be capable of driving away this enemy 
He went to where the sage was and said to the sage The country is in great peril 
How can it be driven off The sage replied Do you have an enemy who opposes you The king said King Saptabhu has five hundred warriors They all lead an army to attack me and I do not have the warriors to confront  Chapter I them 
Do you know a stratagem that can drive away the enemy The sage answered You might ask the lady Padmavati back 
She can drive away the enemy The king said How can she drive them away The sage   b answered Those five hundred warriors are all your sons 
Your first wife was jealous She rejected the sons borne by Padmavati and placed them on the river 
King Saptabhu took them out downstream and raised them till they attained manhood 
Place it in front of your army They will submit by themselves In agreement with the sages words the king then returned and confessed his faults to the lady Padmavati After confessing his faults he adorned the lady and gave her fine clothes to wear He made her mount a big white elephant and placed it in front of his army 
The five hundred warriors raised their bows to shoot but their hands stiffened of themselves and they could not bend anymore They were very startled 
The sage came flying in the sky and said to the warriors Do not raise your hands Do not feel any malice If you feel malice you will all fall into hell 
This king and his lady are your parents The mother then put her hands on her breasts Each breast had two hundred fifty nipples which all went into the mouths of her sons 
They then showed repentance to their parents and they felt ashamed They all became pratyekabuddhas The two kings also spontaneously reached awakening and they too became pratyekabuddhas I was that sage 
At that time I protected the sons so that they did not feel malice toward their parents and they became pratyekabuddhas 
Now I also praise the virtue of supporting ones parents Parable  
The Lady Mrgankavatl The Buddha informed the bhiksus on Mount Grdhrakuta near Rajagrha There are two ways for men to succeed quickly at becoming a man or a god or reaching the happiness of nirvana 
 Parable  There are two ways that quickly make a man fall into the three unwholesome destinations experiencing terrible suffering They asked Which are the two ways for men to succeed quickly at becoming a man or a god or reaching the happiness of nirvana The Buddha said One is to support ones parents and the other is to honor the noble What are the two ways that quickly make men fall into the three unwholesome destinations experiencing terrible suffering The Buddha said One is to do any evil to ones parents and the other is to do evil to the noble The bhiksus said to the Buddha O Worldhonored One how is this quick accomplishment of the wholesome and the unwholesome achieved The Buddha said to the bhiksus In the past uncountable ages ago there was a country called Benares 
At that time a Brahman lived on the mountain He used to urinate on a rock Afterwards there was some semen that fell on the place of urination A doe came to lick it and immediately became pregnant 
When c the time had come came to where the sage was and gave birth to a daughter She was upright and very beautiful but her feet were like a deers feet The Brahman took her in fed her and let her grow up 
It is a rule for Brahmans always to serve the fire so that it does not go out 
While the girl was keeping the fire burning she became distracted and let the fire go out 
She was afraid fearing the B rahm an s anger 
There was another Brahman who lived one krosa away from there The girl hurried to that Brahman and asked him for fire 
When the Brahman saw that there were lotus flowers in her footprints he said to the girl If you go seven times around my house I shall give you fire 
When you leave also make seven rounds but do not walk in your first footprints Go back along another road Having done as he asked she went away with the fire Then when King Brahmadatta was out on a hunting trip he saw that the house of that Brahman was completely surrounded by fourteen rows of lotus flowers He also saw two roads each with a row of lotus flowers and he wondered why 
He asked the  Chapter I Brahman You have no pond at all 
How did you come by these lovely lotus flowers He answered Over there where the sage lives there is a girl She came to ask me for fire In each of this girls footprints lotus flowers grew So I told her If you want fire go around my house seven times 
When you leave make seven more rounds That is how I came by these rows of lotus flowers The king followed the footprints with flowers to where the Brahman was and he asked to see his daughter 
Seeing that she was upright he was very pleased and he asked the Brahman for this daughter 
After a while she became pregnant and the diviner foretold that she would give birth to a thousand sons When the first wife of the king heard these words she became jealous and devised a scheme In her great kindness she called the attendants who were near the lady Mrgankavatl and gave them many riches and precious things 
Then when the time had come the lady Mrgankavatl gave birth to a lotus with a thousand petals 
When she was about to give birth the first wife blindfolded her and did not allow her to see for herself She took putrid horse lungs and placed them underneath her She put the lotus with a thousand petals in a box and she threw it into a river Upon her return she removed the blindfold and said Look what you have borne The lady saw only a lump of putrid horse lungs 
The king sent someone to ask what she had borne and the messenger replied She just bore some putrid horse lungs Then the first wife said to the king O king do you enjoy being fooled by what this animal has borne It was raised by a sage but it has borne this inauspicious filthy a thing The kings first wife then relieved this lady of her official duties and forbade her any further audience 
He had collected the tribute and was about to dispatch it by messenger When he was about to leave the sons said What are you going to do The king then replied I am going to pay tribute to King Brahmadatta The sons all said If you had one son you might hope to subdue the world so that tribute would come to you 
But having us a thousand sons why must you pay tribute to somebody else The thousand sons immediately led their army to subdue several countries and they gradually came to the land of King Brahmadatta 
When the king heard that the army was there he made an appeal in his country for someone who could drive away such an enemy 
Not a single person could drive them away 
When the second wife received the appeal she said I can drive them away When asked How can you drive them away the wife replied Just make a platform one thousand feet high for me When I sit on it I am certain that I can drive them away When they had made the platform the second wife sat down on it 
Then when the thousand sons wanted to raise their bows to shoot they could not raise their hands 
The wife said Do not raise your hands against your parents I am your mother The thousand sons asked By what proof can we know our mother She answered If I put my hands on my breasts and if each breast has five hundred nipples that all go into your mouths I am your mother 
If this is not so I am not your mother Then she put both hands on her breasts On each breast there were five hundred nipples They went into the mouths of the thousand sons Nobody in the rest of the army could do this 
The thousand sons submitted and showed repentance toward their parents 
Thereupon the sons were in harmonious union and there was no enmity between the two countries any more They agreed that  Chapter I five hundred sons stay with their real parents and that five hundred sons stay with their foster parents 
Then the two kings divided Jambudvipa each raising five hundred sons The Buddha said If you want to know the thousand sons at that time are the thousand Buddhas of the bhadrakalpa 
The jealous wife who blindfolded the others eyes is a scaly blind b dragon 
The father was Suddhodana and the mother was his wife Maya The bhiksus said to the Buddha What reason was there that this girl was born from the womb of a doe and that lotus flowers grew under her feet 
Furthermore why did she become a kings wife The Buddha said In the past this girl was bom into a poor family 
Both mother and daughter were weeding the field when they saw a pratyekabuddha begging for food with his alms bowl The mother said to her daughter I want to take my share of food from the house and give it to this fine man The daughter said Take my share too and give it to him The mother returned home to take the shares of food of both mother and daughter and to give them to the pratyekabuddha 
The daughter gathered plants and flowers and spread them out to make a seat for him She scattered the flowers for him and bade the pratyekabuddha sit down 
The daughter wondered why her mother was late and she climbed to a high place She saw her mother in the distance Having seen her mother she said to her Why dont you hurry 
You are coming with a deers gait When her mother had arrived she objected to her mothers slowness So she was irritated and said I would rather be born to a doe than to my mother The mother then gave the two shares of food to the pratyekabuddha Mother and daughter both ate what was left 
When the pratyekabuddha had finished eating he threw his bowl into the air and flew away In the air he changed his appearance eighteen times 
The mother was delighted and made a vow May I always have noble children in the future just like the noble one now Through this karmic causality she later gave birth to five hundred children who all became pratyekabuddhas While on the  Parable  one hand she was a foster mother on the other hand she was the mother of those she had given birth to 
Because of her remark mentioning her mothers deer gait she was conceived in a does womb her feet resembling the hooves of a deer 
Because she had gathered flowers and scattered them for a pratyekabuddha a hundred lotus flowers grew in her footsteps 
Because she had spread out the plants she always got to be a kings wife 
The mother later became King Brahmadatta and the daughter later became the lady Mrgankavatl 
Through this karmic causality she later gave birth to the thousand noble ones of the bhadrakalpa 
Through the power of the vow she always bore noble ones Having heard these words the bhiksus were glad and paid their respects

When this girl was bom she had great merits and they gave her the name Bhadra 
As she grew up she had great respect for the a kasaya  
Because of her respect for the kasaya she left home and became a bhiksuni 
She did not meet the Buddha but through diligent development she obtained arhatship 
Since she regretted not having met the Buddha she went to where the Buddha was and expressed her regret to the Buddha 
The Buddha said I have already accepted your regret at another time The bhiksus were surprised and asked the Buddha Why did this excellent bhiksuni never meet the Buddha after she left home 
Today she meets the Buddha and expresses regret Why The Buddha then explained why 
Long ago there was a white elephant with six tusks who had many herds 
This white elephant had two wives One was called Bhadra and the other Subhadra 
Roaming through the forest he came across lotus flowers and he wanted to give them to Bhadra but Subhadra took them away 
When Bhadra saw that Subhadra took the flowers she became jealous That elephant loves Subhadra and he does not love me In those mountains there was a Buddhist pagoda where Bhadra used to gather flowers and offer them And she made avow saying When I am bom among people I shall remember my previous life and pull out the tusks of this white elephant So she went to the top of a mountain hit herself and died 
Later she was bom as a daughter in the family of the king of Videha and she remembered her previous life 
When she had grown up she became the wife of King Brahmadatta Remembering her previous resentment she said to Brahmadatta If you give me ivory for my couch I shall be very lively 
If  Chapter II not I cannot be lively King Brahmadatta then summoned hunters saying that if anyone could come back with ivory he would give him a hundred taels of gold Immediately a hunter deceptively put on a kasaya took his bow and poisoned arrows under his arm and went to where the elephants were Then the elephant wife Subhadra saw the hunter and she said to the elephant king Someone is coming The elephant king asked What clothes does he wear She answered He wears a kasaya 
The elephant king said In the kasaya there is sure to be goodness and no evil Thus the hunter could come nearer and he shot a poisoned arrow 
Subhadra said to her husband You said that there is goodness in the kasaya not evil What of this then He answered It is not the kasayas fault 
It is the fault of mental vexation Subhadra then wanted to hurt that hunter but the elephant king spoke all manner of soothing words preaching the Dharma and he did not let her hurt him 
Furthermore he was afraid that his herd of five hundred elephants would surely kill this hunter and he hid him under a precipice He sent the entire herd of five hundred elephants far away He asked the hunter What do you want by shooting me He answered I do not want anything 
Because King Brahmadatta wants your tusks I came wishing to take them away The elephant said Take them quickly The hunter replied I do not dare take them myself 
Such is the compassion I was brought up with that b if I take them myself my hands will become inflamed and fall off The white elephant immediately turned toward a place with tall trees and pulled out his tusks himself twisting them with his trunk He gave them making a vow With the gift of my tusks I vow that in the future I shall pull out the tusks of the three poisons from all living beings The hunter took the tusks and gave them to King Brahmadatta When his wife received these tusks she began to feel regret and she said How could I take the tusks of this excellent one possessed of a pure morality Greatly developing her virtues she pledged I wish that in the future he may attain the moment of  Parable  becoming a Buddha 
For his Doctrine I shall leave my family to apply myself to the path obtaining arhatship You should know that I was that white elephant 
Devadatta was the hunter at that time 
Bhadra is the present bhiksuni 
Bhiksuni Yasodhara was Subhadra Parable  
The Hare That Roasted Itself and Offered Itself to a Great Sage In SravastI there was an elders son who had left his family to devote himself to the Buddhas Doctrine but he always liked his kinsmen in his neighborhood He did not like to work with men of the path nor did he like to read scriptural texts or to practice the path 
The Buddha ordered this bhiksu to go to an aranyaka place diligently develop himself and obtain arhatship endowed with the six superknowledges 
The bhiksus were surprised and said to the Buddha O Worldhonored One your appearance in the world is wonderful It is extraordinary 
You can accommodate such an elders son making him obtain arhatship in an aranyaka place and become endowed with the six superknowledges The Buddha said to the bhiksus It is not only now that I can accommodate someone I did so already long ago The bhiksus said to the Buddha We wonder how you O Worldhonored One accommodated someone in the past The Buddha said to the bhiksus In the past there was a sage who lived in a mountain forest 
Then there was a severe drought and the fruits of the trees and plants the roots and stalks and the branches and leaves all withered away in the mountains 
At that time the sage was friendly with a hare and he said to the hare I want to go to the village to beg for food The hare said Do not go 
I shall give you food Thereupon the hare collected a stack of firewood and said to the sage You must take my food The rain will come Stay for three days and the flowers and fruits will come out again Then you can gather food 
 Chapter II When the sage saw this he thought This hare is friendly and c benevolent It is my best companion It gave up its life to be my food That is truly a difficult feat Then the sage became very miserable and he took the hare and ate it 
Because the bodhisattva had done this arduous and painful deed the palace of Sakra devanam indra shook and he thought Why does my palace shake now He looked into the matter and he knew that the hare had indeed done a difficult deed He was moved by its deed and he immediately caused it to rain 
The sage subsequently went and ate fruits again 
He then developed himself and obtained the five superknowledges If you want to know who the sage with the five superknowledges was he is the present bhiksu 
I was the hare at that time 
Because I gave myself up I made the sage stay in an aranyaka place and I let him obtain the five superknowledges 
Why should I not today be able to make this bhiksu leave his kinsmen and stay in an aranyaka place letting him gain arhatship and obtain the six superknowledges Parable  
The Good Monkey and the Evil Monkey When the Buddha was in Rajagrha the bhiksus said to the Buddha O Worldhonored One if one relies on Devadatta one always obtains suffering 
But if one relies on you O Tathagata Worldhonored One one obtains happiness now and later one is bom in a wholesome place and obtains the path of deliverance The Buddha informed the bhiksus Not only now 
In the past there were two monkeys who each had five hundred dependents 
A prince of KasI happened to be on a hunting trip He surrounded them and was going to get at them 
One a good monkey said to the other an evil monkey If we cross this river now we can escape from our difficulties The evil monkey said I cannot cross it The good monkey said to his monkeys The trunk and branches of the vetra tree are very long So grasp its branches He let his five hundred dependents cross 
The evil monkeys dependents were caught by the prince because they did not cross 
 Parable  At that time the good monkey was myself 
The evil monkey was Devadatta and the dependents he led knew suffering at that time For those who rely on him now it is the same 
Those who relied on me then experienced happiness for a long time Now they obtain fame and they are honored In the future they will obtain deliverance as men or gods 
Those who relied on Devadatta experienced decay for a long time In their present existence they obtain a bad reputation and people do not honor them In the future they will fall into the three unwholesome destinations 
Therefore  bhiksus stay away from evil acquaintances and befriend virtuous ones 
A virtuous acquaintance gives others safety and happiness for a long time 
Therefore one should befriend a virtuous acquaintance 
Stay away from an evil acquaintance 
An evil acquaintance torments and consumes you In the present world and in the next world he is a mass of suffering 
The Buddha Extinguishes Three Fires with the Water of His Knowledge There was a country called Daksinacala The Buddha wanted to go to that country On the way he reached a village where he could spend the night 
There the villagers happened to organize a meeting to commemorate an auspicious occasion Drank from consuming wine they did not notice a fire that set the village ablaze 
The people were afraid No one knew where to go and they all said to each other Only if we trust in the Buddha can we escape from fiery ruin So they said to the Buddha O Worldhonored One we wish to be saved The Buddha said All living beings have three fires 
the fires of desire hatred and delusion 
With the water of my knowledge I shall extinguish these three fires 
If these words are true this fire will be extinguished After he said this the fire was immediately extinguished 
Everybody was happy and they faithfully respected the Buddha The Buddha expounded the Doctrine to them and they obtained the path of the srotapanna 
The bhiksus were surprised Your appearance in the world O Worldhonored One is wonderful and  Chapter II extraordinary 
The fire in the village is extinguished and the villagers mental impurities are extinguished as well The Buddha said Not only now do I bring benefit 
In the past I have also brought considerable benefit to others The bhiksus asked We are wondering O Worldhonored One about this bringing of benefit in the past 
How did you do that The Buddha said In the past somewhere in the Snowy Mountains there was a large bamboo forest Many birds and animals lived in that forest 
There was a parrot called Joyneck 
As the wind blew in the forest two bamboos rubbed against each other and started a fire setting the bamboo forest ablaze The birds and animals feared that they might not be able to escape 
The parrot had deep compassion and felt pity for those birds and animals He plunged his wings into water and sprinkled it onto the fire 
He was diligent in his compassion and so he moved Indra making his palace shake vehemently 
Sakra devanam indra looked with his divine eye Why does my palace move 
He saw that in the world there was a parrot who showed great compassion and who wanted to rescue others from a fire He went to the limit of his strength but he could not extinguish the fire 
Sakra devanam indra then turned to the parrot and said This bamboo forest is large it extends thousands tens of thousands of miles The water taken up by your wings is just a few drops 
How can you extinguish such a big fire The parrot answered If I am diligent and not idle in my magnanimity I shall surely extinguish the fire 
If I cannot extinguish it in this life when I receive a body in the future I swear I shall surely extinguish it b Sakra devanam indra was moved by his determination He let rain come pouring down and the fire was extinguished At that time the parrot was myself 
The birds and animals in the forest are now the people in the big towns 
Then I extinguished the fire for them and let them gain happiness 
Now also I extinguish the fire so that they may gain happiness Furthermore asked for what reason the villagers obtained the path where the Truths are seen the Buddha said In the time of Kasyapa Buddha  Parable  these people observed the five precepts For that reason they have now seen the Truths and obtained the path of the srotapanna Parable  
In Benares There Was an Elders Son Who Together with a Celestial Spirit Moved the King to Pious Conduct Thus have I heard Once the Buddha was in Sravasti He said to the bhiksus If someone wants King Brahma to stay in his house Brahma will stay in his house if he takes pious care of his parents 
If he wants to make Indra stay in his house Indra will stay in his house if he takes pious care of his parents 
If he wants all celestial spirits to stay in his house he just has to support his parents and you must know that all celestial spirits are already in his house 
Only if he supports his parents will his upadhyaya stay in his house 
If he wants his acarya to stay in his house his acarya will stay in his house if he only supports his parents 
If he wants to support the nobles and the Buddha the nobles and the Buddha will stay in his house if he supports his parents 
The bhiksus asked O Tathagata Worldhonored One respect for ones parents is marvelous The Buddha said Not only is respect for ones parents marvelous now 
In the past also it has been wonderful to respect ones parents The bhiksus said How was this being respectful in the past The Buddha said Long ago in Benares there was a poor man who had only one son 
Then there was famine in the world He buried his parents alive under the ground and nourished his living children 
A neighbor asked Where are your parents He answered My parents were old 
So I buried them and with my parents share of the food I want to feed my children so that they can grow up A second family heard this and they said that this was reasonable Thus it spread and all over Benares it became the rule 
 Chapter II Now there was an elder who also had a son When this son c heard this he considered it to be wrong and he thought By what means can I abolish this wrong rule Consequently he informed his father Father you must now go far away to study so that you may know the scriptural commentaries So his father went When he had obtained some learning he returned home but he had grown older still 
The celestial spirit wrote a statement asking the king four things If you can solve the questions in this statement I shall protect you However if you do not solve them after seven days I shall make your head O king split into seven parts The four questions were these 
What is the greatest happiness 
What is the most excellent among flavors 
When the king obtained it he made inquiries in the land as to who might answer these questions 
If someone answered them his every wish whatever he wanted would be fulfilled The elders son received this document and he explained its meaning saying Faith is the greatest wealth The Right Doctrine is the greatest happiness Truthfulness is the best flavor 
When the celestial spirit saw it he felt great joy The king felt great joy too 
The king asked the elders son Who instructed you with these words He replied My father instructed me The king said Where is your father The elders son said 
Please O king take away my fear 
Because my father is very old I have kept him underground offending against the rule of the land 
Please listen to my words O great king 
Our indebtedness to our parents is as important as heaven and earth They nursed us for ten months cleaned away our feces and removed our urine They suckled and nourished us and taught us the ways of humans 
That we can see the sun and moon and lifes accomplishments is the work of our parents 
If we carried our fathers on our left shoulders and our mothers on our right shoulders for a hundred years giving them all manner of further support we still could not repay our debts to our parents 
Then the king asked What do you want He replied I do not want anything else but I do wish that you O great king would abolish this evil rule The king agreed with his words and proclaimed in the land that if anyone lacked piety toward his parents he would receive heavy punishment 
At that time I removed the evil rule from that country instituting the rule of pious obedience That is why I have become a Buddha That is why I still praise the rule of pious obedience today Parable  
The White Fragrant Elephant of the King of Kasi Nourishes His Blind Parents and Conciliates Two Countries Long ago the Buddha was in Sravasti He informed the bhiksus There are eight kinds of people to whom one definitely should give freely Do not doubt this any longer 
They are ones father ones mother the Buddha his disciples people who come from afar people who go on a long journey the sick and those who attend the sick The bhiksus said to the Buddha O Tathagata Worldhonored One wonderful 
Extraordinary is your constant praise for respect toward ones parents The Buddha said Not only now but since olden times have I always honored and respected them The bhiksus asked How did you praise respect The Buddha said Long ago there were two kings 
One was the king of Kasi and the other was the king of Videha 
The king of Videha had a big fragrant elephant With the power of the fragrant elephant he destroyed the army of the king of Kasi 
The king of Kasi thought Now how shall I catch a fragrant elephant and  Chapter II destroy the army of the king of Videha Then someone said I have seen that there is a white fragrant elephant in the mountains When the king heard this he immediately sent out an appeal 
The elephant thought Though I may go far away and though my parents are blind and old it would be better to comply and go to the king Then the troops led the fragrant elephant to the king 
The king was very happy He had a fine dwelling built for  He spread out a mat and a rug of fine felt under him and he had a host of skilled ladies play the harp and the lute to amuse him 
He gave the elephant food and drink but the latter did not want to take it 
Then the one who tended to the elephant came to tell the king The elephant does not want to eat The king himself went to the elephant 
In high antiquity all animals could talk like people 
The king asked the elephant Why do you not eat The elephant answered I have a father and mother who are old and blind If no one gives them water and grass my parents will not eat 
How then can I eat The elephant said to the king If I wanted to go your army could not hold me back O king Although my parents are blind and old I came here to you O king O king let me return now and support them 
When their lives have ended I shall come back by myself When the king heard these words he was extremely happy and he said We are like elephants with human heads but this elephant is a person with an elephants head Previously the people of Kasi treated their parents with contempt and without any respect but b because of this elephant the king issued a command throughout the whole country that if anyone did not piously support and respect his parents he would be severely punished Consequently he let the elephant return to his parents He supported his parents for the length of their lives and when his parents had died he came back to the king Then the king was very happy with the white elephant and adorned him 
When he wanted to attack the other country the  Parable  elephant said to the king Do not fight them As a general rule when there is fighting there are many wounded The king said They have treated us harshly The elephant said Please let me go so that the enemy will not dare annoy you The king said If you go you may not be able to return He answered No one can hold me back or keep me from returning Thereupon the elephant went to the other country 
When the king of Videha heard of the elephants arrival he was very happy and went out himself to welcome him When he saw the elephant he said to him Stay in my country now The elephant said to the king I cannot stay now Never in my life have I broken my word I made a prior promise to the other king that I would return to his country 
You two kings should cease your enmity and bring peace to your countries 
Would this not be joyful He then spoke the stanza Gaining a victory adds to hatred and a defeat increases suffering He who does not fight over winning or losing has the greatest happiness When the elephant had spoken this stanza he returned to Kasi 
Ever since the two countries have been at peace He who was the king of Kasi is now King Prasenajit 
The king of Videha is King Ajatasatru 
I was that white elephant 
Because I piously supported my parents I have caused many beings to support their parents piously And I was then able to make two countries agree to be at peace just as they are today Parable  
In Benares a Younger Brother Mildly Reproves His Older Brother Consequently They Get Through to the Prime Minister and Urge the King to Convert the World Once the Worldhonored One said to the bhiksus You must know that in the past in Benares there was a time when an evil rule was  Chapter II prevalent 
When a father had reached the age of sixty a rug was spread out for him by the door so that he could keep watch 
There were two brothers and the elder one said to the younger one Spread out a rug for our father so that he may keep watch by the door There was only one rug in the house The younger brother then cut it in two and gave one half to his father He said to his c father My elder brother gives this to you father It is not I who gives it 
My elder brother instructs you father to keep watch by the door The elder brother said to the younger one Why didnt you give him the whole rug but cut it in two and gave him half The younger brother replied We just had one rug 
If I did not cut it in two for him where could I get another later The elder brother asked To whom do you want to give another one The younger brother said How could I not keep one for you brother The elder brother said Why for me The younger brother said You will grow old and your son will also place you by the door When the elder brother heard these words he was startled and said Will it be the same with me The younger brother said Who will take your place Then he said to his elder brother One ought to abolish such an evil rule altogether So the brothers went together to the prime minister and they repeated this discussion to the state councillor 
The state councillor replied Truly so All of us will grow old too The state councillor informed the king and the king agreed with these words 
He issued a command throughout the land that one should piously support ones parents He no longer allowed the evil rule to be observed and abolished it Parable  
Brahmadattas Wife Is Jealous and Hurts Her Son Dharmapala The Buddha was in Rajagrha and he said to Devadatta I have always felt profound kindness for you and I am without evil toward you in body speech and mind Now let us be forgiving  Parable  Devadatta cursed and went away 
The bhiksus said Why is it Tathagata that you are so kind but Devadatta still scolds you The Buddha said Not only now 
In the past in Benares there was a king called Brahmadatta His wifes name was Durmati They had a son Dharmapala He was intelligent and kind and studied with his teacher 
Then King Brahmadatta led his ladies into the park and he was entertained and happy He sent the wine that was left over to his wife in order that she might drink it 
His wife became angry and said I would rather stab Dharmapala in the throat and drink his blood than drink this wine When the king heard these words he said in anger Call Dharmapala back from his studies When Dharmapala had come the king wanted to cut his throat 
The son said to his father I have committed no crime  king you only have one son Why would you kill me The king said I do not kill you 
It is your mothers intention You can tell your mother Forgiveness will make her happy and I shall never kill you The son was then forgiving toward his mother and said I am your only son and I have done nothing wrong 
Why would you kill me When his mother did not accept her sons forgiveness the king stabbed his sons throat and gave her the blood to drink The Buddha said Kokalika was that father the king 
Devadatta was that mother 
I was that son 
I had absolutely no evil thoughts then but my forgiveness was not accepted It is the same now My forgiveness is not accepted 
Even though I was killed then  felt no resentment whatsoever Still less would I be angry now and harbor evil thoughts Parable  
The Bhiksu Darva Is Slandered Once there was a bhiksu called Darva He had the strength of someone with great power 
Having gone forth with diligence he had obtained arhatship and was endowed with majesty He always managed the monks affairs His five fingers sent out light so he spread out the monks various mats 
Because of this the Buddha called him the best caretaker 
 Chapter II The bhiksu Maitrakanyaka had little merit himself At the next meeting of the congregation the food was coarse so he turned back and said in anger If this Darva takes care of the monks affairs never in my life shall I get good food 
I must find some means to do something about this He had a sister who was a bhiksunl He went to salute her and told her to slander Darva three times 
Darva grew weary and ascended into the sky undergoing the eighteen transformations He entered the samadhi with the glow of fire When the blaze of fire was extinguished in the sky nothing remained of him If slander in regard to desire can make even a noble one extinguish his appearance how much more so for a common man 
Therefore a wise one should be cautious about slander and never speak lightly 
Then the bhiksus asked the Buddha Why was the bhiksu Darva slandered 
And why did he obtain this great power 
Furthermore why did he obtain arhatship The Buddha said In former times when man lived twenty thousand years there was a Buddha called Kasyapa 
At the time during Kasyapa Buddhas existence there was a young bhiksu whose countenance was fine and whose appearance was beautiful 
This young bhiksu went to beg for alms Before he returned there was a girl who had been moved by his beauty She looked at this bhiksu and could not take her eyes from him The bhiksu Darva was then superintendent of provisions 
He happened to see this girl following the bhiksu her eyes constantly upon him so he spoke out in defamation For certain this woman had intercourse with that bhiksu For that reason he fell into the three unwholesome destinations The suffering he experienced was immeasurable Even now his misfortune is not over He is still slandered 
Because in the past at the time of Kasyapa Buddha he went forth to study the path he has now obtained arhatship 
Because in the past when he managed the monks affairs he pulled free a donkey that was carrying rice flour and had sunk deep into the mud he got the strength of someone with great power  Parable  Parable  
Revata Is Slandered b Once upon a time in Kasmlr there was an arhat Revata He sat in meditation in the mountains 
Someone lost an ox and was following its tracks 
The track led him to Revata who happened to be making an herbal decoction to dye his garment The garment changed by itself into the skin of an ox and the dye changed into its blood The decocted herbs changed into the flesh of an ox and the bowl in his hands changed into the head of an ox 
When the herdsman saw this he seized Revata tied him up and led him to the king who put him into prison 
For twelve years he remained in jail feeding the horses and cleaning up their manure 
Among the disciples of Revata five hundred had obtained arhatship Looking for their master they did not know his whereabouts 
When his karmic condition was about to end there was one disciple who saw that his master was in prison in Kasimr So he came to tell the king My master Revata is in your prison O king 
May our meeting set this matter straight So the king sent someone to the prison to investigate 
When the kings man arrived at the prison he saw only someone whose stem appearance was downcast His beard and his hair were very long and he fed the horses and cleaned their manure as would a jailed inmate 
He returned and said to the king There is no religious person no sramana at all in prison 
There is only a prisoner The bhiksu the disciple again said to the king I wish that you would simply give instructions that all bhiksus are allowed to leave prison Then the king issued the command that all religious persons could leave prison 
In his prison the beard and the hair of the Venerable Revata fell off by themselves and a kasaya covered his body He jumped into the air and experienced the eighteen transformations 
When the king saw this he sighed at this marvel Bowing down in deepest respect he said to the venerable one Please accept my repentance Revata immediately came down and received the kings repentance 
 Chapter II The king then asked For what karmic condition were you in prison and experiencing suffering through the years The venerable one replied Formerly I also lost my ox 
I followed its tracks and arrived at a mountain I saw a pratyekabuddha sitting in meditation in a lonely spot and I immediately accused him falsely for one day and a night 
For that reason I fell into the three unwholesome destinations My suffering was immeasurable but I still had misfortune left It was not over Even after I obtained arhatship I was still slandered Parable  
Radhika the Ugly Daughter of King Prasenajit Once King Prasenajit had a daughter called Radhika She had the eighteen deformities and looked like no other human All who saw her were appalled 
King Prasenajit then ordered that all those among the elders sons of good family in the land who were impoverished and alone be brought to him 
At that time near the marketplace there was an elders son c who was all alone He provided for his livelihood by begging 
When those who went out to summon the sons saw him they took him to the king 
The king led this man into his park in the back and made a proposal saying I have one daughter Her appearance is ugly It will not do to show her in public I want to give her in marriage to you now sir 
Can you agree to it Then the elders son said to the king Whatever the king has decided even if it concerned a dog I still would not refuse 
How much less could I fail to agree to marry your daughter O king Consequently the king gave her in marriage to him and built him a palace He told the elders son This woman looks awful Do not show her to anyone When you go out lock the gate and when you are in keep the door shut 
Consider this a constant rule There were many elders sons who as common friends organized banquets and distractions Whenever they met the wives of the elders sons all joined the party However this royal daughter  Parable  alone did not come 
Thereupon they all made an agreement that when they met again later they had to bring their wives 
Subsequently they organized another meeting but the poor elders son still did not bring his wife just as before Then they all charged him a heavy fine 
The elders son politely accepted being fined 
They made a new agreement to meet again the next day and if he did not bring his wife he would have to pay another heavy fine 
Thus he was fined three times and he still did not bring her to the meetings 
When the poor elders son later arrived home he said to his wife I have often been condemned to pay a fine because of you When his wife asked why her husband said We all have an agreement that on a day when we meet to drink we must all bring our wives to the meeting 
Because I was told by the king not to take you and show you to the people outside I have been fined frequently When his wife heard these words she was utterly mortified and deeply afflicted 
Later on another banquet was organized and the husband again went alone The wife doubled her good faith at home and she pronounced the wish When the Tathagata appears in the world many are benefitted but I am blamed 
I alone do not benefit The Buddha was moved by her determination and he leaped out of the ground First she saw the Buddhas hair She was full of reverence and joy and her own hair changed into beautiful hair 
Then she saw the Buddhas forehead and she saw his eyebrows his eyes ears nose body and mouth As she saw them her joy became more and more profound and her body changed 
Her ugliness vanished completely and she looked like a goddess 
The elders sons talked things over in secret saying As for the reason why the kings daughter does not come to our meetings it is certainly because her beauty is greater than average or else because she is so terribly ugly that she does not come 
We shall now make her husband drunk so that he loses consciousness We shall take away his keys open the gate and have a look Then they drank and made him drunk they took his keys and they went in  Chapter II each others company 
When they opened the gate and had a look they saw that this kings daughter was beautiful beyond compare Then they left closing the gate and went back to the place from which they had come 
As the husband still had not regained consciousness they returned his keys attaching them to his waist 
When the husband came to he returned home When he opened the gate he saw his wifes extraordinary beauty He was surprised and asked her What deity are you staying in my home His wife said I am your wife Radhika The husband was surprised and asked her the reason for this unexpected event 
The wife then replied When I heard that you were often condemned and fined because of me I felt mortified In my affliction I called upon the Buddha Then I saw the Tathagata leap out of the ground Seeing him I felt joy and my body became beautiful The poor elders son was extremely happy 
He then went to the king and told him The body of your daughter O king has of itself become beautiful 
She wants to see you now O king When the king heard this he was happy and so he invited her 
Although he was happy upon seeing her he felt very perplexed He had it in mind to go to the Buddha and he said to the Buddha O Worldhonored One why was this daughter born in my palace with an ugly body startling anyone who saw her 
Furthermore why has she now suddenly become beautiful The Buddha said to the king Once in the past there was a pratyekabuddha Every day he begged his food He arrived in front of the gate of an elder The elders daughter then took some food to give it to the pratyekabuddha but seeing that the pratyekabuddha's body was ugly she said This one is awful 
Because she gave food she was born in your palace 
Because she defamed a pratyekabuddha her body was ugly 
Because she was mortified and afflicted she could meet me and because she became happy her body became beautiful When the congregation heard the Buddhas explanation they received it with joy and respectfully made obeisance 
 Parable  Parable  King Prasenajits Daughter Suprabha Once King Prasenajit had a daughter called Suprabha who was intelligent and fair Her parents felt kindly toward her and the whole palace loved her reverently 
The father said to his daughter It is because of me that the whole palace loves you reverently The daughter answered her father I have the karmic power 
It is not because of you my father and king Though he asked her three times in this way her answer remained the same 
I shall now put it to the test whether you have your own karmic power or not He ordered his attendants to look for a very poor and lowly beggar in the town 
So they carried out the kings instructions and set out on their search They found a poor man and took him to the king 
The king then b gave his daughter Suprabha to the poor man saying to his daughter From now on you may know by factual verification whether it is your own karmic power rather than my power His daughter still replied I have the karmic power So she left together with the poor man 
She asked her husband You must have had parents The poor man answered My father used to be the highest elder in Sravastl I lived at home with my parents but it all came to an end when they died 
I do not have anyone to depend on and so I am destitute Suprabha asked him Would you know now where your old home was He replied I know where it was but the buildings are destroyed 
As they came to a particular place the ground split open by itself and a treasure hidden in the ground appeared just like that With these valuables they hired people to build a dwelling In less than a month the palace and the houses had all been completed They were filled with palace attendants and singing girls with countless female and male servants 
The king suddenly remembered I wonder how my daughter Suprabha is Someone answered Her palace and her wealth are no less than yours O king The king said The Buddhas words  Chapter II are true 
When one performs good or evil one will experience its reward That same day the kings daughter sent her husband with an invitation to the king 
The king accepted the invitation and he saw that in her house carpets and rugs adorned the dwellings excelling those in his own palace 
When the king saw this he sighed at this marvel 
The daughter knew that her words were true and she said For the good I have performed I experienced this recompense The king went to ask the Buddha What meritorious action did this daughter perform in a previous existence that she has obtained birth in a royal family and that her body is bright The Buddha replied to the king Ninetyone kalpas ago there was a Buddha called Vipasyin 
At that time there was a king called Bandhumat The king had a first wife 
After Vipasyin Buddha had entered nirvana King Bandhumat erected a pagoda of the seven precious things for the Buddhas relics 
The kings first wife placed the plume adornment of her celestial crown on the head of Vipasyin Buddhas image and she attached the wishgranting gem in her celestial crown to his crest Its brightness illuminated the world So she pronounced the wish May my future body be bright the color of pure purple gold honorable and aristocratic and may I not fall into the three unwholesome destinations or the eight difficult conditions That first wife of the king at that time is now Suprabha 
At the time of Kasyapa Buddha she worshipped Kasyapa Tathagata and his four great disciples with savory food but her husband stopped her 
His wife earnestly requested him Do not stop me I c ask you to let me supply them well The husband then gave his wife permission and she completed her worship 
The husband at that time is her present husband that wife is his present wife 
Because the husband then stopped his wife he remained poor Because he then gave her permission he obtained great wealth essentially because of his wife 
When he was without his wife he was later poor again 
Good or evil actions follow you always without fail When the king heard the Buddhas explanation he gained deep understanding about ones actions 
Parable  Once Two Brothers Sons of a King Were Expelled from Their Country Once there were two brothers sons of a king who were expelled from their country When they arrived at a deserted area their provisions were completely used up 
The younger brother killed his wife and shared her flesh with his brother and his wife so that they might eat 
When the elder brother obtained this flesh he hid it and did not eat it He took a slice of the flesh of his own leg and he and his wife ate that 
When the flesh of the younger brothers wife was all used up he wanted to obtain some by killing his elder brothers wife 
His elder brother said Do not kill her 
I shall give you back the flesh that I hid away 
Eat that When they had passed beyond the deserted area they reached the dwelling of a divine seer Gathering fruits they nourished themselves 
Afterward the younger brother died of illness and only the elder brother was left behind all by himself 
Then the prince saw a criminal whose hands and feet had been cut off as in punishment He felt compassionate and gathered fruits to provide for the crippled mans livelihood 
In his conduct as a man the prince scarcely knew lust Once when he had gone to gather fruits and his wife had stayed behind she had intercourse with the criminal She herself had private feelings and disliked her husband intensely 
One day she followed her husband to gather fruits Upon reaching the bank of a river she said to her husband Take the fruit at the top of the tree The husband said to his wife Underneath there is a deep river 
I might fall into it The wife said Tie a rope around your waist I shall pull the rope while you go a little closer to the bankThe wife gave her husband a push and he fell into the river 
Because of the wholesome power of his compassion he drifted away with the water and did not drown 
 Chapter II Downstream there was a country whose king had passed away The diviners of that country were investigating who should become king in the land 
In the distance they saw a yellow cloud cover on the river After the diviners had interpreted this to mean that under the yellow cloud cover there had to be a divine being they sent someone on the water to go and welcome him and they installed him as their king 
Carrying the crippled man and wandering from place to place to beg the kings former wife arrived in the kings adoptive country 
The people in the land declared that here was a fine woman who carried her crippled husband respectfully displaying pious obedience So they made this known to the king 
When the king heard about it he sent someone to invite her to come to his palace 
The king asked the woman Is this crippled man really your husband She answered TrulyThen the king said Do you know me She a answered I do not know you The king said Do you know a certain  
 She looked closely at the king and only then did she become ashamed 
So the king felt compassion and he had someone provide for their livelihood 
The Buddha said If you want to know that king is myself 
Cinca was that wife the daughter of a Brahman She slandered me strapping a wooden bowl around her waist  
The one who at that time had his hands and feet cut off was Devadatta Parable  
The Wife of Sudatta the Elder Nourishes the Buddha and the Couple Are Recompensed Once when the Buddha was in the world Sudatta the elder ended up in poverty All his riches were used up He was engaged as a servant and received three pecks of rice He and his wife steamed it and prepared a meal 
Then when they had steamed it Aniruddha happened to come by to beg for food 
Sudattas wife took his bowl filled it up with rice and gave it to him 
Afterwards Subhuti  Parable  Mahakasyapa Mahamaudgalyayana and Sariputra one after the other came by to beg The wife took the bowl of each filled it with rice and gave it to them 
Finally the Worldhonored One himself came to beg for food She gave him a full bowl too 
Thereupon Sudatta who had been away returned and asked his wife for food 
The wife answered her husband Supposing that the reverend Aniruddha came would you eat the food yourself or give it to the reverend He replied I would rather abstain from eating and give food to the reverend And if Kasyapa Mahamaudgalyayana Subhuti Sariputra and even the Buddha came what would you do He answered I would rather abstain from eating and give it all to them The wife said to her husband Since this morning all these noble ones came to ask for food 
All the food we had I gave to them The husband said to his wife Our misfortune has come to an end and our good fortune will grow Then he opened up his storehouse and it was completely filled with grain silk food and drink 
Parable  Sarana Bhiksu Is Beaten by King C andapradyota Long ago the son of King Udayana called Sarana found delight in the Buddhas Doctrine He went forth to study the path and he practiced the asceticism of the dhutagunas He was sitting in meditation with settled mindfulness underneath a tree in a mountain grove when King Candapradyota passed by with his ladies on a pleasure trip 
Reaching this grove the king halted his carriage to rest and immediately fell asleep 
Because the king was asleep the ladies amused themselves They saw that there was a bhiksu sitting in meditation underneath a tree his mind settled They went over to him paid their respects and made inquiries 
Then the bhiksu expounded the Doctrine to them 
When the king later woke up he looked for his ladies and saw that in the distance there was a bhiksu underneath a tree His appearance was handsome and he was in the flower of his youth  Chapter II The ladies were in front of him listening to the Doctrine The king    b went to him and asked Have you obtained arhatship He replied I have not Are you an anagaminT He answered I am not Did you obtain srotapatti He answered I did not Do you contemplate impurity He answered I do not Then the king became very angry and he said You have absolutely nothing at all 
Why do you sit here with my ladies since you are a common man in the cycle of birth and death He grabbed him and gave him a beating hurting him all over his body 
When the ladies said This bhiksu has done nothing wrong the king became angrier still and gave him another beating They all cried with distress and the king became twice as angry 
At that moment the bhiksu thought to himself Because the Buddhas of the past were forbearing they obtained the unsurpassed path 
Furthermore in the past Ksantivadin had his ears nose hands and feet cut off by someone but he was still forbearing 
Should I not be all the more forbearing today being of sound body Reflecting thus he endured in silence 
After he had received the beating he hurt all over his body It got worse and worse and he could no longer stand the pain Again he thought If I were among the laity as the son of the king of the land I would succeed to the royal throne The strength of my troops would not be inferior to that of any other king 
Today as I am alone having gone forth I am oppressed He felt deep distress and he wanted to discontinue the path and return to his family So he took his leave of his upadhyaya Katyayana wishing to return to the laity 
His upadhyaya replied You have just received a thorough and painful beating Wait until tomorrow Stay a while to rest 
Late at night the Venerable Katyayana showed him a dream in which Sarana saw himself discontinuing the path and returning to his family After the death of the king his father he succeeded to the royal throne He assembled his four troops and attacked King Candapradyota 
When he had reached the other country he drew up in array and they fought a battle He was  Parable  defeated and his army was destroyed He himself was taken prisoner 
Then when King Candapradyota had seized Sarana he sent someone with a sword in order to do away with him 
Sarana was utterly terrified then and the thought occurred to him that he wished to meet his upadhyaya Although someone was about to kill him he did not feel any malice 
At that time the upadhyaya was aware of what Sarana had in mind Holding his staff and his alms bowl he was about to go on his begging round Appearing in front of Sarana he said My son I have constantly expounded the Doctrine to you in various ways If you seek victory in a quarrel you can never gain it 
If you have no need for my teaching you know what may happen He answered his upadhyaya If you save your disciples life now I shall not dare c do it again Then Katyayana said to the kings men on behalf of Sarana I wish you would desist for a while 
Allow me to inform the king and save his life Having said this he went to where the king was but the kings men did not want to delay any further and they planned to do away with him 
When they were about to let the sword drop he was terrified and could not utter a sound Then he woke up 
When he awoke he told his upadhyaya everything he had seen in his dream 
His upadhyaya replied In life there is absolutely no victory in strife 
As a rule in warfare one considers the destruction of the enemy to be a victory Although on the path of destruction one may with foolish emotions today take delight in ones mind in the future world one will fall into the three unwholesome destinations experiencing immeasurable suffering 
If one loses and is ruined by someone else one loses ones life and misfortune comes to the common people One increases other serious offenses so that one falls into hell Enemies do not stop their mutual killing and they revolve endlessly in the five destinations Consider this over and over again 
If you want to leave the fear of birth and death  Chapter II now or the agony of a beating you should contemplate your own body in order to stop hating 
The body is the wellspring of all suffering It is encroached upon by hunger thirst cold warmth birth old age sickness and death mosquitos gadflies poison and animals 
Such enemies are numerous and immeasurable You cannot wipe them out Why do you want to wipe out only King Candapradyota 
If you want to destroy your enemy you must destroy affliction 
The enemy affliction hurts countless bodies 
An enemy in the world may be serious but he hurts only one body the enemy affliction hurts a multitude of good qualities 
An enemy in the world may be fierce but he hurts only an impure and filthy body 
If one looks at it from this viewpoint affliction is the basis of the rise of enmity 
If you do not attack the enemy affliction now how will you attack King C andapradyota 
Thus he explained the Doctrine in various ways 
When Sarana heard these words his thoughts became clear and his mind understood 
He became a srotapanna and he felt profound joy in the Great Law He doubled his vigorous pursuit and having practiced the path for a short while he became an arhat 
Parable  A Palace Attendant Redeems Bulls That Were to Be Gelded and Regains His Manhood Long ago in Gandhara there was a butcher who wanted to geld all of his five hundred young bulls 
A palace attendant who was a eunuch then redeemed the bulls with his own money and turned the herd loose Because of these circumstances he regained his manhood 
He returned to the kings house and sent someone to make it known that a certain person was outside 
The king said He is my domestic 
Why does he do so now  Parable  a When the king asked this the attendant replied to the king When some time ago I saw a butcher who was about to geld his five hundred young bulls I redeemed them and set them free 
That is why my body became complete 
So I dare not enter Upon hearing this the king was pleased He had a deep belief in and respect for the Buddhas Doctrine 
If he was thus affected by a splendid recompense his later recompense will surely be immeasurable 
Parable  Two Palace Attendants Have an Argument Long ago when King Prasenajit was lying down to sleep he overheard two palace attendants having an argument 
One said My livelihood depends on the king The other answered I depend on no one I live by the power of my deeds When the king heard this he approved of the one whose livelihood depended on the king and he wanted to reward him 
So he sent a servant to say to his wife I shall send someone now 
Give plenty of money clothes and jewelry to the one who will come Thereupon he sent the one whose livelihood depended on the king to give his wife the rest of the wine he had been drinking 
As that attendant went out of the door with the wine his nose started to bleed and he could not go on 
He happened to meet again the one who lived by the power of his deeds and he had him go and take the wine to the wife 
When the wife saw him she recalled the kings words and bestowed money clothes and jewelry upon him 
Upon his return to the king the king saw him and was greatly surprised So he called the one whose livelihood depended on the king and asked him I sent you Why did you not go He answered When I went out of the door my nose suddenly started to bleed 
I could not bear it so I had the other one take the rest of your wine O king and give it to your wife  Chapter II Then the king sighed and said Now I know that the Buddhas words are the truth one performs his own deeds and must experience their recompense One cannot take it away 
Looking at it from this vantage point a wholesome or an evil recompense is brought about by ones deeds Neither a god nor a king can bestow it  Chapter III Parable  
Parable  Parable  Two Brothers Both Go Forth Kokalika Slanders Sariputra The Stanzas of the Dragon Kings Devadatta Wants to Harm the Buddha The Jlvamjivaka Bird The White Swan King The Big Tortoise Two Scheming State Councillors The Wild Cock King The Krkara Bird The Aged Seer The Two Traders Eight Gods One after the Other Ask about the Doctrine  Chapter III Parable  Two Brothers Both Go Forth b Once upon a time there were two brothers who found their happiness in the Buddhas Doctrine 
They went forth and applied themselves to the path The elder brother was diligent and he developed many good qualities He practiced aranyaka conduct and shortly afterward obtained arhatship 
The younger brother was intelligent His learning was extensive and he recited the scriptural texts of the Tripitaka Later he was invited by the state councillor to be his tutor and received a great deal of money The councillor commissioned him to construct monks quarters and a temple with a pagoda 
The master of the Tripitaka Doctrine accepted the riches and he had people measure out the area to build a temple with a pagoda The pagoda was dignified and the buildings were magnificent Their construction was a piece of wondrous craftsmanship When the state councillor saw the temple his respect increased twofold 
He granted the bhiksu honors Encouraged by this and finding himself better off the Tripitaka bhiksu saw that the councillor was kindly disposed So he thought The monastery may be completed but it is still necessary that monks dwell in the monastery I shall speak to the state councillor so that he may invite my elder brother Having had this thought he addressed the state councillor I have a brother who lives elsewhere 
O danapati you might now invite him to stay in the monastery The state councillor answered That which is decided by my teacher a regular bhiksu I dare not oppose 
 He immediately sent someone with an urgent invitation 
Upon the elder brothers arrival the state councillor saw his diligent behavior and he increased his homage twofold 
Later the state councillor gave the aranyaka bhiksu a fine piece of cloth of inestic mable value but the aranyaka bhiksu was not willing to accept it 
When he needs anything valuable I shall give it to him Afterwards the state councillor gave a piece of coarse cloth to the Tripitaka master  
Upon receiving it he became very angry 
And later the state councillor again gave the elder brother the aranyaka a priceless piece of fine cloth 
When the elder brother received it he passed it on to his younger brother 
When the younger brother saw it he became twice as jealous So he took this piece of cloth went to the beloved daughter of the state councillor and said to her Your father the state councillor treated me generously before Now ever since my elder brother came perhaps he has in some way deceived your father who is now no longer generous toward me 
If he asks questions answer The aranyaka whom you O father hold in esteem has taken this and given it to me The state councillor is bound to become angry but do not talk with him The daughter said to the Tripitaka master My father is now generous and reverential toward that bhiksu holding him as dear as his own eyes or a bright pearl 
Why should I suddenly slander him The Tripitaka master then said If you do not do so I shall break with you forever The daughter replied Why be so precipitate 
There must be a better way As the situation could not be resolved she accepted that cloth and cut it in front of her father making it into a garment 
Then when the state councillor saw the cloth he recognized it and thought to himself That socalled bhiksu the elder brother is a very evil man Obtaining my piece of cloth he did not keep it for himself but he deceives a woman my child with it After that whenever the aranyaka came he no longer went out to welcome him any more and his countenance changed 
Then when the elder brother saw how the state councillor behaved he thought to himself Someone must have slandered me so that he is acting like this Then he ascended into the sky and made the eighteen transformations 
When the state councillor saw this he felt profound respect and obedience With his wife he fell at the  Chapter III bhiksus feet and confessed His respect and affection were twice as great as before He then expelled the Tripitaka master and his own daughter 
The Buddha said At that time I was the Tripitaka master 
Because I slandered someone I experienced great suffering during countless kalpas Even now I am slandered by Sundari 
The girl is expelled now because she slandered a noble one and she is needy begging for a living 
Do not slander lightly because you will thus bring punishment on yourself Parable  
Kokalika Slanders Sariputra ia Long ago the Venerable Sariputra and the Venerable Maudgalyayana were wandering from town to town Arriving at a potters workshop they encountered a rain storm so they stayed there for the night 
It happened that a cowherd girl had arrived at the pottery first 
She was staying deep in the back and because disciples are no different from common men when they have not entered concentration they did not notice her 
When the cowherd girl saw that the looks of Sariputra and Maudgalyayana were fine she was deluded inside and she lost impurity 
The Venerable Sariputra and Maudgalyayana left the pottery 
Upon examining someones countenance he knew whether or not that person had given way to desire He saw the cowherd girl leave after them and the countenance of the girl suggested that she had fulfilled her desire He did not know that the girl had deluded herself and lost impurity So he slandered the Venerable Sariputra and the Venerable Maudgalyayana accusing them of debauching the cowherd girl 
He widely proclaimed this to the bhiksus 
Then the bhiksus remonstrated three times Do not slander the Venerable Sariputra and the Venerable Maudgalyayana Kokalika then become angry and his anger grew and grew 
 Parable  There was an elder called Baka The Venerable Sariputra and the Venerable Maudgalyayana had explained to him the essentials of the Doctrine and he had become an anagamin When his life had ended he was born in the Brahma Heaven so they called him Bakabrahmana 
Then Bakabrahmana directly knew in heaven that Kokalika had slandered the Venerable Sariputra and the Venerable Maudgalyayana and he descended into Kokalikas house 
Kokalika asked Who are you He answered I am Bakabrahmana Why did you come The brahmana said With my heavenly ear I have heard you slander the Venerable Sariputra and the Venerable Maudgalyayana 
He replied You O Bakabrahmana say that you are an anagamin 
Anagamin means one who does not return Why did you come to me 
If you are like that the Buddhas words are untrue The brahmana said Not to return means not to return to the realm of desire and to experience birth Then Kokalika got nasty boils as big as beans all over his body from head to toe 
He went to where the Buddha was and he said to the Buddha Why did Sariputra and Maudgalyayana debauch the cowherd girl The Buddha remonstrated too saying Do not accuse Sariputra and Maudgalyayana of that Hearing these words spoken by the Buddha he became twice as angry 
The Buddha again remonstrated saying Do not say this His boils gradually became as big as fists 
He did   ib not desist from asking a third time and his boils gradually became as big as gourds He got a fierce fever and jumped into a cool pool which caused it to start boiling vigorously His boils all burst open His life immediately ended and he fell into the Mahotpala Hell 
Then the bhiksus said to the Buddha O Worldhonored One why did someone gravely slander the Venerable Sariputra and the Venerable Maudgalyayana The Buddha said In a past kalpa Sariputra and Maudgalyayana were common men 
They saw a pratyekabuddha leave a potters workshop A cowherd girl also  Chapter III happened to be there She left after him and they immediately slandered him saying That socalled bhiksu certainly had intercourse with this girl Because of this deed they fell into the three unwholesome destinations and experienced immeasurable suffering 
Though they have become noble now their previous karmic causality had not ended They were still slandered 
Know that srvakas cannot be great teachers to sentient beings 
If Sriputra and Maudgalyyana had shown any element of supernatural power for Koklikas sake Koklika would surely have escaped hell 
Because they did not show it for him they let Koklika fall into hell The Buddha explained that event in this manner 
In the case of a bodhisattva it would be just as in the time of Krakucchanda Buddha There was a sage called Dipamkara He lived together with five hundred sages in a thatched cave in a mountain forest 
A woman accidentally passed there It happened to be raining and the wind and cold were extreme She did not have a place to shelter herself against the rain so she turned to where the sage Dipamkara was and spent the night there 
The next morning she went away When the sages saw her they immediately slandered him and said This sage Dipamkara certainly committed impure behavior with that woman Dipamkara knew then what was on their minds Apprehensive that their slander would cause them to fall into hell he ascended seven tala trees high in the sky and made the eighteen transformations 
When the sages saw this they said When ones body can leave the ground to the distance of four fingers length it is free from lust 
How could we slander a pure person Then the five hundred sages threw themselves to the ground They bent down and repented 
For this reason they escaped heavy punishment 
Know that a bodhisattva has great expedient means He is truly a good teacher to sentient beings The Buddha said The sage Dipamkara is now Maitreya 
The five hundred sages are now the elders the five hundred bhiksus  Parable  Parable  
The Stanzas of the Dragon Kings When the Buddha was in Rajagrha Devadatta went to where the Buddha was and scolded him with foul words 
When Ananda heard this he became extremely angry He drove Devadatta away ordering him to leave He said to him If you come again I will see to it that you suffer greatly 
Wien the bhiksus had seen this they said to the Buddha Strange O Worldhonored One 
You O Tathagata always have compassionate thoughts for Devadatta but Devadatta always harbors evil thoughts toward you O Tathagata 
Ananda became angry He drove him away and made him leave The Buddha said Not only now In the past it was also like this 
Long ago in the land of Kasi there were two brothers dragon kings One was called Dardara and the other Upadardara They always let it rain in the right season so that the vegetation in that land grew abundantly The five cereals ripened and the animals drank water 
The number of oxen and sheep grew The king of the land then often had oxen and sheep killed He went to where the dragons were and sacrificed the animals to the dragons 
The dragons appeared and said to the king Since we do not eat them what is the use of killing these creatures and sacrificing them to us Although they repeated these words it was to no avail 
The two brothers then went away together and avoided that place They arrived at the dwelling of a small dragon called Dundubhi 
The dragon Dundubhi was always angry He scolded them with foul words 
Dardara said to him Dont get angry 
We shall soon be gone Upadardara was extremely angry and said You are just a petty dragon that always eats frogs 
If I gave vent to my anger I would blow you and your relatives away so that you would all be extinguished Dardara said to his younger brother Dont be angry 
The king of Kasi is longing for us The king of Kasi said these words If the two dragons come I shall bring them sacrifices of curds according to their needs and I shall not slaughter any beings any more When  Chapter III the dragon kings heard this they returned to their former place Thereupon Dardara spoke these stanzas May you all be in harmony and listen attentively It is extremely wholesome to purify ones mental dharmas 
When the god among gods the Sambuddha the Tathagata was in the world the bhiksus still uttered evil words and derided one another The One with Great Compassion heard such words 
He assembled the Sangha of bhiksus and spoke thus O bhiksus you have left your homes relying on me You must not do wrong deeds but you all speak harsh words You slander each other harming yourselves 
Do you know that one who seeks bodhi must develop friendly forbearance a difficult and hard practice If you want to rely on the Buddhas Doctrine  You must practice the sixfold respectful behavior 
The wise one listens well when applying himself to the Buddhas path Because he wants to benefit and bring peace to beings he vexes absolutely no one If he is learned in his practice he must shun evil 
When someone who has gone forth raises strife it is like ice water coming out of a fire 
One brother the elder one was called Dardara The other was called Upadardara They both did not kill any living being and maintained the precepts in purity  Parable  Having mighty qualities they disliked their dragonlike appearances 
When they met a sramana or Brahman one who practiced the precepts in purity or who was learned they changed their appearances and honored him devotedly serving him On the eighth day the fourteenth day and the fifteenth day  They observed the eight precepts and checked their minds They left their dwelling and went elsewhere 
There was a dragon called Dundubhi who saw the mighty qualities of us two dragons He knew he was inferior and he became envious He kept scolding us with harsh words 
With swollen jaws and swollen mouth he breathed heavily His mind was filled with hatred and his body was inflated What he uttered were nasty sounds and slanderous words He was seized by deception and falsehood 
Hearing this infamous scolding by the evil dragon Upadardara was extremely angry He insistently said to his elder brother Dardara I am slandered by these foul words He always eats frogs and lives near the water 
 In the water he annoys the water animals and on land he vexes people 
Hearing this foulness I would like to be patient but it is hard to bear I shall now destroy him and his relatives  When all are destroyed let us go back to our place When the dragon king with great power heard his younger brothers words the fine stanzas that he expounded were praised by the wise If at the place where one stays one night  Chapter III b  
If one rests under a tree with little shade   One must not destroy its branches and leaves or its flowers and fruits If one does some evil to relatives one will never find happiness If the kindness of one meal is repaid with evil  
 One is an ungrateful evildoer His wholesome fruit does not grow but is extinguished again If a forest is burned and scorched it later grows again as before  
 But the good of an ungrateful person does not grow If one cares for an evil person with a hundred offerings he will never be grateful he will certainly repay with evil just as in the case of the sage on whom an elephant cow relied 
The sage kept the son alive but when grown he became deranged and killed the sage trampling his wooden dwelling to pieces 
 His mind is fickle and unstable just like a tree in a whirlpool He does not develop friendliness nor does he return any kindness He is like a white cloth as distinguished from a skillfully dyed one 
 If one wants to repay hatred one should increase goodness One must not harm with evil The wise repay hatred with friendliness One may carry the burden of heaven and earth of mountains and seas  
Equal friendliness toward all beings this is the highest and most excellent happiness When one helps someone cross a ford and pass in uttermost safety  Parable     twofold happiness of such friendliness is like this 
not to harm ones friend means happiness and doing away with ones arrogance also means happiness 
If internally one has no virtuous conduct and externally one is negligent  
 One is truly ignorant and produces arrogance If one likes violent strife and is friendly with evil friends ones fame is spoiled and one has a bad name 
Orphans old people sick people   The weak who have recently lost their riches and honor a lord who has lost his land who is destitute and poor those who are distressed by loneliness and have no supportif for those who are distressed by calamities   One does not feel pity one is not called benevolent 
If one reaches another country without any relatives forbearance means happiness when one meets with any foul scolding Restraining any foulness strife is appeased 
 It is better to stay in another country where people do not know you than to be in ones own state scorned by all If one is respected in another country people will all come and be close to you not creating any angry strife   Like ones friends and relatives in ones own country 
The happiness of riches and honors in the world is very little The sufferings of decay are very many If one sees that beings all give in   And are unable to restrain themselves silence means happiness 
The enemys power is superior and I am weak Since my friends are few I have no one to rely on If one considers thus silence means happiness 
 Unrighteous people desire and are stingy They do not trust are shameless and do not accept a word Silence toward those evil ones means happiness 
They have a great deal of hatred and the harm they bring is evil  Chapter III  
Near such people silence means happiness They do not trust are overbearing and like to be conceited 
They break the precepts and are malignant They do not bother with forbearance They always do what is wrong and never walk in faith Silence toward these people means happiness 
 They lie and have no moral dread They like slander wrong views harsh words and frivolous talk They are haughty and conceited and they count on their egos They are extremely stingy and cherish envy 
If people do not know you in some other place and if they do not distinguish your different characteristics and conduct you must not be conceited and feel pride 
On reaching another region and staying there one looks to others for clothing and food one is not selfsufficient If one is reviled one must bear it all 
If while staying in another region and expecting clothing and food  One wants happiness in ones undertakings one must also be forbearing just as I mentioned earlier 
If one stays in another region and expects clothing and food even if a vile person comes to despise you   The wise person ought to bear this 
If an evil friend lives in another region a foolish one may dwell together with the vile person A wise one brings himself to safety as when covering over a fire 
 Just as when a blustering gale blows over a blazing fire the flames spread through the forest and burn everything so hatred burns oneself and the others just like fire This is known as the damage of utter evil  Parable    Hatred and desire are eliminated by the wise person 
He who has never lived with goodness but who claims it at once having always been near evil is a deluded person  He who does not contemplate his faults but denies them at once he who performs such deeds is not a wise one 
If there were no foolishness wisdom would not be manifest Just as when a bird has a broken wing and cannot fly   A wise one is just like that if there are no fools Because of ones ample foolishness and ignorance one cannot understand that wisdom has power 
Because of this intelligent ones   Having extensive knowledge and being learned can dwell in happiness When a wise one gains an advantage his mind is not exalted and when he loses an advantage he is not dejected being free from delusion 
The principles he explains are praised as explanations of the truth  His every word is a protection against evil His eloquence is for happiness and benefit He gives explanations to bring about the necessary understanding 
When a wise one hears about something he does not immediately act  He considers and deliberates and he investigates whether it is true He acts only after he has understood whether it is right This is called benefitting oneself and benefitting others 
The wise one never   Performs an unwholesome action or an unprincipled deed for his own sake He does not offend against the Right Doctrine because of suffering or happiness and he never forsakes right conduct for his own sake 
 He also finds evil unsuitable and he is free from foolishness When peril is imminent he does not fear He never vilifies another to gain advantage He is neither fierce nor timid  
 Nor is he inferior but he stays exactly in the middle Such deeds are characteristic of a wise one Fierceness produces jealousy and timidity is despised by others Rid of these two extremes his behavior holds to the middle 
 Sometimes he is silent as if he were dumb Sometimes he kills with words as if he were a king Sometimes he brings cold like the snow and sometimes he offers heat like a blazing fire 
 Sometimes he is as lofty as Sumeru Sometimes he looks as low as ground covering Sometimes he is as illustrious as a king and sometimes he is quiet as if released 
 Sometimes he bears the hardships of hunger and thirst Sometimes he bears what is painful or pleasant All wealth is like excrement to him In his mastery he subdues all hatred 
 Sometimes he relaxes with music in merrymaking Sometimes he is as frightened as a deer and sometimes he is as fierce as a tiger or a wolf He contemplates the right time and the wrong time power and powerlessness 
 He contemplates riches and honor and their decline To bear the unbearable this is true forbearance To forbear the bearable this is ordinary forbearance One must also be forbearing toward the weak 
 When riches and honors are abundant one should always be humbly forbearing Forbearance of the unbearable this is called forbearance One must bear no grudge because of what may be resented Among people who hate ones mind must always be pure 
 If one sees someone doing evil one must not do it oneself Forbearance toward someone who is victorious over you is called forbearance from fear Forbearance toward someone who is your equal means one is afraid of strife Forbearance toward one who is inferior is called extensive forbearance 
 The fool cannot bear foul scolding and defamation feeling as if he had two stones in his eyes Experiencing foul scolding and grave defamation a wise one can bear it an elephant in a shower of flowers 
 If he is gravely defamed by foul scolding the wise one can bear it with his eye of wisdom just as when rain falls on a big rock the rock suffers no damage and is not destroyed  Bad words or good words painful or pleasant deeds the wise one bears them also as if he were a rock 
If one is reproached with the truth one may not be angry over a mans true words  If someone reproaches you with untrue statements that person makes a fool of himself through his own nonsense The wise person understands and feels no anger in either event 
When for the sake of wealth or of profit  
 One endures suffering or happiness and defamation through foul scolding or when one can endure not expecting wealth or profit even if the evil person has a hundred a thousand precious objects one should quickly leave him 
 When the branches of a tree are broken off one cannot climb it When someones thoughts are dispersed he must not be befriended Then follow another road and leave him far away The world will be full of potential friends 
 When one is first respectful and then haughty one is despised one is not praised and one does not get any respect Just like a white crane that swiftly flies away the wise person stays away from the fool and should leave him quickly 
 When a person likes strife and cherishes crookedness when he is happy to see someone elses wrong when he slanders lies speaks harsh and frivolous words when he despises and defames sentient beings   When furthermore he utters painful words penetrating to the marrow and when he does not guard his corporal verbal and mental actions the wise one should leave for somewhere else 
An evil person who is envious does not have wholesome thoughts  When he sees someone elses profit happiness and fame vexation and great bitterness arise in his mind His speech may be soft but his mind is utterly evil 
Yes a wise one must leave him and go somewhere else  When people find happiness in foul desire and covet advantages and honors when they are crooked and need something to cling to lacking any shame when inwardly they are not pure and likewise outwardly a wise person must quickly leave and go somewhere else 
 When someone has no reverential thoughts when he is taken in by pride but cannot be instructed when he calls himself a wise one but is a fool in reality a wise person must leave him and go somewhere else 
 When one has food and drink here and bedding and clothing on lifes road one must guard them and remember this kindness like a kind mother who saves her only child 
 Craving increases all suffering First abandon craving and leave hatred They can lead all people to an  Parable  c unwholesome destination 
Haughtiness and pride must be abandoned too  When you are rich you have friends but when you are poor they leave 
If it is for the sake of one family give up one person Give up one family for one village  Give up one village for a country Give up the world for your own person 
Give up your own person for the Right Doctrine Give up present riches for one finger  Give up your four limbs for your life Give up everything for the True Doctrine 
The Right Doctrine is your shelter against the rain as if it were an umbrella Those who practice the Doctrine are protected by the Doctrine  Through the power of practicing the Doctrine one avoids any unwholesome destination Practicing the Doctrine is just like finding shade in the scorching heat of spring 
Be on your way together with the wise  If one does not consider the possession of ample riches as joyful if one does not consider the loss of important valuables as sorrowful and if one does not constantly toil and seek one is called a strong hero 
 If one gives away ones riches and is very happy if worldly wrong is swiftly given up if one establishes oneself in peace even deeper than the sea one is called a vigorous superior man 
 If one understands what is meaningful skillful in everything if one is pliable as a person dwelling in happiness everybody will praise him as a fine man Upadardara said these words I shall double my devotion to my brother now If I meet with hardship if I am extremely distressed I shall  Chapter III never do anything wrong again 
Whether dying or living I gain riches  Or lose riches I shall do no evil 
O brother know now that I shall serve you I would rather die because of moral conduct than live because of immoral conduct 
Why should one live a whole life and be negligent and do evil 
In my birth and death I have done what is not good I have met evil friends and done what is not right but upon meeting with a virtuous friend I have ceased all this  With his knowledge of his previous lives the Buddha expounded these gathas to the bhiksus 
I was Dardara and Upadardara is Ananda 
 bhiksus you must know that the practice of this application is explained in collections of terms and in compilations of the Doctrine You must widely comply with the utmost respect  bhiksus of the Sangha practice this Dharma Parable  
Devadatta Wants to Harm the Buddha When the Buddha was in Rajagrha he said to Devadatta Do not harbor excessively obnoxious thoughts toward me the Tathagata 
You will sustain loss fall prey to unhappiness and yourself experience its suffering The bhiksus said It is extraordinary O Worldhonored One that Devadatta always has evil thoughts for you O Tathagata but for a long time you Worldhonored One have had friendly thoughts and pity  
You talk to him gently The Buddha said Not only now but also in the past In the land of Kasi in the city of Benares there was a great dragon king by the  Parable  name of Campeya He used to bring seasonal rain so that the grains would ripen On the fourteenth and on the fifteenth day he changed into a man and kept the five precepts practiced liberality and listened to the Doctrine 
At the time in southern India there was a master of spells He came and planted an arrow and made an incantation taking hold of the dragon king Campeya 
Then a celestial spirit said to the king of Kasi that there was a master of spells who was going to take the dragon king Campeya away from Kasi The king immediately brought out his troops and went out to chase him That Brahman then made another incantation so that the kings troops could not move at all 
The king spent a fortune to redeem the dragon king 
The Brahman came a second time to take the dragon king with his incantation but the relatives of the dragon raised clouds and made it rain 
Thunder crashed and they wanted to kill the Brahman but the dragon king was kind at heart and said to the crowd of dragons Do not take his life He soothed them with his goodness and let the man return 
When he came back a third time the dragons immediately wanted to kill him but a the dragon king protected him and did not let them kill him 
He let him go That dragon king is now I 
The master of spells is now Devadatta 
Even when I was a dragon I could be kind at heart and I frequently rescued others How much less would I lack friendliness now Parable  
The Jlvam jivaka Bird When the Buddha was in Rajagrha the bhiksus said to the Buddha O Worldhonored One Devadatta is your brother ie cousin O Tathagata 
Why does he always want to find fault with you O Buddha The Buddha said Not only now In the past in the Snowy Mountains there was a bird called jivamjivaka He had one body and two heads 
One head used to eat fine fruits and wanted the body to be safe The other head became jealous and said Why does  Chapter III he always eat fine fruits while I never get them He then picked a poisonous fruit and ate it so that the two heads both died 
If you want to know who is the one who ate the sweet fruit at that time it was myself 
The one who ate poisonous fruit then was Devadatta 
Formerly he shared one body with me but he still had evil thoughts Now he is my brother in the same way Parable  
The White Swan King The Buddha was in Rajagrha Devadatta pushed a mountain to crush the Buddha He let the elephant Dhanapala loose wanting him to trample upon the Buddha His bad reputation was spreading 
In front of a crowd Devadatta repented toward the Buddha touching the Tathagatas feet but when there was no crowd he spoke foul words among the bhiksus and reviled the Buddha 
Everyone said Devadatta repents toward the Buddha His mind is well subdued There is no reason for the spread of his bad reputation The bhiksus said Extraordinary O Worldhonored One is Devadattas ability to be treacherous 
In front of a crowd he is subdued toward the Buddha but when he is in a secluded spot he has evil thoughts and reviles the Buddha The Buddha said Not only now but also in long bygone times 
There was a lotus pond in which lived many water birds among them a stork He slowly stepped around in the pond lifting his feet All the birds said This bird behaves well there is dignity in his upbringing He does not disturb the water animals Then there was a white swan who spoke the gatha 
The stork said Why do you say these words 
Come and be friends b with me The white swan replied I know your treachery I shall never be your friend If you want to know the swan king was myself 
The stork of that time is now Devadatta  Parable  Parable  
The Big Tortoise The Buddha was in Rajagrha Devadatta constantly harbored malicious feelings He wanted to harm the Worldhonored One So he engaged five hundred Brahmans who could shoot well 
He had them go to the Worldhonored One with bows and arrows to shoot the Buddha with their bows but the arrows they shot changed to kumuda flowers pundarika flowers padma flowers and utpala flowers 
When the five hundred Brahmans saw this divine change they all grew very frightened and put aside their bows and arrows They worshipped the Buddha repented and sat down on one side 
The Buddha expounded the Doctrine to them and they all became srotapannas 
They further said to the Buddha Please let us go forth to study the path The Buddha said You have come well O bhiksusl Their hair fell off and they donned the robe of the Doctrine 
The bhiksus said to the Buddha O Worldhonored One your divine power is miraculous 
Devadatta always wants to harm you O Buddha but you O Buddha always show great friendliness The Buddha said Not only now 
In the past in Benares there was a merchant chief called Akrtajna He went to sea with five hundred traders to gather valuable objects 
Having obtained them he returned and was caught in a whirlpool His ships were seized by a water raksasa and he could not go any further 
The merchants were extremely frightened They all called out O spirits of heaven and spirits of earth spirits of sun and moon who would be so kind as to rescue us from our distress There was a big tortoise whose back was a mile wide 
Then the tortoise grew a little sleepy and Akrtajna wanted to hit the tortoise on the head with a large stone and kill it The merchants said We are alive saved from danger by the tortoise To kill it is unlucky and ungrateful Akrtajna said I am starving who is going to worry about  Chapter III gratitude He immediately killed the tortoise and ate its flesh 
That same night a herd of elephants trampled them all to death 
At that time the big tortoise was myself 
The one who was Akrtajna is Devadatta 
The five hundred merchants are the five hundred Brahmans who went forth and obtained the path 
I rescued them from their distress in the past and now I have again pulled them out of the misery of birth and death Parable  
Two Scheming State Councillors c When the Buddha was in Rajagrha Devadatta wanted to see the Buddha killed for all kinds of reasons but he did not succeed 
Then there was a Brahman who came from southern India He was an expert in magical skills and was able to compound poisonous drugs 
Devadatta then compounded a poisonous drug at the Brahmans place and scattered it on the Buddha 
The wind blew the drug away making it fall back on Devadattas own head so that he was stupefied on the spot He crawled on the ground and was about to die A doctor could not heal him 
Ananda said to the Buddha O Worldhonored One Devadatta is about to die because of the poison 
Out of pity the Buddha explained to him the truth From the time I achieved Buddhahood as a bodhisattva I have always felt compassion for Devadatta without any illfeeling 
Devadattas poison will be dissipated by itself After he spoke these words the poison was immediately dissipated 
The bhiksus said Extraordinary O Worldhonored One 
Devadatta always has evil in mind for you O Tathagata but you O Tathagata intend to keep him alive still The Buddha said Not only now does he have evil in mind for me 
In the past he was the same So they asked the Buddha What were these evil intentions toward you O Buddha The Buddha said In a time gone by in KasI in the city of Benares there were two state councillors 
One was called Senaka and the other was called Durmati 
Senaka always behaved according to the law but  Parable  Durmati always performed evil deeds He liked to scheme and he said to the king Senaka wants to perform a rebellious act So the king had put away 
The good spirits of heaven spoke out in the sky and said Such a worthy man He really has not committed any crime 
Why do you keep him under arrest The dragons then spoke in similar fashion and the officials and the people also spoke in the same way So the king set free Then Durmati stole from the kings treasury and put what he had taken in Senakas home 
But the king did not believe Durmati and said to him Being envious of him you have acted in this unreasonable manner The king ordered that Durmati be apprehended and handed over to Senaka who was instructed to pronounce judgment on him 
Senaka instructed Durmati to show repentance toward the king but Durmati knowing his own guilt fled to the king of Videha He prepared a jeweled box and filled it with two vicious snakes knowing that they were poisonous He had a messenger of the king of Videha send it to the other country Both the king and Senaka were to look at it together and not to show it to anyone else 
Senaka answered When something comes from afar one ought not to look at it oneself When fruit comes from afar one ought not to eat it immediately 
There are evil people there It may be that they come with evil to see you hurt The king said I do want to have a look Senaka emphatically warned him three times but the king did not heed his words 
He again said to the king If you do not accept my words you may look at it yourself O king I cannot look at it The king then opened it Both his eyes were blinded and he could see nothing 
Senaka was mortified he could have died of anxiety He sent people forth to the four directions to pass through every country to search for a good medicine far and wide 
When he had obtained fine medicine the kings eyes were cured and his  Chapter III sight restored They were healed and just as before 
The king at that time is Sariputra now 
The Senaka of that time is myself 
The Wild Cock King When the Buddha was in Rajagrha Devadatta went to where the Buddha was and said these words O Tathagata now is the time for you to dwell in a quiet place 
Let me take charge of this great assembly The Buddha said Swallow your spittle foolish fellow 
I would not commit any great assembly even to Sariputra or Maudgalyayana 
How could I commit one to you Devadatta went away cursing 
The bhiksus said O Worldhonored One Devadatta wants to cause you O Buddha all kinds of distress 
He is full of ways to deceive you O Tathagata The Buddha said Not only now In the past by the Snowy Mountains there was a cock king who was the leader of a multitude of chickens 
He said to the chickens Stay away from towns and villages Do not let yourselves be eaten by people We have many enemies Watch out for yourselves Then there was a cat in a village that heard about the presence of the cock 
She crawled slowly underneath the trees looking downward and said to the cock I shall be your wife and you will be my husband Your looks are proper and enchanting The comb on your head is red and your body is all white If we do this we shall be safe and happy The cock then spoke the gatha 
The cock at that time was myself the cat Devadatta 
Formerly in the past he wanted to entrap me and now he wants to entrap me again  Parable  Parable  
The Krkara Bird The Buddha was in Rajagrha 
Devadatta then thought The b Buddha has five hundred spirits in dark garments constantly guarding him The Buddha has ten powers A hundred a thousand Narayanas cannot equal them I cannot hurt him now 
I shall serve him still When I hurt him having observed his essential traits I may be able to kill him So he repented toward the Buddha in the great assembly of bhiksus bhiksunis upasakas and upasikas and he thought If he accepts my repentance I can make convenient use of it 
I want to develop the determination for practice in that solitary place The Buddha said My Doctrine is free from deceit 
All who deceive are without my Doctrine The six heretical teachers said Devadatta kindly repents toward the Buddha but the Buddha does not accept this repentance The bhiksus said Devadatta turns to the Buddha with deceit The Buddha said Not only now 
In the past long ago there was a king in Benares called Brahmadatta 
He had made a rule to stop killing There was a hunter then Wearing the garment of a seer he was killing deer and birds 
No one knew about it but there was a krkara bird who said to the people This very evil person may wear the garment of a seer but in reality he is a hunter He constantly commits killings but people do not know it Everybody believed the krkara bird that the truth was as it had said 
At that time the krkara bird was myself 
The hunter was Devadatta 
The king was Sariputra Parable  
The Aged Seer The Buddha was in Rajagrha 
King Ajatasatru then sent five hundred large measures of food a day to Devadatta and Devadatta was greatly honored 
The bhiksus all said to the Worldhonored  Chapter III One King Ajatasatru sends five hundred large measures of food a day to Devadatta The Buddha said O bhiksus do not extol the fact that Devadatta has obtained honorsAnd he spoke the stanza 
Having spoken this stanza he said to the bhiksus Not only now is Devadatta hurt by honors He does not slander me only now 
It c was the same in the past The bhiksus asked the Buddha What do you mean by the past The Buddha said Formerly in Benares on the Seer Mountains there were two seers One of them was aged and had obtained the five superknowledges 
The other one was in the prime of life and had obtained absolutely nothing 
Then the aged seer went to Uttarakuru through his supernatural power He came back with ripe rice and they both ate it 
He also came back with jambu fruit and they both ate it 
Having arrived in the Trayastrimsa Heaven he came back with divine sudha and they both tasted it 
When the young seer had seen this his mind started longing and he said to the aged one I wish you would teach me how to develop the five superknowledges The aged seer said If you are goodhearted you will obtain the five superknowledges and certainly be benefitted 
If you are not goodhearted you will on the contrary experience damage He still zealously stated his desire O please teach me Then the aged seer taught the five superknowledges and the younger seer consequently obtained them 
After he had obtained the five superknowledges he showed all kinds of supernatural power in front of a crowd After that he became very famous and honored and so he became envious of the aged one Slandering him  Parable  everywhere he lost his supernatural powers 
When all had heard this they said The aged seer has had these qualities for a long time and the young seer slanders him unreasonably So they were all angry at him They blocked his way at the gate of the city and did not let him in 
If you want to know the aged seer then is myself 
The young seer then is Devadatta 
The Two Traders The Buddha was in Rajagrha 
Those then among the bhiksus who took the Buddhas words to heart all obtained nirvana or the destination of gods and humans Those who took Devadattas words to heart all fell into hell and experienced great suffering 
The Buddha said Not only now do those who receive my teaching get considerable gain and those who follow Devadatta s words get considerable suffering 
It was the same in the past 
In the past there were two traders who both led five hundred merchants 
In the desert there was a yaksa demon who had taken on the appearance of a youth He wore fine clothes and on his head he wore a garland of flowers He was walking while playing the lute He said to the traders Arent you completely exhausted 
Right ahead of you there are fine water plants If you come with me I shall show you the way One merchant leader consequently believed his words Let us now throw away the water plants we are carrying so that we may travel light He went on ahead of the others 
The other trader said    a We do not see water plants now Do not throw them away The one who threw the water plants away died of thirst 
The one who did not throw them away reached his destination 
The one who did not throw away the water plants then is myself

Eight Gods One after the Other Ask about the Doctrine Formerly when the Buddha was in the world eight gods one after the other suddenly came late at night to where the Worldhonored One was 
The appearance of the one who came first was dignified and his luminescence shone for a whole mile With ten goddesses as his retinue he came to the Buddha He bowed most reverently and withdrew to one side 
The Buddha said to the god Because of the merits you have developed you have received a celestial body rejoice in the five desires and readily obtain happiness Then the god said to the Buddha 
 Worldhonored One I was born and live in heaven but my heart is always sad 
Although in my behavior in my former existence I was loyal and pious toward my parents toward my masters and toward sramanas and Brahmans although I felt respect for them still I could not be diligent toward them when paying respect or worshiping  when welcoming them or seeing them off 
Because of this action my recompense is truly little less than that of other gods Because it is less I myself disapprove of my conduct being unable to find satisfaction 
There was another god The appearance of his body was brilliant and his retinue excelled ten times that of the previous one He came to the Buddha made a deep obeisance and withdrew to one side 
The Buddha said to the god Being bom in heaven you readily obtain happiness The god said to the Buddha 
 Worldhonored One I was born and live in heaven yet  am always sad 
Although in my behavior in the previous world I was loyal and pious toward my parents toward my masters and toward sramanas and Brahmans although I was respectful and worshiped  still I could not give them a smooth mat for a bed or a seat

Although in my former existence I was very loyal and pious toward my parents toward my masters and toward sramanas and Brahmans although I was respectful and worshiped and gave them bedding still I could not arrange for enough savory food and drink with which to honor them 
Because of this action the recompense I now obtain is less than that of other gods Because it is less I reproach myself that the karmic cause I have developed is not complete Therefore I am sad

Because of this the recompense I now obtain is less than that of other gods Because it is less I constantly reprimand myself that the karmic cause I developed is not satisfying Therefore I am sad 
There was yet another god whose appearance was brilliant and whose retinue excelled ten times that of the previous one He came to the Buddha made a deep obeisance and withdrew to one side 
 Chapter III The Buddha said to the god Experiencing a celestial body you readily obtain happiness The god said to the Buddha

On the way he happened to meet a man of the path Taking his alms bowl and holding his staff he went along begging for food The laborer immediately started thinking That sramanas appearance is fine and his dignity shows his upbringing He is very worthy of respect 
The poor man then said to the man of the path I have some parched barley flour with me 
He gave it to him and he uttered the prayer If this man of the path has obtained the path by maintaining the precepts in purity may he see to it that I become king of two small countries The man of the path again said Why so little 
Why so little The poor man thought He may be a man of the path but he looks like a very big eater 
However I have invited him Everything must be provided to him He mixed two more pints of  Parable  b flour made a lump with it and gave it to him He then thought If this man of the path has obtained the path by maintaining the precepts in purity may he see to it that I become king of four small countries The man of the path again said Why so little 
He mixed it all made a lump and gave it to the man of the path He further uttered the prayer Now if this man of the path is someone who maintains the precepts in purity may he see to it that I become the king of Benares command four small countries and obtain the path of insight into the Truths Because the man of the path when obtaining flour complained that it was too little the poor m an said I do wish that you would eat now 
If it is not sufficient I shall take off my garment trade it for food and drink and give it to you But when the man of the path had eating he had only used up one pint and he gave the rest back to its owner 
The poor man asked him O venerable one you previously complained that there was much too little flour 
Why do you not use up the food now The man of the path answered When you first gave me a lump of flour you wanted to be the king of a small country so I said that your hearts wish was too small With the second lump of flour you wished to be the king of two small countries so I said that you wished for too little With the third lump of flour you wished to be the king of four small countries so I said that your hearts wish was too small With the fourth lump of flour you wanted to be the king of Benares and command four small countries obtaining later the fruit of the path of insight into the Truths 
I did not object that it was too little because the quantity was not enough Then the poor man started doubting If I can now rule five countries this is no small matter 
I fear it isnt true He further considered If he can know my thoughts he must be a noble man a great field of merit 
Surely he does not deceive me The man of the path knew this He threw his alms bowl into the sky and then  Chapter IV flew away He was transformed into a large body filling the sky 
He then changed into a body as small as a particle 
Water emerged above his person and fire came out beneath him He walked on water as on earth and he walked on earth as on water Making the eighteen transformations he said to the poor man You have uttered your great wish well Have no doubts about it He then rendered himself invisible and departed 
Then the poor man went to the city of Benares and on the way he met a state councillor 
When the state councillor saw him he carefully looked him over and said to him Are you not the son of Mr 
Soandso He answered Yes I am He asked him W hy are you so shabby He answered When I was young I lost those on whom I relied In my family all have died and there is no one to look up to 
Therefore I am in poverty and so shabby The state councillor then informed the king of Benares The son of Mr Soandso your dear friend O king is now outside the gate 
He is completely impoverished The king subsequently ordered that the man be brought before him 
Asking full details he knew he was a dear friend The king then informed him Be very close to me 
Beware do not leave me Seven days later the king fell ill and his life ended The ministers started planning and said The king has no heir Yes this poor boy was dear to our king 
It is fitting that we promote him to be the king of Benares When he got command over four countries he became cruel Then that previous man of the path sitting in full lotus posture in the sky in front of the kings palace and he said In the past you uttered a prayer to see the Truths 
Why do you do all this evil now disregarding the past He further explained the Doctrine in several ways to the king 
When the king heard the Doctrine he regretted the evil he had done before He gave up his errors and felt shame He practiced the path with special zeal and became a srotapanna  Parable  Parable  
A Poor Girl Gives Her Two Coins and Obtains Her Recompense Formerly on Mount Grdhrakuta there were many noble ones monks living in seclusion 
The reputation of that mountain was wellknown throughout the countries spreading in all directions Those who brought offerings were numerous 
There was an elder who took his relatives and went to submit offerings 
A poor beggar woman thought The elders are bringing contributions to the mountain now They are going to hold a gathering I am sure I shall c go there to beg So she went to the mountain 
Upon her arrival on the mountain where she saw the elders arranging all manner of delicacies and offering them to the monks she thought to herself They have developed merit in their previous existences and are rich now If they now perform meritorious acts again they will achieve excellence I have not performed anything in my previous existence 
In this world I am poor If I do not perform anything now I shall be even worse off in the future Thinking this she cried and was unhappy 
She further thought I once picked up two coins out of some manure I have always saved them for the time when my begging would be unsatisfactory I was going to exchange them for food and drink and support myself with them 
I may not obtain food or drink for a day or two but that will not kill me after all She waited until the monks had finished their meal took the two coins and presented them 
The monks on the mountain had a rule that when someone had given something the karmadana would stand in front of the monks and offer a prayer for the benefit of the donor 
Why does he not do as he usually does when he sees money  Chapter IV The senior subsequently left half of his food for this woman 
All saw that the senior gave a great deal to the woman and they too gave her much 
The woman could then carry away a great deal of food and she was extremely happy I just happened to give and now I am recompensed 
So she returned from the mountain carrying the food Arriving under a tree she lay down to sleep and rested 
The kings principal wife happened to have been dead for seven days The king sent messengers to search throughout the land for anyone who had enough merits to become his wife 
The diviners foretold that under a yellow cloud cover there had to be a worthy person 
So they all went and arriving at that tree they saw that the womans beauty was luminous with the mark of merits The tree cast a twisting shadow but light and shadow did not change 
The diviners said This womans merits are adequate to make her the wife So they bathed her in fragrant water and gave her the wifes clothes which were neither too big not too small but just right for her Guided by an escort of a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders she was led to the palace 
When the king saw her he was happy and he felt respect in his heart Thus some time passed She thought to herself The reason I obtained this prosperity is that I gave the coins 
Those monks have done me an enormous favor So she said to the king I was poor before but I was brought forward by you O king 
As I have come to be someone let me repay the kindness of the monks When the king told her to do as she wished his wife immediately went to the mountain with cartloads of food and even precious things 
He sent the karmadana to pronounce the prayer and did not pronounce the prayer himself 
The kings wife said For my two coins in the past you uttered a prayer for me but now that I bring you cartloads of precious things you do not utter a prayer for me All the young bhiksus were displeased with the senior monk 
Before when a poor woman gave two coins he pronounced his prayer but now that the kings wife brings cartloads of precious things he does not pronounce a prayer 
Is this because he is getting old  Parable  Then the senior monk expounded the Right Doctrine to the kings wife and he said Woman in your heart you are displeased with me thinking Before when I gave two coins he pronounced a prayer for me but now that I bring cartloads of precious things he does not pronounce a prayer Concerning the Buddhas Doctrine I do not prize precious things 
Woman when you gave two coins before your wholesome thoughts were very excellent Afterwards you gave precious things but your ego was proud Therefore I do not pronounce a prayer for you now 
You must profoundly understand the thought of going forth 
The young men of the path were all ashamed and they all became srotdpannas 
When the kings wife heard the Law she was ashamed but happy She too became a srotapanna 
Having heard the Law she made obeisance and withdrew 
Khanu a Painter from Gandhara Arranges for Food and Obtains His Recompense Formerly in Gandhara there was a painter by the name of Khanu For three years of employment he earned thirty ounces of gold He was about to return home when he saw that in some other region they were holding the great quinquennial assembly  He asked the karmadana How much might you need to arrange for an assembly for one day The karmadana replied For thirty ounces of gold you can obtain an assembly for one day So he thought to himself Because I did not plant meritorious deeds in my former life I have received this retribution and must make my living as an employee 
Why not support it So he said to the karmadana Please let me be a disciple 
I want to arrange for an assembly After he had arranged for the assembly he was happy and joyful He immediately returned home 
When he reached home his wife asked him where the money for his three  Chapter IV b years of employment was 
Her husband answered All of the money I have earned is now put in a secure repository His wife then asked Where is this secure repository The man said In the Sangha His wife then blamed him and she called a meeting of their home town 
They tied up her husband and she went to a judge and said We mother and child are poor and suffer hardship We have no clothes and no food but when my husband has earned money he spends it elsewhere and does not bring it back home 
Would you please investigate why The judge then asked her husband Why so He answered Just like the flash of lightning my body does not shine for long Also just like the early dew of morning it disappears after a short while Therefore I was fearful and I said to myself deeply that I now met with hardship and was in need of clothing and food because I had not performed meritorious acts in my previous existences Therefore because I saw that they were holding the pancavarsika in Puskaravati and that the community was pure I felt joy 
The karmadana answered that with thirty ounces of gold I could provide for one day 
He renounced his own garment his necklace his saddle horse and all his chariot equipment and he gave it all to Khanu 
Such was his splendid recompense His fruition would come later 
Kapila and His Wife Sell Themselves Arrange a Gathering and Presently Obtain Their Recompense Once there was a man called Kapila 
He provided for their livelihood by hiring himself  Parable  out He saw that others the elders all went to the temple to hold a great almsgiving gathering When he returned home he lay down to rest for the night with his wife His head lying on his wifes arm he thought to himself I am poor now because I did not perform meritorious acts in my previous existence 
Someone like that elder has performed meritorious acts both in his previous existence and now 
I do not have any merit now and in the future world I shall suffer even more Having thought this he wept with unhappiness and his tears fell on the arm of his wife 
The wife asked her husband Why do you cry He answered I see that when someone develops merit he is always happy but I myself am low and poor 
That is why my tears fall The wife said What good does it do to weep 
You may sell me to someone else and perform meritorious acts with the money The husband said If I were to sell you how could I stay alive myself The wife said If I am not driven out because you fear for your livelihood let us both you and I sell ourselves now and develop merit Thereupon the man and his wife both went away to a wealthy family 
They said We man and wife now ask you to trade these worthless persons for moneyThe master asked them How much money do you want They replied We want ten pieces of gold The master said I shall give you the money now but if after seven days you cannot repay me I shall take you and your wife as my slaves They expressed their agreement and settled the matter 
Carrying the money they went away and came to that temple 
With the gift they arranged to provide for a gathering but the husband   c and wife both pounded rice themselves They encouraged one another saying Now we have to do our best and perform meritorious deeds 
Later when we belong to another family how can we comply with our intentions Thereupon night and day they diligently made preparations for the gathering When the sixth day had arrived and they were going to provide for the gathering the lord of the country also happened to want to provide for a gathering Upon arrival they quarreled about the day 
The monks all said We have accepted the poor one so we cannot  Chapter IV change The lord of the country heard this and he said What kind of a small man is he that he can quarrel with me about the day of the gathering So he sent someone to say to Kapila Leave my day to me Kapila replied I really will not give way for you The messenger returned three times in this way bringing back the same refusal as the first time 
The king wondered why He went himself to the monastery and said  Why do you not arrange it for a later day Why do you quarrel with me about the day He replied I am my own master for just one day more 
After that I shall belong to another family and be unable to provide any more The king asked why he could not and the one who had sold himself said We considered that we had not performed meritorious deeds in our previous existence and that we are poor now 
Moved by this fact we just sold ourselves trading ourselves for money Performing meritorious acts with it we want to end this suffering 
If we have no property to repay the other party after seven days we shall be slaves 
Now it is the sixth day so tomorrow it will be over 
Therefore we quarreled about the day risking our lives When the king heard these words he felt profound pity and sighed at this unheardof event You truly understand the hardship of poverty You can change an insecure body for a secure body You change insecure riches for secure riches 
You change an insecure life for a secure life Then he let them arrange for the gathering The king took off his own and his wifes garments and their necklaces and gave them to Kapila and his wife He ceded ten villages to them and enfeoffed them for their merit 
As for him who develops merit with all his heart however splendid his presently obtained recompense may be how much greater will be the recompense he obtains in the future 
Looking at it from this standpoint all people in the world want to escape from suffering They must diligently develop merit How can they be selfindulgent lazy and heedless  Parable  Parable  
A Srdm anera Saves Ants from Water and Is Recompensed with Long Life Once there was a man of the path an arhat who was bringing up a srdmanera  He knew that this srdmaneras life was sure to end after seven days He gave him a leave of absence and let him return home He told him to come back on the seventh day 
On his way he saw many ants floating about on the water Their life was about to come to an end and he had compassionate   a thoughts He took off his kasdya filled it with earth made a dam in the water and rescued the ants He put them up in a high and dry place so that they all could live 
When he returned to his master on the seventh day his master was very astonished 
The master subsequently entered into concentration Contemplating with his heavenly eye he knew that had no longer had any remainder of merit but that he had obtained by saving the ants He did not die on the seventh day but prolonged his life 
The King of Gandhara Attends to an Old Pagoda and His Life Is Prolonged Long ago there was a lord in the land of Gandhara And there was a wise diviner who predicted that the kings life was sure to end in seven days time 
The king set out on a hunting trip and saw an old pagoda dilapidated and in ruins So he and his ministers had it restored When the restoration was completed he returned to his palace in good spirits and for seven days he lived uneventfully 
When the diviner saw that the king had lived through the seven days he wondered why and he asked the king What meritorious act did you perform The king answered I did not do anything in particular 
His merit was due to his restoration of the pagoda 
 Chapter IV b Parable  A B hiksu Repairs a Hole in a Temple Wall and as a Recompense His Life Is Prolonged Long ago there was a bhiksu The time of his death was upon him There happened to be a heretic a Brahman who saw signs and knew that within seven days the life of this bhiksu was sure to end 
Then when this bhiksu entered a monastery he saw that there was a hole in the wall He immediately made a lump of plaster and filled it in 
Because of this merit he lengthened his life and was able to live through the seven days 
When the Brahman saw this he wondered why and he asked him What merit did you cultivate The bhiksu answered I did not cultivate anything in particular 
Yesterday when I entered the monastery I saw that there was a hole in the wall 
I just repaired it The Brahman said with a sigh The field of merit of the Sangha is most important It can let a bhiksu who is about to die live on and prolong his life Parable  
An Elders Son Meets the Buddha and Asks to Lengthen His Life Once the Buddha was in the world A diviner predicted that although the fiveor sixyearold son of an elder was endowed with good qualities his life would be short 
The elder led him to the six heretical teachers expecting that they might lengthen his life but not one of those six teachers could provide a way to prolong it and he was angry 
He led to the Buddha and said Please O Worldhonored One prolong this boys short life for me The Buddha said There is no way I can give him a long life Again he said to the Buddha Please show us a means The Buddha then instructed him Go to the gate of the city 
Greet those who enter too There was then a demon who had taken the appearance of a Brahman He was about to come and enter the city The child  Parable  greeted him With an incantation the demon spoke the wish May you live long This demon was the demon who killed children 
But the way of a demon does not allow a double standard Because he had allowed him a long life he could not kill him any more 
This being the case he humbly restrained himself and was respectful The son was able to prolong his life 
Parable  An Elders Son Becomes a Servant Arranges a Gathering and Obtains His Present Recompense Once when the Buddha was in the world there was an elders son who had lost his parents early Alone destitute and solitary he provided for his living by being a servant 
He heard people say that in the Trayastrimsa Heaven there was extreme happiness He also heard others say that if one worships the Buddha and his Sangha one will surely be born  So he asked someone How much does it take to be able to worship the Buddha and his Order Then someone said For thirty ounces of gold you can organize a gathering So he came to the marketplace seeking a post as a servant 
Near the marketplace there was a very wealthy elder who could engage him as a servant 
The elder asked him Well what can you do He answered I can do any task How much do you ask for three years of service He answered I ask thirty ounces of gold When the elder heard that he could do anything he hired his services 
His conduct was upright In gold and silver in copper and iron and in every kind of business he made twice the usual amount of profit 
When the time had come he asked the elder his price in gold for his services 
The elder asked him Now that you have the gold what will you do with it He answered I want to worship the Buddha and his Sangha The elder said I shall assist you now 
You just invite the Buddha and his Order So he went to the monastery to invite the Buddha and his Sangha 
The Buddha stayed in his own quarters but the monks all accepted the invitation of the son  
On the day of the big event many people sent all kinds of food and drink to be given to the Order 
The monks had already eaten their fill when they arrived at the abode of the son 
The son then served the food with his own hands but the abbot said to give just a little 
They all in turn said to give just a little down to the lowest rank 
The son was distressed and lamented I have toiled for three years to arrange for this food and drink hoping that the Sangha would eat it but the monks do not take the food 
I want to be born in heaven but I shall certainly not be born there He went to the Buddha and said As the monks do not eat my offerings my wish c will certainly not be realized The Buddha said Did they eat something He answered They all ate something The Buddha said Even if they had not eaten anything your wish would surely be fulfilled 
How would it not be fulfilled when they have eaten something The youth was glad and he returned to eat and drink 
At that moment the monks had finished their meal and gone back 
Then five hundred merchants came back from the sea They entered the city and asked for food and drink 
There was a dearth of food at that time Nobody gave anything 
Someone said The son arranged for a gathering today 
He is sure to have food and drink When the son heard that there were merchants he was happy to give them food All five hundred merchants ate their fill All their attendants were fully satiated too 
The lowest merchant gave him a pearl worth ten thousand ounces of gold 
The highest one gave him a pearl worth a hundred thousand ounces of gold 
Every one of the five hundred merchants gave a pearl and they also gave him a brass basin Although they gave this to the son he did not dare take it 
He went to ask the Buddha about it and the Buddha said This is your splendid recompense Just take it without anxiety Later you will certainly be bom in heaven have no fear The elder who had employed him had no son he just had a daughter 
Thus his became the first  Parable  in Srvasti 
At the end of the elders life King Prasenajit heard that he was clever and wise and he asked the elder to give the youth all the family possessions Such was his splendid recompense 
His fruition followed 
Parable  Purna Gives the Buddha a Bowl of Food and Obtains His Present Recompense Long ago when the Buddha was in the world there were five Brahman brothers 
One was called Yasas the second was called Vimala the third was called Gavampati and the fourth was called Sodayin 
These four brothers had gone into the mountains to apply themselves to the path They obtained the five superknowledges 
The youngest brother was called Purna When he saw the Buddha asking for alms he filled his bowl with fine white rice and gave it to the Buddha 
At that time plowing and sowing were Pumas regular occupations So when his plowing and sowing were finished he went back to his house 
Once when he left for his field he saw that the crop growing in his field had changed to golden grain several feet high 
After he had harvested it the crop grew again as before The king heard this and he too came to reap but he could not gather it all In the same way none of all those who came to collect it could gather it all 
The brothers thought Is our younger brother Purna making a living or is he poor So they all came to look into the matter 
When they saw that their brothers occupation was more prosperous than the kings they said to their brother You used to be poor 
Why are you rich all of a sudden He replied When I met Gautama I gave him a bowl of rice and obtained this recompense When the four brothers heard this they were oveijoyed 
They further said to their brother Now prepare lumps of sweetmeat for us Each of the four of us will take one lump and offer it to Gautama with the wish to be bom in heaven Not having listened to his Doctrine they did not need deliverance 
I l l Chapter IV Each one thereupon took a lump of sweetmeat and went to where the Buddha was The eldest brother grasped one lump and put it into the Buddhas bowl 
The Buddha said All formations are impermanent When the second one then put his lump of sweetmeat into the Buddha s bowl the Buddha spoke these words They are of the nature that they rise and pass away When the third one then put his lump of sweetmeat into the Buddhas bowl the Buddha spoke these words When their coming into existence and passing away have ended  
 When the fourth one then put his lump of sweetmeat into the Buddhas bowl the Buddha spoke these words Their allayment means happiness So they returned home 
Having reached a solitary place they asked one another Did you hear what he said The first brother said I heard All formations are impermanent The second one had heard They are of the nature that they rise and pass away The next one had heard When their coming into existence and passing away have ended  
 The fourth one had heard Their allayment means happiness While the four brothers all considered this stanza they became angmins and they all came to where the Buddha was They asked for the homeless state and obtained arhatship 
Parable  Mahaprajapatl Who Gives the Buddha a Garment Made of a Golden Fabric and the Craftsman Who Pierces Pearls Once when the Buddha was in the world Mahaprajapatl made a garment for the Buddha out of a fabric with golden threads and she took it and offered it to the Buddha 
The Buddha then said Give it to my Sangha Mahaprajapatl said I suckled and raised you O Worldhonored One I have made this garment myself And so I offer it to you O Buddha I hoped that you O Tathagata would accept it from me 
Why did you say just now to give it to your Sangha The Buddha said I would like to let my aunt obtain great merit 
The field of merit of the Sangha is vast and  Parable  endless That is why I have exhorted you 
If you follow my advice you will already have brought an offering to the Buddha Mahaprajapati then took this garment and went to the Sangha She started with the abbot but no one ventured to take it 
Next it was Maitreyas turn and Maitreya accepted the garment He put it on and went to the city to beg for alms 
Maitreyas body had the thirtytwo marks and the color of pure purple gold After his arrival in the city everybody strove to see him but nobody gave him food 
There was a craftsman who pierced pearls He saw that not one person gave food So he knelt before him and invited him He led Maitreya to his home and gave him food 
When Maitreya had finished his meal the craftsman who pierced pearls then spread a small seat in front of him and beseeched him to tell about the Doctrine 
Maitreya had the four powers of eloquence So he explained the Good Law to him in several ways 
The craftsman who pierced pearls then wished to listen and was happy to hear it He could not hear enough 
Previously there had been an elder who wanted to give his Vb daughter in marriage He had engaged the craftsman who pierced pearls to pierce one precious pearl for a hundred thousand coins 
At that moment the family who gave the daughter in marriage sent someone to ask for the pearl 
As the craftsman who pierced pearls was just then listening intensely to the Doctrine he did not have time to pierce it So he answered Could you wait just a little while came a second time with his request 
He even came a third time but he still did not obtain it 
The elder became angry and he returned to take away all his money and his pearl 
The wife of the craftsman who pierced pearls was angry at her husband and she said Dont you have anything else to do If you had pierced the pearl instantly we should have gained a hundred thousand coins Why did you listen to the beautiful explanation of this man of the path When her husband heard this he felt bitter in his mind 
At that moment Maitreya knew his bitterness and he asked him Can you follow me to the temple He answered Yes So he followed Maitreya to the monastery 
Maitreya asked the abbot Suppose  Chapter IV someone obtains a hundred thousand catties of gold 
Would it be better to listen with joy to an explanation of the Doctrine Kaundinya said Even if someone had obtained a hundred thousand catties of gold it would be better if he gave a bowl of food to one who observes the moral precepts 
All the more so if he could listen for a moment with devout thoughts to an explanation of the Doctrine he would then surpass him a hundred a thousand ten thousand times Thereupon he asked the question of a second venerable and the venerable answered If someone had obtained a hundred thousand chariots filled with gold it still would be better to give one bowl of food to one who observes the moral precepts 
All the more so if he were happy listening to the Doctrine In due time he further asked his question of a third venerable and the venerable answered If someone had obtained a hundred thousand sheds filled with gold it still would be better to give one bowl of food to a person who observes the moral precepts 
All the more so if he listens to the Dharma He further asked his question of a fourth venerable and the venerable answered If one had obtained a hundred thousand states filled with gold it still would be better to give one bowl of food to a person who observes the moral precepts All the more so if he listened to the Doctrine it would be a hundred a thousand ten thousand times better Thus he asked his question of one after the other and then it was Aniruddhas turn 
Aniruddha said If someone had obtained gold that filled the four continents it still would be better to give one meal to a person who observes the moral precepts 
All the more so if he listens to the Dharma Maitreya asked him Reverend you say that if one were to give one bowl of food to a bhiksu it would surpass even the possession of gold that filled the four continents Why is it so The reverend answered I shall certify this with my own person 
I recall that nine million kalpas ago there were an elder and his two sons One was called Rista and the other was called Arista He used to tell them The high must come down the  Parable  permanent must come to an end That which has come to life will die and that which has come together will be separated The elder fell ill 
Do not dwell apart For instance one string cannot tie down an elephant but if one assembles many strings an elephant cannot break them 
If you stay together you too will be like a bundle of strings Then after the elder had given his last instruction to his sons he stopped breathing and his life ended 
Because their father had told them to the brothers lived together holding each other in high esteem 
Later the elder brother let his younger brother marry Having lived with them for a while the wife of the younger brother said to her husband You are like his slave 
The expenditure of riches and the affairs dealing with guests all depend on your brother You only get clothing and food If you are not a slave then what are you She kept saying these words 
At this moment a change of heart happened to the husband and his wife He asked his elder brother to live apart 
The elder brother said to his younger brother You do not remember our fathers words when he was dying However the younger brother did not change but kept asking him to live apart 
When the elder brother saw that his brothers mind was made up they then separated 
The younger couple was youthful and given to ease and their expenditures were extravagant After a short while the younger brother was poor and in trouble and he came to beg from his elder brother 
His elder brother gave him a hundred thousand coins at that time Not long after he had left with the money he spent it all and came with a new demand 
Thus he returned six times and each time he was given a hundred thousand coins 
When he returned the seventh time his elder brother reprimanded him You do not remember our fathers words when he was dying You have asked for a separation but you are unable to apply yourself to making a living You keep coming to ask for things 
I shall give you a hundred thousand coins once more but if you cannot do all  Chapter IV right and come with a new demand I shall no longer give you anything in the future After these bitter words husband and wife both applied themselves to making a living Gradually they became wealthy 
The elder brother lost his riches and gradually became poor He came to beg from his younger brother His younger brother did not even give his brother a meal and said I say O brother you were always rich Did you become poor too 
Why do you come today to ask something from me When the elder brother had heard this he was utterly dejected and he thought If even brothers from the same father are like this it will be all the more so with strangers So disgusted with birth and death he did not return home but went to the mountains to apply himself to the path 
His younger brother afterwards gradually became poor too and as the world met with a drought and famine he made a living selling firewood 
The pratyekabuddha then came to the city to beg for food He obtained absolutely nothing and went back to the mountains with an empty bowl 
The person who sold firewood then saw the pratyekabuddJ'a leave the city with an empty bowl He wanted to give him the millet gruel he had earned selling firewood He said to the pratyekabuddha Reverend could you take coarse food The pratyekabuddha answered It does not make any difference whether it is fine or coarse 
It will allow me to sustain myself a The person who sold firewood then gave it to the pratyekabuddha who accepted it and ate it When he had eaten it he flew up in the air made the eighteen transformations and returned to the same place 
The person who sold firewood later went to gather firewood again On his way he saw a rabbit and seized it with a stick It changed to a dead person who suddenly rose and came at him and grasped him around the neck The person with the firewood wanted to push him away any way he could to make him go away but he could not get rid of him 
He tried to rid himself of the person until dark and came home  Parable  carrying him on his back When he was in his home the dead man let go and fell to the floor it was a person made of genuine gold 
The man who sold firewood then cut off the golden mans head upon which the head grew again He removed his hands and feet and the hands and the feet grew again Before long the golden head and the golden hands filled his room stacked up as a big pile 
The neighbors informed the minister In the house of this poor man all by itself there grew this pile of gold When the king heard this he sent a messenger to ascertain what had happened 
When he arrived in the room he saw nothing but the hands feet and head of a putrid corpse 
The man of the house himself took the golden head and came to present it to the king Yes it was genuine gold 
The king was very glad Taking him to be a man of good fortune he endowed him with a village 
After that his life ended and he was reborn in the second heaven as Sakra lord of the gods He descended to a rebirth among men as a noble Cakravartin  He was a king of gods or a king of men for ninetyone kalpas without any interruption whatsoever 
Now in his final body he was reborn in the Sakya clan On the day he was born over thirty miles of hidden valuables sprang up all by themselves 
He gradually grew up but Sakya Mahanama his elder brother was loved more by his parents My mother ie Aniruddhas mother wanted to put her sons to the test So she sent word that she had no food 
I Aniruddha said Just bring me something without any food So they gave me an empty plate The empty plate then naturally filled itself with food of a hundred flavors 
Even if one used the gold of the four continents to feed oneself it would not be sufficient for one kalpa so it certainly could not bring me constant happiness for ninetyone kalpas 
As for the reason that I now spontaneously obtained this food it was just because I had given one bowl of food in a previous life that I now obtained this recompense From the Buddhas down to the Brahma gods those with pure morality are called people who observe the moral precepts 
When the craftsman who pierced pearls heard these words he was very glad in his heart  Parable Parable Parable Parable Parable Parable  Parable  Parable

The bhiksus asked For what reason was this heavenly son reborn in a heavenly mansion The Buddha said Formerly among people he constructed a lecture hall for me 
He came to me and moved by my kindness he worshipped me When he heard an explanation of the Doctrine again he became a srotapanna 
An Elder Sees That the King Constructs a Pagoda He Constructs a Pagoda Too and Is Recompensed with Rebirth in Heaven At that time on Mt Grdhrakuta there was an elder from southern India He saw that King Bimbisara constructed a splendid stupa and a monastery for the Buddha He too invited the Tathagata and constructed a stupa and a monastery for him to dwell in 
Afterwards when his life had ended the elder was reborn in heaven He came to the Buddha In his gratitude he worshipped him The Buddha expounded the Doctrine to him and he became a srotapanna 
The bhiksus asked As a result of what previous karma was this heavenly son reborn in a heavenly mansion The Buddha said Formerly among people he saw that the king erected a  Parable  a pagoda and grew happy 
As a result of this wholesome action he was reborn in heaven He heard the Doctrine from me again he was devoutly awakened and realized srotapatti 
A Merchant Constructs a House Offers It to the Buddha and Is Reborn in Heaven At that time in the land of SravastI there was a merchant 
His mother raised his son When the son had grown up he too wanted to go on a far journey 
His grandmother said to him Your father went away on a far journey but he died and did not return 
Open a shop in town in the neighborhood He then respected her command and put up a shop in town He thought The people of this city all invite the Buddha Now I have recently constructed a house I too shall invite the Tathagata So he went to invite the Buddha 
When the Buddha arrived he said to the Buddha I offer you this house O Tathagata From now on when you come to the city you may always come to my house to wash your hands and to wash your bowl Afterwards life ended and he was reborn in heaven He came to the Buddha 
The Buddha expounded the Doctrine to him and he became a srotapanna 
The bhiksus asked Because of which previous karmic causality was this god reborn in heaven The Buddha said Formerly when he was a man he had just built a shop 
As a result of this wholesome action he is now reborn in heaven He heard the Doctrine from me again and obtained his recompense  Chapter VI Parable  Parable  Parable  
Lord Sakras Questions The Saving of Ajnatakaundinya and Others and an Explanation of the Past The Sakya Son Ksema Has an Eye Sickness but When He Takes Refuge in the Three Precious Things His Eyes Are Purified Seven Kinds of Liberality The Land of King Chiapu Suffers a Drought and by Bathing the Buddha the People Obtain Rain An Elder Invites Sariputra and a Mahallaka  Chapter VI Parable  Lord Sakras Questions Thus I have heard Once the Buddha was in the land of Magadha South of Rajagrha there was a Brahman village called Amrasanda 
Lord Sakra heard that the Buddha was then in a rocky cave on Mount Vaidehaka north of this village He informed the gandharva prince Pancasikha There is a Brahman village called Amrasanda in the land of Magadha To the north of this village is Mount Vaidehaka The Worldhonored One is there 
Let us go there now The gandharva prince Pancasikha answered Yes indeed 
That would be excellent He was happy and gladdened to hear it so he took his lute of lapis lazuli and followed Lord Sakra to the Buddha 
When the gods heard that Lord Sakra was going to the Buddha together with the gandharva prince they adorned themselves They followed Lord Sakra down from heaven to Mount Vaidehaka 
At that moment a bright light was shining on the mountain The seers in the neighborhood all said it was the light of a fire 
b Lord Sakra said to the gandharva prince This place is pure an aranyaka place free from all evil One may safely sit down in meditation But now a multitude of honorable gods is crowding together at the Buddhas side filling the space around him 
How can we visit the Worldhonored One now Lord Sakra then told the gandharva prince You may go to the Buddha for me and communicate that we would like to put forward some questions at an audience The gandharva prince received the instructions and went away 
When he was neither too far nor too close he looked up with reverence at the Honorable Ones face took his lute and played so that the Buddha might hear He composed the stanzas When a heart that lusts brings forth longing attachment it is just like an elephant sunk in the mud or like an elephant that is maddened and impossible to control with a hook 
Like an arhat longing for the Wondrous Law such also is my fondness for your beauty one who respectfully greets  Parable  his father Because you were bom in a noble place the joy of my love is doubled in my affections You have the highest power to make my love grow 
The Buddha said It is marvelous O Pancasikha how you have managed to bring this music and all the instruments in harmony 
You have played this song from the right distance So Pancasikha said to the Buddha In the past I met a fine lady called Suryavarcasa She was the daughter of Tumburu the gandharva king 
I now speak these stanzas again in front of you O Buddha Lord Sakra said to himself As the Buddha has awakened from his concentration he is now talking to Pancasikha Lord Sakra further said to Pancasikha Announce my name now 
Bow at the Buddhas feet and make inquiries of the Worldhonored One Does he suffer little from illness or vexation and is his daily life easy Are his food and drink appropriate and is his strength at rest Does he not suffer from any evil and does he dwell in contentment To this Pancasikha agreed 
Having received Lord Sakras instructions he again went to the Buddha and announced Lord Sakras name He bowed at the Buddhas feet and made inquiries of the Worldhonored One with Lord Sakras words 
The Buddha said Are Lord Sakra and his gods all in peace Pancasikha again addressed the Buddha O Worldhonored One c Lord Sakra and the thirtythree gods would like to meet you O  Chapter VI Buddha 
Do you give them your permission to come and meet you The Buddha said Now is just the right time When Lord Sakra and the thirtythree gods heard the Buddhas instruction they immediately went to the Buddha They bowed at the Buddhas feet and stood to one side 
They said to the Buddha O Worldhonored One where shall we sit The Buddha said Sit down on these seats They said to the Buddha This cave is extremely small and the crowd of gods is extremely numerous Having said these words they saw that the rocky cave became wider 
Through the Buddhas supernatural power it could contain a crowd 
Lord Sakra then bowed at the Buddhas feet and sat down in front He said to the Buddha For a long time I have constantly wanted to meet you O Buddha wanting to hear your Doctrine 
In the past you O Buddha were in Sravasti and you had entered the samdhi of the glow of fire At that time there was a waiting maid of Vaisravana called Bhujavati Bhujavati was turned towards the Buddha her hands joined in salutation I said to that waiting maid of Vaisravana then The Buddha is now in concentration 
The Buddha said to Lord Sakra At that moment I heard your voices and quickly rose from my concentration Lord Sakra said to the Buddha I once heard this from the ancients 
When the Tathfigata the arhat the samyaksambuddha appears in the world the crowd of gods increases and the crowd of asuras decreases 
Now I myself am born among the gods The crowd of gods increases and the asuras decreases 
I now see that the Buddhas disciples who are reborn in heaven surpass the gods in three respects Their life span is superior their splendor is superior and their fame is superior So  Parable  Lady Gopika was born in the Trayastrimsa Heaven 
She had been the Buddhas disciple and she became my son called the Heavenly Son Gopaka 
There were also three bhiksus who were developing pure conduct before the Buddha but their hearts were not yet free from desire When their bodies were ruined and their lives had ended they were reborn in the family of gandharvas Three times every day they served the gods 
When the Heavenly Son Gopaka saw these three people acting as servants he said 
I am not delighted and I cannot bear it Formerly when I was among people those three men often came to my house and received my worship Now they are servants of the gods 
I cannot bear to see that 
These three gods used to be the Buddhas listeners and disciples When I was a person in the past they received my respect and worship food and clothing but they are inferior now You heard the Doctrine from the Buddhas mouth and received the Buddhas explanation Why were you reborn in this vile condition 
I used to serve and worship you but I heard the Doctrine from the Buddha and practiced liberality Because of the karmic cause of my morality and faith I am Lord Sakras son I possess great majesty power and sovereignty All gods call me Gopaka 
You have obtained the Buddhas excellent Doctrine Why could you not practice it with diligence Why are you reborn in this vile condition 
I cannot bear to see this loathsome thing now I do not like to see such a thing 
Why were you with one and the same Doctrine reborn so low in a condition where a disciple of the Buddha must not be reborn When the Heavenly Son Gopaka had made this criticism the three men felt profound shame and discontent arose  Chapter VI in their hearts Joining their hands together they said to Gopaka Just as you O Heavenly Son have said it is really our own fault We must now do away with that evil of desire be diligent in our zeal and develop concentration and wisdom The three men kept Gautamas Doctrine in mind 
Seeing their desires as a calamity they severed the bonds of their desires They terminated their desires just as a big elephant breaks his fetters 
Lord Sakra Isana the multitude of other gods and the Four Heavenly Kings protectors of the world all came to their seats The three who had done away with their desires ascended in the sky in front of the other gods 
Lord Sakra said to the Buddha What quality did these three men obtain that they can exert these various supernatural powers and come to see you  Worldhonored One 
I should like to ask you what they have obtained The Buddha said Since these three men have rejected that other place they obtained rebirth in the Brahma world I wish that you O Worldhonored One would explain to me how they were reborn in the Brahma Heaven Very well O worthy Lord Sakra do I discern the uncertainty revealed by your question Then the Buddha thought Lord Sakra is free from deceit 
His question about his doubt is sincere 
I shall answer his questions and give him a detailed explanation Lord Sakra asked the Buddha Which are the fetters that bind men gods nagas yaksas gandharvas asuras garudas and mahoragas The Buddha then answered The two fetters selfishness and jealousy bind men gods asuras gandharvas and every kind of beings 
Now that I have heard this explanation from you O Buddha the web of my uncertainty is removed Lord Sakra was very glad and he asked a further question 
Because of which cause and from which condition does one feel selfishness and jealousy How do they arise and how are they extinguished O Kausika  Parable  b selfishness and jealousy arise from unpleasantness or pleasantness 
When there is unpleasantness or pleasantness one is sure to have selfishness and jealousy 
Now that I have heard this explanation from you O Buddha the web of my uncertainty is removed Lord Sakra was very glad and he asked a further question How do unpleasantness and pleasantness arise and how are they extinguished The Buddha answered Unpleasantness and pleasantness arise from delight 
Now that I have heard this pious explanation from you O Buddha the web of my uncertainty is removed Lord Sakra was very glad and he asked a further question From which cause does delight arise and through which condition does it increase 
How is it extinguished The Buddha said Delight arises from false imagining and it increases through false imagining If there is false imagining there is delight 
Now that I have heard this explanation from you O Buddha the web of my uncertainty is removed Lord Sakra was very glad and he asked a further question Why does false imagining arise and through what condition does it increase 
How is it extinguished False imagining arises from idle fancy and it increases through idle fancy 
Now that I have heard this explanation from you O Buddha the web of my uncertainty is removed Lord Sakra was very glad and he asked a further question Why does idle fancy grow and how does one extinguish idle fancy The Buddha informed Kauika If you want to extinguish idle fancy you must develop the eightfold right path 
right views right action right speech right livelihood right application right mindfulness right purpose and right concentration When Lord Sakra had heard this he said to the Buddha Truly so God among  Chapter VI gods Idle fancy is truly extinguished through the eightfold right path 
Now that I have heard this explanation from you O Buddha the web of my uncertainty is removed Lord Sakra was glad and he asked a further question If one wishes to extinguish idle fancy one may develop the eightfold right path 
By relying on which qualities can a bhiksu cause this eightfold right path to increase The Buddha said Well there are three qualities 
When we hear this meaningful explanation the web of uncertainty is removed 
When a bhiksu practices these parts of the right path he causes the path to increase because he relies on these three elements Having heard this he was glad 
Lord Sakra further asked When a bhiksu wants to extinguish idle fancy how many qualities does he have to apply himself to The Buddha said He must apply himself to three qualities 
He must apply himself to making his morality superior he must apply himself to making his concentration superior and he must apply himself to making his wisdom superior When Lord Sakra heard this  Truly so God among gods 
Now that I have heard this explanation the web of my uncertainty is removed He was delighted and glad and he asked a further question If one wants to extinguish idle fancy how many meaningful things should one understand 
I am listening The Buddha said One should understand six meaningful things First the eyes consciousness of form second the ears consciousness of sound third the noses consciousness of smell fourth the tongues consciousness of taste fifth the bodys consciousness of touch sixth the minds consciousness of the dharmas When Lord Sakra had c heard this  Truly so God among gods 
Now that I have heard this explanation the web of my uncertainty is removed He was delighted and glad and he asked a further question Do all beings have one and the same selfishness one delight one intention and one inclination The Buddha said O Lord Sakra all beings do not have the same selfishness the same delight the same intention nor the same inclination either 
Beings are  Parable  numberless and the worlds are numberless Their desires and inclinations are very different They are not the same 
Now that I have heard this explanation the web of my uncertainty is removed He was delighted and glad and he again asked a further question Do all sramanas and Brahmans completely achieve one perfection 
Do they achieve one absence of impurity 
Do they achieve one perfect brahmacarya The Buddha said Not all sramanas and Brahmans can completely obtain one perfection and one absence of impurity nor do they achieve one perfect brahmacarya 
When a sramana or a Brahman has achieved unsurpassed deliverance having cut the fetter of craving and when he has achieved right deliverance then he completely achieves one perfection one absence of impurity and one perfect brahmacarya 
As you have explained O Buddha unsurpassed deliverance having cut the fetter of craving One who has achieved right deliverance completely achieves one perfection one absence of impurity and one perfect brahmacarya 
Now that I have heard them from you O Buddha I understand these meaningful things Understanding this Doctrine I have crossed to the other shore of uncertainty I have pulled out the poisoned arrows of my wrong views 
I have removed my wrong views and my thoughts will not regress When he had expounded this scripture Lord Sakra and his eightyfour thousand gods obtained the purity of the eye of the Doctrine without any stains and free from impurity 
The Buddha said Kausika you have asked these questions in the past of sramanas and Brahmans have you not 
 Worldhonored One I recall that in the past I was once in a gathering of the gods in the assembly hall of the Good Law I asked the gods if a Buddha had appeared in the world 
The gods all said that no Buddha had appeared yet When the gods had heard that no Buddha had appeared in the world yet they all broke up the gathering 
I saw sramanas and Brahmans in a secluded  Chapter VI place and so I went over to them When the sramanas and Brahmans asked me who I was I said I was Lord Sakra 
I did not salute them on the contrary they saluted me 
I did not ask them anything either but they questioned me 
I knew that they were without knowledge Therefore I did not take refuge in them 
From now on I shall take refuge in you  Buddha and be your disciple O Buddha Then he spoke the stanzas I used to be in constant doubt and my mind was not fulfilled For a long time I have searched for wisdom that might dispel such doubts 
In my search for the Tathagata I saw sramanas and Brahmans in secluded places In my mind I thought that there was the Worldhonored One 
So I went over to them saluted them respectfully and made inquiries I put this question to them How does one develop the right path  
Those sramanas explained neither the right path nor the wrong path Now I have seen you Worldhonored One and the web of my uncertainty is completely removed 
Today there is a Buddha the greatest teacher in the world He destroys and subdues the enemy Mara Having ended affliction he is most victorious 
The Worldhonored One has appeared in the world marvelous and unequalled Among the crowd of gods and demons there is no one like the Buddha  O Worldhonored One I have become a srotapannal O Bhagavan I have become a srotapannal The Worldhonored One informed him Excellent 
Excellent Kausika 
If you are not negligent you will become a sakrdagamin 
 The Buddha said to Lord Sakra Where did you gain this indestructible faith Lord Sakra said I have gained it here at your side O Worldhonored One 
I shall obtain the life of a god here again but I wish for complete understanding Having this in  Parable  mind Lord Sakra said O Worldhonored One I now have this idea 
I shall obtain a birth in an aristocratic place among men and have plenty of everything 
Then I shall reject the worldly and go forth from my home there taking refuge in the noble path If I gain nirvana that will be absolutely splendid 
If I do not gain it I shall be reborn as a god in a pure abode Lord Sakra then gathered the crowd of gods together and informed them At the three divisions  I have worshipped the god Brahma but from now on I shall stop and not do this 
At the three divisions I shall worship the Worldhonored One Lord Sakra then informed the gandharva son Pancasikha You have now done me a momentous kindness because you have awoken the Buddha the Worldhonored One so that I have learned his deep Doctrine 
When I return to heaven I shall make the noble Suryavarcasa Tumburus daughter your wife 
I shall also let you take her fathers place and be king of the gandharvas Lord Sakra then led the crowd of the gods three times around the Buddha stepped backwards and departed Having reached a serene abode they all said three times Namo Buddhaya and returned to heaven 
Not long after Lord Sakras departure the king of the gods Brahma said this to himself Lord Sakra has left I shall now go to the Buddha In the time in which an ablebodied person bends and stretches out his arm he reached the Buddha 
Having made obeisance at the Buddhas feet he sat down to one side The light b of the god Brahma shone all over Mount Vaidehaka Then the god Brahma spoke the stanzas Many are benefitted when these meaningful things are displayed 
He repeated Lord Sakras questions and returned to heaven 
In the morning the Buddha informed the bhiksus The king of the gods Brahma came to me yesterday Having spoken these stanzas he returned to heaven When the Buddha had said these words  Chapter VI the bhiksus were glad They respectfully made obeisance at the Buddhas feet and withdrew 
Parable  The Saving of Ajnatakaundinya and Others and an Explanation of the Past When the Buddha was in Rajagrha his explanation of the Doctrine saved Ajnatakaundinya Sakra devanam indra and King Bimbisara Each was the leader of a multitude of eightyfour thousand and they all gained the path 
The bhiksus thought it strange that each had so many followers pulled out from the three unwholesome destinations 
The Buddha said Not only now but also at one time in the past were they rescued The bhiksus said How did rescue in the past come about 
The Buddha said In the past there once were merchants who went to sea to gather riches On their way back they ran into a python in a vast wilderness its body fully six krosas high It encircled the merchants surrounding them on all four sides leaving no room to go in or out 
So the merchants experienced extreme panic They all called out Spirits of the heavens spirits of the earth if someone is compassionate save usI Then there was a white elephant who was a companion of a lion The lion pounced and crushed the brain of the python so that the merchants could escape from their peril 
At that moment the python hurt the lion and the white elephant with its venomous breath but their lives did not cease 
The merchants said You have rescued us 
Do you have any wish The animals answered We wish to become Buddhas and to save all people The merchants said If you obtain Buddhahood please may we hear the Doctrine at the very first gathering and obtain the path The lives of the lion and of the white elephant ended then The merchants burnt them and erected a pagoda with their bones The Buddha said If you want to know who was the lion at that time it is I 
The white elephant at that time is Sariputra 
The leaders of the merchants are Kaundinya  Parable  c Lord Sakra and King Bimbisara 
The multitude of merchants were the gods and men who have presently obtained the path 
Parable  The Sakya Son Ksema Has an Eye Sickness but When He Takes Refuge in the Three Precious Things His Eyes Are Purified Thus I have heard Once the Buddha was in the park of the Sakya clan 
At that time in the city of Catuma there was someone of the Sakya family called Ksema He had pure faith in the Buddha pure faith in the Doctrine and pure faith in the Sangha 
He had taken refuge in the Buddha taken refuge in the Doctrine and taken refuge in the Sangha 
He was all turned toward the Buddha all turned toward the Doctrine and all turned toward the Sangha 
He did not have any doubts about the Buddha any doubts about the Doctrine or any doubts about the Sangha 
He did not have any doubts about the Truth of suffering any doubts about the Truth of origination any doubts about the Truth of cessation or any doubts about the Truth of the path 
Because the Sakya son Ksema had an eye disease he could not see the various things 
So the Sakya son Ksema intoned names of the Worldhonored One Namo to the one who gives eyes Namo to the one who gives brightness Namo to the one who removes darkness Namo to the one who holds a torch Namo to the Bhagavan Namo to the Sugata  
Hearing his voice he said to Ananda Go and help Ksema the Sakyan with words now Rescue him guard him and take care of him Do away with his misfortune Bring gain to the fourfold Sangha bring them benefit and let them dwell in happiness  Chapter VI Then the Worldhonored One expounded for Ksema the Sakyan the sutra for the purification of eyes 
Tadyatha hili mili kili hi heta Let the eyes of Ksema the Sakyan be purified with this spell for the purification of eyes and let his sclerotic membrane be removed whether it is an air film  or a heat film or a phlegm film or a film of all of these 
If one also calls someone elses name in this way his eyes will be purified When his eyes are purified this will remove the darkness and remove the membrane whether it is an air film or a heat film or a cold film or a film of all these 
One will not feel any burning boiling swelling pain itch or flowing tears 
O Ananda in such words from the six Buddhas Worldhonored Ones up to me now as the seventh we have given this explanation The Four Heavenly Kings also expound this spell Lord Sakra expounds it too King Brahma and his Brahman groups also rejoice in it 
O Ananda I do not see whether one is among the gods or among men in Maras or in Brahmas  among the multitude of sramanas or the multitude of Brahmans Men or gods may proclaim these words three times whether for sclerotic membranes for darkness for a swelling for the pupils of the eyes or when tears flow from the eyes It may be caused by a god by a dragon a yaksa an asura a kumbhanda a hungry ghost a pisaca or by poison an evil charm the way of enchantment a vetala spell an evil star or any constellation 
 Parable  After Anandas arrival he pronounced the spell three times for Ksema the Sakyan and Ksemas eyes were as pure as before He could see everything 
With this spell then called someone elses name just as for Ksema the Sakyan In all cases he removed darkness and he removed the membrane of air of heat of cold or of all three No one felt any burning boiling swelling pain itch or flowing tears 
Namo Bhagavate namas Tathdgatdyarhate Samyaksambuddhdya With the words of this divine spell a bodhisattva may obtain any auspicious accomplishment 
Parable  Seven Kinds of Liberality The Buddha has said that there are seven kinds of liberality that do not diminish ones possessions but gain one a considerable recompense 
The first is called ocular liberality When one always regards his parents and masters sramanas and Brahmans with a friendly eye not with an evil eye this is called ocular liberality 
Upon abandoning ones body and then getting another body one obtains pure eyes 
Upon becoming a Buddha in the future one obtains the heavenly eye The Buddha eye is called the first recompense 
The second is called the liberality of a pleasant countenance that is not to knit ones brows or show an unpleasant face toward ones parents or masters toward sramanas or Brahmans Upon abandoning ones body and then getting another body one obtains an upright appearance 
Upon becoming a Buddha in the future one obtains an appearance of genuine gold This is said to be the second recompense 
The third is called liberality of speech that is when one utters soft words not harsh words to ones parents and masters to sramanas and Brahmans 
Upon abandoning ones body and then getting another body ones words become eloquent What one explains is faithfully accepted by others 
Upon becoming a Buddha  Chapter VI in the future one obtains the four analytical knowledges This is said to be the third recompense 
The fourth is called corporal liberality Standing up meeting and greeting one s parents and masters sramanas and Brahmans this is called corporal liberality 
Upon abandoning ones body and then getting another body one obtains an upright body a tall body a body respected by others 
Becoming a Buddha in the future ones body is like a nyagrodha tree the top of which one cannot see This is said to be the fourth recompense 
The fifth is called mental liberality Even though one may offer the above if ones thoughts are not affable one does not call it liberality 
If one profoundly worships with goodheartedness and affability this is called mental liberality 
Upon abandoning ones body and then getting another body one obtains clear thoughts and b no deluded thoughts 
Upon becoming a Buddha in the future one obtains a mind with all kinds of knowledge This is said to be the fifth recompense ie of mental liberality 
The sixth is called liberality of bedding and seating When one meets one s parents or masters sramanas or Brahmans one spreads out bedding and seating for them so that they may sit down One even asks them to be seated on ones own seat 
Upon abandoning ones body and then getting another body one always obtains honorable bedding and seating the seven precious things 
Upon becoming a Buddha in the future one obtains the Lion Throne of the Law This is said to be the sixth recompense 
The seventh is called liberality of dwelling When one lets ones former parents and masters sramanas and Brahmans come and go sit and lie down in ones dwelling this is called liberality of dwelling 
Upon abandoning ones body and then getting another body one obtains natural housing and lodging 
Upon becoming a Buddha in the future one may obtain any room for meditation This is said to be the seventh recompense These are said to be the seven liberalities 
They do not diminish ones possessions but gain one a considerable recompense 
 Parable  Parable  The Land of King Chiapu Suffers a Drought and by Bathing the Buddha the People Obtain Rain If one plants something wholesome in an excellent field of merit one is sure to obtain recompense afterward 
Formerly countless numberless asarnkhyeya kalpas ago there used to be a king named Chiapu He ruled the eightyfour thousand countries of Jambudvipa 
The king had twenty thousand wives but no male offspring He prayed to the spirits and after many years his principal wife bore him a crown prince called Candana He ruled the four quarters as a Wheelturning King In his weariness he went forth and realized right awakening 
The diviners in the land then all said that a great drought would last twelve years With what plan could they avert this calamity 
They talked it over and said We must make a golden tub now and put it in the marketplace We must fill it with perfumed water and let the Buddha bathe in it When we distribute the perfumed water and erect shrines around it we can avert the calamity So they invited the Tathagata to bathe in the perfumed water 
They distributed the remainder of the bathing water of the Worldhonored One in eightyfour thousand precious flasks which they sent to the eightyfour thousand countries instructing them to construct shrines around the water Their worship brought about merit 
Because they had constructed shrines and brought about merit the sky sent ample rain The five cereals were abundant and the people were happy 
Then there was someone who saw these shrines and was delighted in his heart So he scattered one handful of flowers over a shrine and obtained a considerable wholesome recompense 
The Buddha said When with my Buddha eye I contemplate the shrines with the perfumed water of the Tathagata Candana in that faraway past I see that those who were converted by them have all long since become Buddhas and entered nirvana 
The one who offered one handful of flowers is myself 
Because I had that  Chapter VI karmic causality in the past I have finally brought about my c realization of Buddhahood now 
Therefore a practitioner should diligently perform meritorious acts He must not underestimate the smallest wholesome deed Parable  
An Elder Invites Sariputra and a M ahallaka Once in the city of Sravasti there was a distinguished elder His house was extremely wealthy and his riches were immeasurable He used to invite sramanas in the sequential order of the Sangha to go to his house to receive worship 
So in sequential order of the Sangha it was the turn of Sariputra and a mahallaka  They went to the house of the elder When the elder saw them he was in very good spirits 
Just on that day his traders who had gone to sea returned home safely with a great many precious things 
At that time the king of the land had bestowed upon the elder a gift of villages as a fiefdom His pregnant wife then went on to give birth to a son These happy occasions all happened at the same time When Sariputra and his companion had entered the house they received offerings from the elder 
If in your devotion and contentment you produce thoughts of the ten powers may the future always be like today When the elder had heard this prayer he was very happy and gave two fine splendid pieces of cloth to Sariputra but he gave nothing to the mahallaka 
On his way back to the temple the mahallaka felt disappointed and he thought The reason Sariputra has now obtained that cloth is that the prayer he incanted was agreeable to the elder That is why he obtained that gift 
I must now ask for this prayer So he said to Sariputra Please teach me the prayer you just intoned  Parable  Sariputra replied to him You must not use this prayer at all times 
There are times when you may use it and there are times when you must not When the mahallaka insistently demanded Please you must teach it to me Sariputra could not refuse his request and taught him the prayer 
After he had received the instructions he then studied it so that he became extremely wellversed in the prayer He thought When will it be my turn to occupy the seat of honor and intone this prayer 
Later according to the sequential order of the Sangha he occupied the seat of honor in the house of the elder 
At that time the traders of the elder had gone to sea but had lost their riches The elders wife was involved in a lawsuit and moreover his son had died The mahallaka nevertheless intoned the former prayer wishing that the future would always be like today 
When the elder heard these words he became angry he gave a beating and chased him away from the house 
After being beaten in anger felt very vexed and ran into a field of sesame plants belonging to the king He trampled on the plants and snapped them off 
The one who took care of the sesame was angry at such behavior He flogged with his whip and utterly disgraced him 
After the mahallaka had received a thorough beating he then asked the person who had beaten him What did I do wrong that I am beaten like this The man who took care of the sesame then accused him of trampling on the plants and he showed him where the road was 
He went on along the road and after a few miles he met someone else who had mown wheat and piled it up 
At that time it was the custom to go around a stack keeping to the right Having gone around it one would set out food and drink to pray for a bountiful crop If one went around it keeping to the left it was not considered to be auspicious 
The mahallaka then went around the stack keeping to his left The owner of the wheat was angry at him and gave him another beating with his cudgel 
The mahallaka then asked him What did I do wrong that you give me this savage beating with your cudgel The owner of the wheat answered When you went around the stack why did you not go around it  Chapter VI keeping to the right wishing me that much more might be added to it 
Because you committed a breach of our rules I beat you Then he showed him his way 
After he had proceeded just a little while he happened to come upon a funeral He went around the grave mound as he should have gone around the previous stack of wheat and he uttered the prayer May much more be added 
May much more be added The chief mourner was angry at him He grabbed him gave him a beating and said to him When you see someone who has died you should feel grief and say From now on it must not be like this again Why did you say instead May much more be added 
May much more be added The mahallaka said From now on I shall do as you say Again he went on and he saw a marriage ceremony 
Those who were being married were angered by his behavior They again gave him such a flogging that his head split open 
He then continued on his way Retreating in confusion from this beating he ran into someone who was catching wild geese Frightened and scared out of his wits he touched the net and so startled the geese that they scattered The hunter was angry grabbed him and gave him another beating 
Suffering terribly from his beating the mahallaka then said to the hunter As I go along my way I am frequently distressed 
Why dont you crawl quietly on your hands and knees So he stuck to the road crawling on his hands and knees just as the hunter had told him 
Further along the way he met someone who was washing clothes When that person saw him walking on his elbows she thought he wanted to steal her clothes She immediately grabbed him and gave him another beating with her cudgel 
After he had suffered this hardship the mahallaka then told in detail what had happened and was set free 
After his arrival in the Jetavana he said to the bhiksus When the other day I intoned  Parable  b Sariputras prayers I experienced considerable suffering He then explained how he was beaten his skin and body broken and how he had nearly lost his life 
The bhiksus led the mahallaka to the Buddha and they explained why this man was beaten 
The Buddha said Not only now does the mahallaka have this karmic causality but it was so also in the past 
There was a daughter of a king who had fallen ill The chief astronomer divined that she should go to a cemetery in order to be cured of her illness 
So the kings daughter led her attendants to a cemetery 
Along the way there were two merchants who saw the kings daughter and her majestic escort They became afraid and ran into the cemetery 
The kings daughters servants cut off the ears and nose of one of them 
The other one panicked and lay down among the corpses feigning death 
Wishing to be cured the kings daughter then wanted to pick out someone who had died recently one whose skin was not yet rotten She was going to sit down on him and wash herself in order to heal her ailment 
The servants then thought they had caused a demon to rise from the dead He may bring a calamity upon us They closed the gate to ward anyone off The kings daughter desperately tried to hold on to the merchant and would not let him go 
He then informed her of the truth I really am no demon The kings daughter immediately went to the city together with the merchant She called out to open the gate of the city and reported the true facts 
Although the girls father the king heard her words he still felt some disbelief Accompanied by armed men he had them open the gate and went to have a look Only then did he know that the merchant was no demon 
Her father the king said A girls body may not be seen twice So he  Chapter VI gave his daughter to the merchant in marriage 
The merchant was glad and his good luck was immeasurable The Buddha said The merchant who gained the kings daughter then is Sariputra 
The one whose ears and nose were cut off is the mahallaka 
Not only today but from now on 
O bhiksus if you want to expound the Doctrine or intone a prayer you must understand the time and the occasion You must develop liberality morality patient endurance strenuousness meditation and wisdom You ought to know the right time and the wrong time for grief or joy

At that time in southern India there was a Brahman who knew all about wishgranting gems He took a wishgranting gem and went from southern India to eastern India 
Before King Prasenajit he spoke these words Who can recognize and know this wishgranting gem King Prasenajit assembled his ministers but among all the knowledgeable people no one was able to recognize it 
King Prasenajit went with him to the Buddha The Buddha said to the Brahman Do you know the gems name 
Do you know where the gem comes from 
Do you know the gems power replied Certainly I know The Buddha said This gem comes from the brain of a big makara fish The length of the fish is two hundred eighty thousand miles This gem is called Diamond Solid It has a first power 
If any person suffering from poison sees it the poison totally dissipates Or if he is touched by its brightness this also dissipates the poison 
A second power When someone who is ill with fever sees it he is cured When its brightness touches him he is also healed 
A third power Someone may have countless enemies when he holds onto this gem they all become his friends 
When the Brahman had heard these words he was gladdened by them The Tathagata is truly omniscient So he presented the gem to the Buddha and asked for the state of going forth 
When the Buddha said Welcome O bhiksul the mans hair fell off by itself and the robe of the Law enveloped him Having had the essentials of the Doctrine explained to him the Brahman became an arhat 
The bhiksus said You could recognize the gem well O Tathagata Chapter VII You could also expound the Doctrine so that he obtained the realization of the path The Buddha said Not only now but also in the past it was like that 
Once in the land of KasI in the mountains of the seers there was a seer with the five superknowledges 
Then there was a Brahman who took the leaf of a tree and asked the seer Of which tree is this a leaf The seer replied This tree is called goldtop When someone is poisoned when he is in critical condition and near death he should sit down under this tree and will dissipate 
When someone who is ill with a fever resorts to this tree also will be done away with 
When someone is touched by the leaves of this tree any poison or fever will be completely done away with The Brahman was glad and he asked to become the seers disciple Practicing his doctrine he also obtained the five superknowledges 
The seer with the five superknowledges at that time is now I 
The Brahman who took the leaf of the tree at that time is this present Brahman 
At that time I instructed him so that he might be endowed with the five superknowledges Now he is exempt from the hardship of birth and death too having become an arhat Parable  
Dasabala Kasyapa Stops the Bleeding of the Buddhas Foot with True Words At that time the Tathagata was wounded by the thorn of a khadira tree The thorn wounded his foot which did not stop bleeding They smeared it with all kinds of healing herbs but they could not cure it 
The arhats gathered healing herbs in the fragrant mountains and they applied the ointment but still did not diminish 
Dasabala Kasyapa arrived where the Worldhonored One was and he said If the Buddha the Tathagata has impartial thoughts for all beings if he is impartial toward Rahula and Devadatta and does not discriminate between them the bleeding of his foot must stop The bleeding immediately stopped and the ib sore healed too 
The bhiksus said admiringly All kinds of fine  Parable  healing herbs were applied but the bleeding did not stop Yet after Kasyapas true words it stopped The Buddha said Not only now 
In the past it was the same Once there was a Brahman He had a son called Ahimsaka who said to his father Do not hurt any sentient being when walking in the fields The father said to his son Do you want to be a seer 
How could you avoid an insect in that occupation The son said I now hope that you may obtain happiness in the present world and happiness in the after world You do not need any words of mine 
What do I have to live for So he sat down by the side of the spring belonging to a venomous dragon wanting to choose death 
In those days there was a venomous dragon Seeing it would kill you 
When the son of the Brahman saw the venomous dragon its venom spread throughout his body and his life was about to end 
His father then felt grieved As he did not know his sons whereabouts he set out to look for him and he saw that his son wanted to die When the father arrived where his son was he said If my son has never had any harm in his mind this venom should dissipate After he spoke these words the poison dissipated and was restored to his previous state 
The father at that time is Dasabala Kasyapa 
The son at that time is myself 
In the past he could relieve me of my disease with true words In the present time too he cured my disease with true words Parable  
The Buddha Sits underneath the Bodhi Tree and Paplyan the Devil King Wants to Come and Upset Him Once the Tathagata was sitting underneath the bodhi tree Papiyan the evil devil leading a multitude of eighty million sought to destroy the Buddha 
Arriving where the Tathagata was he spoke these words 
Gautama how can you sit all alone 
Get up quickly and leave 
If you do not leave I shall grab you by your feet and throw you into the seaThe Buddha said When I contemplate the  Chapter VII world there is no one who can throw me into the sea 
Once in a previous world you were only a temple chief Having received the eight precepts one day you gave one bowl of food to a pratyekobuddha Therefore you were reborn in sixth heaven of the desire world as a great devil king 
I however widely developed merit in three asamkhyeya kalpas In the first asamkhyeya kalpa I worshipped countless Buddhas In the second and third asamkhyeya kalpas it was the same The disciples and pratyekabuddhas I worshipped cannot be calculated 
But who is a witness to what you say of yourself The Buddha pointed to the earth with his hand and said This earth ic is my witness When he said these words the whole earth shook in six ways 
What you say Worldhonored One is true not false The Buddha said to Paplyan Only if you can first move this water bowl can you throw me into the sea Then Paplyan and his host of eighty million could not move  
The bhiksus said Paplyan has been distressing the Tathagata for a long time but he cannot win The Buddha said Not only now but equally in the past 
Once in the land of Kasi in the mountains of the seers there was a seer with the five superknowledges He instructed the youths in the city of Benares and they were all converted and left home to follow the path of the seer 
At that time the spirit of the city was extremely angry and said to the seer If you come into town and make one more conversion I shall grab you by your feet and throw you into the sea The seer then took a water bowl and said to the spirit of the city First move this bowl and then throw me out The spirit expended the  Parable  utmost effort but he could not move it He shamefully retreated in submission 
The seer at that time is myself 
The spirit of the city at that time is Papiyan Parable  
The Buddha Explains the Misfortune of Profitable Offerings to the B hiksus Once when the Tathagata was in Sravasti he was burdened with profitable offerings 
There was a deep forest called Tanchuangyen Fleeing from the profitable offerings went to this forest 
In the forest there was a monastery where an arhat called Nayaka was the head of the temple 
During the days after the Buddhas arrival in that forest the forest was filled with people worshipping him by bringing him clothes He said I do not need profitable offerings but these profitable offerings keep following me There were twelve thousand bhiksus who had arrived there too 
The Buddha said to the bhiksus Socalled profitable offerings are a great misfortune They may prove to be a burden Even an arhat is burdened by profitable offerings The bhiksus asked What burden may they prove to be The Buddha said The damage of profitable offerings ruins the skin the flesh the bone and the marrow 
How do they ruin them 
They ruin the skin which is morality the flesh which is concentration the bone which is wisdom and the marrow which is fine wholesome thoughts The twelve thousand bhiksus arranged their three robes and six objects and became aranyakas 
The Buddha then said in praise Excellent excellent that you follow the way of the aranyakal My way here is a way of little    a desire not of many desires 
It is a way of wisdom not a way of foolishness When the bhiksus had heard him say these words they all obtained arhatship 
The bhiksus said to the Buddha Wonderful O Worldhonored One The Buddha said It does not happen only now it happened also in the past 
Once in the land of KasI there was a state councillor called Yaksa 
Yaksas son called Yajnadatta was profoundly aware of impermanence 
Because he wanted to make them diminish their desires Yajnadatta gave up the soft herbs and took the tough herbs He gave up the sweet fruits and took the sour fruits He gave up his own fresh fruits and took the stale fruits of the others Just by giving up and taking the fruits he obtained the five superknowledges 
When the twelve thousand seers saw him like this they applied themselves to diminishing their desires They no longer sought to obtain many things and they all obtained the five superknowledges 
Through the gradual use of expedient means of salvation Yajnadatta converted the seers 
After his life had ended he was reborn in the stage without needs  
Yajnadatta is myself 
The twelve thousand seers at that time are the twelve thousand bhiksus present now Parable  
On the Way to His Execution a Thief Sees the Buddha in the Distance and Being Happy He Is Reborn in Heaven Once in SravastI King Prasenajit struck a drum and promulgated an order If someone who has committed a robbery is caught he must be put to death Then there was someone who had apprehended a robber and brought him to justice 
The king immediately sent the robber out to be executed 
Outside of the city in the distance the thief happened to see the Tathagata on his way and he was happy in his heart He arrived at the place of his execution and underwent the kings law 
 Parable  He was subsequently reborn in heaven and fully developed the three recollections Knowing that he was reborn in heaven after his life had ended because he had been happy seeing the Buddha when he was going to be executed he was moved by the Buddhas kindness and descended to earth to worship him The Buddha expounded the Doctrine to him and he became a srotapanna 
The bhiksus asked Because of which karmic cause was he reborn in the heavenly abode The Buddha said Once among men he was executed by the king On the way to his death he saw me the Buddha and rejoiced 
Because of this wholesome cause he was reborn in that heavenly abode Having heard the Doctrine from me again he gained insight and realized srotapatti 
Parable  Someone Whose Hands and Feet Had Been Cut Off as a Punishment Is Moved hy the Buddhas Kindness and Is Reborn in Heaven Once in the land of Sravasti someone had offended against the kings law They cut off his hands and feet and threw him down by the roadside 
On his way the Buddha saw him went over to him and asked What do you consider to be most painful now The crippled man answered I suffer very badly from starvation So the Buddha ordered Ananda to give him food 
'When the crippled mans life had ended he was reborn in heaven Moved by the Buddhas generous kindness he descended to earth to worship him The Buddha expounded the Doctrine to him and he became a srotapanna 
The bhiksus asked Through which course of action was he reborn in heaven The Buddha said Once among men his hands and feet were cut off as punishment and he was thrown down by the roadside When I the Buddha arrived there I ordered that he be given food He was happy in his heart and when his life had ended he was reborn in heaven Having heard the Doctrine from me again he obtained the path 
An Elder Offers Delicious Honey Syrup to Passersby and Is Reborn in Heaven Once there was an elder in SravastI who was looking for a place for a forest dwelling in the Jetavana He wanted to construct a dwelling there 
There was no more empty space left So the elder made a drink with fine pure water using all sorts of honey and all sorts of flour in the main gate of the Jetavana and gave it to all who passed by 
After ninety days the Buddha received some too 
Thereupon the elders life ended and he was reborn in heaven Having great dignity he ascended to the abode of the gods but he came down to worship the Buddha The Buddha expounded the Doctrine to him and he became a srotapanna 
The bhiksus asked Through which course of action was he reborn in heaven with such splendid dignity The Buddha said When he was a man once he made all sorts of drinks at the gate of the Jetavana and gave them to everyone 
For this karmic cause he was reborn in heaven Having heard the Doctrine from me again he obtained the path Parable

When the messenger reached the Buddha he paid his respects and said to the Buddha The king and the elder would like to see you O Tathagata 
I wish that you Worldhonored One would mount this carriage and go to SravastI The Buddha said I do not need a carriage 
Although I have said these words I shall go through the air on your carriage so that you may obtain the merit The  Parable  messenger went ahead and informed the king and also the elder 
The king and the elder went out to welcome the Buddha personally and the messenger also came back with the king to meet the Buddha 
When the messengers life had ended he was reborn in heaven Riding on a precious carriage he came to the Buddha The Buddha expounded the Doctrine to him and he became a srotapanna 
The bhiksus asked Why was he reborn in the palace of the gods and why does he drive this precious carriage The Buddha c said Once among men he was sent by the king to me the Buddha and he presented me with his carriage to ride in 
Because of this deed he is now reborn in heaven and always drives a precious carriage Having heard the Doctrine from me again he gained insight and realized srotapatti 
When King Prasenajit Goes Begging Urging Conversion a Poor Man Gives Him a Cloth and Is Rehorn in Heaven Once in the land of SravastI King Prasenajit said these words While Sudatta the elder still can urge all people to perform meritorious deeds I shall now instruct beings to beg too so that they may obtain merit Thereupon he went on his conversion tour begging everywhere 
There was then someone who was poor and completely destitute He only had one piece of cloth and he immediately gave it to King Prasenajit 
When the king had received the cloth he in turn presented it to the Buddha 
Later the poor mans life ended and he was reborn in heaven Moved by the Buddhas great kindness he came to worship him The Buddha expounded the Doctrine to him and he became a srotapanna 
The bhiksus asked What deed did he perform once that he was reborn in that heaven The Buddha said When he was among men the king happened to be urging people to reform

The elder brother constantly urged his younger brother to serve the Three Precious Things but the younger brother did not comply They quarreled all the time and did not live in harmony So each lived his own life 
The first one worshipped the Buddha Later his life ended and he was reborn in heaven He then came to the Buddha and worshipped him showing his gratitude The Buddha expounded the Doctrine to him and he became a srotapanna 
The bhiksus asked What deed did he perform in the past that he was reborn in this heavenly palace The Buddha said Formerly among men he found happiness in the True Doctrine and he served the Three Precious Things Because of this meritorious cause he has obtained rebirth in heaven now Having heard the Doctrine from me again he was zealously devoted and he realized the fruition of the path Parable

The Arhat Jayanta Chases the Evil Dragon Far into the Sea There once was a reverend arhat called Jayanta Seven hundred years after the Buddha had left the world he appeared in Kasmir 
At that time there was an evil dragon king in Kasmir called Aruna It frequently brought about calamities and distressed the nobles 
The whole population of the land was distressed by it 
There were then two thousand arhats who all exerted their supernatural strength to drive the dragon out so that he would leave the land Among them there were five hundred arhats who moved the earth with their supernatural power 
Another five hundred emitted a bright light 
Another five hundred entered concentration and walked in meditation 
Each and every one exerted his supernatural strength but could not make move 
Then finally the Reverend Jayanta went to the dragon pond snapped his fingers three times and said Leave now dragon You cannot stay here So the dragon left not daring to stay 
The two b thousand arhats then said to the reverend We and you reverend have alike achieved the destruction of our impurities Our enlightened Dharma bodies are all equal but although we all exerted our supernatural strength we could not make the dragon move 
How did you reverend drive the dragon Aruna far away into the ocean with three snaps of your fingers The reverend then replied Ever since I was a common man I have observed the prohibitory precepts 
Therefore you could not move him The Reverend Jayanta then went to northern India with his disciples On his way he met a crow He looked up at it and smiled 
 Parable  The disciples said We wonder reverend why you smiled 
Please explain to us what it means The reverend replied When the right time comes I shall give you an explanation 
Thereupon he went on and he arrived at the city of Taksasila Having reached the gate of the city he was dispirited and his complexion changed When it was time to eat he entered the city to beg for food After he had obtained his food he went back through the gate of the city 
The disciples kneeled and said We wonder why you smiled before and also why your complexion changed and became sad The Reverend Jayanta then answered his disciples In the past ninetyone kalpas after the Buddha Vipasyin had entered nirvana I was the son of an elder 
At that time I wanted to go forth but my parents did not let me They said to me Our family matters are important If you go forth who will provide for our posterity 
We shall choose you a wife When she has given birth to an heir we shall give you permission to go forth I immediately got married 
After I had taken a wife I again asked to go forth My parents again said When you have a son we shall give you permission to go forth Shortly thereafter I had a son 
When my son could speak I again said to my parents I would like your permission first Allow me to go forth At that moment my parents were afraid to go against their former words They secretly instructed the wet nurse to tell their grandchild When your father wants to go forth and leave you must hold your father back at the gate and say to him Do you want to abandon me now after you have given me  and go forth 
If you go please have me killed now before you leave I his father immediately felt dispirited changed my mind and said to my son I shall stay now I shall not leave any more For this reason I have been drifting through birth and death 
When I contemplate my former lives with my eye of the path it is very difficult to meet anyone in heaven among men or in the three unwholesome destinations 
It may be very difficult to encounter someone but when I took one look just now I recognized that the crow I saw a while ago was the grandson from that period 
 Chapter VII Now the reason why I was dispirited before and my comc plexion changed is that I met a hungry demon near the city who said to me I have been near this city for seventy years My mother entered the city to seek food for me but she has not come out once 
I am starving and thirsty now and I am extremely distressed Please reverend enter the city If you meet my mother please tell her for me to come quickly and take care of me So I entered the city 
I met the hungry demons mother and said to her Your son is starving outside and he is in great distress He would like to see you  The hungry demons mother then replied It has been more than seventy years since I entered this city My own little merit has recently caused me to become emaciated and without strength 
I cannot get it When I finally have a mouthful of impure food and I want to take it out through the gate to share it with my son there are strong demons at the gate again and they will not let me leave 
I wish that you reverend would have pity on me and take care of me so that mother and child may see each other and eat this impure food I the reverend then took care of the hungry demons mother and she could leave through the gate of the city 
Then I the reverend asked this demon How long have you lived here The demon then answered I have seen this city destroyed seven times over I the reverend then sighed and said A hungry demons life is long and extremely painful  When the disciples heard these words they were all disgusted with birth and death and they obtained the path 
Two B hiksus Visit Jayanta and Are Reborn in Heaven Once there were two bhiksus in southern India then who had heard that Jayanta had veiy splendid dignity 
On their way they saw a bhiksu under the trees whose appearance was very humble He was in front of a furnace lighting a fire 
The two bhiksus asked him Do you know the Reverend Jayanta He answered Yes The bhiksus said Where is he now He said In the third cave up there The two bhiksus then climbed the mountain 
When they got to the cave they saw the bhiksu who had just been lighting a fire 
The two bhiksus then wondered why The bhiksus said He has such distinguished virtues 
Why should we worry about our inability to arrive here first Then one bhiksu wanted to do away with his doubts and he asked him O reverend you have such dignity why do you light the fire yourself The reverend answered I remember the suffering of my past births and deaths 
All the more would I bum this firewood Then the second bhiksu asked I am ignorant of the suffering of your past births and deaths 
How were they I would like to hear about them The reverend answered I remember that five hundred existences ago I was bom as a dog I was constantly distressed by hunger and thirst There were only two occasions when I was fully satisfied 
One was when I met a drunkard who had vomited his wine on the ground and I was happily satisfied 
The other was when I met two people husband and wife who made a living together The husband went to the field and his wife stayed behind to prepare the food For some reason she left for a while I immediately went in and stole that food 
The vessel with the food happened to have a small mouth Although my head did go in it was difficult to get it out afterward Although I had eaten my fill I suffered afterwards 
When the husband returned from the field he cut off my head and it fell into the vessel When the two bhiksus had heard his exposition of the Doctrine they were disgusted with birth and death and became srotapannas 
The King of the Kusanas Meets the Arhat Jayanta In the land of the Kusanas there was a king called Candana Kaniska He had heard that in Kasmlr the reverend arhat called Jayanta was very famous and he wanted to meet him So he personally went to that country together with his attendants 
While on his way the thought secretly arose in his mind I am a king now All people in the world prostrate themselves in reverence before a king If he himself is not someone with great virtue how can he bear being worshipped by me Having thought this he then went on his way to the other country 
Someone then informed the Reverend Jayanta The king of the Kusanas called Candana Kaniska is coming from afar with his attendants to meet you 
Please reverend adjust your clothes and let us do him honor The reverend then replied I have heard that the Buddha has said that the path of someone who has gone forth is respected and that he is an example for laymen He devotes all his attention solely to his virtues How could he go out with personal adornment to welcome someone So saying nothing he sat quietly in a formal manner and did not go out 
Thereupon the king of the Kusanas arrived at the place where he was staying and he met the Reverend Jayanta When he saw his dignified virtues his respectful devotion became twice as deep So he came forward bowed and stood aside 
At that moment the reverend wanted to spit Without realizing it the king of the Kusanas stepped forward and presented a spittoon 
So the Reverend Jayanta said to the king I a poor man of the path am not fit to be a field of merit for you now O king 
Why do you waste your time in coming to see me The king of the Kusanas was profoundly ashamed then I previously ventured to have a trifling opinion and he knew my thoughts If he himself does not have divine qualities how could he be like that And he had enormous respect for the reverend 
Then the Reverend Jayanta immediately gave some instruction to the king When you came O king your path was fine 
May  Parable  you go just as you came When the king heard these instructions he immediately returned to his country 
While on their way his ministers were resentful and they said We followed you O king on a far journey to another country In the end we did not hear anything 
So we return to our country with nothing The king of the Kusanas then declared to his ministers Do you blame me now for having gained nothing 
The reverend gave me the instructions When you came your path was fine May you go just as you came Do you not understand this 
In the past I kept the precepts and practiced liberality I repaired monasteries and constructed pagodas Because of these several qualities I planted the seeds to be a king and I now enjoy this rank I am now developing further merit and extensively accumulating wholesomeness 
In the future world I will surely experience the merit again That is why he instructed me saying When you came your path was fine 
May you go just as you came When his ministers had heard this they bowed and apologized We are your servants and our knowledge is shallow so we arrived at a false understanding 
Because of the virtues you have accumulated you enjoy the rank of king The ministers were happy Having said this they withdrew 
The King of the Kusanas Has Three Wise Subjects as Virtuous Friends Once the king of the Kusanas called Candana Kaniska was befriended by three wise people The first was called Bodhisattva Asvaghosa The second was a great minister called Mathara The third was a skillful physician called Caraka 
Bodhisattva Asvaghosa said to the king When you apply my words it will allow you O king to be always accompanied by good in the world into which you are bom to be perpetually free  Chapter VII from any hardship and to leave the unwholesome destinations permanently The second one the great minister also said to the king If you apply my private words O king and do not divulge them you will be able to subdue the whole territory between the four seas The third one the skillful physician further said to the king If you apply my words O great king it will allow you O king never to meet with an untimely death 
The hundred flavors will please you and you will be in good health and free from ailment The king followed his words and he never knew even a slight illness 
Thereupon the king applied the words of his great minister Confronted by his military power there were none who were not subjugated Three directions of the territory between the four seas had been subdued and only the eastern one had not yet been subjected So he equipped his army and wanted to go and punish it 
He sent his people and his white elephants ahead They led the way and the king followed behind He was about to c reach the Onion Range and cross a steep pass but the elephants and horses that he had mounted before did not want to proceed any further 
The king was very startled and said to his horses Since we began mounting you in military expeditions three directions have been subdued 
Why do you not want to continue on your way now The great minister then said to the king I told you before not to divulge my private words You have divulged them now O king 
Your fate will not be far away The king knew it would be as his great minister had said He would surely die before long 
In the course of his military expeditions the king had killed more than three hundred thousand people He knew that his punishment in the future would be severe and that he would certainly undergo it without any doubt He became afraid and he was repentant He developed dana  kept the precepts constructed monasteries and worshipped the Sangha 
 Parable  Then all his ministers said to one another The king has committed immense crimes His massacres go beyond principle Even though he may perform meritorious deeds now what good does it do in regard to his past crimes The king heard about this 
He ordered his subjects Heat up a big cauldron and let it boil very hard for seven days and seven nights 
Do not let it stop The king then threw a ring from his finger into the cauldron and he told his ministers Return the ring in the cauldron to me sirs The ministers said to the king We prefer to go to our deaths for some other crime 
This ring cannot be gotten The king said to his ministers Might there be a means to get it The ministers then replied One might put out the fire underneath and add cold water on top 
Through this means one might be able to obtain it without hurting ones hand The king replied The evil I have performed before may be compared to that hot cauldron I am now developing that which is wholesome I feel shame and remorse and I shall not do evil any more Why would I not extinguish it 
The three unwholesome destinations may be avoided and I may become a man or a god The ministers immediately understood 
When they had heard this they were all glad The words of a wise man must be put to use

So the Buddha said You Brahman woman are foolish hold wrong views and do not believe in the Three Precious Things When the wife heard these words she became furious She ripped off her necklaces put on a dirty and greasy garment and sat down on the floor 
When her husband came in he asked her Why are you like that She answered The sramana Gautama has abused me 
Open the gate tomorrow and wait for the Buddha to come When the next day the Buddha appeared in his house the Brahman grabbed his sharp sword and was about to chop the Buddha down but he could not touch him 
Seeing that the Buddha was up in the air he felt shame prostrated himself on the floor and said to the Buddha Please Worldhonored One come down and accept my repentance So the Buddha came down accepted his repentance and expounded the essentials of the Doctrine to him Both husband and wife obtained the path of the srotdpanna 
When the bhiksus had heard about the Buddhas subjection of such evil persons they all said these words The appearance of the Worldhonored One in the world is absolutely marvelous it is totally exceptional The Buddha informed the bhiksus Not only today but also in the past I brought about submission The bhiksus said to the  Parable  b Buddha We wonder how this submission in the past was brought about The Buddha said Once in the land of KasI there was a king by the name of Oshou 
For this reason the precious objects in the land became great riches Everyone told of this abroad and evil reputation spread 
At that time there was a parrot king in the woods He overheard people passing by telling about the kings wickedness So he thought I am a bird but I still know what is wrong I shall now go to him and explain the right path to him 
If that king listens to my words he will certainly say He is a king of birds yet he has excellent advice 
What if a king of men rebuked by him mended his ways  He subsequently flew up in the air to the kings park He wheeled around and came down on the top of a tree 
The king s wife happened to have gone into the park for a stroll Clapping his wings and calling out the parrot then said to her The king is tyrannical absolutely unprincipled He oppresses all people He is even malicious toward birds and animals 
You his wife are oppressive no different from the king How can the parents of the people be like that When the wife heard this her rage flared up 
What is this small bird its mouth hill of reproach for me She sent someone to catch it but at that moment the parrot entered the hands of the birdcatcher not frightened or afraid 
When the wife got the parrot she gave it to the king 
The king said to the parrot Why do you reproach me The parrot replied I am only saying that you O king are on the wrong path 
I do not dare to reproach you The king then asked What wrong path am I on replied You are on a wrong path with seven elements that can endanger your person O king asked Which seven answered 
Fond of wine you are befuddled and do not concern yourself with the affairs of the nation 
Addicted to games you do not develop respect for propriety 
On hunting trips you kill living beings and you have no merciful thoughts at all 
You like to utter harsh words and you have never spoken nicely 
Your taxes your levies of service and your fines are twice as heavy as the common rule 
You rob your peoples riches beyond the principles of righteousness 
You have these seven elements that can endanger your person O king 
There are furthermore three elements that may overthrow your state O king The king again asked Which three elements do you mean The parrot replied You are befriended by treacherous and deceiving people 
You do not depend on excellent people nor do you accept sincere reproofs 
You like to attack other countries and you do not care for your people 
If these three are not done away with you will be overthrown if not some morning then some evening 
The whole territory turns to the one who is a king A king must be like a bridge saving all people 
A king must be like a weighing beam Those who have relations with him are all equal 
A king must be like a path not going against the tracks of the wise 
A king shines over all the world just like the sun 
A king brings coolness to things just like the moon 
A king must educate people kindly and be merciful just like ones parents 
A king must cover everything just like heaven 
A king must support all things just like the earth 
A king must bum away trouble for all his people just like fire 
A king must enrich the four directions just like water 
Like the noble monarchs of the past he must instruct all beings about the ten wholesome paths  Having heard these words the king felt deeply ashamed Your words parrot are utterly honest and utterly sincere As a king of  Parable  men my behavior was unprincipled 
Allow me to comply with your instructions to have the honor to have you as my teacher and to experience and develop the right path When he practiced the teaching his bad reputation disappeared in the land His wife and subordinate officials all became loyal and respectful In the whole population there was none who was not happy It was like a royal bull crossing over water 
The parrot at that time is myself 
Oshou the king of Kasi at that time is the present state councillor 
The wife at that time is now the state councillors wife Parable  
The Buddhas Disciple Nanda Is Compelled by the Buddha to Go Forth and He Attains the Path The Buddha was in the land of Kapilavastu He entered the city to beg for food and arrived at Nandas house Nanda happened to be preparing some cosmetics for his wife some fragrant ointment for between her eyebrows Hearing that the Buddha was at his gate he wanted to have a look outside 
He took his bowl and went to his house filled it up with food and presented it to the Buddha but the Buddha did not take it He passed it on to Ananda 
Ananda said Return the bowl to its place of origin to the one you obtained it from Thereupon Nanda took the bowl and followed the Buddha to the Nyagrodha pure abode 
The Buddha then ordered a barber to shave Nandas head but Nanda did not want him to 
Making an angry fist he said to the barber You should shave all the heads of the whole population of Kapilavastu nowThe Buddha asked the barber Why did you not shave him The barber answered Because I was afraid I dared  Chapter Vili not shave him The Buddha and Ananda themselves went to him 
Because Nanda was afraid he did not dare not be shaved 
Even though he had obtained the tonsure he always wanted to go back home The Buddha always took him along and he could not get away 
I shall wait till after the Buddha and the monks have all left and then go back home After the Buddha had entered the city Nanda thought I shall draw the water from the well for them 
Only after I have filled their water bowls shall I return He subsequently drew water from the well but as soon as one bowl was full another was overturned It continued like that for some time and he could not fill the bowls a So he said I cannot fill them up altogether I shall let the bhiksus draw the water themselves after they return 
Just as one leaf was shut the other leaf opened again Just as he had shut one door the other door opened again Again he thought I cannot shut them all as I might wish I shall just leave them and go 
Even if I lose the clothing and other effects of the bhiksus I have plenty of possessions enough to be able to make it up So he left the monastery and he thought The Buddha will surely pass by here 
When he saw the Buddha coming in the distance Nanda hid behind a big tree but the spirit of the tree lifted the tree up in the air 
The Buddha saw Nanda as he stood there in the open 
He led him back to the pure abode and asked him Do you think about your wife Nanda replied I do indeed So he took Nanda up on the Anapo Mountain and he further asked Nanda Is your wife beautiful Yes he replied 
As there was an old blind monkey in the mountains further asked Your wife Sundarl is her countenance as beautiful as this monkeys Nanda was vexed and he said in his mind Few people equal my wifes beauty 
He saw the gods and the goddesses enjoying themselves He saw that in one palace there were five hundred goddesses but no god 
Nanda returned to ask the Buddha about it but the Buddha said Go and ask them yourself Nanda went to ask them In all the other palaces there are gods 
Why is there no god in this place only The goddesses answered In Jambudvlpa the Buddhas disciple Nanda was compelled by the Buddha to go forth 
Because he has gone forth he will be reborn as our god in this heavenly palace after his life has ended Nanda answered It is I myself So he wanted to stay right there but the goddesses said We are goddesses but you are a man now When you have given up your human life back there and are reborn here then you can stay So he returned to the Buddha and told all this to the Worldhonored One 
The Buddha said to Nanda How does your wifes beauty compare with that of the goddesses Nanda replied Beside those goddesses she is like the blind monkey that you compared to her The Buddha led Nanda back to Jambudvlpa 
In order to be reborn among the gods Nanda was diligent in his morality 
Ananda then spoke the stanza When for instance a ram is fighting it withdraws when it is going to advance When you keep the precepts because of desire it is exactly the same 
b The Buddha then took Nanda to hell He saw the cauldrons all with people boiling in them He saw just one cauldron standing there empty but boiling 
He wondered why and came to ask the Buddha about it 
The Buddha Informed him Go and ask about it yourself So Nanda went and asked a jailer All the cauldrons are boiling sinners Why is this cauldron empty without anyone being boiled The jailer answered In Jambudvlpa there is a disciple of the Tathagata called Nanda 
Because of his merit for having gone forth he will obtain rebirth in heavenBut because of his having given up the path out of desire he will fall into this hell after his heavenly life has ended That is why I now make the cauldron boil and wait for him Nanda was alarmed 
Fearing that the jailer  Chapter Vili might keep him he said the words Namo Buddhaya 
Take me back to Jambudvipa The Buddha said to Nanda You must diligently keep the precepts developing your heavenly merit Nanda answered I do not need a rebirth in heaven 
I wish not to fall into this hell The Buddha expounded the Doctrine to him and after the first seven days he became an arhat 
The bhiksus said in admiration The appearance in the world of the Worldhonored One is truly marvelous truly exceptional The Buddha said Not only now 
It was like that in the past too The bhiksus said Please tell us how it was the same in the past 
The Buddha said Long ago the king of Kasi was called Purnamukha In the land of Videha there was a luscious lady of extraordinary beauty 
At that time the two countries had a constant hatred of each other By the side of the king of KasI there was a deceitful minister who said to tempt him that in the other country there was a luscious lady whose beauty was rare in the world 
When the king heard these words he became deluded in his heart and sent a messenger to ask for her but that country refused 
He sent another messenger to say that he wanted to see her for a while and that he would send her back within four or five days The other king then ordered the luscious lady In your behavior be fully equipped with all your accomplishments and let the king of KasI be deluded by you so that he cannot leave you for a moment Then he sent her away After four or five days he called her back saying he was going to arrange for an important sacrifice that he needed this woman and that after she had returned for a while he would send her back So the king of Kasi sent her back 
Such lying went on for many days 
As the king was deluded in his heart he wanted to go to the other country taking just a few men with him His ministers strongly protested but he did not want to take their advice 
 Parable  In the Seer Mountains there was a monkey king at that time He was clever intelligent and endowed with great knowledge As his wife had just died he took a female monkey 
The whole crowd of monkeys angrily blamed him This luscious monkey is our common property 
Why do you alone take her The monkey king then took the female monkey away to the land of Kasi and fled to the king The whole crowd of monkeys all pursued them 
When they reached the city they violated the houses and destroyed the walls They could not be brought to reason 
The king of Kasi said to the monkey king Why do you not return the female monkey to the monkeys now The monkey king said My wife has passed away I would not have a wife any more 
O king why do you want me to send her back now The king said to him Your monkeys are ruining my country now Why should she not return 
The monkey king said Is this not all right The king answered No it is not all right This went on two or three times but the king kept saying No it is not all right Then the monkey king said In your palace you have eightyfour thousand wives but you are not pleased You want to go to a hostile country in pursuit of a luscious lady 
I do not have a wife now I just took this one but you say it is not all right 
All ten thousand families look up to you for their livelihood Why do you abandon them for one luscious lady 
 king know that the happiness of lustful deeds is little and that the suffering is great For instance when holding a burning torch against the wind a fool does not let go and is sure to be burned 
Desire is impure like a heap of dung 
Desire shows an outward appearance covered by a thin skin 
Desire is ungrateful like a venomous snake daubed in dung 
Desire is like a brigand feigning to be a mans friend 
Desire is like a loan that must surely be returned 
Desire is distasteful like a flower growing in a lavatory 
Desire is like an inflammation of an itching boil When one scratches it it becomes worse 
Desire is like a dog gnawing a dry bone As  Chapter Vili his saliva is mingled with it he thinks it has some taste His lips and teeth are completely broken but he cannot get enough of it 
Desire is like a thirsty person drinking salty water It increases his thirst 
Desire is like a lump of meat eagerly quarreled over by a flock of birds 
Desire is like a fish or an animal The flavors they are after are extremely small but their distress is very great The monkey king at that time is myself 
The king at that time is Nanda 
The luscious lady at that time is Sundari 
At that time I wanted to pull Nanda out of the mud I want to pull him out of the suffering of birth and death now too Parable  
A Fine Athlete Converts a Band of Brigands in the Wilderness Once the Buddha was in Rajagrha 
Between the two countries of Rajagrha and Vaisali there was a band of five hundred brigands 
King Bimbisaras kindness was ample and fine He ruled his country with merciful laws and he did not hurt the life of any being So he issued an appeal saying he would copiously reward a with nobility anyone who could go and convert the band of five hundred thieves so that they would not commit any more robberies 
There was an athlete then who came and answered the kings appeal He went to the wilderness and pacified the band of brigands He was able to keep them from committing more robberies 
After he had thoroughly subdued them he built the great city Atavl with a moat and placed them there Little by little their numbers increased and many people entrusted themselves to them Thereupon they became a great country 
The people of the country all said We have received the kindness of the fine athlete s care now so that we all can assemble here Let us make this agreement From now on anyone who takes a new wife must offer her first to the athlete So they went to the athlete and said to him We have made an agreement that the one who takes a new wife must offer her first to you O athlete and for  Parable  two reasons 
They actually applied this rule When quite some time had gone by there was one woman who was not happy about this She urinated naked in front of everyone They all scolded her saying You are shameless 
How can a woman urinate standing in front of all the men The woman replied When a woman urinates naked in front of you why should she be ashamed 
The whole country is made up of women Only the fine athlete is a man If it were in front of him I would be ashamed 
Why should I be ashamed in front of you So the men said to each other This womans explanation is exactly right Sariputra and Maudgalyayana then passed through the wasteland together with five hundred disciples 
When the athlete knew this he invited the two reverends and their five hundred disciples to stay there and stop for the night He gave them clothes and food 
After three days had passed the people in the land came together and organized a gathering Drinking wine they became drunk and they decided to surround the fine athletes house and bum it down 
The athlete asked What are you doing this for The crowd answered Every newly married wife goes to you first We are men and we will not stand for this Therefore we come to bum you down The athlete answered I did not agree before 
You forced me to No one listened to him So they burned him to death When his life was about to end he made the vow May I be reborn in this wilderness through my merit for having worshipped Sariputra and Maudgalyayana and may I become a very strong demon and annihilate everybody When he had said this his life stopped 
He was immediately transformed and reborn as a demon He spread a vast epidemic and killed a great many people 
Occasionally some wise people b implored the demon You have killed innumerable people now You cannot eat all the flesh You let a great deal rot Please let us kill cows and horses and give you one person every day So all in  Chapter Vili the land drew lots one person each day 
Then it eventually the elder Subhadras turn Subhadra had a son who was virtuous and upright He was to be eaten by the demon next 
The elder thought The Tathagata has appeared in the world and is saving all suffering beings 
I wish that the Worldhonored One would save my son from his present distress The Buddha was in Rajagrha When he knew the elders thoughts he immediately came to the demon of the wilderness and sat down in his palace 
When the demon of the wilderness came he saw the Worldhonored One and became extremely angry He said to the Buddha Sramana go away So the Buddha left 
When the demon next entered his palace the Buddha had come again 
This happened three times but the fourth time the Buddha did not leave The demon said If you do not leave I shall turn you upside down grab your feet and throw you into the Ganges The Buddha said to him I do not know anyone in the world neither god nor Mara nor Brahma who can grab me and do such a thing The demon of the wilderness said All right all right 
Let me ask you four things O Tathagata Explain them to me 
First who can cross the rapid current Second who can cross the ocean Third who can do away with all suffering 
Fourth who can obtain purity The Buddha replied Faith can cross the rapid current Heedfulness can cross the ocean Strenuous pursuit can do away with suffering Wisdom obtains purity After he had heard these words the demon took refuge in the Buddha and became the Buddhas disciple 
He took the elder Subhadras son and placed him in the Buddhas bowl They subsequently called the boy Hastaka Atavaka He grew up little by little The Buddha expounded the Doctrine to him and he became an anagamin 
The bhiksus said Your appearance in the world O Worldhonored One is truly wonderful 
You could subdue such a very evil demon of the wilderness O Buddha and make him an upasaka  The Buddha said Not only now 
Also in a past time there once was a vast wilderness between two countries the land of Kasi and  Parable  the land of Videha 
There was an evil demon called Slesaloma He blocked the road and no one in the whole population could pass through There was one leader of merchants called Simha who wanted to take this road with five hundred merchants They were all frightened and afraid they might not get through 
The leader of the merchants said Do not be afraid 
He reached the place where the demon was and he said to the   c demon Have you not heard my name replied I have heard your name I came with the intention of fighting you asked What can you do So took his bow and arrows and shot at the demon 
He shot five hundred arrows but they all sank into the demons belly His bow sword and weapons entered the demons belly too He went right up to and hit him with his fist but his fist also went in When he used his right hand his right hand got stuck 
The leader of the merchants replied with the stanzas Now my hands my feet and my head and all my riches and my weapons  I have only my vigor that did not get stuck in you If my vigor does not cease my fight with you will never be given up 
Slesaloma is the present demon of the wilderness  Chapter Vili Parable  
A State Councillor Hears the Doctrine and Renounces Desire When the Buddha was in Rajagrha Bimbisara had a highranking state councillor who often went to the Buddha with his king to listen to the Tathagatas exposition of the Doctrine of renunciation 
After this he had intercourse with his wife only infrequently His wife conceived evil thoughts She looked for poison to put in food She invited the Buddha and wanted to give to him but her husband was aware that his wife had something evil in mind 
When he asked her for the food his wife did not want to give it but gave him some other food After the Buddhas arrival the husband said to the Buddha You must not eat this food The Buddha said Why must I not eat it answered It is poisoned The Buddha said All the poisons in the world do not surpass the three poisons 
Then the state councillors wife had faith and the Buddha expounded the Doctrine to her Both husband and wife became srotapannas 
The bhiksus marvelled at this wonder 
The Buddha said Not only now but also in the past have I converted them 
Once the king of Kasi had a wise minister called a Vidhura He constantly counseled the king and all his ministers according to the law of the path so that they would all develop what is wholesome 
He often visited Vidhura listening to his words of the Doctrine 
His intercourse with his wife became rare The dragon lady was angry and she said Only when I have sacrificed Vidhuras heart in fire and drunk his blood can I live There was a yaksa demon then who visited this dragon king and his wife and who was their friend Upon hearing the dragon ladys words he replied I can get you these He appeared at the  Parable  dragon ladys side as a merchant carrying a wishgranting gem He went to the king of Kasi 
He gambled with the king staking his wishgranting gem The king put up his country its treasure and Vidhura as his stake against the gem 
The yaksa won He had no need for the country and its treasure He just chose Vidhura and gave his gem to the king 
The king asked Vidhura if he wanted to go away and he answered I want to go As the yaksa took him away Vidhura asked the yaksa What is your intention in coming to ask for me The yaksa did not answer but kept asking with such insistence that he said to him The dragon kings wife wants your heart in order to sacrifice it in fire and she wants your blood to drink Vidhura said If she kills me she will take my heart and blood The heart and blood of any person are the same How would you know whose it is 
Do not kill me now but let me go The one who requires my heart wants my wisdom The one who requires my blood wants my doctrine Having heard these words the yaksa thought He really is a wise one So he took him to the dragons 
When the dragons saw  they were happy He expounded the Doctrine to them 
The dragon king and his wife and all their dependents had respectful and devout thoughts and they all took the five precepts Even the crowd of yaksas took the five precepts 
At that time the dragons and yaksas in Jambudvipa offered many precious things and sent them to Vidhura 
When Vidhura obtained these precious things he offered them to the king and to the people 
Thereupon the people of Jambudvipa and the dragon demons took the five precepts and practiced the ten wholesome  
Vidhura at that time is myself

The dragon lady at that time is the state councillors wife

The Nirgrantha Disciples Throw Themselves into a Pool of Fire but Are Saved by the Buddha b The Buddha was in Sravasti 
At that time the Tathagata had subdued the six heretical teachers with their wrong views and also their followers so that they were completely ruined 
Five hundred Nirgranthas thought Our group of disciples is completely ruined and scattered 
It would be better to burn ourselves and all go to the afterworld So they piled up firewood and wanted to burn themselves 
The Tathagata felt great compassion and wanted to pull them out of their suffering He was next to the firewood but did not let the fire start and entered the samadhi of the fires glow 
When the Nirgrantha disciples saw the great pool of fire they were glad and said We do not have to light the fire They all threw themselves into it 
When they were in the pool of fire their bodies were cool and they were extremely happy Seeing the Buddha there they were twice as joyful 
When they asked to go forth the Buddha said Welcome bhiksus Their hair fell off and they had the garments of the Law on their bodies The Buddha expounded the Doctrine to them and they became arhats 
The bhiksus said Wonderful O Worldhonored One that you could pull these Nirgrantha disciples out of the suffering of being burnt so that they became arhats The Buddha said Not only now 
In the past in Sravasti there were five hundred traders who went to sea to gather valuables 
They had a leader then called Visakha He went away with a favorable wind at the head of the group of merchants and arrived where the valuables were 
When loading them aboard the ships all the merchants avariciously took the valuables placing heavy loads on the ships 
Visakha then said to the merchants Do not load too heavy a cargo of valuables You will lose your lives The merchants did not heed his words They preferred to die with the valuables rather than to reduce their amount 
So the leader of the merchants threw the valuables from his ship into the water and had the merchants come aboard his own ship The ships with the valuables  Parable  all sank in the sea 
The spirit of the sea saw that the leader of the merchants could give up his valuables to save the merchants and he was happy He took the valuables that the leader of the merchants had thrown away and flew ahead with them After they had come home from the sea he returned them to the leader of the merchants 
The merchants said Why did we not risk our lives for the valuables Seeing their misery Viskha then felt profound compassion and he shared with them all the valuables that he had obtained He expediently practiced the doctrine of going forth on a heterodox path and he obtained the five superknowledges 
The merchants said Such a great man He does not covet riches Practicing his aspirations he has obtained considerable gain We must learn from him They all gave up their valuables went to the seer and practiced his doctrine 
Viskha at that time is myself

Five Hundred White Wild Geese Hear the Doctrine and Are Reborn in Heaven    c The Buddha was in Srvasti 
At that time the land of Pancla had contributed five hundred white wild geese to King Prasenajit King Prasenajit gave them to the Jetavana pure abode 
When it was time for the monks to eat they went begging for their food When the geese saw a multitude of monks they came closer and stood in front of them 
The Buddha expounded the Doctrine with one sound and the beings all gained understanding according to their kind 
The flock of geese also understood the Buddhas words at that time and hearing the Doctrine they were glad Singing out in harmony they returned to their pond Later since their feathers had gradually grown they flew to another place A hunter covered them all with a net and killed them 
When they were caught in the net one goose made a sound  Chapter Vili and all the geese fell in with him It was the sound of the time when they had heard the Doctrine Because of this wholesome thought they were reborn in the Trayastrimsa Heaven 
As a rule for rebirth in heaven there are three considerations First one considers where one came from 
Second one considers in which place it has been decided that one would be reborn 
Third one considers what deed one has performed to obtain rebirth in heaven 
So they thought this over and they saw their previous karmic causality They had only heard the Doctrine with the Buddhas monks there was nothing else that was a good causality 
Having made this thought the five hundred celestial sons immediately descended to the Tathagatas side The Buddha expounded the Doctrine to them and they all became srotapannas 
Whenever King Prasenajit went to the Buddha he used to see the five hundred geese spread out in front of the Buddha but one day he did not see them 
So he asked the Buddha Where have all those geese gone The Buddha said Do you want to see the geese When the king said Yes the Buddha said Previously the geese flew off to somewhere else and they were killed by a hunter 
Those five hundred celestial sons are now wearing splendid celestial caps and they are exceptionally beautiful 
Having heard the Doctrine now they have all become srotapannas The king asked the Buddha Because of what karmic causality did this flock of geese fall into the animal  
Why were they reborn in heaven after their fives had ended and why have they attained the path now The Buddha said Once in the time of the Buddha Kasyapa five hundred women all received the precepts but their devotion was not strong and they broke the precepts they had received Because they had offended against the precepts they fell among the animals and became these geese 
Because they had received the precepts they met me the Tathagata heard my Doctrine and obtained the path Because they had heard the Doctrine as geese they were reborn in heaven  Parable  Parable  
Devadatta Releases the Maddened Elephant Dhanapala Wishing to Harm the Buddha The Buddha was in Rajagrha 
At that time Devadatta released the maddened elephant Dhanapala wanting him to harm the Buddha The five hundred arhats all flew up into the sky Only Ananda stayed behind all alone behind the Buddha 
When the Buddha then raised his right hand the white elephant Dhanapala saw five hundred lions The elephant was frightened then and was immediately subdued 
The five hundred bhiksus had all left the Buddha and only Ananda had stayed behind with him 
The Buddha said Not only now It was the same in the past 
Once in the land of Kasi there were five hundred wild geese who all formed a flock The king of the geese at that time was called rastra The king of the geese had a minister named Sumukha 
When the king of the geese was caught by a hunter his flock of five hundred geese all flew away Only Sumukha followed him and did not leave him He said to the hunter Please let my king go I myself shall now take his place But the hunter did not agree he then gave the king of the geese as a contribution to King Fanmoyao 
The king asked the king of the geese Do you feel safe The king of the geese answered I receive great kindness O king I obtain clean water from you and I also obtain fine herbs With these I have a livelihood I dwell in the land in constant peace 
I only wish that you O great king would let all geese go so that they would be free from fear A flock of five hundred geese was crying in the air above the kings palace 
What would they rely on at that moment 
O king know that all riches are broken down and destroyed Having come from the four quarters the mountains reduce them to nothing 
The strong have diseases too Coming from the four quarters they ruin the strong 
All who are in the prime of life have a mountain of diseases coming from the four quarters and ruining their prime 
All who have life have the high mountains of death coming from the four quarters and destroying life 
All have these four mountains in common Gods and dragons people and demons all living species are subject to them 
Therefore always develop friendly thoughts and diligently practice the True Doctrine 
If you can do that you will have no regrets when you die Because you will have no regrets you will obtain rebirth in a wholesome place and certainly meet the noble Meeting the noble you will certainly be delivered from birth and death 
The king asked Sumukha Why do you keep silent Sumukha answered Two kings a king of geese and a king of men are b talking now If I were to interrupt it would be bad manners I would not show proper respect of subject for superior The king said Truly wonderful 
You have the body of a goose but you can practice the restraint of a loyal minister in a manner unequalled by people You were willing to trade your own life for that of the king of the geese 
You furthermore humbly comply and do not interrupt his speech Such righteousness of a lord and his minister of you and the king of the geese is rare in the world He gave them all golden neck plates and attached them to their heads He  Parable  dressed the goose kings head up with a beautiful piece of white silk and he sent them away saying You expounded the Good Doctrine to me in the past So I let you go The goose king is myself

He did not have compassionate thoughts and was filled with heterodox views In his great compassion the Tathagata sent his disciples everywhere to convert other countries Katyayana came from the Brahman caste in the country of King Candapradyota So the Buddha sent Katyayana back there to convert its king and its population 
When the Reverend Katyayana had received the Buddhas instructions he returned to his country of origin 
King Candapradyota did not see what was right and served a heterodox path In the morning he never wanted to see anyone He first paid his respects by sacrificing to the gods 
Because he wanted to convert King Candapradyota Katyayana rose early one clear morning He changed his appearance so that he looked like a messenger from far away and presented a beautiful figure as he went through the kings gate 
When the king saw him returned to his original appearance and looked like a sramana 
The king particularly detested men of the path people who had taken the tonsure The king said in great anger You must die now He sent someone to seize Katyayana wanting him to do him harm 
Katyayana said to the king What did I do wrong that you want to see me harmed The king then said You shaven one just seeing you brings bad luck That is why I want to kill you now The Reverend Katyayana answered The bad luck now is mine not yours O king 
Even though you have seen me O king you have not been harmed I have been seen by you O king and you want to see me killed 
The conclusion one might say is that I am the one who has the bad luck A king of course is intelligent Having heard these words he understood their meaning He let Katyayana go and he did not harbor any evil thoughts 
He secretly sent two men to follow him to observe where he stayed and what he ate 
They saw that Katyayana was sitting under a tree and that he ate the food he had begged When he obtained food he shared it with the two men  Parable  a Whatever was left over they dumped into the river 
When the two men returned the king asked the whereabouts of the reverend and also about his food The two men reported in detail to the king what they had seen earlier 
Later the king invited the Reverend Katyayana and gave him some coarse food He sent someone to ask whether this food was to his liking 
The reverend answered I am nourished by this food The king then gave him exquisite food of superior flavor 
Again he sent someone to ask Is it to your liking replied This food gives me nourishment The king later asked the reverend About the food I gave you no matter whether it was coarse or exquisite you always say you are nourished 
What does this mean The Reverend Katyayana answered the king Ones mouth is like a furnace 
This body is like a wagon It does not judge what is good or bad Both fragrant oil and stinking grease Serve equally well  
When the king heard these words he clearly knew greatness He then gave coarse and exquisite food to the Brahmans 
When the Brahmans at first received the coarse food they all were angry They changed color and cursed 
When he later gave them exquisite food they were happy and had words of praise 
When the king saw that the Brahmans were either happy or angry depending on the food his devout respect for Katyayana doubled 
At that time there was a woman whose descent was not related to that of the reverend She lived in a Brahman village outside the city She had very beautiful hair 
When the time for the summer retreat came she dearly liked to worship She cut off her hair and sold it for five hundred pieces of gold She invited Katyayana and worshipped him during the summer retreat 
When the summer retreat was over the Reverend Katyayana returned to the city 
 Chapter IX In King Candapradyotas palace it suddenly emerged that there was a dead pheasant just like the pheasant eaten by a Wheelturning King Thus King Candapradyota wanted to eat it 
A prudent minister then said to the king This pheasant is not fit to be eaten right away You should test it first The king followed his advice and had someone cut off a small slice to give to a dog 
When the dog got the meat he liked the taste of the meat so much that he swallowed his tongue at the same time and died The king then had some meat cut off to try it on a man 
When the man was eating the meat he liked its exciting flavor so much that he even ate his own hand and died 
When the king saw this he became very afraid He heard some people say about this meat that only a noble Wheelturning King someone who had obtained the path with pure knowledge could eat it 
He immediately had someone blend it with fine food and sent it to the Reverend Katyayana 
After Katyayana ate that food his health was all right 
The king later sent someone to observe him He saw that Katyayanas complexion was clear twice as fine as usual 
When the king heard this he felt deep amazement and his respect grew even more while he despised the heretical Brahmans 
The king asked Katyayana O reverend where did you pass the summer retreat 
Where have you come from now The reverend gave a detailed explanation about the woman of external descent who had sold her hair exchanged it for money and worshipped the Sangha When the king heard these words he said The hair of the women with the most beautiful hair in my palace is worth no more than a few copper coins Now you say that that womans hair was worth five hundred pieces of gold That womans hair must have been exceptionally beautiful 
Her appearance must be wonderful So he asked the name of the womans parents and then he sent a messenger to have a look at the woman herself Her beauty was incomparable just as he had thought it would be 
The king sent messengers to betroth her as his wife but the family of the woman demanded a great many precious objects towns and villages The king thought it over again If I give these things they will still belong to me after the woman has come So he gave these  Parable  things and received her as his wife 
The day he first welcomed her the whole country was in a festive mood All declared that it was a very auspicious event 
In the next days he issued a general amnesty and he called her Lady Sivakosa The king was very desirous of pleasing her Later she gave birth to a crown prince called Gopala 
The king then saw eight things while dreaming in his bedb chamber First on his head a fire was burning 
Second two snakes were twisted around his waist 
Third a fine iron network entangled him 
Fourth he saw that two red fishes swallowed both his feet 
Fifth there were four white swans that came flying toward the king 
Sixth walking in bloody mud he sank into the mud up to his armpits 
Seventh he climbed a great white mountain Eighth a stork relieved itself on his head 
When he had woken up from his dreams he thought they were inauspicious 
So he went to the Brahmans and the Brahmans listened to the dreams of the king They had disliked the king for some time and they were jealous of the reverend too So they said of the kings dreams O great king this is not good luck If you do not bring satisfactory sacrifices misfortune will befall your person When the king heard their words he believed them to be true and his sorrow increased 
So he asked them What is required for me to make satisfactory sacrifices The Brahmans said What will be needed are those whom you hold most dear O king 
If we tell you you will certainly not be able to do it O king The king then answered These dreams are terrible I only fear that great misfortune will befall my person I do not have any regard for anyone other than myself 
Please tell me what is needed When the Brahmans saw his insistence they knew that he was very serious So they said to the king As for that which you might need there were eight things in these dreams You need eight things to be able to avert calamities 
Second kill the crown prince Gopala whom you love O king 
Third kill your most important minister your state  Chapter IX councillor Fourth kill all your officials O king 
Fifth kill your elephant that can run three thousand miles in one day 
Sixth kill your camel that can run three thousand miles in one day 
Seventh kill your best horse O king 
Eighth kill the baldheaded Katyayana 
After seven days when you have killed these eight collect their blood and when you walk in it you will do away with the calamities 
When the king heard their words he immediately gave his permission because he valued his own life 
He returned to his palace and he was depressed and grieved 
His wife asked the king what the matter was 
The king answered his wife stating in detail and explaining his previous inauspicious dreams and he told her that the Brahmans would bring the sacrifices needed for the dreams 
When his wife heard it she said Just see to it that you are contented and without distress  king 
Why waste words about my worthless person She then said to the king After seven days I shall return to die Allow me to go to the Reverend Katyayana to observe abstinence and to listen to the Doctrine during the next six days 
The king said she could not go 
If you go to him you might tell him the real situation If he knows it he will leave me and fly away When his wife insisted the king could not decline 
After his wife came to the reverend she made obeisance and made inquiries Thereupon after three days the reverend asked her in astonishment The kings wife has come here and c never stayed more than two nights 
Why is it not the same as usual now The wife told him everything about the bad dream of the king After seven days they will kill us to avert calamities by sacrificing us We just have a little while to live 
Therefore I came to listen to the Doctrine And so she explained the kings dream to the reverend but the Reverend Katyayana said These dreams are very auspicious 
One should be happy They are nothing to worry about 
The burning fire on the head means that the land of the jewel lord will come with a celestial crown worth a hundred thousand taels of gold and offer it to the  Parable  king 
This is the exact meaning of the dream The wife was worried because the seven days were almost over and she would be harmed by the king She was afraid that it would come too late She asked the reverend When will it arrive The reverend answered Today between  and  PM it is sure to arrive 
The two snakes twisted around his waist mean that the king of the Kusanas will contribute two swords worth a hundred thousand taels of gold When the sun sets they will arrive 
The fine iron network entangling him means that the king of Mahacina will contribute a pearl necklace worth a hundred thousand taels of gold Tomorrow morning it will arrive 
The red fishes swallowing his feet mean that the king of Simhala will contribute precious pattens of lapis lazuli worth a hundred thousand taels of gold The day after tomorrow at mealtime they will arrive 
The arrival of the four white swans means that the king of Vrji will contribute a precious golden carriage The day after tomorrow it will arrive at noon 
The bloody mud means that the king of Parthia will contribute a garment of deer hair worth a hundred thousand taels of gold The day after tomorrow in the afternoon it will arrive 
Climbing the grand white mountain means that the king of Atavi will contribute a large elephant The day after tomorrow between  and  PM it will arrive 
The stork relieving itself on his head means that the king and his wife will have some private disagreement 
It was indeed just as the reverend had said When the stipulated time came everything that the countries were to contribute arrived The king was very happy 
Lady Sivakosa already had a celestial crown She put the celestial crown that the land of the jewel lord had offered on top of it Just to tease the king took one celestial crown that Lady Sivakosa was wearing and placed it on the head of Lady Suvarnakesa 
Lady Sivakosa then became angry and said  Chapter IX If there is anything bad I am the first to suffer 
Now you give the celestial crown that I got to her She then threw a cup of cream at the king s head and soiled it completely The king was very angry He drew his sword and was about to cut his wife down His wife was afraid of the king and she ran to her room 
The king then realized that this was precisely the private disagreement to which the reverend had alluded when he interpreted the dream 
The king and his wife thereupon went to the Reverend a Katyayana and discussed everything that had occurred He had believed in wrong and evil words He had almost done something very evil to those whom he loved the reverend his wife and son and his most important minister 
Now that he had heard the reverends exposition of the truth dissipating his blindness he saw the right path free from any evil 
He chased the Brahmans away far from his realm and he asked the reverend Why did these countries offer to me what they each valued most The reverend answered In the past ninetyone kalpas ago there was a Buddha called Vipasyin 
When that Buddha appeared there was a country called Bandhumati The kings crown prince found devout joy in vigorous pursuit He went to that Buddha worshipped him and made obeisance He presented the celestial crown that he wore his precious swords his necklace his tall elephant his precious carriage and his kambala garment to that Buddha 
Because of this merit he was honorable in every birth The precious things he wanted came without his having to ask for them 
When the king had heard this he had profound and devout respect for the Three Precious Things He made obeisance and returned to his palace Parable  
The Golden Cat One day Ring Candapradyota was strolling in his park In a hall in the garden he saw a golden cat going from the northeastern  Parable  corner to the southwestern comer 
The king sent some people to excavate there They found a bronze jar The jar had a capacity of three bushels and it was filled with gold coins 
As they dug deeper and deeper they found another jar And so they eventually found three jars each containing three bushels 
On the offchance they started digging nearby and they recovered more bronze jars They kept digging and over an area of fully five li they obtained bronze jars filled with gold coins everywhere 
King Candapradyota thought that this was extraordinary and so he went to the Reverend Katyayana and discussed with the reverend how he had obtained the money I just took it like that wanting to use it There will not be a calamity for me and my people will there The reverend replied This is a meritorious recompense obtained because of a previous karmic causality O king Just use it 
There will be no difficulty The king then asked I wonder about this previous causality what was that The reverend answered Listen carefully Listen carefully 
In the past ninetyone kalpas ago when the Buddha Vipasyin had left the Doctrine behind there were bhiksus who set up a high seat at a comer where four roads crossed and placed an alms bowl on it saying Anyone with worldly possessions who can put his riches into this solid repository and deposit them will find that water cannot dissipate them fire cannot bum them the king cannot take them away and robbers cannot steal them There was a poor man who because he had sold firewood happened to   b possess three coins 
He was five li from his house and when he returned home he was happy at every step When he arrived at his gate he entered his house only after he had made an earnest vow toward the place where he had been inspired to turn to Buddhism The reverend said The poor man at that time is the present king 
Because of his former gift of three coins he obtained noble birth from generation to generation He has always obtained three jars filled with coins Because he rejoiced with every step for five  Chapter IX li he obtained these gold coins throughout five li When the king heard about his previous karmic causality he was glad and left 
Parable  King Candapradyota Obtains Five Hundred Alms Bowls Once King Candapradyota went to the city of Ujjayini 
When the gatekeeper opened the gate one morning there all of a sudden were five hundred wagons outside the gate each loaded with precious bowls filled with golden grain Each had a seal the text of which said These bowls are for King Candapradyota The gatekeeper reported this to the king saying Outside there are precious bowls 
It is written on the bowls that they are for you O king I wonder if I may accept them now The king thought These valuables have arrived unexpectedly 
If I accept them might there not be a calamity for my house and country Having thought this he went to the Reverend Katyayana and asked him Opening the gate this morning we suddenly saw precious bowls The seal on them said For King Candapradyota I do not know whether they mean good luck or bad May I accept them 
The reverend answered They are your recompense for previous merit O king 
Just accept them without any afterthought The king said to the reverend What merit did I earn previously that brings me this recompense The reverend answered In the past ninetyone kalpas ago there was apratyekabuddha in the Seer Mountains 
The pratyekabuddha then went to a potter and asked him for an earthen bowl 
The potter thereupon was happy to give the pratyekabuddha five bowls all filled with water 
When the pratyekabuddha received them he threw the bowls in the air jumped up and ascended into the air making eighteen transformations The potter his wife and child and the people who were buying earthenware were all joyful at seeing this miracle and their happiness was without limit 
 Parable  The potter at that time is yourself O king 
His wife at that time is the lady Sivakosa 
His son at that time is the crown prince Gopala 
The one who was buying earthenware at that time is the state councillor Fulukuei 
His wife who was buying earthenware is the state councillors wife 
The king further asked I wonder if these bowls appeared by themselves or did they come from somewhere The reverend   ic answered These bowls do not exist by themselves 
They come from a dragon palace in the River Ganges How do you know that Long ago a Brahman King Ramas uncle was practicing pure conduct on the bank of the River Ganges 
At that time King Rama sent food to his uncle daily in a precious bowl 
It is a rule for Brahmans not to use a vessel twice After his meal the uncle threw the bowl in the River Ganges 
A blind dragon took the precious bowl filled it with golden grain and placed it in his palace 
The bowls that were thrown away gradually became more numerous every day And so he obtained bowls for five hundred wagons 
The blind dragons life ended and he did not have a son who would keep these bowls The celestial lord knew your karmic causality O king that you had given bowls in the past so he sent these to you 
When the king heard these words he accepted the precious bowls in order to perform meritorious acts with them He widely practiced liberality and worshipped the Triple Jewel Because of this he received an auspicious rebirth Parable  
On Imploring the God Vemacitra Hoping to Gain Considerable Wealth There once were two brothers whose family was extremely poor The elder brother continually night and day zealously revered and implored the god Vemacitra hoping to obtain considerable wealth but he let his younger brother plow and plant the fields 
When the elder brother had spent quite some time making such prayers the god Vemacitra took the form of the younger brother and went to the elder brother 
The elder brother was angry at this brother and  Chapter IX said Why are you not plowing and sowing 
What are you doing here The younger brother then replied Brother day and night you pray in the temple of the god hoping to obtain considerable wealth 
Through abstention and pledges I hope to obtain considerable wealth The elder brother said to his younger brother If you do not plow the fields and plant the seeds how can we obtain an abundance of property The younger brother asked his elder brother Do we really gather that by sowing When the elder brother could not reply the god Vemacitra thereupon returned to his celestial form and said to him Now my    a power may truly help you today 
Your previous karmic causality has made you poor because you did not practice liberality That is why you are poor 
Even though day and night you zealously beg me for abundant wealth and riches how can you obtain them 
Take for example an amra tree If it is winter you cannot obtain any fruit even though you may serve a hundred or a thousand heavenly gods to get its fruit 
The same applies to you Because you previously did not develop any karmic causality but still beg me for considerable wealth you cannot obtain it either 
When the fruit is ripe you will naturally obtain it without asking for it He then spoke the stanzas 
Parable  
HaritI Loses Her Son Hariti was the wife of the demon king Pancika She had ten thousand sons who all had the strength of fine athletes 
The  Parable  youngest one was called Pingala This demon mother was inhuman and cruel She killed peoples sons to eat them 
People suffered because of her They appealed to the Worldhonored One 
The Worldhonored One then took her son Pingala and put him at the bottom of his bowl 
HaritI looked everywhere in the world for him for seven days but she did not find him She was sorrowful and sad When she heard others say It is said that the Buddha the Worldhonored One is omniscient she went to the Buddha and asked him where her son was 
The Buddha then answered You have ten thousand sons You have lost only one son Why do you search for him suffering and sad 
People in the world may have one son or they may have several sons but you kill them HaritI said to the Buddha If I can find Pingala now I shall never kill anyones son any more So the Buddha let HaritI see Pingala in his bowl 
She implored the Buddha and the Buddha said If you can accept the three refuges and the five precepts now and never in your life kill any more I s h a l l return your son HaritI did as the Buddha told her to and she accepted the three refuges and the five precepts 
After she had accepted them he returned her son 
The Buddha said Keep the precepts well In the time of Buddha Kasyapa you were the seventh the youngest daughter of King Chiehchi You performed acts of great merit but because you did not keep the precepts you have received the body of a demon Parable  
The Priest in Charge of Sacrifices to a God   b There once was a Brahman who served the god Mahesvara 
Day and night he served him so the god asked him What do you seek The Brahman said I seek to become in charge of sacrifices to you now O god The god said Over there is a herd of cattle 
Make inquiries of the one walking in front So just as the god had said he went to ask the ox What is it like for you now  Chapter IX painful or pleasant The ox then answered It is extremely painful 
I am yoked to a lead cart and I never find rest anymore He then further asked Why did you receive this body of an ox The ox answered him I was in charge of sacrifices to that god 
Parable  
The Sacrifice to the Spirit of a Tree There once was an old man whose family was very wealthy This old man wanted to eat meat and he cunningly devised a means Pointing to a tree at the end of a field he said to his sons Our family estate is prosperous now because of the bounty of the spirit of that tree 
You should now choose a sheep in the herd as a sacrifice to it His sons then followed the instructions of their father and they subsequently killed a sheep and offered it to thank this tree Underneath the tree they erected a shrine to the god 
Later their fathers life was over and he died Pursued by his actions he was reborn into the herd of sheep of his own family 
His sons then happened to decide to make a sacrifice to the spirit of the tree So they chose one sheep and by chance took the one that had been their father When they were about to kill it the sheep started bleating It laughed and said What spirit could this tree have 
Because I wanted meat in the past I falsely let you make a sacrifice We all ate the meat together I alone now have to face retribution for the misdeed  Parable  An arhat happened to arrive there begging for his food 
He saw that the deceased father had received the body of a sheep So he lent his eye of the path to the owners so that they might see for themselves Then they knew that the sheep was their father and they felt vexed in their hearts They destroyed the tree and its spirit 
A Woman Is Disgusted with Desire and Goes Forth   c There was once a woman whose beauty was extremely fine She went forth to follow the doctrine of a heretical teaching and practiced its path 
People said to her With such a complexion you should have stayed a laywoman 
Why did you go forth The woman answered As for me it is not that I am not beautiful these days but I have gone forth now because for some time I have been disgusted by sexual desire 
When I was in my family my place was quickly allotted because of my beauty I had a son very early So my son grew up and his beauty was beyond compare I noticed that he was losing weight as if he were ill 
So I asked my son what he was suffering from but he did not dare speak up As I kept on asking he had no alternative but to say to his mother If I do not tell the truth I fear my life will be in jeopardy I fear that if I were to tell you the whole truth I would make a complete fool of myself So he said to me I want to have you to satisfy my sexual desires 
Because I do not have you I am ill I said to him Since ancient times there never has been such a thing I further thought If I do not comply my son may die It would be better to go against reason to keep my son alive now So I called my son wanting to comply with his intentions 
When he was about to come into my bed the floor split open and my son immediately fell in alive I was frightened and pull him back with my hands  Chapter IX but I got his hair 
I still cherish my sons hair in my bosom today 
Because I was affected by this event I went forth Parable  
A Son Lacking in Filial Piety Experiences a Painful Retribution Once in the land of Chiame there was an aged mother in the village of Kutasanda She had only one son 
This son was unmanageable He did not practice benevolence and piety Because he was angry at his mother he raised his hand to her and gave her a thrashing 
That same day he went away and ran into a bandit who chopped off his arm The crime of lacking filial piety was immediately punished with suffering of this kind His later suffering in hell cannot be measured 
The Discussion of King Menandros with Nagasena In the past King Menandros was intelligent and very perspicacious There was nothing he was not versed in He thought that his knowledge was matchless So he asked his ministers Is there anyone who is wise and eloquent who can answer me when consulted about something I am not sure of There was a minister then whose family had previously worshipped an aged bhiksu 
So he talked to the king and the king asked him Do those who attain the path attain it staying in their families or do they attain it having gone forth The aged bhiksu then replied to him One may obtain the path in both    a cases The king further asked him If one may obtain it in both cases what is the use of going forth The aged bhiksu remained silent 
King Menandros became even more arrogant then 
His ministers said to the king Nagasenas wisdom is superior 
Who might be able to add to it When Nagasena had obtained this milk he understood its purpose With his disciples he collected five hundred needles he put them in the curdled milk but the milk still did not spill over He subsequently sent it back to the king 
When the king had received it he knew the meaning of it He then sent a messenger to invite Nagasena who subsequently obeyed the kings call 
Nagasena pointed to his breast with his finger and said Yes only I know When King Menandros was about to invite him into his palace he opened up a small room the door of which was very low He was hoping to make Nagasena bend over and bow down to him But Nagasena knew that the king wanted to get the better of him So he refused to enter and he was not humbled 
King Menandros then prepared food and drink and he gave Nagasena all kinds of coarse food When Nagasena had eaten three or five spoonfuls he said that he had had enough 
When afterwards he was given delicious food he ate again The king asked him You said before that you had had enough Why do you still eat now Nagasena answered I had enough of the coarse food 
I have not had enough of the delicious food yet He then said to the king You might assemble many people in your hall now so that it is entirely full So they called people to fill up every part of it until there was no more space left 
The king came at last As he was about to enter the hall everyone drew in his belly out of fear The area became wider and wider so that there was room for many people 
Nagasena then said to the king Coarse food is like the common people Delicious food is like a king 
When people see the king who does not step out of  Chapter IX his way The king further asked Who obtains the path he who has gone forth or he who stays in his family Nagasena replied One may obtain the path in both cases The king then asked If one may obtain it in both cases why should one go forth Nagasena replied Suppose for example one sends an ablebodied man to go somewhere more than three thousand miles from here 
If one gives him a horse to ride and provisions and if he has a weapon will he be able to arrive quickly When the king said    b Yes Nagasena continued If one sends an old man and if one gives him a jaded horse to ride without any provisions will he be able to arrive The king said Even if one gave him provisions he probably still would not arrive let alone without any provisions Nagasena said When one who has gone forth obtains the path he is like the ablebodied person 
When one who stays in his family obtains the path he is like that old man The king further asked I would like to ask you now about my person Is the self permanent or impermanent 
Give me a satisfactory reply Nagasena replied with the question When for instance O king there are fruits on the amra tree in your palace are they sweet or sour The king said There is no such tree in my palace at all 
Since all five aggregates are specifically without a self why ask me if the self is permanent or impermanent The king then further asked Although in the hells swords cut up the body and disperse it everywhere its life is still preserved 
Is this really the case Nagasena replied When for instance a woman eats cakes meat melons and vegetables all the food is digested 
When she becomes with child at the moment a kalala  it is still like fine dust 
Nagasena replied In the hells it is through the power of karma too that life is preserved The king further asked When the sun is high it stays basically the same 
Why is it very hot in summer and very cold in winter 
In summer days are long and in winter the days are  Parable  short Nagasena answered On Mount Sumeru there is a higher and a lower path In summer the sun takes the higher path The road is longer and the run is slower It reflects on the golden mountains 
In winter the sun takes the lower path The road is shorter and the run is faster It reflects on the waters of the oceans Therefore it does not take so long and it is very cold Parable  
A Woman Lacking in Filial Piety Wants to Harm Her MotherinLaw but She Kills Her Husband Once there was a woman whose disposition was perverse She did not abide by the rules of propriety In all her words and actions she was constantly in opposition to her motherinlaw She was angrily reprimanded by her motherinlaw and was always resentful 
Her anger grew and grew and she plotted to kill her motherinlaw When later she had devised a plan she told her husband to kill his mother himself 
Her husband was foolish and he accepted his wifes words So he led his mother to a deserted place He tied her hands and feet and was going to do her harm 
The seriousness of the crime deeply moved the heavens above Clouds gathered in the four quarters and brought forth a crash of thunder striking the son dead 
When the mother returned home the wife opened the gate Thinking that it was her husband she asked Is the killing over yet The motherinlaw answered that it was over 
Only the next c day did she know that her husband was dead 
Such was his immediate retribution for his unfilial crime He afterwards went to hell and experienced immeasurable suffering Parable  
The King of Benares Hears Calls from the Cemetery If one has recourse to appropriate means everything may be obtained provided that it may be sought for 
If it must not be  Chapter IX sought for it cannot be obtained at all no matter how badly one wants to obtain it 
It is like crushing sand to press out oil or trying to obtain ghee by collecting water Since it cannot be obtained one toils in vain 
In the land of Benares there once was a king called Brahmayasas Late at night he used to hear a voice calling from the cemetery crying O king 
 king He heard the voice three times each night 
When the king heard the strange voice he was extremely disturbed The voice did not stop but went on for a long time 
The king assembled the Brahmans his astronomers and his diviners and he discussed it with them saying Every night I hear a voice calling me from the cemetery I always panic I dare not respond out of fear They all answered There is surely a phantom in the cemetery that makes that sound 
You should send a courageous person to the cemetery to have a look So the king made an appeal If someone will go to the cemetery at night I shall reward him with five hundred pieces of gold At that time there was someone who was orphaned being fatherless His family was destitute but he had great courage 
Wearing armor and holding a sword in his hand he went to the cemetery at night 
I have constantly called the king at night If the king would respond to me I would like to go to his storehouse 
We shall arrive at your house tomorrow at dawn The one who had been summoned asked When you come tomorrow with what shall I welcome you Sarikha answered Just clean up the house and remove any refuse 
He asked for his five hundred pieces of gold from the king and then a used them to prepare the offerings 
The king asked him What was that voice The one who had been summoned deceivingly replied that it was a demon 
When the one who had been summoned heard Sahkhas words he was personally delighted He summoned a barber in order to take care of his appearance 
When the next day arrived his offerings were ready There were eight men of the path who came for their nourishment 
He urged the others one after the other to go  and they became eight vessels full of gold 
Through an opening in the gate the barber saw that his neighbor had obtained these treasures He silently thought to himself I understand this method 
I shall try it out He then made preparations as the other man had done and he invited eight men of the path After he had prepared the food he closed the gate and covered the windows He knocked the senior man over the head expecting to get an accumulation of valuables just as had the man who had been summoned 
But the head of this man of the path was smashed and hk blood was dripping soaking his bedding and seating The barber urged him to go to a corner but he was overcome with fear and lost consciousness 
One by one all seven were beaten and they rolled about on the floor Among them there was one whose strength was very great He immediately seized the barber by the hand pushed him outside and cried out shouting Our host wants to harm us The king then sent someone to have a look 
The barber then made a complete statement to the king of what had happened 
The king subsequently sent someone to the house of the one who had been summoned Seeing the treasure of gold he wanted to tax it fully but it changed into a poisonous snake and that changed to a mass of fire 
This is your merit This also applies to ordinary people in the world Through strenuous perseverance and maintaining the eight precepts one obtains a wholesome recompense By gradually practicing the eightfold right  one obtains a pure fruition 
Even should someone else wish to imitate you and maintain the eight precepts or if he has no true faith within himself and seeks for happiness not only will he not obtain a wholesome fruition but he will suffer a calamity just like that foolish man 
An Aged Bhiksu Obtains the Four Fruitions The Buddhas Doctrine is vast and it saves without any limit If one earnestly strives for the path one is sure to obtain its fruition Even though one is ridiculed ones merit is not lost 
For instance once in the past there was an aged bhiksu whose years had decayed and whose spirit was dull Seeing the young bhiksus expound the Doctrine in various ways he heard their exposition of the four fruitions and was full of admiration He said to the young bhiksus You are clever 
I wish you would give me the four fruitions Every young bhiksu mockingly said I have the four fruitions I need delicious food 
Only then shall I give them b When the aged bhiksu heard these words he was happy inside He took off his kambala and bartered it for what they needed He thereupon served the young bhiksus all kinds of delicacies and asked them for the four fruitions 
When the young bhiksus had eaten the food they poked each other and said playing with the aged bhiksu Venerable one sit down in a comer of this house 
We shall give you the fruitions When the aged bhiksu had heard this he was glad He sat down as they had told him to 
The young bhiksus hit his head with a felt ball and said to him This is the fruition of a srotapanna 
 When the aged bhiksu heard this his concentrated mindfulness was not disturbed So he obtained the first fruition 
 Parable  The young bhiksus further played with him and said We have given you the fruition of a srotapanna so you still have seven births and seven deaths yet 
Change to another comer and we shall give you the fruition of a sakrdagamin As he had obtained the first fruition the aged bhiksus thoughts then gradually advanced So he changed his seat 
The young bhiksus again hit his head with a ball and said to him We give you the second fruition The aged bhiksu then increased his concentrated mindfulness and realized the second fruition 
The young bhiksus further played with him and said You have obtained the fruition of a sakrdagamin now You still have the adversity of coming and going in birth and death Change your seat again and we shall give you the fruition of an anagaminV The aged bhiksu then changed his seat as they had said 
The young bhiksus again hit his head with a ball and said to him We now give you the third fruition When he heard this the aged bhiksu was glad and doubled his concentration He immediately realized the fruition of an anagamin 
The young bhiksus further played with him and said You have obtained the fruition of a nonreturner now but you will still experience an impure body in the realms of form and formlessness Impermanent and deteriorating it will cause constant suffering Change your seat again and we shall further give you the fruition of an arhat The aged bhiksu then changed his seat as he was told to 
The young bhiksus again hit his head with a felt ball and said to him We now give you the fourth fruition The aged bhiksu then reflected in concentration and realized arhatship 
Having obtained the fourth fruition he was absolutely delighted Preparing delicacies and all kinds of fragrant flowers he invited the young bhiksus and showed his gratitude He discussed with the young bhiksus the pure qualities contributing to awakening 
However the young bhiksus were at a loss for what to say 
Only then did the aged bhiksu tell them I have realized the fruition of an arhat When the young bhiksus heard these words they were all sorry for their previous misdeed for having ridiculed him 
Therefore practitioners should be mindful of what is wholesome Even  Chapter IX when ridiculed one may still obtain a fruitful recompense 
How much more so when in concentration Parable  A Woman Is Utterly Sincere and Obtains the Fruition of the Path c If one strives for the path one should be zealous and sincere When one is moved by zeal and sincerity one can obtain the fruition of the path 
For instance there once was a woman who was intelligent and wise She deeply believed in the Triple Jewel She used to invite a bhiksu according to the order of the Sangha to go to her house so that she could worship him 
There was an aged bhiksu then who came to her house when it was his turn He was old and his faculties were dull He was simply ignorant 
Once when he had finished his meal there that woman asked the aged bhiksu Expound the Doctrine to me She spread out a seat for herself closed her eyes and remained silent 
The aged bhiksu then knew that he was ignorant He did not know how to expound the Doctrine He watched her closed eyes left her and returned to his temple 
But this woman realized in her concentration that the formed elements are impermanent painful void unable to be selfexistent In her profound contemplation she obtained the first fruition 
When she had obtained the fruition she asked for the aged bhiksu and wanted to show her gratitude 
This aged bhiksu knew that he was ignorant that he had left her and fled He felt twice as ashamed and he again abandoned her and hid 
But when this woman did not stop earnestly looking for him he showed up 
The woman then fully discussed how she had experienced the fruition of the path Therefore she presented him with an offering to show her immense gratitude 
Because he was ashamed the aged bhiksu deeply blamed himself In this way he obtained his own fruition That is why a practitioner should be zealous 
If he is zealous he will certainly obtain what he strives for 
King Udayana Rahula A Old Brahman Is Duped A Brahmans Wife Wants to Harm Her MotherinLaw The Crows and the Owls Avenge Their Grievances Parable  A Maidservant Fights with a Goat Chapter X Parable  King Udayana a Formerly King Udayana lived in the city of Roruka He was intelligent and perspicacious 
The beauty of his first wife called Syamavati was extraordinary Her behavior was also virtuous The king respected her dearly and she was his absolute favorite 
It was a rule in that country then that no king could play the lute himself 
But his wife then presumed on being the favorite and said to the king Please play the lute for me 
I shall dance for you  king The king could not decline her wish He took his lute and played His wife immediately raised her hands and danced 
The king had always been versed in physiognomy Seeing his wife dance he noticed that she was marked for death He then put aside his lute and gave a deep sad sigh 
His wife said to the king I enjoy your special favor now I have ventured to ask you in our inner room O king to play the lute and I have started dancing so that we might enjoy ourselves Did  do something wrong that you put aside your lute and sighed 
 king please do not conceal anything but tell me The king then answered My deep sigh was not for you to hear my wife His wife said As I serve you now O king my utter sincerity is unparalleled 
How could I appear to feel different toward you When you started dancing a while ago the mark of death was externally visible When I calculate the remainder of your life it is not more than seven days 
That is why I put aside my lute and sighed When his wife heard this she felt extreme sorrow and she said to the king If it is as you have said that my life will not be long  have heard the bhiksuni Saila explain that if one can go forth with devout thoughts for one day one will certainly obtain rebirth in heaven 
For this reason I want to go forth 
Please give me your permission O king and I can be on my way The feelings of the king were very affectionate then and his love was unremitting He said to his wife When the sixth day is here I shall allow you to go  Parable  forth and enter the path 
I shall not decline your wish So when the sixth day came the king said to his wife You have wholesome thoughts wanting to go forth 
Only shall I give you my permission and let you go forth When she promised she received his permission and could go forth and experience the observance of the eight precepts That same day she drank too great a quantity of honey syrup and suffered from intestinal convulsions On the morning of the seventh day her life ended 
Because of her good karmic causality she was reborn in heaven Then she wondered about three things The first was about the past What body had she had 
The second was about her previous karmic causality What merit had she developed 
The third was about the present She decidedly had the body of a goddess 
Having come to this conclusion she knew fully about her previous karmic causality and her vow to the king Because of the vow she had made   b she came to the king 
At that moment light filled the kings palace on all sides The king then asked Who is this bright sign for 
Please explain it for me Then the goddess answered I am your wife Lady Syamavati When the king heard these words he wanted her to come and sit down but the goddess replied As I am now I see you as offensive  king and unapproachable 
I have come to see you because of my previous vow O king When the king had heard this his mind understood and he spoke these words Now this goddess formerly was my wife Because she had wholesome thoughts wanting to enter the path she went forth for one day and subsequently her life ended Because of this merit she was reborn in heaven 
Why should I not go forth now 
I have heard it said that one fingernail of a god has the value of Jambudvipa 
It is nothing to have regrets about Having said these words he installed his son Senaraja to succeed him on the royal throne He went forth applied himself to the path and obtained arhatship 
 Chapter X Then the king Senaraja ruled over the land and he trusted artful talk He felt nothing for state matters Ring Udayana felt pity for his son and for the people of the land He wanted to come and convert them urging them to develop goodness 
Ring Senaraja heard that his father was about to arrive and his joy was immeasurable He wanted to order everyone to go out to the roadside and welcome him 
His deceitful ministers were afraid of being sent away then so they said to the king You wear the celestial crown on your head now O king and you sit on the Lion Throne According to the law it is impossible for two people to sit on the Lion Throne 
If you welcome the king your father he will again take up his royal position He will surely kill you O king 
If you remain king it is necessary to harm the king your father Ring Senaraja then felt distressed His uncertainty grew and grew When their remonstrating did not stop an evil idea came to his mind He summoned a candala to go and kill his father 
When the candala received the summons he went to where the king the father was He bowed his head and said to him In the past I have received your favors I really do not have any feelings of betrayal toward you old king but I have been sent to kill you now O old king 
If I do not do you harm I shall certainly be punished with death The old king replied I am coming now to convert your king 
How could I be so fond of myself as to let you be put to death He stretched his neck so that it was more than a hundred feet long and he said to the candala Go ahead and chop it off The candala then tried to chop it off with all his strength but the sword could not wound it 
Because the old king felt pity he lent the candala his supernatural power and said to him Go and tell your king this for me now You have killed your father and you have furthermore harmed an arhat You have committed two deadly sins If you are quite repentant you may wipe away your c sins Then after the candala had received this instruction he raised his sword to cut again 
He cut off the old kings head and took it back to his country 
Ring Senaraja saw his fathers head the color of which had not changed and he knew that his father had obtained the path He  Parable  did not want the position of king 
After his remorse had arisen he felt regretful He cried and fainted After quite some time he regained consciousness and asked the candala what the king his father had said 
The candala then told the king what the old king had told him to Since you have killed your father and you have furthermore harmed an arhat you have committed two deadly sins 
You will have to be quite repentant When he had heard these words was twice as torn and he said The king my father had obtained arhatship What desire would he have for a country 
But they made me kill my father The deceitful ministers were afraid then that the king would harm them and they said to the king How can there be arhats in the world 
O king you believe in hollow words and you torment yourself with them The king then replied My fathers head has been dead for many days now but its color has not changed If he had not obtained the path how could this have come about 
Furthermore in the time of my father the great ministers Tisya and Upatisya both went forth and obtained arhatship We have seen their various miracles Upon their nirvana people collected their bones and erected pagodas that are in existence now 
How could you say that do not exist The deceitful ministers answered Magic in the world and incantations and also the power of medicinal herbs can do miracles too 
Those two ministers were no arhats 
After a few days we shall show you proof Having said these words they made two holes by the pagodas and placed a cat in each of them They fed them at the pagodas When they called Tisya come a cat came out to eat the meat When they told it to go back it went back into the hole 
When they had instructed them in that way the cats were trained So the ministers said to the king Do you want to see Tisya and the other now O king 
Please let us go and have a look together The king ordered his carriage and went to the pagodas 
Those deceitful ministers then called Tisya come out A cat came out of a hole When they told it to go back the cat went back into the hole 
When the king saw this his confusion was complete He confidently made up his mind and did not believe in punishment or merit 
 Chapter X The king then went out with his army on an excursion When he returned he saw the Venerable Katyayana on his way he was sitting in meditation and had entered concentration 
Then the king saw him and had an evil thought He took some earth in his hand and covered the venerable one with it He said to those around him Each of you cover Katyayana with earth for me Thereupon the reverend was buried under a heap of earth 
There was an important minister who had faith in the Triple Jewel He arrived later and when he heard about this matter he was extremely distressed 
So he removed the earth from the    a reverend and said to everyone If anyone cares for me remove this earth The reverend was sitting in a jeweled cavity of lapis lazuli 
His divine bearing looked fresh and he did not look dirtied The important minister was glad and bowed at his feet He said to the reverend The king is unprincipled now committing this evil misdeed Good and evil will surely be repaid 
How can he be free from calamity The reverend answered After seven days it will rain earth It will fill this city and pile up into a mountain of earth The king and the people will all be covered and perish When the great minister heard this he felt sad and he told the king about it 
He also devised a plan to make a tunnel that ended outside the city 
When the seven days were over it rained fragrant flowers precious jewels and clothes In the city there was none who was not glad The deceitful ministers said to the king These lucky signs now all come because of your virtue However an ignorant person has slandered you saying that it would rain earthInstead we get precious jewels 
The circumstances do not agree with such deception When the people with unwholesome karmic causality heard that there was a lucky sign they all gathered together like clouds 
Then at the four gates of the city the iron barriers were all lowered by some obscure power There was nowhere to escape or hide It then rained earth filling the city and piling up like a mountain 
But the great minister left through the tunnel together with those he cared for He went to the reverend and said to him I am moved when I think that this city is covered up in one day The earth that  Parable  has rained has become a mountain The lord and his people have lost their lives 
I shall tell you 
In the past many kalpas ago there was the daughter of an elder in that country She lived on an upper storey While she was cleaning at the break of day she was getting rid of the filth she was sweeping and it fell on the head of a bhiksu She did not feel any remorse 
All the women then asked her How have you obtained this fine husband The daughter then answered I have done nothing but to sweep the upper storey letting the dust fall on a bhiksus head 
For that reason I happen to have met my fine husband When the women heard this they thought it was as she had said and they competed in making piles of dust to throw on bhiksus 
For this karmic reason they all received this retribution Having said these words he went to the city of Pataliputra together with Punyatara 
Ever since antiquity the city of Roruka and that city have alternately prospered and decayed When one city was ruined the other city prospered Therefore the reverend and the others went to Pataliputra The elder Ghosila worshipped the reverend at the border 
The elder had always been wealthy but when the reverend reached his house his riches became more abundant than before 
After he had reached the city the Reverend   b Katyayana said to the Buddha For what reason does the Reverend Ghosila have his nice voice 
His enormous wealth is immeasurable and his riches still increase The Buddha said Once a long time ago there was an elder who every day sent someone to ask five hundredpratyekabuddhas to come to his house and to prepare a meal 
That messenger usually went with his dog 
As he happened to have some business or other he could not go to invite them 
The dog went alone to the monastery at the usual time and he barked at the Sangha 
The pratyekabuddhas then said Laymen have many things to do They tend to forget when it is too difficult for them but the dog just came barking to call us So they all went to the elders house 
 Chapter X The elder was absolutely delighted at that moment and he worshipped according to the rules 
The elder at that time was myself 
The messenger at that time was Aniruddha 
The dog at that time was the elder Ghosila 
That is why in every existence he has a fine voice and plenty of riches 
Therefore a wise one must diligently worship the fields of merit Parable  
Rahula Thus have I heard Just on the night when the Buddha went forth Rahula the Buddhas son first entered the womb 
The bodhisattva Siddhartha practiced austerities for six years Underneath the bodhi tree he subdued the four Maras removed the hindrances and suddenly had great insight realizing the unsurpassed path He was endowed with the ten powers and the four fearlessnesses he accomplished the eighteen special qualities and was endowed with the four analytical knowledges By way of all the perfections he had reached the other shore 
Rahula was born just on the night when Sakyamuni realized the path All the ladies in the whole palace were ashamed They were very distressed and said Uncanny indeed is this great evil Yasodhara did not mind whether it was right or wrong 
The bodhisattva Siddhartha has long ago gone forth but all of a sudden she now gives birth to this son 
It is very shameful There was a Sakya woman called Vidyut the daughter of Yasodharas mothers sister Beating her breast and slapping her thighs she angrily scolded her Yasodhara you are loved by the reverend one 
Why did you commit this outrage It is already six years since the crown prince Siddhartha has gone forth to apply himself to the path but you give birth to this little son It is very untimely Who did you obtain him from 
You are shameless  Parable  c bringing disgrace to our family You are not to be counted amongst our family since you do not protect us from a bad name 
The bodhisattva Siddhartha has great excellence His fame is known far and wide Why is it that you do not preserve it now but actually bring it to disgrace At that very moment King Suddhodana was in his lofty mansion 
He saw that the great earth was shaking in six directions and he saw unusual manifestations When King Suddhodana had seen these signs he thought that the bodhisattva had died and an arrow of sorrow hit his heart He became very distressed and he said The fragrance of my sons morality fills the four distances 
My son is like a tree trodden down by the elephant of death He is as big as the golden mountains adorned with a mi ititude of valuables My son is the king of the golden mountains His person adorned with the primary and secondary marks is destroyed by the thunderbolt of impermanence 
He is like the great ocean filled with a multitude of treasures Like the waters of the ocean disturbed by a makara fish so it is with the ocean of my son disturbed by the makara fish of death 
He looks like the full moon surrounded by the stars So it is with my son surrounded by immeasurable qualities and adorned with the primary and secondary marks Now he is swallowed by Rahu who means impermanence 
The present day must not interrupt my lineage I had hoped indeed that my son might be a noble Wheelturning King or that he might complete a Buddhas path I would rather die now 
If I lose my son my life wracked  Chapter X with grief and distress will certainly not be preserved I had hoped that he would go forth and attain immortality donning the robe of the Law and holding the alms bowl I most certainly shall not see such things 
Because he thought of his son he experienced all kinds of anxious thoughts and considered things to be as he imagined 
Then he heard people raise their voices crying loudly in the palace The king was twice as startled thinking that the crown prince had died He asked a maidservant who was passing by What is this crying 
My son is not dead is he The maid said to the king The crown prince is not dead Yasodhara has just given birth to a son The whole palace is ashamed 
That is why they are crying When the king heard these words his anger grew and grew He raised his voice and wept bitterly crying out loudly in a high voice He called out Strange It is deeply disgraceful 
Six years have passed since my son left home 
How can she now give birth to a son It was a rule in the land that when one beat the drum once all armies would assemble When the ninetynine thousand Sakyas were all gathered he called Yasodhara 
Yasodhara then donned a white garment and clasped her son to her bosom She was not in the least afraid She had some stain on her face and she stood there among her own people holding her son in her arms 
Then a Sakya holding the staff changed color with anger and scolded Yasodhara 
You a have brought shame on our clan 
He was Yasodharas maternal uncle He said to Yasodhara Among the vile and foolish no one can surpass you 
I should speak the truth for the clan After all where did you get this son Yasodhara felt no shame at all She straightforwardly said From the Sakya by the name of Siddhartha who has gone forth 
From him did I obtain this son When King Suddhodana heard these words he was angry and he said Do not protect the one you have borne You conveniently  Parable  tell a lie Whether it is true or false is known to all Sakyas 
Even though my son Siddhartha had heard about the five objects of desire when he was in our family he still did not lend his ear to them Much less would he have lust and sire a son 
Such words are utterly indecent 
From whom did you obtain your son bringing us disgrace This is truly perverted and not the correct way 
When formerly my son Siddhartha was in his family he was not at all attached to any valuables or delicacies whatsoever How much less so now that he practices asceticism daily eating rice gruel With this denunciation King Suddhodana gave vent to his deep anger 
He asked the Sakyas How should she now suffer and be killed There was another Sakya who said I think we should make a fiery pit and throw them into the fire so that absolutely nothing is left of mother and child They all said that this was best 
So they dug a pit for a fire and piled up khadira wood in the pit and set fire to it They led Yasodhara to the brink of the fiery pit 
Only then did she become afraid having seen the fiery pit She was like a wild deer all alone in the park Looking in the four directions she saw no one to depend on 
Yasodhara then called out because she experienced this calamity without any wrongdoing on her part 
She looked around at the Sakyas but there was no one who would rescue her Hugging her child she gave a deep sigh Remembering the bodhisattva she said You have compassion commiserating with all Gods dragons and spirits all respect you 
We mother and child want for your protection We experience suffering having done no wrong Why  bodhisattva are we not given any attention 
Why do you not rescue us mother and child 
In our present peril there is neither god nor benevolent spirit who cherishes us 
O bodhisattva when you were among the Sakyas in the past you were like the full moon among the stars but now one cannot even catch one glimpse of you She immediately turned in the Buddhas direction and wholeheartedly paid her respects 
She further saluted the Sakyas joined her palms and turned toward the fire speaking the true words As for my son here I really do not have this child from anyone else If it is true and not false that  Chapter X he has stayed in my womb for six years the fire will be extin  b guished and never burn us mother and son Having said these words she went into the fire and the fiery pit changed into a pond She saw that she was placed on a lotus 
Because of my true words that this son here is really the bodhisattvas child I have escaped the calamity of fire There was then a Sakya who said When I look at her appearance she is neither startled nor afraid 
Deducing from this one must know that it is trueThere was another Sakya who said This fiery pit has changed to a clear pond 
This is proof enough to know that she is free from wrongdoing The Sakyas then led Yasodhara back to the palace and they were twice as respectful and full of praise They got a wet nurse for her to take care of her son just as with any other delivery 
The grandfather King Suddhodanas love was profound If he did not see Rahula he lost all appetite 
When he thought of the bodhisattva he took Rahula into his arms and dispersed his gloomy thoughts with him 
In short after six years King Suddhodana longed for the Buddha and sent a messenger to invite him 
Out of compassion the Buddha returned to his former country 
He came to the Sakya palace The Buddha changed into one thousand two hundred fifty bhiksus who all looked like the Buddha having the same luster 
Yasodhara said to Rahula Who is your father 
Go to him After Rahula had bowed to the Buddha he stood at the Tathagatas right side The Tathagata stroked Rahulas head with his hand which showed a wheel from the merits he had developed in countless kalpas The Sakyas then all thought The Buddha still has personal affection now The Buddha knew what the Sakyas were thinking and he spoke the stanzas 
He will go forth too again being my son in the Doctrine I shall briefly mention his qualities He will go forth and apply himself to the true path He will accomplish the fruition of arhatship 
An Old Brahman Is D uped All frauds deceivers and cheats outwardly look ordinary but c inwardly they are villainous That is why a wise one must ascertain other peoples rectitude 
For example long ago in the past there was a Brahman whose age was already advanced but who married a young wife The wife did not like it that her husband was aged Her licentiousness was unending 
When her desire had become manifest she urged her husband to organize a gathering inviting young Brahmans The husband suspected deceit and did not want to invite them in 
The young woman then devised all sorts of schemes to delude her husband 
When the son of the old Brahmans former wife fell into a fire the young woman saw it with her own eyes She let him fall and did not hold him back 
The Brahman said Why did you not seize my son when he fell into the fire just now His wife replied Since my youth I have only approached my own husband 
Why do you all of a sudden want me to lay my hands on this male child When the old Brahman heard these words he thought it was as she had said Because he trusted his wife he organized a great gathering in his house and assembled the Brahmans 
The young woman then had intercourse with them 
When the old Brahman heard about this he felt bitter So he took his valuables wrapped them in his clothes and left his wife 
When he was far away from home he saw a Brahman on his way and they became companions That evening they stayed together in one place At the break of day they went on together 
When they had left the house of their host and were leaving it  Chapter X behind the other Brahman said to the old one There is a leaf that got stuck to my clothes at the place where we spent the night yesterday Since I was a child I have not appropriated any worldly object I consider a leaf sticking to me to be an absolute disgrace I would like to go back to that host and return the leaf 
You stay here and wait for me to go there and back When the old Brahman heard these words he sincerely believed them and he became twice as reverential He promised he would stay and wait 
The other Brahman pretended that he wanted to take the leaf back to their host but he entered a ditch in the vicinity and lay down on his stomach After quite some time he went back and said that he had returned the leaf to the host 
The old Brahman trustingly thought it was true and his affection doubled 
As the moment was right for the old Brahman to wash and relieve himself he entrusted his valuables to his companion This person then took the valuables and ran off 
When the old Brahman saw that he had been robbed of his belongings he was saddened by that man and felt hurt Full of sorrow and distress he disappointedly continued on his way 
After walking for a while he rested underneath a tree and saw a stork It held a straw in its beak and said to the birds We should sympathize with each other come together in one place and stay a there together At that time the birds all believed its words and gathered together 
Then after the stork had urged all the other birds to be on their way it went to their nests pecked their eggs and drank the liquid It killed their offspring and ate them When the birds were about to arrive again took up a straw in its beak 
After the birds had returned they saw what had happened and they all angrily railed at the stork but it retorted I had nothing to do with it The birds knew then that it was full of deceit and they all left 
After had passed some more time under the tree he saw a heretic who had gone forth He was wearing a patched robe and walked quietly taking slow paces and calling out Out of my way you creatures The old Brahman asked him Why do you call out Out of my way as you walk along The  Parable  heretic answered I have gone forth 
That is why I call out When the Brahman saw the one who had gone forth speaking these words openly he had profound and genuine faith in him So he immediately followed him and went to his house 
Spending the night there said to the Brahman I need a solitary place in order to develop my thoughts 
Stay in another room and sleep there The Brahman was happy to hear that he would practice the path then and he felt joy 
Late after midnight he heard the sounds of music of singing and dancing So he went to have a look and he saw that in the room where the heretic who had gone forth was staying there was a pit in the floor A woman had come out of it to associate with him When the woman was dancing the heretic played the harp 
When he had seen this said to himself Among all beings in the world no matter whether they are men or animals there is not one you can trust He spoke the stanza 
She did not touch another man And he returned the leaf to his host The crane deceivingly held a straw in its beak And the heretic was afraid to hurt an insect The words of none of these cheats Can be trusted at all 
At that time there was an elder in the land who had great wealth in his home He had a large number of precious objects One night he lost a great deal of riches 
When the king heard this he asked the elder about his acquaintances in order to ascertain who might have caused the loss 
The elder informed the king I have never had anything to do with scoundrels There is only one Brahman who has long been coming and going He purifies his person and cleanses himself He would not offend against anyones possessions 
There has not been anyone else except him When the king had heard this he took hold of the Brahman and  Chapter X interrogated him 
The elder then went to inform the king That mans pure conduct is unequalled in the world How can he sudb denly be arrested I would rather lose my riches 
Please O king set him free The king then answered In the past I have heard that there are such cases Outwardly they feign purity but inwardly they harbor wickedness Do not fret Let me investigate the truthAfter he had said these words he immediately started his investigation 
Being at a loss for what to say and his arguments being clumsy confessed to the truth 
And so when a wise one dwells in the world he is like a mirror He is good at distinguishing true from false He is a guide in the world 
A Brahm ans Wife Wants to Harm H er M otherinLaw Once there was a Brahman whose wife was young Her beauty was dazzling and her lust was prodigious She would have liked to indulge in profligacy but because her motherinlaw was there she could not do as she wanted She secretly conceived a treacherous plot to harm her motherinlaw 
She piously pretended to take care of her in order to mislead her husbands mind From morning till dark she was very respectful providing for her so that she lacked nothing Her husband was glad and he said to his wife You take care of her now so you are a pious wife If my mother has reached old age it is because of your efforts The wife answered her husband I bring her worldly contributions now 
Is there a good way for her to somehow be reborn as a goddess The husband replied to his wife According to the rules of the Brahmans one may jump into an abyss of fire and be burnt by the five fires 
If one acts in this way one obtains rebirth in heaven The wife replied to her husband If my motherinlaw may be reborn in heaven this way and receive spontaneous  Parable  offerings why do we have to be so diligent in assuring that she receive our worldly offerings Upon her saying these words the husband believed them 
So he made a large pit of fire in the open country piled up plenty of firewood and made a big blaze At the pit he then arranged for a large gathering They supported his aged mother on her way there and convened all their relatives The whole crowd of Brahmans went to the gathering place 
When the guests had gone away husband and wife stayed alone with his mother They led her to the fiery pit and pushed her into it They went away without looking back 
In the fiery pit there was a ledge The mother fell on the ledge she did not fall into the fire after all 
The mother then came out of the pit As the day would soon come to an end she wanted to return home following the path she had come 
On her way she passed through a dense forest It was dark where she was and she was afraid of tigers and wolves raksasas and demons She climbed up a low tree in order to escape what she feared 
By chance a band of robbers who had stolen a great deal of riches gathered one after the other and rested underneath the tree 
The aged mother was afraid so afraid that she did not dare to move but she could not hold back and coughed 
When the robbers heard the sound of coughing they thought it was an evil demon left their riches behind and all ran off 
When daylight came the aged mother was calm and composed Without any fear she immediately came down from the tree She picked out some valuables fragrant necklaces pearls golden bracelets pearly pendants all kinds of genuine and wonderful c objects and she went home carrying a full load 
When the husband and his wife saw the mother they were startled and terrified They thought she was a vetala demon 
As they did not venture to come closer the mother said After my death I was reborn in heaven and obtained a great deal of riches She said to the wife The fragrant necklaces pearls golden bracelets and pearly pendants are gifts to you from your parents aunts and sisters 
Because of my old age  Chapter X and weakness I could not carry more 
She wanted to jump into a fiery pit just as had her motherinlaw and she said to her husband Because my aged motherinlaw has jumped into a fiery pit now she has obtained these riches Because her strength is weak she could not carry more 
If I go I shall certainly obtain more The husband made a fiery pit for her just as she had said She jumped in and was consumed She immediately vanished forever 
The gods then spoke the stanza A man towards honored ones Must have no evil thoughts Just as a wife wanting to harm her motherinlaw Was burned and destroyed herself instead 
Parable  The Crows and the Owls Avenge Their Grievances Once the crows and the owls were each others enemies 
The crows waited for daytime and knowing that the owls could not see trampled the owls to death and devoured their flesh 
The owls knew that at night the crows eyes were in darkness and they pecked at the crows pierced their bellies open and ate them 
The fears of the day and the fears of the night never ended 
There was a clever crow then among the other crows who said to the crows We are enemies and if we do not seek a solution we shall finally massacre one another It is impossible for both of us to be saved We should find a means to exterminate the owls Only then can we be happy 
If this does not happen we shall finally be defeated The crows replied It is as you say 
What means should we devise to obtain the destruction of our enemies The clever crow answered You crows just peck at me and pull out my  Parable  feathers Peck up my head I shall devise a plan to exterminate them So they did as he said 
His appearance haggard from anxiety he lamented outside the nesting place of the owls 
One owl heard his voice and came out and asked Why do you now come to us your head mauled and your feathers ruined suffering bitterly and uttering lamentations 
What do you want to tell us The crow said to the owl The crows hate me and I cannot stay alive 
That is why I have come to give myself up to you so that I may escape their enmity The owl felt compassion then and wanted to keep and feed him but the other owls all said This is our enemy 
Why would you feed him to prolong his enmity The owl then replied a Because he is in great distress he has come here to call on us All by himself and alone what harm could he possibly do Consequently he fed him and regularly gave him remnants of meat 
As days and months gradually passed the crows feathers gradually grew back and he pretended to be happy but he secretly devised a plan He carried dry branches grasses and wood and placed them in the owls nest as if to show his gratitude 
The owl said to the crow Why do you do this The crow replied There are nothing but cold stones in your nest I use these grasses and wood in order to keep out the wind and coldThe owl thought that that was right 
He kept his silence and did not reply 
Thereupon the crow asked to take care of the nest In his deceit he was given the task so that he might show his gratitude for the support given to him 
Then there happened to be a severe snowstorm and the cold was bitter The owls came together in the nest in a flurry The crow saw his chance and rejoiced He brought a herdsmans fire and set fire to the owls nest with it 
The gods then spoke the stanza Wherever there is an old grudge One should not have confidence The crow for instance pretended to do good But he burned the owls to death  Chapter X Parable  
A M aidservant Fights w ith a Goat There once was a maidservant whose disposition was honest 
She used to be in charge of her masters barley and beans In her masters home there was a goat that looking for a way out ate the barley 
As the number of pecks was diminished the maid faced her masters anger 
It was all eaten by the goat For this reason the maid had a constant dislike of the goat Every time she was beaten with the rod she then beat the goat with it 
The goat cherished anger too and it came to butt the maid Thus they offended each other many times 
One day the maid was emptyhanded when lighting the fire The goat saw that she did not have a rod and it came straight at the maid to butt her Because the maid was in difficulty she put the fire she had lighted on the goats back 
As the goat was burned by the fire it rushed against everything and set fire to the villagers all the way up to the mountain wilds 
At that moment there were five hundred monkeys in the mountains When the fire came it was a big blaze and they could not escape So they were all immediately burnt to death by the fire 
When the gods saw this they spoke the stanza Amidst anger and strife One must not stay When the goat and the maid quarrelled The villagers and the monkeys died 

To his thinking the food would be so much better if he took a great deal of salt Then this stupid and ignorant man ate it on an empty stomach Afterwards he had his palate out of order and fell ill 
The heretics having learned that abstaining from food and drink might lead to the path of Enlightenment immediately fasted for seven or fifteen days They merely got fatigued and famished accomplishing nothing in terms of Enlightenment 
Those heretics are just like that stupid man who on account of the pleasant flavor that the salt enhanced ate salt on an empty stomach only to lose all tastes  
THE STUPID MAN STORES UP MILK Once upon a time there was a stupid man who was about to give a party He wanted to store up milk for his guests If I milk the cow beforehand every day he thought little by little there will be too much of milk and will not be enough space to store it and it may even spoil 
I'll milk the cow right away at the time of the party He then separated the cow from the calf and tied them up apart 
A month later he actually gave the reception He tried to milk the cow but the milk had run dry 
Some guests got annoyed and others laughed at him 
So are the idiotic fellows who want to give alms at once but prefer to wait until they possess great wealth 
It usually happens that before they can scrape together enough money it is seized by the country officers or taken away by robbers and thieves or by fire and flood It also happens that due to their sudden demise they are not in time for giving alms 
THE HEAD IS BROKEN WITH PEARS Once upon a time there was a baldheaded man who was bit in his head by a few pears thrown at him He forbore taking the blows without knowing that he should have tried to dodge them 
A bystander asked the man Why didn't you dodge the blows that wounded your head The man answered Proudly relying upon doing violence to others and being short of intelligence he the attacker took my baldhead for a stone 
That's why he struck me with pears and broke my head like that The bystander retorted It's you who are indeed short of intelligence 
How can you call him stupid 
Haven't you been stupid enough to get injured without the sense to run away So is the monk who unable to abide discipline meditation and wisdom keeps only a good appearance to expect support He is just like that stupid man who got as far as wounded on the head without knowing to run away and called the attacker stupid into the bargain 
THE WIFE PRETENDS TO BE DEAD Once upon a time there was a stupid man who loved very much his beautiful wife 
In the meantime she associated herself surreptitiously with another man Burning with lecherous passions she wanted to leave her husband to be with her lover She secretly told an old woman After my departure I would like you to place a woman's corpse in my house You then tell my husband that I'm dead The old woman did what she was told 
She told the husband shortly after his return that his wife passed away 
He went to see the corpse and believed it was that of his own wife He grieved and wept bitterly He gathered a great deal of wood and oil together for the cremation Then he put the ashes into a bag and had it with him day and night 
She came back and told her husband I'm your wife The husband answered My wife died a long time ago Who are you to lie to me that you are my wife The husband refused to believe her in spite of her repeated explanations 
So are the heretics who having learned the heretical doctrine confusedly stick to it with all their soul and take the doctrine to be the right one without altering their mind forever Thus they will be unable to believe accept or keep any other creed even it is an orthodox one 
GETTING THIRSTY ON SEEING WATER Once there was a fellow desperately in need of water for his thirst 
A bystander asked You are suffering from thirst How that you have found water why don't you drink it The fellow answered If I could drink up all that water I would do it 
Since there is more water than I can finish I would rather not drink it at all As soon as people heard this they laughed aloud at him The heretics acting against all senses and reasons think since they are unable to keep all the Buddhist commandments they refuse to accept any of them They will never attain the path of Enlightenment and thus subject to transmigration in time to come They are just like that stupid thirsty fellow who gets laughed at by his contemporaries 
THE DEAD SON IS ABOUT TO REMAIN IN THE HOUSE Once upon a time there was a man who brought up seven boys one of whom died 
Finding the son dead he intended to leave the body in the house and moved out himself 
A bystander said to him You know the living and the dead go separate ways Since your son is dead he should be quickly buried in a far away place with all due solemnity 
He then thought he would have to kill another son to hang one body on each end of the pole to keep in equilibrium and carry them for burial in a long way off the forest 
His contemporaries laughed aloud at his unprecedented eccentricities 
A monk who secretly broke one commandment felt afraid to confess it He would pretend that he had scrupulously kept all commandments and led a life free from evil and defilement Some wise men might then tell him A monk should keep the commandments just like brilliant pearls should be protected from being damaged How can you break what you have accepted 
Now you are reluctant to confess them The offender would answer Now that I have to confess I might as well do more breakings 
Then I'll confess all my sins at once Consequently he broke more commandments by doing many evil things before his confession 
This monk is just like that stupid man who kills another son when one dies 
ONE RECKONS ANOTHER MAN TO BE ONE'S ELDER BROTHER Once upon a time there was a man endowed with a respectable appearance and intelligence as well as wealth 
Another man then claimed this man to be his elder brother 
He did so because of the man's wealth When he needed money he called the man elder brother 
After the rich man paying his debt he stopped calling him elder brother 
A bystander asked You are a strange man 
When you are in need of money you call him elder brother 
When he is in debt you will not Why The man answered When I want to get at his money I'll call him elder brother As a matter of fact he isn't my own elder brother 
The heretics who have heard the good words of Buddhism purloin and make use of them as their own When people try to teach them how to practice the goods words they do not want to listen They declared that they use the good words of Buddhism to instruct the other people in order to earn a living There is no need that they should bother to know how to practice it 
Those heretics are just like the stupid man who calls the rich man elder brother for his money 
A RUSTIC STEALS CLOTHES FROM THE PALACE TREASURY Once upon a time there was a rustic who stole garments from the palace and then escaped to a remote place 
The king sent men to search for him in all directions 
Finally he was arrested and taken to the king who accused him of theft and asked him where he had got the clothes The rustic answered that they belonged to his grandfather 
The king then ordered him to put them on He did not know how to wear them He put on his arms what should be worn on his legs What he ought to have on his waist he put on his head 
Seeing this the king summoned his ministers for consultation on the matter If the clothes belonged to your grandfather you should know how to wear them How can you wear them in all wrong ways 
It's certain that they are not your old clothes 
Figuratively speaking here the king is like Buddha the valuable clothes the Buddhist teachings the stupid rustic the heretic A heretic who has eavesdropped on Buddhism makes it for his own He then misinterprets it because he does not know the real meaning of its teachings 
This heretic is like the rustic who stole the king's valuable clothes without knowing how to wear them properly and put them on in all the wrong ways 
THE FATHER'S VIRTUES ARE PRAISED Once upon a time there was a man who praised his father's virtues before everybody My father is compassionate He neither kills nor steals 
At the time it so happened that a stupid man heard those words and declared My father is more virtuous than yours The others asked In what way he is more virtuous' 
Please tell us about him The man answered Undefiled as my father was he gave up completely his sexual desires when he was young 
There are those ignorant people in the world who want to extol the merits of others without knowing how to be realistic and get ridiculed instead These people are just like that stupid man who wanted to praise his father but turned out to speak fatuously 
THREE STORIED HOUSE Once there was an ignorant rich man who one day went to another rich man's threestoried house Struck with admiration by the imposing spacious airy and well lighted building he said to himself I'm no less rich than he 
Why don't I have the same house built as this one Thereupon he sent for a carpenter and said Can you construct an imposing house exactly like that one That carpenter replied It's I who built that one He went on Now you may build a house like that one for me The carpenter began first to level the ground afterward laid the foundation stones and then drove in piles for walls 
He askedWhat are you doing now The carpenter replied I'm building three floors The stupid man went on I don't want the two floors below 
You had better start building from the third floor for me The carpenter answered It's impossible If I don't begin with the ground floor how can I build the second 
If I don't build the two below how can I build the third floor The stupid man persisted saying But I don't need the two floors below only the top Hearing those words his contemporaries sardonically laughed at him 
Sakyamuni's four degrees of disciples who are unable to practice earnestly Buddhism and respect the Three Precious Ones wanted to attain the path of deliverance by leading an idle life They said We don't need the first three degrees below but seek only that of Arahant's There was no difference between the stupid rich man and those disciples who were also laughed at by their contemporaries 
THE BRAHMAN KILLS HIS SON Once upon a time there was a Brahman who prided himself on his erudite knowledge of astrology and various arts He was such a conceited man that he claimed to be learned in everything To show his ability he went abroad carrying his son in his arms and cried 
The Brahman was asked Why are you crying He replied This baby is going to die within seven days I'm grieved at his inevitable death 
That's why I can't help crying The contemporaries said It's difficult to know a man's life It's easy to make a miscalculation He may not die seven days 
Why should you weep in advance The Brahman said The sun and the moon may set and the stars may fall but I have never had a miscalculation on my record To prove his selfclaimed knowledge he killed his son on the seventh day for the sake of fame and gain 
They all came to pay him homage and were heartily convinced that he deserved respect  
This is also true with those of Sakyamuni's four degrees of disciples who claim to have attained the path of Enlightenment for the sake of the material offerings from others They would try to fool people by killing an innocent man in order to deceitfully show the virtue of compassion Such disciples would be certainly doomed to limitless suffering in time to come just like the Brahman who wanted to prove the accuracy of his prophecy by killing his son and thus deceived people 
THE BOILED BLACK ROCK HONEY SYRUP Once upon a time a man was boiling black rockhoney syrup when a rich man came to his house 
He poured a little water into it and put it on a slow fire 
He then fanned it with a fan in the hope of cooling it 
A bystander addressed to him If you don't put out the fire below how can you cool it even though you keep on fanning People began to laugh at him 
This is like the heretics who will practice a little mortification by sleeping on thorny brambles without putting out the flames of annoyance As the five passions are still blazing within them there is no way for such people to become cool and quiet As a result they sardonically laughed at by the wise Moreover they will suffer affliction in their present lives and transmigration in the future 
COMMENTING ON SOMEONE'S QUICK TEMPER Once a group of people sat in a house commenting on someone as being of good virtue except for two faults First he was quicktempered Second he was impulsive 
At the time this man happened to pass by the door and heard the comment He entered the house grabbed the man who had criticized him and started to beat him 
Thereupon one bystander asked why he beat the man 
He replied When did I ever lose my temper or act impulsively 
That's why I have beaten him The bystander pointed out Your action at once demonstrates that you have often lost your temper and acted impulsively 
People who are addicted to drinking and other debaucheries when scolded by others strongly hate their critics in turn 
OFFERING THE GUIDE UP AS SACRIFICE TO GOD Once upon a time there was a group of merchants who wanted to go to the sea A guide was required They set out in quest of such a man After finding such a man they started the trip and saw a temple when they reached a land of wilderness 
The only one fit to be sacrificed was the guide 
After performing the rites they soon lost their way and knew not which direction to go They then died one after another 
So are the people in general Those who seek to fish for treasure in the sea of Dharma should keep the commandments of doing good deeds as their guide 
If they break them they will end their lives in the wilderness and can never be rescued Furthermore they will have to go through the Three Evil Paths of Transmigration and suffer forever and ever Such men are just like the group of merchants who killed the guide and died in a body as a result 
THE PHYSICIAN GIVES MEDICINE TO THE PRINCESS TO MADE HER GROW UP FAST Once upon a time there was a king who brought a daughter into the world 
He sent for the doctor and asked him Could you prescribe some drugs for my daughter in order to make her grow up faster The physician replied I have a good prescription for her 
Your Majesty must not see her at the time of my searching for the medicine 
I'll present her to your Majesty after she has taken it Then the physician went to a remote region in search of the medicine He found it and came back twelve years later Having taken the medicine the daughter was led to the king who was happy to see her Then he said to himself He's a good physician 
All the courtiers derided the king for his ignorance to such an extent that he did not know to think of the year in which his daughter was born The king believed that her growing was due to the effect of the medicine 
So are the people in general They will visit a wise man and say We should like to attain the path of Enlightenment 
Please instruct us that we may immediately receive the transcendent wisdom By means of expediency the master will guide them to practice meditation and contemplate the Twelve Links connected with the causation of rebirth 
Our great master you have made us obtain so quickly the quintessential truth WATER THE SUGAR CANE Once upon a time two men who cultivated sugarcane pledged that the one who had a good harvest would win prizes while the one with a bad harvest would be heavily penalized 
One of them thought The sugarcane itself is very sweet It will be more delicious if I water it with its compressed juice Then I will get the upper hand over him Immediately he began to press the juice from the sugarcane 
He watered the plant with the juice in the hope of making it more delicious Instead he destroyed the seedling and lost his entire plantation 
Those who wish for the comforts of life use their high positions and great influence to oppress the mass They steal others' possessions as their own wealth to do good works with a view to enjoy better life afterwards However they are unaware of the calamities which are to come upon them Those people are just like the man who pressing the sugar cane lost everything 
A DEBT OF HALF A CENT Once a merchant lent half a cent to a man who then took a long time repaying him 
To go there he had to pay two cents as ferry fare to cross a wide river The debtor was not at home when he arrived there On his trip back he had to pay as much again 
So are the people at large To seek a little fame and gain people will spare no pains to bring ruin upon what should be their greater concern They seek selfpreservation at the expense of morality Consequently they will earn a bad name in this life and suffer retribution in the hereafter 
GRIND A KNIFE UPSTAIRS Once upon a time there was a poor man who had to work very hard in the king's service As time went on he became emaciated 
Out of pity the king gave him a dead camel 
Having received it the poor man began to flay it His knife being very blunt he looked for a whetstone to grind it At last he found one upstairs where he sharpened the knife 
He ran up and down the stairs doing the sharpening and skinning frantically for a while and finally he felt so tired that he could not go on any longer 
A stupid man who by breaking the strict commandments gathers plenty of money and uses it on offering in the hope that he will be born in Heaven This stupid man is just like the poor man who worked hard for little gain in hanging his camel upstairs and sharpening his knife 
LOSS OF A SILVER BOWL BY BOAT Once upon a time there was a man who dropped a silver bowl into the sea while crossing it He pondered I'm going to make a mark on the water I'm carrying on my journey now 
But I'll come back for it later After two months' travel during which he visited Ceylon and many other countries On seeing a river he jumped into the water looking for the bowl he had lost before 
What are you doing there people asked 
He replied I have lost my bowl 
Now I would like to get it back People went on When did you lose it He answered I lost it crossing the sea Again people asked How long ago did you lose it He answered I lost it two months ago People asked Since you lost it two months ago in the sea why are you looking for it here in the river He answered I made a mark on the water where I lost the bowl 
The heretics who do not practice the right religious belief but a fallacious one suffer from their useless mortification in seeking deliverance Those men are just like the stupid man who has lost his bowl in the sea and looked for it in the river 
THE KING WAS SAID TO HAVE GIVEN REIN TO CRUELTY Once upon a time a man pronouncing his king's crimes said Very cruel is the king 
He is incapable of governing On hearing this the king lost his temper without making sure who it was that had said it He took his deceitful attendant's advice by holding an eminent minister under arrest He ordered to have his backbone flayed and have his body cut to one hundred ounces of flesh for punishment 
To his regret the king ordered one thousand ounces of flesh is given to the minister to make up for what was cut off from his body 
Later when the minister gave a groan with pain at night the king asked What's wrong with you 
I have given you back ten times more than I had taken from you Are you not satisfied with it 
My great king 
How could getting ten times of the flesh the minister relieve himself the pain So is the stupid man who is greedy for the present pleasure but not afraid of the consequences for the hereafter 
He makes people around him miserable and puts them into requisition trying to make a fortune On the other hand he hopes to redeem his sins and obtain blessedness 
This stupid man is just like the king who first flayed and punished someone and then tried to give him back the flesh It is impossible that the pain can be eased 
A WOMAN LONGS FOR A SECOND CHILD Once there was a woman who longed for a second child 
He asked other women Who could bring me another child An old lady told her I can find a way for you to give birth to another child on one condition that you should offer a sacrifice to God She asked What have I to offer as a sacrifice Thereupon the old lady replied Kill your son and use his blood as a sacrifice to God 
A wise man nearby heard the story first jeered and then scolded the woman How so stupid and ignorant you are 
To kill your son that you have now 
Are you sure that you'll have another one whose birth is unknown So is the stupid man who in order to get uncertain happiness plunges into the burning pit and does all sorts of wrongdoings in the hope of entering Heaven after death 
He then transported them into the market However there were no buyers due to their high price Unable to sell them after several days he got bored and tired While he saw some other dealers selling out quickly their charcoal he said to himself that it is better to burn the lignaloes into charcoal in order to get them sold quickly 
After he burnt them he went to the market again but the value of the burnt lignaloes was less than half of that of the charcoal 
So are the stupid in the world To attain Buddhahood it requires them to practice diligently and zealously through various methods However they draw back from encountering difficulties They would resolve reaching Sravaka stage by destroying quickly the Karma of reincarnation in their hope of becoming Arahant 
THE THIEF STEALS EMBROIDERED SATIN TO WRAP UP WORN CLOTHES AND RAGS Once upon a time there was a thief who sneaked into a rich man's house to steal a piece of embroidered satin 
He was laughed at by the wise So are the stupid in the world who have faith in Buddhism who practice good teachings and who do meritorious works Because of their basic greed for gain however they break the pure commandments and lose their various merits They are also laughed at by the people at large 
TO CULTIVATE THE BOILED SESAME Once upon a time a stupid man who after eating the raw sesame found it not as tasty as the boiled kind He said to himself I would boil the sesame before cultivating it 
So are the people at large who consider it difficult to follow Bodhisattva's practice due to the strict requirement of eternities of the strenuous efforts Finding no pleasure they think that it will be easier for them to become Arahant's by cutting quickly off the transmigration without realizing that they would never attain Buddhahood that way just as the boiled seed that would never grow 
THE FIRE AND THE WATER Once upon a time there was a man who needed fire and cold water in caring out his household duties He built a fire in his room He filled a kettle with water and put it on the fire Afterwards the fire went out and the cold water turned hot 
So are the people at large who devoted to the attainment of Buddhism seek the enlightened way by becoming monks But afterwards they still keep ties to their wives children and relatives maintain their concern with the worldly affairs and their enjoyment of the five desires as well 
For these reasons they lose their meritorious blessings like the fire They also break their commandments like the cold water This is held to be true with greedy men 
THE KING'S BLINKING HABIT IS IMITATED Once upon a time there was a man who wanted to please the king 
He asked the others how to do it and was told If you want to please the king you should imitate him He then went to the palace where he saw the king blinking 
Thereupon he imitated and the king asked him Do you have sore eyes 
Is the wind disturbing your eyes 
Why are you blinking He replied Not at all on seeing your Majesty I want to be just like you to please your Majesty Upon hearing those words the king got very angry 
So are the people at large They wish to approach Buddha king of the Law to achieve advancement 
When they sometimes hear of using incorrect phrases in his teachings they may be unable to understand Buddha and they start to ridicule and defame him 
For this reason they lose the benefit they have got from Buddhism forever and fall into Three Evil Paths of Transmigration accordingly This is just like the story of the man imitating the king's blinking habit 
DRESS WHIP WOUNDS Once upon a time there was a man who was punished by the king by whipping and was wounded from it He applied on the wounds horse excrement for quick recovery 
A stupid man nearby was pleased to see it 
He said to himself I have just discovered the method to cure a wound faster As soon as he got home he told his son You are going to whip me until I'm wounded 
I should like to try it Then he was flogged by his son who dressed his wounds with horse excrement believing it was a good method 
They say to themselves in these words We are going to meditate on venery and the five desires They did not see the impurities of the body but rather got deceitful and wrong ideas from the pursuit of sexual pleasure 
Furthermore they suffer from Transmigration and descend into Hell This is held to be true with the stupid at large dressing their wounds with horse excrement 
CHANGE THE WIFE'S NOSE Once upon a time there was a man whose wife was graceful except for her ugly nose When he was out he saw another graceful looking woman with a pretty nose It came into his mind that I would cut her nose and transplant it on my wife's face Wouldn't that be nice He then cut the nose off this other woman 
Caring it home he hurriedly called out to his wife Come quickly I got a pretty nose for you Once she came out he cut off her nose and replaced it with the one he had cut off first 
So are the stupid in the world They hear that aged monks and Brahmans with great fame and merit are respected and much supported They say to themselves in these words There is no difference between them and us They falsely pretend to be virtuous 
Those people are just like the stupid man cutting other's nose only to injure his own wife 
THE POOR MAN BURNS HIS COARSE WOOLLEN CLOTHING Once upon a time there was a poor and weary man who wore a coarse woolen garment which he had made for his customer 
He was seen by a stranger who said to him Coming from an honorable family clan you are the son of a man of high position Why do you wear such coarse woolen clothing 
Now let me teach you how to get some fine clothes You should follow my instructions 
I won't cheat you The poor man follows his instructions happily The stranger immediately lit a fire before him and said in these words Now you may take off your coarse woolen garment and put it into the fire You'll get some beautiful clothes out of the flame instead The poor man did as he was told After his old clothes were burnt nothing was left but ashes 
So are the people at large Our being born as human beings must be attributed to the practice of a good religion from former lives We should take good care of our beings and improve our virtue and do good deeds We are sometimes cheated by the heretics vicious men and seductive women who said You should believe us that you will be reborn after this life in the Brahman Heaven and enjoy longevity and happiness if you practice ascetics by jumping into the fire or rocks now This is just like the story of the poor man burning his clothing 
THE SHEEP FARMER Once upon a time there was a shepherd who was skillful in raising as many as thousands of sheep However he was so stingy that he would not spend a penny 
At the time a swindler found means to make friends with him and said Since you and I have become intimate friends united as one man there should be no gap of any kind between us now 
I know a pretty girl from a certain family I should like you to ask her to be your wife The sheepfarmer was glad to hear those words 
He gave him a flock of sheep and other precious things 
The swindler then said Now your wife has brought a child into the world The sheepfarmer was very delighted to learn about this in spite of the fact that he had not met her yet 
Then one day the swindler said Your child is dead shortly after birth On hearing those words the sheepfarmer cried bitterly and sighed ceaselessly 
So are the people at large There are people who acquiring much knowledge put their creed into practice only for fame and gain They keep secret its teachings unwilling to preach or to teach the others 
Indulging in mundane pleasures they are cheated by the transience of their bodies like the poor man cheated by the illusion of getting a wife and a child Consequently they lose first their good faith then their lives and finally their precious possessions They can then only shed bitter tears by getting depressed and melancholy just like the sheepfarmer 
MASON WANTED Once upon a time a Brahman master indented to give a big party He told his disciple I need earthenware for the party 
Go to the market and fetch for me a mason On his way to the mason's home the disciple came across a man whose donkey was loaded with earthenware for sale in the market Yet all pottery was broken by the animal in the twinkling of an eye On his return home the man was crying and getting quite distraught 
Why are you so sad and disappointed The man replied I have been making earthenware with all my expedient means after toiling and moiling for many years I was on my way to the market intending to sell them But this dumb animal has broken all I had in no time 
That's why I'm so distraught The disciple was glad to see and hear all this and said It's a good donkey I should like to buy it The mason was delighted to sell it 
When the disciple rode it back the master asked Why didn't you come back with a mason 
What's the idea of bringing a donkey here The disciple replied This donkey is better than a mason for it can break things in a split second what a mason has made over a long time The master said You are stupid and ignorant indeed 
Although the donkey can break things in a second it can't even make one pottery in a hundred years So are the people at large 
Those who sometimes receive offerings from their benefactors for a hundred years give nothing in return On the contrary they always do more harm than good This is held to be true with someone who shows ingratitude 
A TRADER STEALS GOLD Once upon a time two traders ran some business together One was a seller of genuine gold while the other Tula cotton 
A buyer of gold came along and asked for a fire test before buying it The cotton trader stole the burnt gold and wrapped it with his Tula cotton which got all burnt up by the redhot gold Thus the stealing was revealed Consequently he lost both gold and Tula cotton 
Like them are the heretics who steal from Buddhism and write in their own religion They wrongfully claim Buddhism to be their own teaching and deny copying from it For this reason they burn and destroy their heretic scripture which is disappeared from the world This is just like the story of the disclosure of the stealing of gold 
HACKING A TREE DOWN FOR FRUIT Once upon a time there was a king who had a tremendously gigantic and beautiful tree It always produced excellent fruit with fragrance and sweetness 
One day the king told a guest who was visiting his palace Wouldn't you like to pluck some of the fruits The man replied I wish to have some but how Call I get them the tree is so tall and large The king then ordered to have the tree hacked down to get the fruit 
The king still tried to revive the tree which had withered and died 
TO SEND PURE SPRING WATER Once upon a time there was a village which was located five Yojanas away from the city and supplied pure spring water 
The king ordered the water to be sent to him in the palace every day by the villagers Becoming utterly weary of the irksome task they all wanted to move away to some remote place 
To them the village chief saidDon't go away 
I'll talk with the king for you to alter the distance between here and the palace from five Yojanas into three Yojanas 
It would be closer for coming and going without much weariness The chief hastened to report to the king who changed the mileage People were delighted at knowing this 
Most still stayed on because of their newly reassured confidence in the king 
So are the people in various walks of life Those who devote themselves to the right religion for crossing the Five Paths toward the Nirvana City intend to abandon their faith when they are weary and exhausted Traveling by the transmigration boat they are unable to make their way toward the shore 
However Buddha the king of the Law has many expedient means from the One Vehicle to the Three Vehicles Those who follow the Hinayana sect are glad to hear those words and find it easier to practice Therefore they spare no effort to do good deeds and improve themselves spiritually so as to make their way of transmigration toward the other shores Afterwards they realize that there is no Three Vehicles but ones 
Because of the confidence in Buddha's words they do not want to abandon their faith by then This is just like the story of the villagers ending pure spring water 
THE MIRROR IN A VALUABLE CASE Once upon a time there was a poor and weary man who was always in debt 
Insolvent he hid himself in the wilderness where he found a valuable case full of precious things A crystal mirror covered them 
So are the people from all walks of life Those who are weary of countless annoyances in life and persecuted by the creditors of the Transmigration Devil want to avoid them and free from them through their belief in Buddhism They begin to practice their faith and do good deeds just as the valuable case to the poor man 
Troubled by the man's imagein the mirror they wrongly cling to the ego taken as the real They fall decadent and lose all their merits acquired previously from meditation monastic grade and good deeds Furthermore they fail in their attainment of the Nirvana from the Three Vehicles just like the stupid man sticking to the prejudice of the ego and abandoning their precious findings in the case 
TO BLIND AN IMMORTAL Once upon a time there was a man who went to the mountains to learn Buddhist Priesthood He succeeded in becoming an Immortal possessing five supernatural powers His divine vision could perceive all hidden sundry treasures 
Upon hearing it the king said to one of his ministers excitedly In order to add more valuable things to my treasury could you make this man live permanently in our country The stupid minister went to his man soon afterwards and took his eyes 
He then went back to the king and said I have gouged out his eyes so he couldn't go away but stay in this country forever The king exclaimed What is important for his staying in this country is that he could perceive all hidden treasures 
Upon seeing a monk making strenuous efforts to meditate on the Fourfold stage of Mindfulness and the impurities or the human body on mountain groves among tombs in the wilderness or under a tree a layman invited him home to practice by making various offerings But in so doing he destroys the monk's good works done before and his chance of attaining Nirvana Therefore he makes him lose the benefit of the eyes of Enlightenment without obtaining anything This is just like the fatuous minister blinding the man with no avail 
TO KILL A HERD OF CATTLE Once upon a time there was a man who owned two hundred fifty cows He often took them to the pastureland for grazing 
By accident one day a cow was killed by a tiger The cattle owner said to himself Now that a cow is lost it's no longer an even number 
What's the use of having them at all He then drove the cattle to a high cliff and killed them all by pushing them down the cliff 
One who observes all of Buddha's commandments breaks one commandment without any sense of shame or repentance On the contrary he says to himself Now that one commandment is broken I'm no longer perfect What's the use of keeping any of the others All commandments are broken as a result of his ill logic 
He is just like the stupid man killing all his cattle 
YELLING AT WATER Once upon a time there was a man who was tired and thirsty from traveling He drank some fresh running water from the wooden bucket After he had had enough he raised his hands in front of the water and said I have had enough to drink Stop flowing The water went on 
Why don't you listen On seeing this an onlooker said You are so ignorant 
Why don't you just leave Thereupon the onlooker drew him away 
So are the people at large One who immerges himself in transmigrations and the thirst of desire drinks salty water of the five desires After getting tired of them he says in those words Disappear thou Five Desires Don't let me see you again I've told you 
Why are you still present A wise man tells him You can keep the Five Desires away by controlling your six organs of senses or by closing your mind and thought to them 
Why do you need to tell Desires to be out of your sight and to disappear This is just like the story of the man yelling at the water 
HOUSE PAINTING Once upon a time there was a man who went to another man's house which had just been painted and the floor made even It was nice and clean He asked the host With what paint did you make the wall so white and beautiful The host replied I mixed rice bran with water and day 
The beauty is the result To himself the guest said It would be better if he had used rice grain instead of bran 
It had better have done almsgiving to obtain any merits So are the common people Those who have heard the Saints preaching that people who do good deeds may go to Heaven after death and consequently get deliverance commit suicide to get there They merely ose their lives in vain without getting anywhere just like that stupid man with his paint 
TO CURE BALDNESS Once upon a time there was a man who was completely bald He felt very cold in winter and hot in summer He was stung by gadflies and mosquitoes He suffered from his baldness day and night 
One day he went to see a specialist well known for his medical and surgical practice and said Great Master Would you cure my baldness Taking off his hat the doctor revealed to him that he too was bald and said I have the same trouble as you 
Suffering from the agonies of birth old age sickness and death people seek for immortality They hear Sramanas Brahmans etc are the best doctors in the world who know now to cure all kinds of diseases They go to a Brahman and say Would you release us from the pain of impenitence and transmigration and help us live in happiness and immortality The Brahman tells them I also suffer from those agonies that you feel So I'm looking for immortality which I can't find 
If I was able to make you get it I would get it first for myself and then for you too The Brahman is just like the bald man getting weary in vain for his healing 
PISACAH DEVILS Once upon a time there were two Pisacah devils who conjointly owned a suitcase a stick and a pair of wooden shoes about which they fought for their monopoly 
An onlooker came over and asked What are the particularities of those three things that you have been fighting for so angrily The two devils replied This suitcase of ours turns out all sorts of things such as clothes food bed articles used on a bed and other living necessities 
One who takes the stick can conquer his hateful enemies without encountering resistance 
One who puts on these shoes will be able to fly without a hitch Upon hearing it the onlooker said to the devils Would you please stand further away 
Immediately the onlooker flew off snatching their suitcase and stick with the shoes on The two devils were startled at the loss of their share 
To them he said I got what you have been fighting for Now you need not are any more Here Pisacah refers to devils and heretics 
Almsgiving applies to the suitcase that turns out all the essential things to the needs of the Five Ways of Existence such as human beings Devas etc 
Meditation symbolizes the stick which can disperse or submit devils enemies and afflictions as thieves 
Commandments observing is like the shoes that ensure rebirth in the world of Devas and men 
As for the divils and heretics coveting the suitcase it signifies that they labor themselves to the seeking for the reward of Enlightenment in the imperfect way which result in nothing to be obtained 
If one can perform acts of merit together with almsgiving commandments observing and meditation practice he will be rid of all suffering and in turn obtain Nirvana 
The trader then skinned the camel He went away leaving it to his two apprentices and said Watch the camel's skin 
Don't let it get damp Later when it started to rain the two dull men covered the skin with all the fine carpet which became entirely ruined Obviously the skin and carpet differed much in price 
So are the people at large Abstaining from killing refers to the fine carpet the camel's skin and wealth To let the carpet get damp when it is raining means to undermine recklessly good merits 
The abstention from killing is the supreme motive to attain Buddhahood Unfortunately people do not effectively practice it They merely adhere to build pagodas or temples and give alms to support monks This is giving up the essential and pursuing the nonessential 
TO GRIND A BIG STONE Once there was a man who ground a big stone with great effort He made a small toy bull out of it after days and months of labor The effort being made was strenuous yet the gain expected was trivial 
So are the people from all walks of life Grinding a stone refers to learning seriously and diligently To make a small toy bull applies 'to the illusive fame and the inducement of the mutual criticism 
A scholar should endeavor himself to serious studying to get wide and extensive knowledge Furthermore he has to put his learning into practice so as to obtain some fulfillment The goal must not be the illusive fame complacence and arrogance which breed only sins and calamities 
EATING HALF A PANCAKE Once there was a man who felt hungry and longed to eat seven pancakes He was already full when he had eaten six pancakes and a half He was so sorry for having ordered seven of them that he slapped his own face and said Half a pancake has filled me up The other six are wasted 
There is actually no pleasure in life There are only illusions just like the stupid man getting full illusion with half a cake Being ignorant people view wealth and honor as pleasure 
It is just like people taken in by clothes and food as pleasure They also bear illusions of the word pleasure when they are toiling and moiling All Buddhas have it that the Three Worlds has no peace but great suffering Ignorant man with wrong views still clings desperately to illusions 
THE SLAVE GUARDS THE DOOR Once there was a man who was about to take a long trip He gave orders to his slave and said Keep a close watch over the door as well as the donkey and the rope 
After his departure the neighbor was playing music with drew attention of the slave He put the rope and the door on the ass' back and went to the neighbor to listen to the music 
The house was then ransacked by a thief after he had left it 
On his return the master asked the alive what had happened to his house 
The slave replied You told me to take care of the door the ass and the rope 
Now that the house has been robbed what's the use in having the door Stupid men in the world cling to birth and death by their lust for life like the slave to the door 
However most monks do not follow the teachings of Buddhism seeking enviously material offerings from others Even when practicing meditation they give an appearance to being pure and clean But their minds are still unsettled by their attachment to the five desires and deluded by sight sound smell taste etc When ignorance takes over the mind and attachment to desires comes into being all lost will be the right thought the enlightened mind and the monastic grades  
TO STEAL THE YAK Once there was a village whose people jointly participated in stealing a yak for food 
The man who lost the yak followed their trail to the village 
He called out to the villagers Do you all live in this village The villagers replied We live in no village Again the man asked There is a pond in your village 
We know of no pond Again he asked Is there any tree near the pond They answered We know of no tree Again he asked Were you on the east side of your village when you stole my yak They answered We know of no east direction Again he asked Wasn't it at noon when you stole my yak They answered We know of no noon time Again he asked Although it is possibly true of your first three answers how can you say there is no direction and no time in all the world 
So I don't believe you at all Sure enough you have stolen my yak 
So are those who break commandments People who hide their sins are reluctant to disclose them They will however go to hell after their death Since Devas and good gods possess supernatural eyes people should not even try to deceive them just like the villagers should not refuse to admit stealing a yak for food THE POOR MAN CROWS LIKE A DUCK It happened once that a foreign country was celebrating its Religious Day for festivities 
To her husband a woman said If you can get blue lotus flowers for me I shall remain as your wife 
I'll walk out on you Her husband was capable of crowing like a duck He then entered the king's pond to steal blue lotus flowers 
I'm a duck He was arrested and was taken to the king On the way he crowed again Thereupon the guard said You didn't crow properly before what's the use of doing so now So are the stupid in the world 
One who in his lifetime does all kinds of evil deeds to the others is reluctant to repent and subdue his mind 
Only at the time of his demise he says From now on I shall start to do good deeds The guard will nevertheless send him to the King of Hell It is too late for him to want to do good deeds just as the stupid man who could crow like duck 
Later however when he saw the branches and the leaves of a big tree wavering up and down in the wind he said to himself The tree must be calling me He then went back under the tree where he had got hit earlier 
So is a stupid disciple In his attempt of becoming a monk he has chances to approach a tutor from who he runs away at his first slight rebuke Afterwards he gets into a lot of trouble when he meets friends who have adverse influence over him Only then does he begin to think of returning to his tutor 
It is indeed stupid of him to go and come like that BOYS' ARGUMENT ON THE SUBJECT OF HAIR There were once two boys who dived in a river where they found at its bottom a bundle of feathers One said that it was the beard of some spirit whereas the other said it was the bear's hair 
A supernatural being nearby was then approached by the two and was asked to settle the argument 
He put rice and sesame seeds into his mouth and chewed for a while then he spat them into his hand and said What I have got here seems to me a peacock's excrement It is known his answer was beyond the question which was put to him 
So are the stupid in the world During the time of preaching those who facetiously discuss the teachings of Buddhism do not give the answer to the right doctrine just like the supernatural being not answering the question People from all walks of life are made a laughing stock So is the frivolous and empty gossip 
TO CURE A HUNCHBACK Once there was a man who suddenly became a hunchback He went to a physician who treated him first with ointment smeared on his back and who then squeezed the hunchback between two pieces of woodblock The doctor pressed the woodblock so hard that the hunchback's eyes popped out 
What they don't realize is that even if they commit crimes most furtively they will make more injuries than profits just like the doctor made the hunchback's eyes popped 
They will one day go to Hell A MAID AND HER FIVE MASTERS Once there were five men who together bought a maid to whom one of them said Get my clothes washed Another man also told her to do the same thing 
But the maid said he would wash for whoever gave her clothes first 
Angrily the second man said Since I have bought you with others how can you wash only for the first one who gave the elder Then he beat her ten strokes with a whip 
Thus she was whipped as much by each of the five masters 
So are the five components of human bodies which are the sources of annoyances They whip the sentient beings with birth giving old age sickness death and numerous other miseries 
THE MUSICIAN Once a musician played in the presence of the king who had promised him a thousand coins 
Later he asked the king for the money The king refused to give it to him and said The music you played doesn't make me merry for a long time Therefore the money that I intent to give you is also to please you just for a while So is the wordy retribution 
While there is little pleasure in human lives and in Heaven there is also little substance in them Owing to impermanence and destruction the pleasure does not last for long just like the music giving only a transient rejoicing 
THE MASTER'S ACHING LEGS Once a master told two of his disciples to take care of his aching legs Each one had to massage continuously each of his two legs 
The two disciples bear strong dislike of each other When one left for a break the other broke with a stone the leg that the first one had massaged out of spite The first one angry at his doings broke the other leg that the second one had massaged 
So are the Buddhist disciples The scholars of Mahayana criticize the Hinayana and viceversa Therefore these two schools' scriptures of the Great Saint run the risk to be both vanishing 
THE SNAKE'S ARGUMENT Once there was a snake whose tail told its head I should lead the way And the head said I'm used to leading why do you want to change positions so suddenly When the head led the way the tail knotted himself around a tree and was unwilling to move 
And when the tail led the snake fell into a burning pit and was burnt to its death 
This is also true with teachers and disciples The disciples have a fancy that the young should lead the way as they think teachers are too old to lead 
Due to their youthful immaturity they often break commandments without being aware of it They end up dragging each other down to Hell 
TO BE A KING'S BARBER Once upon a time a king's personal attendant risked his life to save the king at the battlefield The king was so grateful that he gave his lifesaver whatever he wanted The king asked What do you want 
Your wishes shall be granted The man replied Allow me to shave you when you need a shave The king said If that is what you wish to do I'll grant it to you Such a stupid man is laughed at by the people at large 
It would be so much better for the barber to ask for half a country or to become prime minister or minister of State rather than to practice the mean profession Only a stupid man would do so 
To attain Buddhadhood all Buddhas cultivate themselves with hardship during a long and painful period of time What people do not realize is that Buddha Sakyamuni's bequeathed teachings are scarce to be heard and our human bodies are hard to be acquired as well It is like a blind turtle's trouble in finding a log hole floating at the surface of the water Fortunately enough once these two difficulties are overcome people are selfcomplacent with their shallow mind and few commandments are observed without any ambition of ever attaining Nirvana the perfect Enlightenment 
TO ASK NOTHING Once upon a time two men walking together saw another fellow trying in vain to pull a chariot loaded with sesame out of a hole on the road 
To the two men the fellow said Please give me a hand The two men replied What are our rewards The fellow said Nothing In spite of the answer the two men helped to get the chariot out of the hole 
They demanded Now give us something The fellow replied I'll give you nothing Again the men said Give us Nothing then Half smiling one of them said He doesn't want to give us anything 
No use getting upset The other one replied He said he'd give us 'nothing' 
We'll settle for that 'nothing' When one of them says 'nothing' that 'nothing' is composed of two words which constitute an unreal name 
If the vulgar and common people cling to 'nothing' they will be born is Space World of Formlessness Whereas the other says 'nothing' to signify no form no vows and no Karma 
TREADING ON THE ELLDERS MOUTH Once upon a time there was an extremely wealthy elder whose attendants were eager to please him by paying him all due deference 
When he spat the attendants rubbed it with their feet 
Among them J was this stupid man who said to himself When he spits on the ground others rub it with their feet Now I'm going to be the first one to render the service of rubbing it when he spits next time So when the Elder was about to cough and spit out the man kicked up his foot and trod on the elder's mouth 
He broke the old man's lips and teeth 
To the stupid man the elderly man said What did you do that for The stupid man replied Though I would like to serve you I have always fallen behind others 
So I thought by kicking up my foot when you were about to spit out from your mouth I would be the first to please you People have to pick the right time to do the right thing 
They will get into trouble otherwise even using every possible means to achieve a purpose Therefore they should know when it is right or wrong time 
THE TWO BROTHERS AND THEIR INHERITANCE Once upon a time there was a Ksatriya of the Makara Kingdom who fell seriously ill and was aware of the fatal hour 
To his two sons he ordered After my death divide between the two of you evenly my effects and money After his death the two sons followed their father's will But the elder brother complained against the younger of unfairness in their shares 
An old man nearby said Let me teach you how to divide equally your father's fortune How they asked 
The dead will be reborn This should be answered separately Those who have no desires at all will not be reborn Those who have desires will be reborn 
Are all human beings supreme ones This can be questioned reversely as follows 
Are you referring to the Three Paths of Transmigration or to the host of Devas If you are referring to the former I should say human beings are supreme 
If the latter I should say human beings are not equals to Devas 
No answers to questions If you ask the fourteen difficult questions such as whether the world has limit or whether human beings have any beginnings or ends 
Pretending to be wise the ignorant heretics divide the four ways of answering questions by only using the separate answer just like the stupid man giving advice to the two sons to divide all effects and money into two parts 
WATCHING URN MAKING Once two men went to a potter's field where they watched a treadwheel making earns 
One then left for the great assembly where he was well received with excellent food and got precious teachings as well 
So are the stupid who engage themselves in their housework without being aware that all things are subject to change 
People are inclined to be very fickle nowadays Apparition of Buddhas and Great Dragons thunders all over the world The rain of Buddhist teachings fertilizes all beings except for those who stick to trifles 
Being unconscious of death that could come any time people miss the opportunity to attend to Buddhist assemblies They are unable to be inspired by the precious teachings as a treasure and always remain in misery 
Those who are abandoning the right doctrine and looking endlessly at the trifles of urn making lose the benefit of learning and will never get deliverance 
SEEING THE SHADOW OF GOLD AT THE BOTTOM OF A POND Once upon a time there was a man who went to a large pond where he thought he had seen the shadow of pure gold at the bottom of water 
A few moments later he began to feel very tired 
But as soon as he was out of the water that became clear in no time the golden shadow turned up again Then he dived once again to do more searching Still he found nothing 
At this point his father came looking for him Seeing the state he was in his father asked What have you been doing to get so tired The son replied There is pure gold under water 
I searched for it but could find nothing The father could also see the shadow of pure gold in the water But he soon realized that it was in the trees So he knew what was in the water was mere reflection 
Following his father's instructions the son immediately got the gold from the trees 
So are the ignorant in the world They hold on to tile thought of ego in the shadow of nonego just like the stupid man looking desperately for the gold without success 
BRAHMA'S DISCIPLE CAN CREATE ALL THINGS Brahmans say that the Great Brahma was both father of the world and creator of all things One of the Great Brahma's disciples once said he also had the power to create things 
To the great Brahma he said I can create everything The Great Brahrna replied Don't talk like that 
Since you don't listen to me I wonder how you do it After seeing what his disciple had creased the Great Brahma said The man's head that you have made is too big and the neck too thin The hands are too long and the arms too bony The feet are too small and the legs too fat 
It looks like a Pisacah devil Through the Great Brahma's words we should realize that human beings are created by their own deeds resulting from Karma and not by the power of the Great Brahma Buddha's preaching is not ambiguous As they preach the Eightfold Noble Path they cling neither to the view of total annihilation nor that of permanence 
On the contrary the heretics do cling to the view of annihilation and permanence They cheat the world by performing ceremonies and creating images What they preach really is not Buddhism 
THE PATIENT EATS THE PHEASANT MEAT Once upon a time there was a man who was seriously ill A skillful physician prescribed that he could be cured by eating some pheasant meat After he finished eating one the patient did not eat it again 
Afterwards the doctor came to him and asked How do you feel now The patient replied You have told me to eat some pheasants Now that I have eaten it I dare not eat it again The physician said But why not 
How can you expect to be cured with only one pheasant This is also true with all the heretics 
They should understand what the mind means on hearing such wise and skillful doctors as Buddha's and Bodhisattva's preaching However they cling to the view of permanence thinking that there is only one mind from the past present through future which does not undergo any change This is just like the patient eating only one pheasant that his illness of ignorance and worries cannot be cured 
All Omniscient Buddhas teach the heretics to abandon their prejudiced view of permanence For all phenomena are subject to change at the time of thought How can the mind remain unchanged 
AN ACTOR WEARING A DEMON'S GARMENT Once upon a time there was a troupe of actors from Cadhara Kingdom rambling in different parts of the country giving performances due to a famine They passed the Pala New Mountain where evil demons and meneater Raksas had been found 
The troupe had to lodge in the mountain where it was windy and cold They slept with the fire on One of them who were chilly wore Raksa demon's costume and sat near the fire when another actor awoke and saw him 
In general panic the whole troupe got up and ran away The one who wore the Raksa garment not realizing what was happening followed them Seeing he was behind them all the actors got more frightened to do them harm They crossed rivers and mountains and jumped into ditches and gullies 
So are all the common people Those who happen to be in the midst of the misfortune of famine do not spare themselves trouble to go far away to seek for the sublime teaching of the Four Transcendental Realities of Nirvana namely eternity bliss personality and purity However they cling to their egos which are nothing more than five components of a human being 
Because of this they are flowing back again and again through transmigration Pursued by temptation they are out of sorts in falling into the ditch of the Three Evil Paths Only when the night of transmigration is ended does the wisdom appear once again Also only at this moment can one perceive the five components of a human being have no real ego 
AN EVIL DEMON IN THE OLD HOUSE Once upon a time there was an old house where the rumors had it that an evil demon often appeared People were so frightened that no one would dare to be in it 
A man claiming himself dauntless said I would like to spend a night in this house So he did 
Upon hearing from the bystander that the house was frequently haunted by an evil demon another man also wanted to do the same proving himself to be more intrepid than the first one He tried to enter by pushing the door 
The one who had got into the house first thought the second one to be the demon and blocked the door to his entrance 
When finally coming face to face they realized that they were both mistaken 
So are the people at large Our ego is subject to the law of impermanence and causeeffect and therefore there is no mastering power in our body Considering and analyzing all in all one can only ask who the ego is 
However human beings indulge in illnatured gossip everywhere and fight each other like those men in this told story 
It so happened that her husband was sent on an official mission to a neighboring state the woman secretly prepared some poisonous pills To the husband she said with a faked tenderness Now that you have been sent far away on this official mission I have prepared for you five hundred pills both as food supplies and as something to cheer you up You will take them when you are hungry when you reach the border The husband did not take them when he crossed the frontier 
It was dark then and he decided to rest in the forest Afraid of wild animals he climbed up a tree to spend the night 
He left his pills under the tree On that same night a group of five hundred thieves stopped at the same spot with five hundred horses and precious things stolen from their king They were all hungry and thirsty from their narrow escape Finding those pills under the tree the thieves took them and on account of the strong poisonous effect died one after another in no time 
At daybreak the man hiding in the tree saw the dead thieves Then he deceitfully made as if he slew and shot the corpses with swords and arrows Afterward he got all the horses as well as the stolen goods together and rode towards the foreign country 
Meanwhile the king was on his way with his guards trying to apprehend the thieves They carne across the man and asked Who are you 
If your Majesty doesn't believe it you can inspect the casualties on the spot where we fought Immediately the king sent his guards to inspect the spot They found out what he had said was true 
The king was overwhelmed with admiration for his unusual bravery Later when the man was sent back to his own country the king bestowed him both a knighthood and treasures as well as a piece of land 
The king's old officials said with jealousy Why does your Majesty bestow him such rewards to a but stranger 
Besides the grant of his title of honors goes above the old officials Hearing those words the stranger said Who is intrepid enough to challenge me 
Let's have a duel The old officials were startled and none would venture to accept the challenge 
The way this stranger brags so much about his fighting spirit it will be wonderful if he is made to kill the lion for the sake of the country They then asked the king to give him a sword and spear and sent him off to kill the lion 
The stranger delirious with happiness over his new conquest came to report the news to the king who in turn multiplied his rewards Furthermore he got respect and praises from the whole court as well as the country 
 The pills are referred to as an unclean almsgiving  The king's guards are referred to as good friends  The arrival at a foreign country is referred to as all Devas  Killing the band of thieves is referred to as obtaining the Sotapanna's degree resolving to cut the Five Desires together with other worries  Meeting the king is referred to as coming across the Sage and Saint  Other officials jealousy is referred to as the heretics who utter slander against the wise by saying there is no way that the wise are capable to cut off the Five Desires and other worries  The stranger's bragging is referred to as the heretics who can not resist him  Killing the lion is referred to as destroying all evil demons and thus obtaining the title of honors for the unattached way of Nirvana  The man's fear is referred to as the weak bringing the strong into Subjection 
They would gain so much more in reward considering how the man in this story gained out of an ill almsgiving which later on turned into a good one thanks to the good friends he met 
He had read all about sailing such as to know how to steer the boat how to take the right direction and how to hold in good position when they had to face whirlpools countercurrents or rocks during the journey 
To everybody aboard he said I know all about sailing Everyone believed him It was not long before the captain of the boat fell ill and died soon after He then took charge of the boat 
When they came to whirlpools and rapid currents he recited what he had read without knowing how to put those instructions into practice 
The boat that was strolling and going round could not advance to the pearls place Then they all drowned 
A BET OVER A CAKE Once upon a time there were a man and his wife who shared three cakes On the third they made a bet whoever talks first loses his share of the cake After this they stopped talking 
In no time a thief forced his way into the house to rob valuable things 
The couple saw that everything fell into the thief's hand without uttering a sound due to the bet they had made previously Seeing that they said nothing the thief started to attack the wife in the presence of her husband who still would not utter a word 
I won't give you any of it Upon hearing the story everyone nearby laughed at them 
For a little fame and gain people deceptively appear to be quiet and silent When they are disturbed with their false worries and all other evil thoughts they are not afraid of losing their good teachings and falling into the Three Evil Paths of Transmigration They do not try to seek to leave this world When they have their five desires fulfilled they do not think of the ensuing suffering 
BEARING A GRUDGE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER Once upon a time there was an unhappy man who bore grudges against another man 
He was asked 
Even though I'll hurt myself I still would like to hurt him So are the people at large 
Out of revenge people seek the Vatala incantation to hurt others without realizing that to feel anger and hatred is to get hurt themselves and fall into the Three Evil Paths of hells beasts and hungry ghosts 
THE MAN EATS QUICKLY Once upon a time there was a man who went from North India to the South where he lived for a long time got married and settled down 
The husband ate it in one mouthful while it was piping hot 
What made you eat so fast The husband said That's a great secret that I have been keeping from you Upon hearing these words the wife insisted on knowing the secret thinking there might have some special reason for it 
After a pause the husband replied My ancestors made it a rule to eat quickly I'm doing it nothing more than an act of observing the tradition 
The same also holds true with the common people People who are doing evil things have no sense of shame because they do not know what is right or how to distinguish truth from falsehood They say they observe the tradition They accept and follow it to death just like that stupid man making it a rule to eat quickly 
TO TASTE APPLES Once upon a time there was an elderly man who sent a servant to buy him some apples He gave him orders as follows You'll buy some good and sweet apples for me The servant then went on an errand with money 
The owner of the apple orchard said to him All my apples are good and sweet There is not a single bad one 
You'll know it when you taste one The servant said I'll buy some after I taste every single one of them 
The master did not like the sight of all these halfeaten apples and he threw them all out 
This is also held to be true with the people at large Seeing that all those who keep almsgiving commandment can acquire great wealth and happiness physically at ease and mentally stable People still remark in disbelief We'll believe it if we can get them for ourselves To see for yourself in noble and base rich and poor of this World you would attribute those people to retribution of the previous lives 
THE MAN WHO TURNED BLIND Once upon a time there was a man who had two wives 
Faced with such a dilemma he decided one night to lie flat on the back between the two 
It happened that it was raining so heavily that their house began to have a leak Water and mud fell into his eyes but he dared not get up and run away due to the decision he had taken before Finally he became completely blind 
This is also held to be true with the common people of the world By keeping bad company and doing unlawful deeds people create Karmas and fall into the Three Evil Paths of Transmigration Not only will they remain in the round of existences forever but also lose their eyes of wisdom just like the stupid man who turned blind 
AN OPERATION ON THE MOUTH Once upon a time there was a man who went to his wife's home where he saw people removing the husk from rice 
He stole some rice and hid it in his mouth When the wife came to talk to him he could not answer her with his mouth full He disliked to leave it lest he would put her to shame So he stood speechless 
That aroused her curiosity all the more Looking at him and feeling him with her hands she found his mouth swollen Thereupon she said to her father On his way over my husband suddenly got a swollen mouth and is unable to speak Immediately her father sent for a doctor who said Very serious is your illness 
It will be cured by an operation Then an operation on his mouth was done and his act of theft was exposed 
This is also held to be true with the people at large In doing evil deeds to break the pure commandments and hiding sins people descend to the Three Evil Ways of hells beats and hungry ghosts 
This is just like the stupid man being reluctant to let out rice on account of a trifling shame matter and undergoing an operation on his mouth to reveal his sins 
THE HORSE WAS DEAD Once upon a time there was a man who rode on a black horse to a battle Out of fear he was incapable to combat He daubed his face and eyes with blood and dirt Pretending to be dead he laid down in the midst of corpses 
Back at home he was asked Where is your old horse The man replied My horse is dead 
I have brought back with me its tail People said But your old horse was black How did its tail turn white Speechless the man was laughed at 
So are the people at large Despite of their pretending to be good pious compassionate and restraining themselves to eat meat and drink wine people indulge themselves in killing and injuring other sentient beings and thus raising to pain and cruelty Furthermore they boast that they do good deeds but there is nothing they will not do to commit sins just like the stupid man and his horse 
BECOMING A COMMON MONK Once upon a time there was a kingdom which had a law that all Brahmans in the country should keep their bodies clean and those who do not would be subject to all kinds of hard works 
There was a Brahman who was always holding an empty pot pretending that he was a clean man When someone poured water info his pot he spilled it and said in these words I don't want to wash myself Let the king do it himself 
I have been lying to shun hard labor because of the king's law This is also held to be true with the common monks 
A monk who has shaved his head and worn dyed gannets could break commandments while pretending to be following them outwardly Thus he wants to receive gain and offerings and avoids labor work superficially he looks like a monk but in reality he cheats just like the Brahman holding an empty pot and keeping up appearances 
THE CAME AND THE JAR ARE BOTH LOST Once upon a time there was a man who had a jar used to hold grain A camel put its head into it to eat the grain but it could not get its head out 
An old man came up to him and said Don't be upset 
I'll tell you how to get him out It'll get its head out in no time if you listen to me 
You should cut off its head and he'll be out The man followed his words He killed the camel and also broke the jar 
Such an idiot was jeered by the people at large 
This is also held to be true with the common stupid men Those who hope for Enlightened minds through the Three Vehicles must keep commandments and avoid doing evil deeds However they indulge themselves in the Five Desires which will destroy them Not only do they end up breaking commandments but also giving up the Three Vehicles 
THE FARMER LONGED FOR THE PRINCESS Once upon a time there was a farmer who went to the city and saw the princess who was very graceful He found she was quite a rare beauty Afterwards he thought of nothing else but the princess day and night Since he could not find a way to have a talk with liar he became yellow and fell very ill from his lovesickness 
He replied Yesterday I saw the graceful princess with whom I would like to get acquainted But I've been unable to think of a way This is why I have fallen ill 
Unfortunately she didn't like it at all Upon hearing these words the farmer got very happy and said with a big smile to other people that she would come to him if he sent for her 
A stupid man knows of no seasons of spring summer autumn and winter He sows the land with seeds in winter hoping that they will grow He gains nothing except wasting his energy in vain All are lost as buds stalks branches and leaves 
Getting a little merit the stupid of the world are satisfied with what they think are the attainment of Enlightenment like the farmer who longed for the princess 
TO MILK A DONKEY Once upon a time there was a group of frontiersmen who had never seen a monkey before Thus they could not identify it They were told that its milk was delicious 
The one who grasped the donkey's penis called out that he could get milk there from Then he began to extract 
Finally this group of people felt tired and bored for they could not get what they had wanted They got nothing in return despite of their effort They were all laughed at by the people at large 
This is also held to be true with the common heretics The heretics who learn their religious faith from some inadequate sources might lead to illusions giving rise to all kinds of heterodox views such as to go naked to fast to jump into precipice or go through fire With all these kinds of heterodox views they fall to the evil paths like those stupid men seeking in vain for milk from a male donkey 
THE SON'S TRIPS Once upon a time there was a man who told his son one night Tomorrow I'll go with you to another tribe for some errands The son hastened to go there by himself at dawn without telling his father 
After he came back his father scolded him and said You are very stupid indeed Why didn't you wait for me 
You ran back and forth for nothing only to suffer in vain He was laughed at by the people at large This is also held to be true with the common people 
Those who have the opportunity to become monks and who shave off their mustache and have their hair cut and who wear the monk's three robes do not ask for guidance to obtain Nirvana from an imminent teacher They will in the end lose not only the meditation training but also the merits of monastic grades Finally they will lose altogether the supreme results from the practices of monks under the cloak of whom they virtually gain nothing This is just like that stupid man casting his trip in vain only to get tired and weary 
CARRYING CHAIRS FOR THE KING Once upon a time there was a king who wished to go to the garden named Free From Care for a good time He ordered one of his ministers You'll drag a lounge chair to that garden for me to sit and take rest on The minister considered it a demeaning job for a minister to drag a chair 
So he refused to do it and replied I would rather carry it on my back with a pole than dragging it Then the king put thirtysix chairs on his back and asked him to carry them to the garden 
Such a stupid man was laughed by the people at large This is also held to be true with the common people Seeing hair fallen from a woman's head on the ground people are reluctant to pick it up in the name of keeping the commandments 
However once disturbed by ignorance and desire they do not mind picking up thirtysix unclean things at a time such as hair capillary nail tooth excrement urine etc without feeling shameful and even keep them as long as they live This is just like that stupid man bearing chairs on his back 
TO TAKE AN ENEMA Once upon a time there was a man who had a pain in his rear The doctor said it would be healed by giving an enema 
He immediately went to fetch the instruments for that purpose The patient took the drug before the physician came back His belly became inflated beyond description 
After his return the doctor wondered what had happened to the patient and asked him the cause of it 
To the physician he replied I've just taken the drug for enema That's why I'm dying After hearing these words the doctor scolded him in following words You are the most stupid man I've ever met 
You are acting against all senses Then he gave him other drugs 
Those who bluntly practice the contemplation in meditation without consulting a good master are just like that stupid man taking the wrong thing for his illness 
GETTING BITTEN BY A BEAR Once upon a time there were a man and his son traveling together The son got into the woods and was bitten by a bear Scratches were all over his body Being in a difficult situation he fled to his father 
Seeing his son's wounds the father was astonished and asked How did you get wounded The son replied There was a longhaired monster that bit me The father grasped bows and arrows and went to the woods where he saw a longhaired supernatural being 
When he was about to shoot at him a bystander said Why do you want to shoot at this since he is innocent 
You should punish the guilty This is also held to be true with the stupid of the world People offended by an immoral monk in his religious robe are apt to do the worst harm to all good and virtuous monks This is just like the father wanting to be revenged on the supernatural man for his son's bites by a bear 
THE CULTIVATION OF THE LAND Once upon a time there was a peasant who went to another farmer's property to examine his wheat plants He asked the owner How do you make the wheat grow so well The owner replied First you have to flatten the field 
He poured liquid manure to blend with the soil and scattered seed in land Treading the field with his feet he was afraid that the land would become too hard to be fruitful He said to himself I should sow sitting on a bed carried by others 
That'll do He then ordered each of the four men to hold a leg of the bed to scatter seed in land which became all the harder 
This is also held to be true with the common people To cultivate the field of commandments and wait the good yield of shoots people should consult a master to practice the Buddhist teachings however they break the commandments and do evil deeds 
Thus the shoots of commandments do not grow just like the peasant who was afraid of his won two feet and added still eight of others 
A FEMALE MONKEY Once upon a time a female monkey was beaten by a fullgrown person The animal had no other alternative than gave vent to its anger later on a small boy 
For things born in the past are bygone What come after are different things Thus the one wrongfully gets into a temper only gets deeper and deeper into hatred This is just like the monkey that has been beaten by a grown person vents its anger on a small boy 
DOGS WERE BEATEN WHEN THE LUNAR ECLIPSE HAPPENED Once upon a time there was a king of Asuras who covered the moon with his hands when he thought it too bright 
However the stupid men laid the blame on innocent dogs which were sometimes unjustly beaten 
They often suffer from the desires anger and ignorance But they want to destroy them by sleeping on thorns and their bodies are burning with the five pains just like the dogs were beaten when the lunar eclipse happened 
THE WOMAN WHO HAD SORE EYES Once upon a time there was a woman who had a bad case of sore eyes Another woman told her Where there are eyes there are some times pains 
Although my eyes do not ache now I want to gouge them out so that they will not ache later A bystander said Though it's true that when you have your eyes they may sometimes ache to disturb you yet when you don't have them you'll be sure to suffer for lifetime This is also held to be true with the common stupid men 
People have heard that wealth and fame are the sources of decadence They are afraid of retribution in the hereafter for not doing almsgiving in their present lives The more wealth they have the more troubles they sometimes suffer afterwards 
It is said that if you do almsgiving you may be happy or you may be not 
This is just like that woman who could not bear the thought of having sore eyes wanted to gouge them out to suffer forever 
Such a stupid was laughed at by the people at large 
Stupid men who tell stories in order to win a little fame and gain lose the profit resulted from the practices of monks Furthermore they will fall into the Three Evil Paths of Transmigration after the decay of their bodies or at their death's door This is just like that stupid man who cut his son's head off for a pair of gold earrings 
THE ROBBER'S JOY Once upon a time there was a band of robbers who divided their boot according to their different ranks 
It was considered as an inferior part to be given to one of the robbers of the lowest rank The robber got angry and made a strong protest to the rest Afterwards he brought it to the city for sale 
An honorable elderly man paid him a high price He ended up getting more money than any other robber in the band He then leaped for joy 
This is held to be true with the almsgiving People who are doing almsgiving are usually not aware whether there will be a retribution Be it ever so little they are doing it they after death go to Heaven to enjoy an unlimited amount of happiness The less they do the more they get 
This is just like the robber who was happy after he had got a top price for his Kambala 
THE FEMALE MONKEY AND A HANDFUL OF BEANS Once upon a time there was a female monkey holding a handful of beans After dropping to the ground a grain of bean she dropped all the beans in her hands by looking for the first one All beans were then eaten by chicken and ducks before long 
Those who break one commandment usually do not like to confess Later they break other commandments to such an extent that they end up breaking all of them This is just like the female monkey who loses all beans by looking for a grain of bean 
THE GOLD WEASEL Once upon a time there was a man who found a gold weasel while traveling He put it inside of his shirt as he leaped for joy Traveling on he reached a river where he took off his clothes for crossing Subsequently the gold weasel changed into a poisonous snake 
Deeply grateful the snake changed back into pure gold 
A stupid man nearby who saw it with his own eyes took it for granted that it should always turned out that way He then put a poisonous snake inside of his shirt 
This is also held to be true with the stupid of the world On seeing those who have done good works and in turn have obtained benefit people start to attach themselves to Buddhism They are not motivated by faith but greed They will finally fall into evil paths after death like that man died of snakebites 
This is also held to be true with people who come into contact with Buddhism Although people have the opportunity to meet the Three Precious One's Blessings if they are not going earnestly good work's in time they will fall into the Three Evil Paths of Transmigration after their deaths His is just like that stupid man who gave back the money that he had found As the Stanza has it 
People who are managing this business today will plan another tomorrow Only thinking of enjoyment without contemplation sorrow 
The common people always retard to get deliverance like that man counting the money 
THE POOR WANT TO HAVE AS MUCH AS THE RICH Once upon a time there was a poor man who had but few possessions After meeting some rich men he wanted to be like one of them Unable to do so he was about to throw the little he had into the water 
What they have cannot equal that received by the high and virtuous ones 
They see that those old and virtuous ordained men are supported by the mass of famous people They want to be on an equal footing with them Unable to get equality they feel sorrowful and painful to such a degree as to break their faith This is just like the stupid man who wanting to be equal with the rich casts out the precious possessions of his own 
THE CHILD GETS HAPPY PILLS Once upon a time a wet nurse was walking along the road with a child in her arms She became also weary that she fell asleep on the way 
Then a man appeared and gave the child some happy pills Being gluttonous the child was lured by the good taste and knew nothing about his intentions The man forthwith stripped the child of his necklace brooches and garments 
This is also held to be true with the monks Intent upon worldly interests and noisy places those who are greedy for a little gain and support are drawn to temptation while a thief steals their spiritual credit and treasured commandments They are just like that greedy child whose belongings are taken away by the thief due to the enticement of some tasteful pills 
THE OLD WOMAN CAUGHT A BEAR Once upon a time there was an old woman who was resting under a tree when a bear came to attack her She ran around the tree trying to get away while the bear held the tree with one hand and tried to grasp her with the other Thus hard pressed the woman quickly hugged the tree and held fast the bear's two claws so that the bear could not move 
Then a stranger came up to the spot The old woman called out Let's catch and kill the bear together 
We'll share its meat The stranger believed the old woman's words and began to help capture the bear 
After seizing it the old woman gave it up and ran away 
People progress heresy whose theories are far from good and whose phrases are tangled complicated and full of errors The successors want to continue and give an interpretation to them However they are unable to grasp the meaning There for they are enmeshed in trouble just like that stupid man catching the bear for another person and getting hurt instead 
He found out their affair and stopped outside the door waiting for the man to come out to kill him 
There is no way out but the mani She wanted the man to escape by means of the sewer The man misunderstood her to mean looking for the mani pearls 
This is also held to be true with the common people It is said between birth and death we live a life of impermanence suffering emptiness and unreality of ego We have to reject the two extremes of annihilation and permanence by holding fast to the golden mean in order to get deliverance 
However the common people misunderstand the two extremes to refer to the universe being finite and infinite and the human beings having ego and having no ego Therefore they are unable to grasp the meaning of the middle way to avoid extremes After being stricken with sudden death they will be killed out of impermanence and falling into the Three Evil Paths of Transmigration This is just like the stupid man getting killed looking for man pearls 
A DOVE Once upon a time there were two doves male and female which lived together in a nest They filled their nest with fruit seed that grew up during the fall Later the fruit dried and shrank to fill but half of the nest The male was in a temper and said to the female We have been working hard together for the fruit 
The female replied I haven't eaten it alone 
For the fruit has shrunk by itself Incredulous the male angrily said If it has not been you alone who had eaten how could it grow so much less now Then he pecked the female to death 
A few days later it happened to rain heavily The fruit got moist and grew to its former size On seeing it the male regretfully realized that she really had not eaten and that he had wrongly killed her 
He then cried bitterly and called out to her Where have you gone This is also held to be true with the common people 
Leading a disorderly life people indulge in wild pleasures They think nothing of impermanence when breaking major commandments It will be too late for them to repent afterwards 
It only remains for them to give vent to their sadness with sighs like the stupid dove 
PRETENDING TO BE BLIND Once upon a time there was a trained craftsman who worked for the king He could not bear the hardship and deceitfully said he was blind in order to release himself from the hard work 
On hearing it another craftsman wanted to gouge out his own eyes so as to avoid the tiresome drudgery 
Someone then asked him Why do you want to gouge out your eyes only to make yourself suffer more in another way Such a stupid man was laughed at by the people at large 
This is also held to be true with the common people For the sake of a little fame and gain people are prone to tell wild stories and destroy their pure commandments They will fall into the Three Evil Paths of Transmigration after their death like that stupid man destroying his own eyes for a little benefit 
THE WOOLLEN COAT WAS ROBBED BY THE WICKED THIEF Once upon a time two friends were walking in the wilderness On the way one of them wearing a woolen coat was robbed of it by a thief The other successfully escaped into a thicket 
The loser of the coat had a piece of gold concealed in the collar To the thief he said This coat is worth one piece of gold Now I beg you to let me redeem it at that value The thief asked Where's the gold Opening up the collar the man showed it to him and said Here's the pure gold 
If you don't trust my words you can go and ask a goldsmith who is hiding in the thicket now After seeing the second man the thief also took his clothing from him 
Such a stupid man thus lost his woolen coat gold and everything 
Pious having monastic grades and possessing other merits people are robbed by the thief of temptation They lose their good teachings and their merit as well They lose not only the gain of their own but also make others lose their Karma leading to Buddhahood They will fall into the Three Evil Paths of Transmigration on the dissolution of the body after death like the two losing everything they had 
A BOY CAUGHT A BIG TURTLE Once upon a time there was a boy who was playing on dry land and caught a big turtle He intended to kill it but he did not know how to do so 
Therefore he asked someone and he was told You just throw it into the water and he'll be killed at once The boy believed the words and cast it into the water 
This is also held to be true with the common people Hoping to protect their six sense organs and consecrating themselves to meritorious works people do not know how to do so Accordingly they begin to ask others how to bring about deliverance 
To them the heretics Maras the evil ones and the wicked friends say in their words You just have to be fond of the six sense organs and indulge in the Five Desires 
As I'm telling you you'll get deliverance Such stupid men follow these words without deep thinking and fall into the Three Evil Paths of Transmigration on the dissolution of the body after death This is just like that boy throwing the turtle into the water 
EPILOGUE BY THE REVEREND SANGHA SUNA I have compiled this sutra with joking words that may spoil the Truth 
The question here is whether they are in accord with the Truth Still like the bitter medicine that blends with rock honey can cure the most severe diseases So also may this sutra 
As with strong medicine the humorous joking words are used in the correct doctrine of the Buddha The correct doctrine of Buddhism and its deep meditation illuminate the world like someone taking a purgative to cleanse the body 
Agada medicine is wrapped in tree leaves The leaves should be dropped after the medicine is taken or smeared over the wound 
The humorous joking words are like the wrappings while the truth is inside The wise men will take the Truth but discard the humorous joking words 

VERSES OF THE DOCTRINE WITH PARABLES Translated by the ascetics Fachii and Fali during the Western Chin Dynasty Volume One Impermanence At one time the five qualities of Sakra Lord of the Gods left him He knew that his life would end and that he would descend to be born in the world conceived in the womb of an ass in a pottery 
What do they say are the five qualities 
First the light about the person is extinguished Second the flowers above the head wither Third one wants to leave ones seat Fourth the perspiration under the armpits is strongsmelling 
Fifth defilement sticks to the body Because of these five things he knew that his merit had ended and he felt utterly dejected 
He recalled that only the Buddha might save people from their hardship in the three realms so he hastened to where the Buddha dwelled 
At that time the Buddha was sitting in meditation in a cave on Mount Grdhrakuta having entered the samadhi of universal rescue 
When the Lord of the Gods saw the Buddha he kowtowed did obeisance and prostrated himself and earnestly took the triple refuge in the Buddha in his Doctrine  and in his Community  Before he could stand up his life suddenly ended He then arrived in a pottery as the young in the belly of a sheass 
The ass then pulled herself loose and ran around in the pottery breaking the earthenware Her owner beat her and as a result injured her pregnant womb Sakras spirit immediately returned to his old body Endowed anew with the five qualities he was the b The Scriptural Text 
The Buddha awoke from his samadhi and he said in praise Excellent it is Lord of the Gods when you can take refuge in the Three Honorable Things the Buddha Dharma and Sangha when you are about to die When the retribution for your evil is over you will not suffer again 
 Then the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas Formations are impermanent that is to say it is their nature to arise and to pass away When they have come into being they suddenly pass away Their allayment means happiness 
When for instance a potter makes earthenware with diluted earth it will all break It is the same with a mans life 
When Lord Sakra heard the stanzas he knew that impermanence was inevitable He recognized that evil and merit change he understood that arising and passing away are fundamental and he followed the path of tranquility He acknowledged this with joy and attained the path of the streamenterer  
The Buddha once was in a pure abode in the land of SravastI and expounded the Doctrine to gods men dragons and demons 
The queen mother of Prasenajit the ruler of the land was more than ninety years old then and she suddenly fell seriously ill Medicinal herbs did not make her better and so she died 
The king and the ministers of the land held a funeral according to the rules They moved her spirit to a grave 
When the funeral was over they passed by the Buddha on their way back They took off their garments removed their stockings and did a deep obeisance in front of the Buddha 
The Buddha told them to sit down and he asked them The clothes are coarse where you come from  King and they look different 
Why this behavior The king kowtowed and said The queen mother of the land was more than ninety years old when she recently fell seriously ill She soon passed away We have escorted her spirit and her coffin to her grave 
We are just now on our way back and while passing by we visit you O Noble Reverend The Buddha informed the king From of old to this day there have been four great fears to be born and grow old and wither to lose ones spiritual brightness through illness to lose the spirit after death and to be separated from ones loved ones These are said to be the four 
They do not give man any fixed time As all things are impermanent it is difficult to achieve permanence Everything passes in a day Mans life is like that 
As the five rivers ceaselessly flow day and night just so is the rapid passing of mans life Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanza As a river that swiftly flows and once gone will not return so is mans life Those who are gone do not return 
The Buddha informed the great king that this applies to the whole world None stays long All must die and none escapes death 
The kings of the past the Buddhas and the saints the seers with the five superknowledges they have all gone too None could stay It is useless to grieve for any harm that befalls the body 
If one mourns the deceased as a pious son one performs merits and one does what is meritorious 
One is followed by the merits as provisions someone on a long journey When the Buddha had said this the king and his ministers all rejoiced They forgot their sorrow and gave up suffering All who had come attained the Path 
Once the Buddha was in the Venuvana in Rajagrha He entered the city with his disciples After he had expounded the Doctrine upon request he left the city in the afternoon 
On his way he met someone driving a big herd of wellfed cows back to the city Bobbing up and down and twisting they bumped into each other 
Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas When for instance a cowherd with his staff takes his cattle to the pasture to feed them that would be like old agedeath They also sustain life a The Scriptural Text 
It is not just wellborn men and women but hundreds and thousands of people who amass possessions yet all will perish 
For all who have been born their lives are besieged night and day 
When the Buddha arrived in the Bamboo Garden he washed his feet stepped back and sat down Ananda came forward kowtowed and asked 
 Worldhonored One a while ago you expounded on these three stanzas along the way I still do not know their meaning 
Did you see a man driving a herd of cattle Yes I saw him The Buddha informed Ananda The herd of this butcher used to number a thousand head Every day the butcher sent someone out of the city to look for fine water and grass feeding them so that they would become fat and tall Every day he would pick out the fat ones lead them away and have them killed 
After he had killed more than half of them the remaining ones still did not take any notice They just kept bumping into each other bobbed up and down and mooed 
But why only these cattle 
The same applies to people 
Counting on their selves they do not know about impermanence They nourish themselves in a gluttonous way with the five objects of desire Cheerfully and utterly gratified they then destroy each other Because of impermanence retribution for their past is suddenly upon them when they do not expect it 
Is this any different Among those who were sitting there at the time there were two hundred monks who coveted honors Hearing the Doctrine and having encouraged themselves they achieved the six superknowledges and became arhats 
All those who were seated there felt compassion and joy and they did obeisance to the Buddha 
Once the Buddha was in Sravasti in the Anathapindada Grove in the Jetavana expounding the Doctrine to his disciples 
She was fourteen or fifteen years old beautiful and clever of speech Her father loved her very much She suddenly fell seriously ill and died immediately It was as though there were ripe wheat in the field that was consumed by fire 
He heard people say that the Buddha was a great sage and that as a teacher of gods and men he expounded the path of the scriptural texts making them forget their sorrow and doing away with their suffering 
Please Worldhonored One have pity on me and instruct me 
 The Buddha informed the brahman thusly There are four things in the world that cannot last long 
What are these four 
What is constant will certainly be impermanent wealth will certainly become poverty meeting will certainly become separation the strong will certainly die Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanza All things constant will end That which is high will nevertheless come down Any coming together implies separation 
When the brahman heard the stanza his mind suddenly opened up and he wished to become a monk As his beard and his hair fell off of themselves he became a monk Again reflecting upon the nature of impermanence he entered the path of an arhat 
Once the Buddha was on Mount Grdhrakuta in Rajagrha 
At that time there was a luscious lady in the city She was called Padma b The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables Her beauty was unparalleled in the land 
I should follow the times and enjoy my personal passion With this in mind she returned 
But the Buddha knew that Padma should be saved He changed into a woman a paragon of beauty excelling even Padma tens of thousands of times Seeking Padma out she came toward her 
So she asked the transformed person where she came from where her husband and children her father and brothers all were whether at home or away and why she was walking all alone without any attendants 
The transformed person replied I come from town and I want to return home Although I do not know you it would be nice to return together Shall we both rest and talk at the spring Padma agreed and they both went back to the spring together 
If this is the case even for this person how could I be preserved for a long time 
I must go to the Buddha and zealously apply myself to the Path She then went to the Buddha and prostrated herself Having done obeisance she explained everything she had seen to the Buddha 
The Buddha informed Padma Man has four things on which he cannot depend 
Which four 
riches when they are accumulated they will eventually be scattered Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke these stanzas When one is old beauty fades away The healthy fall ill and are ruined The body collapses putrefied 
That is the way life ends What is the use of this body something constantly dripping and smelly It is worn out by illness and suffers the calamities of old agedeath 
When one indulges in lust and is licentious evil increases One does not see the changes but life is impermanent 
One cannot depend on a son or a father or a brother Oppressed by death one does not have any relative on whom to rely 
Indeed having the quality of the Path nirvana is eternal happiness 
The Buddha said Excellent 
 Her hair fell off and she became a nun She cultivated right contemplation and became an arhat 
When all who were sitting there had heard the Buddhas explanation there was none who was not happy 
Once the Buddha was in the city of Rajagrha expounding the Doctrine in the Venuvana  
How can we not escape from this retribution of death One said I shall enter the ocean Invisible from above and not on the bottom underneath I shall stay right in the middle How could the murderous demon of impermanence know my whereabouts Another said 
I shall enter Mount Sumeru and close its surface again so that I shall never be visible How could the murderous demon of impermanence know my whereabouts Another said 
How would the murderous demon of impermanence know my whereabouts Another said 
We calculate that we have seven days left to live We want to flee for our lives now and we hope we will be able to escape After our return we shall personally visit you 
 Thereupon they parted and each went to his own place 
When the period of seven days was over the life of each one ended like fruit that is ripe and falls 
The market supervisor informed the king that there was a brahman who had suddenly died in the market 
The king understood and said The four men were going to escape from their retribution One is already dead 
I wonder if they can still avoid it The Buddha said to the great king that human beings have four things from which they cannot escape 
What are the four 
being in an intermediate state one cannot but experience birth 
Second being born one cannot but experience old age 
having grown old one cannot but experience illness 
Fourth being ill one cannot but experience death 
Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas Neither in the air nor in the sea nor in the depths of a mountain cave is there a place on earth where one might escape and not experience death 
It is my duty this is my task I shall act so that I shall bring about what is right People fret about this and they go through the sorrows of old age and death 
Knowing this one can appease oneself thus seeing the end of birth O monks reject Maras soldiers and be delivered from the birth and death cycle 
When the king heard the Buddhas words he said in admiration 
Excellent This is truly in accord with your teaching O Reverend The four men were going to escape from their retribution but one has already died 
The same will happen to the others sharing their fate Among the ministers and officials there was none who did not have faith 
Training Once the Buddha was in the land of Sravasti in the pure abode of the Jetavana 
The Buddha informed the monks Diligently cultivate the Path and avoid the rise of any hindrance When your mind is clear and your spirit is concentrated you can escape any suffering There was a monk whose determination was not fully clear 
Having eaten his fill he went to his room closed the door and quietly went to sleep Fond of his own self and light in mind he could not contemplate impermanence Because he was dull and lazy day or night meant nothing to him anymore 
After seven days his life would surely end The Buddha had pity on him He feared that he would fall into an evil path So he entered the monks room snapped his fingers to wake him up and said 
You gadfly conch oyster or worm you are covered with impurity 
In your delusion you assume you are a person You are covered with sores and your mind is afflicted with ailments Meeting with any hardship all you do is resort to sleep 
Reflect and do not be negligent To be a human being apply yourself to a path of benevolence As a result you will not know sorrow Always keep it in mind to extinguish your intentions 
He who has correct views and applies himself to strengthen them stands out brightly in the world The merit he produces is thousandfold and he will never fall into an evil path 
The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables When the monk heard the stanzas he immediately woke up startled Seeing that the Buddha himself was admonishing him his respect increased and he gasped with fright So he rose kowb towed and did obeisance to the Buddha 
The Buddha said to the monk Would it be that you know your former lives The monk answered I am beset by hindrances 
Once in the time of the Buddha Vipasyin you went forth but you coveted personal honors and you were not mindful of the disciplinary prescriptions in the scriptural texts Having eaten to the full you withdrew to sleep not mindful of impermanence Your life ended and you were reborn among gadflies You accumulated fifty thousand years and your life ended 
You later became a conch and an oyster and a worm in a tree for fifty thousand years each 
These four kinds of insects live in lasting obscurity They are egoistic and long for life They like to stay in seclusion Obscurity is their home and they do not see any light 
Only now has your evil come to an end and have you become an ascetic Why do you not get enough of sleeping Thereupon the monk again heard about his previous causality and he felt mortified and reproved himself 
The clouds of the five hindrances dissipated and he immediately attained arhatship 
Once the Buddha was in the land of SravastI in the Anathapindada Grove in the Jetavana together with gods and men expounding the Doctrine with the four classes  
While meditating he thought It is my penis 
He returned to his quarters shut the door and took off his clothes He sat down upon a wooden board with the intention of chopping off his penis Just because of this penis I am made to suffer passing through the birth and death cycle for countless eons The three depraved destinations and the six creatures all result from lust 
If I do not cut this off I shall not have any way of obtaining the Path The Buddha knew what was on his mind and how foolish he was The Path results from restraining the thoughts Thoughts are the foundation Ignorant of his mortality he hurts himself 
He will fall into evil and experience suffering for a long time Thereupon the Worldhonored One entered the monks quarters and asked him What are you trying to do 
 The monk greeted the Buddha and stated I have been applying myself to the Path for a long time but I do not understand the way of the Doctrine yet Every time I sit in meditation I am steeped in desire just when I am about to obtain the Path My virility is so potent that I am confused and remain in darkness 
That is why I borrowed a hatchet wanting to do away with it The Buddha informed the monk How foolish you are You do not understand the principle 
If one wants to seek the Path one must first eliminate ones foolishness and then control ones thoughts Thoughts are the basis of good and evil 
If you want to do away with your roots you must first of all control your thoughts When your thoughts are calmed and your mind clear you will obtain the Path Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanza 
If he applies himself first to relinquish the thought of his mother if he guides the rulers two ministers and if he gives up all attendants he is a superior man of the Path 
The Buddha informed the monk Delusion is the basis of the twelve causes  Delusion is the source of all evil Knowledge c The Scriptural Text 
Only when you have first eliminated delusion will your mind be settled After the Buddha had said this the monk was ashamed and so he reproved himself and said Ever since I was misled by my foolishness I have never understood the old scriptures so that I am like this Your explanation just now O Buddha is truly wonderful He internally considered right concentration and breathing while counting  
Guarding his mind and restraining his thoughts he subdued his affections and shut out all desire and so his mind was settled In the presence of the Buddha he attained arhatship 
Once the Buddha was on Mount Grdhrakta in the land of Rjagrha explaining the doctrine of immortality to gods and men to the king and his high officials 
There was one monk who was willful and reckless The Buddha knew how he was and sent him to a valley of spirits in the mountains He had him sit down under a tree to count his breaths and practice concentration Knowing the length and brevity of the breaths npna guards the mind 
There are only demons who frequently come to frighten people While he was thinking in this way and before he went back the Worldhonored One went to his side He sat down under a tree and asked himYou are alone here Arent you afraid The monk kowtowed and said 
I have never been in the mountains before I was really worried here After a while there was a wild elephant king who came by He lay down against a tree happy all by himself How pleasant to be away from the other elephants The Buddha knew what was on the elephants mind and he said to the monk 
Would you know where this elephant comes from He replied 
I do not know The Buddha informed the monk The size of this elephants herd is more than five hundred head Wearied by the small elephants he left them and came here Lying down against a tree he is thinking how pleasing it is to have left the prison of love 
An elephant may be an animal but he thinks about a solitary abode How much more must you leave your family and seek salvation But in fact because of your loneliness you seek companionship 
One is often hurt by foolish companions One who stays alone has no antagonists and is free from scheming It is better to develop the Path all alone 
There is no need for a foolish companion Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas If one does not have a companion in learning nor a good friend one had better safeguard ones own good conduct rather than associate with a fool a  
Finding joy in the precepts and training in living why would one need the doings of a companion 
Be virtuous on your own and free from grief like the elephant in the open wilderness 
When the Buddha expounded this the monk understood He internally considered the noble teaching and became an arhat 
The spirits in the valley all understood too and became the Buddhas disciples They accepted the precepts and did not frighten people any more 
The Buddha returned to the pure abode together with the monks 
Once the Buddha was in the land of Sravasti in the pure abode of the Jetavana expounding the scriptural Doctrine to gods and men 
In the land of Rajagrha there were two novice monks who wanted The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables to meet the Buddha 
Between the two countries however there was a desert without any people At that time there was a drought and the springs were dry The two monks were starving and thirsty gasping feverishly In an old spring they found plenty of water but tiny insects made it impossible for them to drink it 
We did not imagine that we would die here today One said Let us drink some water to save our lives When we go and see the Buddha how will he know the circumstances The other responded 
However one should keep the precepts and die rather than violate the precepts and live So the first one stood up quickly drank with utmost eagerness and then continued on his way 
The other one did not drink and consequently brought about his own death but he was immediately reborn in the Trayastrimsa heaven After consideration and selfexamination he knew that in his previous life he had kept and not violated the precepts 
As I am reborn here now truly a meritorious retribution is not far off  
Holding fragrant flowers he descended to the Buddha He greeted the Buddha stepped back and stood aside 
The one who had drunk some water arrived a few days later exhausted by the journey He saw that the Buddhas spiritual qualities were utterly venerable and imposing He kowtowed and having greeted him he stated with tears in his eyes My one companion has died yonder 
I want you O Buddha to know that The Buddha said 
I already know The Buddha pointed with his finger and said Well this heavenly person was your companion He kept the precepts intact was reborn in heaven and arrived here first 
 Thereupon the Worldhonored One bared his breast and showed it to him You see my appearance but you do not keep my precepts Even though you may say that you see me I do not see you 
That person who has followed the precepts of the scriptures though ten thousand miles away from me is here before my eyes 
 Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas When one is learned in ones training and when he keeps the precepts and does not break them he is praised in both worlds His wishes will be fulfilled 
When one has little learning in ones training and does not completely keep the precepts he experiences suffering in both worlds His wishes will not be fulfilled 
He who is in training has two things he is always close to the learned and dwelling in the truth he understands the meaningful 
Then when the monk heard the stanzas he felt mortified and kowtowed He repented his error and silently thought about what he had done 
When the heavenly person heard the stanzas his mind was pleased and he obtained the eye of the Doctrine There was none in the crowd of gods and men who did not follow the instructions 
T The Very Learned Once there was a poor family in the land of Sravasti Husband and wife were stingy and they did not believe in the virtue of the Path The Buddha felt pity for their foolishness Looking like a poor ascetic he went to their gate to beg for food 
The husband was not in at the time but his wife scolded him beyond reason 
The ascetic said to her I am a man of the Path and I live on alms 
You do not have to scold me I am just looking forward to some food The masters wife said If you stood there dying you still would not get any food How much less so if you want my food now that you are healthy 
You had better go away at once The ascetic then kept standing in front of her He stared gave his last breath and appeared to be dead His body was swollen and out of his nose and mouth came worms His belly burst and his bowels were in a state of decomposition and impurities flowed forth 
When the wife saw him she was alarmed and lost her voice She ran away and left him 
Thereupon the man of the Path was suddenly gone Some miles away from her home she sat down underneath a tree to rest 
The husband met his wife while he was on his way back home and he wondered why she was afraid 
The wife told him that there was this ascetic whose appearance terrified her Upon seeing him she was so afraid 
The husband became angry and asked where the ascetic might be 
He is gone but I think he is not yet far away The husband took his bow and girded on his sword Looking for tracks he went after the ascetic Flexing his bow and with drawn sword he ran straight ahead with the intention of chopping down the The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables man of the Path 
The man of the Path then magically created a wall of lapis lazuli and surrounded himself with it The husband ran several times along the wall but could not get through So he asked the man of the Path why he did not open the gate 
The man of the Path replied If you want me to open the gate throw away your bow and sword The husband thought to himself I must follow his words 
I have thrown away my bow and sword 
Why doesnt the gate open The man of the Path said 
I want you to throw away the bow and sword stemming from the evil intentions in your mind 
The man of the Path is a supernaturally noble one who knows my thoughts He immediately kowtowed and repented his mistake 
I have a wicked wife who does not recognize a man of truth She is the instigator of my wickedness Please have compassion and do not abandon us now I would like you to exhort her to train in the Path So he stood up and went back to his wife who asked him 
Where is the ascetic Her husband gave a full explanation of his miraculous power and replied He is back there c now You should reform yourself by extinguishing your evil 
Which qualities of the Path did you practice to bring about such wondrous excellence The man of the Path answered My extensive learning is insatiable and I unremittingly follow the Doctrine 
because of these one opens the Path and brings about nirvana Thereupon the man of the Path spoke the stanzas Because one firmly maintains extensive learning and pursues the Dharma one becomes like a hard wall ones zeal then does not break down At that point morality and wisdom are accomplished 
Great learning makes ones resolve clear As it is clear wisdom increases As wisdom sets in one widely understands the essence of things 
Great learning can remove sorrow and with concentration promote joyfulness Explaining the law of immortality well one brings about the gaining of nirvana 
He who as a result of his learning rejects what is improper arrives at the state of immortality 
When the man of the Path had spoken the stanzas he showed the bright appearance of the Buddha His ample radiance was glorious illuminating heaven and earth 
The husband and wife were frightened and their spirits were terrified They abandoned their evils and cleansed their thoughts beating their heads on the ground 
Once the Buddha was in the pure abode of Ghosila in Kausambi together with the four classes explaining the great Dharma 
One day he was walking in the marketplace carrying a torch and someone asked him Why are you walking with a torch in your hand in the daytime The brahman answered 
The Buddha knew that the brahman should be saved because of his previous merits Still his behavior was haughty seeking dominance and fame He did not take impermanence into account His selfconceit and arrogance were such that he would fall into the hell of Mount Tai for countless eons and to escape it would be very difficult 
So the Buddha transformed himself into a worthy and sat down in the marketplace Then he asked the brahman why he was acting in this way 
The brahman replied Because people are in darkness and cannot distinguish clearly between night and day I illuminate them with the flame of my torch The worthy again asked the brahman 
a Among the scriptural texts are the four Vedas Do you know their essential teachings He replied I have no clear idea 
What are their four essential teachings 
One harmonization of the four seasons through knowledge of astronomy and geography Two distinction of the five elements through knowledge of the constellations Three being able to pacify the country through knowledge of government Four unfailing firmness through knowledge of military affairs 
Dont you possess these teachings of the four Vedas The brahman was ashamed 
He threw away his torch and crossed his hands 
The Buddha knew what was on his mind and transformed himself back into his own self His light shone brightly on both heaven and earth With a divine voice he then spoke this stanza to the brahman If one has limited learning and considers oneself so great as to be arrogant toward others then the one who holds the torch is the blind one 
After the Buddha had spoken the stanza he said to the brahman No one is in more complete darkness than you but you have entered a great country with a torch in your hand during the daytime 
He immediately kowtowed and wished to be his disciple 
The Buddha accepted him and let him become an ascetic His thoughts were resolved his foolishness ended and he became an arhat 
Once there was an important elder in the land of Sravasti His name was Sudatta and he had obtained the status of a streamenterer 
He had a friend an elder called Haoshih who did not believe in the Buddhas path or in any therapeutic technique He happened one day to fall seriously ill Failing in energy he had to keep to his bed 
His relatives and friends all went to ask how he was They insisted that he seek treatment but he would not agree at all 
He replied to everyone I have served the sun and moon and been loyal and pious toward the ruler and my father Even if my life were to end here I shall never change my mind 
Sudatta said to him The teacher I serve is called the Buddha His divine qualities spread far and wide Those who see him gain good fortune 
Because your illness will last and will not get better soon I insist that you invite the Buddha and I hope you will receive his good fortune As the day was auspicious Haoshih You may invite the Buddha and his disciples for me Sudatta immediately invited the Buddha and his Sangha 
As he went to the elders home the Buddha emitted a bright light that penetrated everywhere When the elder saw the light he felt happy and relieved 
The Buddha went to him and sat down He asked the elder how his illness was which spirits he had served before and which therapy he had applied 
Since my forefathers time we have followed these practices until we die The Buddha said to the elder When one is born into the world there are three kinds of untimely death To have a disease that does not heal is the first b untimely death To heal but not to be cautious is the second untimely death 
Such illnesses cannot be done away with by the sun or the moon by heaven or earth or by serving forefathers ones ruler or ones father It will be relieved in time through the path of knowledge 
First the temperature of the four elements requires healing herbs Second the evil demons of any heresy require the precepts of the scriptures Third serving the noble relieves misery virtue affects the spirits and merit helps beings 
 Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas One serves the sun because of its light and one serves ones father out of gratitude One serves ones ruler because of his power One serves a man of the Path because of his learning 
If one wants to win one relies on vigor The Doctrine resides in wisdom Meritorious conduct is always clear 
One examines ones friends when making plans and one leaves ones companion in case of urgency One looks on ones wife when happy in the bedchamber If one wants to know knowledge lies in the discourses 
An able teacher shows the Path He resolves doubts so that one may commend clear learning He also cleanses the foundations of purity ably maintaining the storehouse of the Doctrine 
Learning brings benefit to wife and child to elders and younger brothers and to friends in the present world It also brings about merit for the later world Through the accumulation of learning one becomes noble and wise 
Because one can comprehend it one may understand what is meaningful With understanding the precepts will not be broken He who has received the Doctrine and maintains it will accordingly quickly achieve tranquility 
He will be able to disperse sorrowful distress and do away with ominous decay If you wish to secure tranquility and prosperity you must serve the learned 
There were once vast mountains in the south of the land of Rajaghra two hundred miles away from the city The roads to every country in the south passed through these mountains 
They were treacherous and deep and infested by five hundred bandits who robbed the people traveling through the passes Afterwards the spoils were freely scattered about The merchants were ruined and the kings way blocked The king pursued the bandits to punish them but he could not capture them 
The Buddha was in the land then and felt pity for the people considering that those c bandits did not know evil from good The Tathagata is in the world but their eyes do not see him The drum of the Dharma is beaten every day but their ears do not hear it If I do not go to save them they will fall like rocks into an abyss He changed into a man wearing splendid clothes 
He rode a horse and The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables had a sword on his waist and a bow and arrows in his hands His saddle and bridle were decorated adorned with gold and silver and he let bright moonpearls hang down from his horse Making music on horseback he went into the mountains 
When bandits saw him they thought the job was as good as done They had been bandits for many years but had not yet had such an opportunity as this Would this be any different from throwing eggs at a rock 
The whole band of bandits got together and surrounded the traveler They pulled their bows and drew their swords 
While they were arguing about which one would strip him clean the transformed person raised his bow and shot once with the result that the five hundred bandits were all hit by arrows He pointed at them with his sword and all of them were wounded Their wounds were serious the arrows struck deep and they all fell down 
All five hundred bandits lay twisting on the ground They kowtowed and submitted What spirit are you that you have such supernatural powers 
Please quickly pull out the arrows so that the wounds may heal 
Our wounds now hurt unbearably The transformed person answered These wounds do not hurt The arrows are not deep No wound is more serious in the world than sorrow 
There is no injury worse than foolishness So long as you cherish the sorrows of greed and injurious thoughts your sword wounds and poisonous arrow wounds can never heal 
The roots of these two things are much deeper The valiant and the strong cannot pull them out 
Only when one possesses the moral prescripts of the scriptures and becomes learned in the meaningfulness of wisdom can this path of insight cure mental diseases These prescripts remove sorrowful craving foolishness and haughtiness They suppress violence luxury and covetousness 
They are only removed by learning The blind gain their sight through it and one in darkness obtains a candle It leads people in the world just as someone who sees leads those who do not see 
Therefore one who gives up delusion who is free from pride and the joy of luxury who applies himself and serves the learned he is called the one who has accumulated virtues 
When the five hundred men saw the Buddhas shining appearance and had also heard these stanzas they kowtowed and took refuge in him They subdued their thoughts and repented Meanwhile the swords wounds and poisonous arrows were removed by themselves They were happy and their minds opened up to accept the five precepts 
Earnest Faith a There was once a big river southeast of the city of Sravasti Its waters were deep and wide More than five hundred families lived along its banks They had not yet heard about the qualities of the Path or the way of salvation from the worldly 
The Worldhonored One constantly thought he should go there to save those among them who should be saved He knew that these families should be saved by their merits Thereupon the Worldhonored One went to the riverbank and sat down under a tree 
When the villagers saw the Buddhas bright appearance they found it extraordinary and there was none who was not impressed They all went to pay their respects Some saluted and some bowed asking how he was 
The Buddha told them to sit down and he expounded the Doctrine of the scriptural texts The crowd heard it but they did not believe in it because they were used to fraud and were skeptical of any true words 
The Buddha then magically caused someone to appear coming from the south of the river Walking on the water just wet to his ankles he came to the Buddha He kowtowed and greeted the Buddha 
When the crowd saw this there was none who was not astonished They asked the transformed person From the time of our ancestors we have lived on these shores yet we have never heard of anyone walking on water Who are you sir 
What kind of magic do you have that you are able to tread on water and not drown 
Please explain it to us The transformed person answered I am a foolish person from The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables south of the river When I heard that the Buddha was here I wanted to enjoy the virtues of the Path but when I arrived at the southern shore I could not cross in time 
I asked someone on the shore whether the water was deep or shallow He said 
The water may reach up to your ankles Why do you not wade across I trusted his words and just crossed over like that 
 The Buddha then said in praise Excellent 
Excellent If you have faith you may truly cross the abyss of birth and death Why be astonished about walking across a river that is a few li wide Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas 
If one practices devout conduct one is praised by the noble One who enjoys the unconditioned is delivered from any bond 
With faith the Path can be obtained The Doctrine engenders cessation Through learning wisdom is obtained In what is attained there is clearness 
When the alert mind practices faith and morality well the strong man surpasses hate and so he is freed from the abyss 
When the villagers heard the Buddhas exposition their faith was realized Their minds opened up and their faith was firm They all received the five precepts and became people of pure faith As their pure faith was developed the teaching of the Doctrine was spread throughout the world 
Long ago when the Buddha was in the world there was an important elder called Hsiuloto  His wealth was immeasurable and he was devoutly attuned to the qualities of the Path He had vowed that he would always invite the Buddha and his Sangha on the eighth day of the twelfth month and that after his death his son and grandson would always honor the vow 
When b the elder was dying he ordered his son not to abandon the practice 
His son was called Piloto  Later he became poorer and poorer and had nothing in the house When the twelfth month arrived he had nothing to offer He was sad and unhappy 
The Buddha sent Maudgalyayana to go and ask Viradha The month of your fathers obligation is coming what plans do you have Viradha answered 
On the eighth day at noon he may radiate his brightness and have a closer look Maudgalyayana then returned and reported everything 
Viradha then took his wife to his fatherinlaw to borrow a hundred taels of gold 
On his returning home he provided for everything The Buddha went to his house with one thousand two hundred fifty monks When they had taken their seats they passed the water around and ate Having cleansed themselves they returned to their pure abode 
Viradha was glad and did not feel any contrition On that day in the middle of the night precious objects replenished his storehouse filling it as in the past 
When Viradha and his wife saw this the next morning they were glad but also afraid They were afraid that officials might see the treasures and ask where they had come from 
Husband and wife discussed the matter and decided that he should go and ask the Buddha 
So he went to the Buddha and explained the whole situation 
The Buddha told Viradha Put your mind at rest and feel free to use these treasures Do not be suspicious By your devout conduct you did not offend against your fathers instructions 
When a wise person can develop  no matter whether one is a man or a The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables woman or where ones place of birth is a meritorious reward follows by itself Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas 
Through faith one guards morality constantly pure when contemplating Walking in wisdom one serves the teaching and does not forget it 
When one has these riches in life no matter whether one is a man or a woman one is never poor The wise know this to be true 
When Viradha heard the Buddhas explanation his earnest faith increased He kowtowed at the Buddhas feet and returned home with joy He made a complete analysis of the Buddhas teaching and instructed his wife and children They then carried it out and all attained the Path 
Morality Long ago there were mountains in the land of Benares about forty or fifty li away from the city Five ascetics lived in the mountains applying themselves to the Path 
At dawn they left the mountains to beg for food After they had eaten they returned to the mountains arriving at dusk Going and returning was so very wearisome that they were not able to sit in meditation and develop right concentration For years it was like that and they could not obtain the Path 
The Buddha felt compassion for their fruitless efforts He changed into a man of the Path and went to them He asked these men aspiring for the Path if it was not too hard to develop the Path dwelling in seclusion 
It will be just like that all our lives The man of the Path said Well he who considers the Path should take morality as its basis and mental restraint as its practice but if you despise the body while valuing the truth you will reject your corporal life So sustain your body with food and guard your mind in right concentration If you internally apply yourself to tranquility and insight you will appease your mind and attain the Path 
Please men aspiring for the Path do not go tomorrow I shall give you nourishment so that you may rest one day So the five ascetics were very happy c The Scriptural Text 
With appeased thoughts and a settled mind they did not worry about going to beg any more 
At noon the next day the transformed man of the Path came to bring them food After their meal they were content their minds tranquil Thereupon the transformed man expounded the stanzas When a monk is established morally he restrains his faculties 
Subduing his thoughts with moral conduct he preserves proper concentration of mind Internally practicing tranquility and insight he is free from forgetfulness and has right knowledge 
When a wise one guards his moral nature he internalizes right knowledge When he practices the Path accordingly he purifies himself and removes suffering 
When the transformed man of the Path had spoken these stanzas he manifested the bright characteristics of the Buddhas body Thereupon the five ascetics were spiritually moved Grateful for his kindness they kept the precepts and obtained arhatship 
Mindfulness When the Buddha was once in the world King Pukkasati and King Bimbisara were friends 
Upon receiving them King Bimbisara in turn presented them to the Buddha He said to the Buddha King Pukkasati is a good friend of mine and he has sent me these flowers I now present them to you O Buddha 
With what shall I respond to what he has sent me The Buddha informed King Bimbisara Copy the scriptural text on the twelve causes and present it to him 
Upon receiving the scriptural text his mind is sure to turn to zealous devotion He then copied the scriptural text and added a letter saying You sent me precious flowers I now present you this bouquet of the Doctrine Carefully reflect on its meaning 
Donning the robe of the Dharma and a The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables with alms bowl in hand he went to a potters home outside the city of Rajagrha to spend the night The following day he went to the city to beg and after he had eaten he went to the Buddha to receive the precepts 
The Buddha knew with supernatural knowledge that Pukkasatis life would end the following day at mealtime and that he therefore should not come from so far away to meet with him Furthermore it would be a great pity if he did not hear the scriptures Thereupon the Worldhonored One transformed himself into an ascetic He went to the potter and asked permission to spend the night 
You may stay with him in the pottery there He took some straw entered the pottery and sat down to one side 
I have not met the Buddha yet 
When I learned about the twelve causes I became an ascetic Tomorrow I shall enter the city and after my meal of alms food I shall go to meet the Buddha The transformed ascetic said 
Mans life is hazardous with changes occurring from morning till night In its impermanence the retribution of past deeds emerges all of a sudden and not at any fixed time Just observe your body as a coming together of the four great elements It is the result of their combination as well as their dissipation each returning to its origin 
Develop an awakened mind characterized by emptiness purity and thoughtlessness Be especially mindful of the three respectful doctrines and of giving and the quality of morality To know impermanence is no different from meeting the Buddha Your thinking of tomorrow is a profitless thought The transformed ascetic then spoke the stanzas 
Those who know and have awakened their minds are the disciples of the Buddha Day and night they are constantly mindful of the Buddha Dharma and Sangha Be mindful of your body and its impermanent nature Be mindful of morality and the virtue of giving 
Day and night be mindful of emptiness aimlessness and signlessness The transformed ascetic in the pottery then expounded the essence of impermanence to Pukkasati 
When the Buddha knew that the king understood he manifested the splendor and auspicious luminous marks of his Buddha body 
King Pukkasati was surprised and in rapture 
The Buddha again informed him The retribution of evil is impermanent Do not be afraid when it is over When King Pukkasati said 
The following day when it was time to eat King Pukkasati entered the city to beg for alms food At the gate of the city he encountered a cow that had just borne her young Protecting her calf she butted against King Pukkasati to kill him 
The Buddha sent his disciples to cremate him and erect a stupa The Buddha said to his disciples 
It is impossible not to heed the basis of the retribution of evil b Kindness Once the Buddha was in Rajagrha and mountains existed five hundred li away In the mountains there was a family of one hundred twentytwo members whose occupation was hunting in the marshes of the mountains 
They wore furs and ate meat and had never cultivated the land 
With noble insight the Buddha knew that they could be saved He went to the family and sat down under a tree 
The men had gone off to hunt and only the women were there When they saw the Buddhas bright appearance illuminating heaven and earth and the trees and rocks in the mountains changing to gold the young and old were ecstatic Knowing that the Buddha was a supernatural person they all went to pay their respects brought offerings and sat down 
The Buddha explained to the mothers the wrong of killing living beings the merit of practicing kindness and that any affection between two persons is momentary and any union will soon end in parting 
Upon hearing the scriptural text the mothers rejoiced and said to the Buddha We mountain people are eager to take life in order to have meat to eat We want to present some to you as a small offering 
We hope you will accept it The Buddha informed the mothers It is the rule of any Buddha not to eat meat As I have already had my meal you need not provide anything else He then instructed them 
When man eats the five cereals he feels pity for living beings and the wriggling species There is no creature that does not want to live When one kills others to keep oneself alive calamitous evil does not end 
When one is compassionate and does not kill one is without calamity from generation to generation Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the following stanzas He who is compassionate and does not kill and who can constantly control himself dwells in immortality 
He is in a place where there is no calamity He who does not kill and is compassionate who is cautious in his speech and guards his thoughts dwells in immortality 
He is in a place where there is no calamity He who graciously does not interfere who does not harm living beings and who does not annoy anyone deserves the brahma heaven 
He who is always compassionate and pure in accordance with the teachings of the Buddha experiences satisfaction and quietude He transcends birth and death 
When the Buddha had spoken the stanzas the men returned from their hunting Their women were listening to the scriptures and did not go to welcome them as was the custom 
The husbands were suspicious and they wondered why things were not as usual They abandoned the meat and came back thinking that something strange was going on They came back and saw that all the women were sitting in front of the Buddha listening to the scriptures with folded hands They became angry and drew their bows intent on destroying the Buddha 
But the women remonstrated saying He is a supernatural person Do not give rise to any evil thoughts 
 Therefore each repented his sins and did obeisance to the Buddha 
The Buddha again explained to them the merit of not killing and the evil of doing harm 
The husbands unic derstood knelt deeply and said to the Buddha We grew up deep in the mountains maintaining ourselves by hunting Our evil misdeeds have accumulated Which rule should we follow in order to escape grave misfortune Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas 
Acting kindly and compassionately and saving beings with universal love one gains the eleven praises and good fortune always follows 
He is not rebuked nor met with hostilities He does not perish by water or by fire He obtains gain wherever he is and when dead he ascends to the brahma heaven These are the eleven  
When the Buddha had spoken the stanzas the one hundred twentytwo men and women young and old were glad and devoutly accepted them They all subscribed to the five precepts 
The Buddha told King Bimbisara to give them land and to present them with cereals 
The conversion to benevolence was widespread and throughout the land there was peace 
Then the kings mother fell ill Failing in energy she had to keep to her bed He sent for doctors but he did not receive any medical drafts He sent for wise women seeking for them everywhere 
He again summoned the brahmans in the land and some two hundred people came He invited them in had them sit down offered them food and drink and informed them My mother has been ill for a long time I do not know what brought this about 
You have great knowledge and clear understanding of the principles of physiognomy and of heaven and earth and its constellations The Scriptural Text 
Verses of the Doctrine with Parables Why is it that you are unable to tell me what to do The brahmans said The constellations stand in the wrong position and yin and yang are not in harmony 
That is why this has occurred The king said 
What is the right thing to do so that she may recover The brahmans said In a peaceful and pure place outside of the city you should sacrifice to the four mountains and to the sun and moon and the constellations You should obtain a hundred animals of all kinds including a boy kill them and offer them to heaven 
O king you should personally lead your mother there and kneel and do obeisance and beg for her life 
Only then will she recover So the king provided them as instructed As the boy and a hundred head of elephants horses cows and sheep were driven they cried out sadly along the way moving heaven and earth Leaving through the eastern gate the king was going to the sacrificial altar to kill and offer them to heaven 
As the Worldhonored Ones great compassion saves all beings he pitied this kings utter foolishness 
How can he give rise to evil by killing many beings in order to save one person Thereupon the Worldhonored One led his great assembly to this land At the eastern gate of the city he met the king and the brahmans on their way out The animals they were driving came out crying sadly 
The king saw the Buddha in the distance like the sun that has just risen or the full moon His radiance brightly lit up heaven and a earth When the people saw him they were all filled with love and reverence They all wanted to rid themselves of the animals they were driving as well as the sacrificial implements 
The king then advanced and descended from his carriage He removed his parasol and did obeisance to the Buddha He crossed his fingers knelt and made inquiries to the Worldhonored One 
The Buddha told him to rise and asked him where he was going 
He folded his hands and answered The queen mother has been ill for a long time I have consulted the finest physicians and the spirits everywhere Now I only want to go and allay the constellations the four mountains and the five sacred peaks 
If you want to obtain cereals to eat you must plow and sow If you want to obtain great wealth you must practice giving If you want to obtain a long life you must show great compassion If you want to obtain wisdom you must apply yourself to learning 
If you practice these four things you will gain their fruits as they are sown 
A wealthy and honorable family does not covet the food of the humble The gods take the seven precious things for their abode Their clothing and food come naturally 
Sacrificing to licentiousness is like considering what is wrong to be right If one kills life to seek life one is far from the path of life If one kills the life of many in order to save one person how could one succeed that way 
Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanza If one lives a hundred years diligently serving the spirits in the world the sacrifice of elephants and horses would not be the same as one act of compassion 
When the Buddha had spoken the stanza he cast a bright glow that illuminated heaven and earth All in the three woeful destinations and in the eight inopportune births were happy each one in his place 
King Homo heard the exposition of the wonderful Doctrine and he saw the bright glow He was overjoyed and obtained the Path 
When his sick mother heard the Doctrine her five feelings lit up and her ailment disappeared 
When the two hundred brahmans had seen the Buddhas bright appearance and once again heard his words they felt shame and regret and they desired to become his disciples 
The Buddha accepted them all and they became ascetics each one obtaining his wish 
The king and his ministers invited the Buddha When they had worshiped him for a month he left The kings rule was just according to the Doctrine and therein the land flourished 
Words Once King Pukkasati entered the city of Rajagrha to beg for alms At the gate of the city he was butted to death by a cow that had recently brought forth young 
The owner of the cow was alarmed and he sold the cow and turned it over to someone else 
When that man was pulling the cow to water it the cow again butted its master to death from behind 
That owner had a son who became extremely angry He took the cow to be killed and sold the meat in the market 
There was a farmer who bought the head of the cow He carried it with a rope over his shoulder and took it home Further than a li from his home he sat down under a tree to rest and hung the head of the cow from a branch After a while the rope broke and the cows head fell right on top of him 
In one day the cow had killed a total of three people 
When King Bimbisara heard this he wondered why So he went with his ministers to where the Buddha was After he had done obeisance upon arrival he sat apart on the kings throne He folded his hands and said to the Buddha 
Very odd it is O Worldhonored One that one cow kills three people 
 The Buddha informed King Bimbisara The retribution of a misdemeanor has an origin It does not happen just now The king said 
When the old woman returned and did not see the merchants she asked her neighbors who said they had all gone 
The old woman was furious So she went looking for them and after a wearisome pursuit she caught up with them and demanded the rent for the house 
The three merchants scolded her instead saying We already paid you Why do you ask again They all as one contradicted her and they did not want to pay the rent 
The old woman was alone and weak and could not do anything Cursing them angrily she said to the three merchants I may be in distress now but why should I bear your cheating rebuttal 
As for me I vow that if I shall meet you in the place where I shall later be reborn I shall certainly kill you so that you may obtain the right path I shall never forget you I shall rest when I have killed you 
Until then I will not stop  The Buddha said to King Bimbisara The old woman at that time is now this cow 
The three merchants are the three people Pukkasati and the others who were butted to death by the cow Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas 
When one uses evil words and scolds is arrogant and despises others when one engenders such behavior hatred grows and grows 
When one speaks humbly and affably respects others rejects the bonds and bears the harshness hatred is naturally appeased 
When a man is born there is an ax in his mouth The reason why he destroys himself is because of his evil words 
When the Buddha had explained this all those in King Bimbisaras official retinue were full of respect and vowed to dedicate themselves to good conduct They did obeisance and departed 
Fundamentals in Pairs Once the king of the land of Sravasti called Prasenajit came to where the Buddha was He descended from his carriage withdrew his parasol removed his sword took off his footwear folded his hands and came forward He prostrated himself kowtowed at his feet knelt deeply and said to the Buddha I wish to arrange for a trifling meal tomorrow at the four thoroughfares 
Well as the state sovereign you should have intelligent leadership and lead your people along the Path seeking future blessedness The king said 
With utmost sincerity I ask leave to make strict preparations He prepared delicacies with his own hands and went by himself to receive the Buddha and his monks 
When they had all arrived at the four thoroughfares the Buddha came there and took his seat passed around water so that they could cleanse themselves and he poured it with his own hands 
When the Buddha had finished his meal he expounded the Doctrine to the king at the four crossroads Among the countless onlookers at that time were two merchants One thought 
This king is foolish 
He is the king of the land What more could he want 
The Buddha is like an ox and his disciples are like a cart The ox pulls the cart in all four directions The Buddha The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables is just like that 
What reason would you have to submit to and serve him Both men went away and after a journey of thirty li they stopped and lodged for the night Buying some wine they drank together and discussed their affairs 
The four kings protected the one who had had wholesome thoughts but the evil spirits on Mount Tai let the wine enter the belly of the one who had had unwholesome thoughts burning him like fire He left the inn and lay down on the road He sprawled out in the wheel tracks but in the morning five hundred merchant carts rode over him there and he died 
When his companion looked for him the next day he found him dead He said When I return to my country I shall be suspected of having killed him to take away his belongings 
There is no sense in taking this lightly So he abandoned the riches and went to another country 
The king of this land had died without a crown prince In the Book of Prophecies it says In the central region there is a humble person who will rule this land 
The former king has a divine horse which is sure to bend its knees when a new king is appointed They immediately prepared a stately carriage the divine horse and the ribbon for the official seal and they went looking for the sovereign of the land 
The national astronomer said He has a yellow cloud cover this is the aura of a ruler The divine horse bent its knees and licked the feet of the merchant 
The officials prepared fragrant hot water bathed him and saluted him as their king Thereupon he occupied the throne and tended to the affairs of the state 
It must be the Buddhas kindness that has brought this about He then went to the land of SravastI with his officials 
He kowtowed from a distance and said I do not have any merit to receive your kindness O Worldhonored One or to rule over this land I wish to be kind to the multitude of worthies tomorrow and to look after them Once in the third month the Buddha informed Ananda and ordered his monks Tomorrow you are invited by that king 
You must all transform yourselves so that the king and his people will rejoice They each used the foundations of their supernatural power to go to that country They all took their seats in the proper order dignified and according to the rules After they had eaten they washed their hands and expounded the Doctrine to the king 
The king said I am actually an insignificant person I never had any virtue to speak of 
Once that great king gave food to me to the Buddha at the four thoroughfares You O King thought a The Buddha is like a king His disciples are like his ministers You O King sowed this seed 
Now you obtain its fruition The other person said that the Buddha was like an ox and that his disciples were like a cart He sowed the calamity of being run over by a cart Now he is in the hell of Mount Tai run over by a blazing chariot and obtaining his deserts 
It is not your vigor O King that could bring this about If one does something wholesome merit follows If one does something evil misfortune follows This is ones own doing and it cannot be given by gods dragons or spirits 
Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas The mind is the origin of everything The eminence of the mind is caused by the mind If one thinks of evil either of word or deeds the suffering of sin naturally follows as a wagons wheels leave their tracks 
The mind is the origin of everything The eminence of the mind is caused by the mind If one thinks of good either of words or of deeds the happiness of merits naturally follows as the shadow follows the form 
When the Buddha had spoken the scriptural stanzas those who had heard them the king and his subjects were innumerable They were all very glad and obtained the eye of the Doctrine 
Long ago the elder Sudatta bought some land from the crown prince Together they built a pure abode and presented it to the Worldhonored One Each invited the Buddha and his Sangha and The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables made offerings for one month 
The crown prince Jeta was glad and he returned to his eastern palace Praising the Buddhas qualities he made music and rejoiced 
Jetas younger brother Virudhaka was always at the kings side The king then dressed up in plain clothes and with his courtiers and ladies in waiting went to where the Buddha was After he had kowtowed and done obeisance he intently listened to the scriptures Virudhaka stayed behind and was in charge of the throne 
His deceitful ministers Asraddha and others then hatched a treacherous plot and they said Try to wear the great kings ribbon with his official seal and sit on the throne Would you not be just like the king 
 Thereupon Virudhaka agreed with their words He donned the robe and mounted the throne The deceitful ministers all congratulated him You are just like the great king 
 Virudhaka immediately took the leadership over his followers put on his armor drew his sword and went to the pure abode of the Jetavana He deposed the great king blocking his return to the palace He battled the king s subjects in the Jetavana and killed more than five hundred of the kings courtiers 
The king fled with his ladies At the earliest dawn they reached the country of the Sakyas They became hungry along the way and the king ate radishes His belly swelled and he died 
Thereupon Virudhaka became tyrannical He drew his sword and entered the eastern palace to behead his elder brother Jeta 
Jeta knew his own impermanent nature He was not afraid and his countenance did not change color He expressed gratification with a smile and he willingly submitted to the sword b Before his life ceased he heard natural music in the sky welcoming his spirit 
The Buddha then spoke the stanzas in the Jetavana He brings about joy and he will rejoice hereafter The gooddoer rejoices in both cases He will rejoice indeed be glad 
Now he is glad and will hereafter be glad The gooddoer is glad in both cases He brings about his own good fortune Receiving his merits he is delighted 
King Virudhaka then raised an army to attack the land of the Sakyas and he killed the men of the Path of the Sakya family In his cruelty and immorality he committed all five fatal transgressions 
The Buddha predicted to Virudhaka that as he was not filial and loyal and his sins were very grave he would seven days later be burned by the fire of hell The prediction of the chief prophesier further agreed with that of the Buddha 
The king panicked He boarded a ship and went to sea I am on water now 
How could fire consume me At noon on the seventh day there was a spontaneous fire coming out of the water It burned the ship and sank it The king was burned too Consumed by the vicious heat he suddenly perished 
Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas He brings about sorrow and he will grieve hereafter The evildoer grieves in both cases He will grieve indeed be full of anxiety 
Now he repents and he will repent hereafter The evildoer repents in both cases He brings about his own misfortune Experiencing his sins he is tormented 
After the Buddha had expounded this he informed the monks Crown prince Jeta did not covet a glorious position He cherished the Path till death He was reborn high in heaven and his happiness came of itself 
King Virudhaka was foolish and he readily gave in to his desires After his death he fell into hell and the suffering he experienced was immeasurable 
The powerful and the poor throughout the world are subject to impermanence There is none who stays long And so even the superior being died 
His whole conduct was a spiritual treasure When the Buddha had said this there was none who did not accept it in faith 
The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables Beyond Mount Grdhrakuta there once were more than seventy brahmans and their families who deserved to be saved because of their previous merits The Buddha went to their village and appeared showing his supernatural power of the Path When they all saw the majesty of the Buddhas bright appearance they all respectfully bowed down 
The Buddha sat down under a tree and asked the brahmans For how many generations have you lived in these mountains 
What do you do to provide for your living They replied We have been living here for more than thirty generations We farm and raise cattle He further asked 
What practices do you observe with the aim of leaving birth and death They replied 
We serve the sun and moon water and fire 
If someone has died young and old gather and pray for his rebirth in the brahma heaven so that he may leave birth and death The Buddha said to the brahmans Farming and raising cattle sacrificing to the sun and moon and to water and fire and praying for rebirth in heaven are not the right ways to long life or to escape from the birth and death cycle 
The highest merit does not go beyond the twentyeight heavens Without the wisdom of the Path one falls back into the three woeful destinations 
Only if one goes forth develops his determic nation for purity and practices what is meaningful for tranquility may one attain nirvana 
Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas Those who consider the real as unreal and the unreal as real have wrong thoughts and will not obtain real gain 
Those who know the real as real and who upon seeing the unreal know it to be unreal will have right thoughts and will certainly obtain real gain 
Every generation knows death In the three worlds there is no happiness Although the gods are happy they too will die when their merits have been exhausted 
When considering worldly matters there is nothing produced that will not come to an end Wanting to leave the cycle of birth and death one must practice the true Path 
When the seventy brahmans had heard the Buddhas explanation they understood and were glad and they wished to become ascetics 
The Buddha said Welcome monks Their hair fell off of itself and they all became ascetics 
The Buddha and the ascetics set out for the pure abode When they were halfway there they longed for their wives and children and each wanted to withdraw It happened to rain then and they became even more depressed 
The Buddha knew what was on their minds He magically created several tens of huts along the way They entered them to get out of the rain but the huts were leaking 
Because the huts were leaking the Buddha spoke the stanzas If a house is ill thatched it will leak when it rains If the mind does not reflect on ones actions it will be penetrated by lust 
If a house is well thatched the rain will not leak through If one reflects on ones actions with an attentive mind lust is buried and does not arise 
Even though upon hearing the exposition of these stanzas the seventy ascetics did their best to pull themselves together they still felt darkness in their hearts The rain stopped and they went on their way 
On the ground there was some old paper The Buddha told a monk to pick it up Being told so he picked it up 
The Buddha asked the monks 
What kind of paper is this The monks said to the Buddha This is paper to wrap incense It may be thrown away now but it still retains its fragrance 
The Buddha continued on his way On the ground there was a broken string The Buddha told a monk to pick it up Being told so he picked it up 
The Buddha further asked 
What kind of string is this The monks said That string is foul smelling This is a string to tie up fish The Buddha said to the monks These things are The Scriptural Text 
Verses of the Doctrine with Parables fundamentally pure but they all depend on a cause to bring about what is wrong or meritorious 
It is like that paper or that string When close to fragrance it is fragrant When used to tie up fish it stinks They are gradually tainted and become accustomed to it without being aware of it 
 Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas A vile person affects others as if they were near a putrid thing Gradually being deluded they practice what is wrong and being unaware of it they accomplish what is bad 
An excellent person affects others as if they were near incense Advancing in knowledge they practice what is good and bring about a clear scent 
a When the seventy ascetics had heard these stanzas they knew that the desire for home was a foul marsh and that wife and children were fetters and handcuffs With earnest faith they went to the pure abode 
Reflecting on their actions with an attentive mind they obtained the path of the arhat 
Negligence Long ago when the Buddha was in the world there were five hundred merchants who had traveled the seas They returned to their country carrying the seven precious things in large quantities While passing deep through the mountains they were misled by evil spirits and they could not find their way out Their provisions were all used up and placed in a distressing situation they all subsequently died from hunger 
There was an ascetic then in the mountains who was applying himself to the Path Upon seeing this situation he thought to himself I have been diligent in my application to the Path for seven years but I cannot attain it Furthermore I am poor without any means to sustain myself 
These valuable goods do not have any owner 
I shall take them back and establish a home Thereupon he descended from the mountains and took precious things with him After he had stored them away somewhere he left the mountains He asked his brothers to help him carry them back home 
Just when he was halfway the Buddha remembered that this monk would surely obtain deliverance The Buddha then changed into a nun with shaved head and the robe of the Doctrine but with powdered face and painted eyebrows and strung with necklaces of gold and silver She entered the mountains through a valley and met the ascetic on her way 
She made a deep bow and asked how he was doing 
The man of the Path scolded the nun saying Is this the way to attain the Path 
But why still powder your face paint your eyebrows and wear necklaces on your person The nun answered 
He leaves his relatives applies himself to the Path dwells in the mountains and appeases his mind Why then take what is not yours In your greed you are forgetful of the Path and quick to leave your noble intentions behind 
Your birth in the world is like a journey but the retribution for your evil is longlasting Thereupon the nun expounded to him the stanzas 
The merits of keeping the precepts lead to joy Breaking the precepts however results in fearful thoughts When one can do away with the impurities of the three worlds one is close to nirvana 
Then after the nun had spoken these stanzas showed the brightness of the primary and secondary marks of his Buddha body 
When the ascetic saw this his hair stood on end with fear He kowtowed at the Buddhas feet repented his mistake and pleaded A fool makes mistakes acting contrary to the right teaching 
When he goes on without redeeming himself what will happen to him Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas When one has earlier given way to negligence but has later restrained himself well he illuminates the world 
Mindfulness to concentration is the proper attitude When one erringly has committed evil but then overturns it by means of what is wholesome he illuminates the world 
He who though young goes forth from home and fully cultivates the Buddhas teaching illuminates the world as the moon does after the clouds have parted 
When one has earlier done evil but has later ceased to offend he illuminates the world as the moon does after the clouds have parted 
When the monk had heard these stanzas his fetters were removed and his covetousness ceased He kowtowed at the Buddha s feet and he went to sit under a tree As his counting of breaths continued his tranquility and insight became pure He attained the realization of the fruition of the Path and became an arhat 
The Mind Once when the Buddha was in the world there was a man of the Path He sat under a tree on the bank of a river and applied himself to the Path but in twelve years his covetousness had not been conquered Letting go his thoughts and with a distracted mind he only held dear the six desires beauty for his eyes sounds for his ears fragrances for his nose flavors for his mouth tactility for his body and dharmas for his mind 
He transformed himself into an ascetic and went to where the man was They both lodged under a tree 
On one occasion by the light of the moon a tortoise came out from the river to the tree There also was a hungry otter looking for food He saw the tortoise and wanted to eat it but the tortoise drew in its head tail and four legs and hid them in its shell It couldnt be eaten 
When the otter was some distance away the tortoise stuck out its head and feet and walked away Nothing could be done about it and so it got away 
Thereupon the man of the Path said to the transformed ascetic This tortoise has an armor to protect its life The otter could not gain advantage The transformed ascetic replied 
I think that people in the world are inferior to this tortoise Ignorant of their impermanence they give rein to their six senses When the external Mara gains advantage the body is destroyed and the spirit leaves Birth and death cycles are endless and revolve in the five destinations 
Verses of the Doctrine with Parables for external appeasement seeking happiness Thereupon the transformed ascetic spoke the stanzas The body does not last long It will return to earth anyway The body is destroyed and the spirit leaves 
When thoughts seek to go somewhere the coming and going is endless If one has much viciousness in mind one only provokes evil for himself 
A thought is created by oneself It does not come from parents You may direct it toward what is right Do what is meritorious and do not turn back 
Hide your six  just like the tortoise Guard your mind as a fortress When wisdom is victorious in the battle with Mara there will be no ailment 
When the monk had heard the exposition of these stanzas his covetousness ceased and his desire ended and he attained the Path of an arhat 
He knew that the transformed ascetic was the Buddha the Worldhonored One He reverentially adjusted his clothes and kowtowed at the Buddhas feet All gods dragons and spirits were delighted 
The Fragrance of Flowers Once the Buddha was in the land of Sravasti In the sea southeast of the country there was a terrace On the terrace there were flowers and fragrant trees The trees were pleasant 
There were five hundred female brahmans who although serving a heterodox path were very diligent and zealous of the mind They did not however know about the Buddhas existence 
The women then said to each other When we received our forms we were born as women From our youth until our old age we are in the custody of three things and we cannot be free Furthermore our life is brief 
It would be better if we all went to the terrace with fragrant flowers to gather the fragrant flowers If we are strenuous when fasting and let Brahmadeva descend he will comply with our wishes We wish to be reborn in the brahma heaven and to have a long life without death We also free without any bondage freed from any retribution and without any more sorrow So they took their offerings and went to the terrace 
They gathered fragrant flowers and served Brahmadeva They held their fast wholeheartedly wishing to let the venerable spirit descend 
Thereupon the Worldhonored One saw these women Even though they held a lay fast their minds were resolved and they deserved to be saved So he flew up in the air with a great multitude of disciples bodhisattvas gods nagas and spirits went to the terrace and sat down under a tree 
The women were glad and they thought he was Brahmadeva They comforted each other that they had obtained their wish 
Then one celestial person said to the The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables women This is not Brahmadeva This is the most honored one in the three worlds called the Buddha 
The people he has saved are innumerable Thereupon the women advanced to where the Buddha was They did obeisance came forward and said to the Buddha We have a great deal of impurity and we are women now We wish to be free from bondage and be reborn in the brahma heaven 
The Buddha said  women as you are eager to obtain fine gain you have made this wish 
In the world there are two things for which the retribution is clear He who does what is wholesome experiences what is meritorious He who does what is evil experiences calamity 
The suffering of the world or the happiness of heaven the vexation of the conditioned or the tranquility of the unconditioned who can choose and take what is true 
Excellent  women that you have a clear purpose Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas Who can choose the earth reject custody and choose heaven Who can expound the verses of the Doctrine like picking wonderful flowers 
The learner chooses the earth rejects custody and chooses heaven He expounds well the verses of the Doctrine and ably gathers the flowers of merit 
Knowing that the world is like earthenware an illusion and a brief existence one brings a stop to the opening of Maras flowers and will not experience the cycle of life and death 
Seeing the body like foam an illusion and spontaneous one brings a stop to the opening of Maras flowers and will not experience the cycle of life and death 
When the women had heard these stanzas of the Buddha they wished to apply themselves to the true Path and to become nuns Their hair fell off of itself and they were provided with the robe of the Doctrine After reflection and quiet concentration they attained the path of the arhat 
Ananda said to the Buddha Well what merit did these women actually have that they had the Worldhonored One save them 
And further as soon as they had heard the exposition of the Doctrine they went forth and attained the Path The Buddha informed Ananda 
Once at the time of the Buddha Kasyapa there was an important elder whose riches were countless His wives and ladies numbered five hundred 
He was jealous by nature and his gate was not opened arbitral ily The wives and ladies wanted to go and meet the Buddha but they never obtained his permission 
The Buddha said to Ananda The five hundred wives and ladies of that time are the present five hundred nuns 
Because of the sincerity of their vow they now deserve to be saved That is why the Worldhonored One saved them 
 When the Buddha had explained this there was none who was not glad 
Volume Two Formerly when the Buddha had just attained the Path he was in the land of Rajagrha While making conversions he gradually arrived in the land of Sravastl 
Then there was a merchant an important person called Poli  He went to sea with five hundred merchants searching for precious things 
The spirit of the sea then came out He held a handful of water and asked Poli Is the water of the sea plenty or is my handful of water plenty Poli answered 
The handful of water is plenty W hy The water of the sea may be plenty but it is useless for ones present need It cannot save a thirsty person A handful of water may be little but if one meets a thirsty person one may use it and give it to him to save his life The merit one will experience in later times is incalculable The spirit of the sea was glad and he said in praise 
Excellent He then took off his eightfold fragrant necklace comparable to the seven precious things to present to Poli 
While the spirit of the sea accompanied him he went back safely and arrived in the land of Sravastl He presented the fragrant necklace to King Prasenajit and gave a complete account of its origin I think this fragrant necklace must not be worn by me I respectfully offer it to you 
 The king received the fragrant necklace and he thought it wonderful So he called the women and had them line up in front of him 
Sixty thousand women came in complete b The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables attire 
The king asked Why did my wife Mallika not come forward A servant answered 
Today is the fifteenth day She observes the fast according to the Doctrine of the Buddha She dresses in plain clothes not in grand attire That is why she does not come forward 
 Then the king became angry and he sent someone to call her saying To observe the fast now do you not disobey the kings orders When he had thus sent for her three times Lady Mallika came forward dressed in plain clothes 
Among the multitude she was as bright as the sun and moon and twice as beautiful as usual 
The king was startled and as his respect increased he said 
I have received this female form The impurity of its sensual nature night and day accumulates like a mountain But ones life is short and one is afraid of falling into the three woeful destinations That is why I observe the fast of the Buddhas Doctrine in my life 
If one stops craving and follows the Path one will meet with merit in every existence The king rejoiced upon hearing this and he gave the fragrant necklace to his wife Mallika 
His wife replied I am observing the fast now 
You may give it to someone else The king said It was my intention to give it to the most excellent one You are the most excellent now Moreover you observe the fast of the Doctrine and your determination for the Path is extremely strong 
If you do not accept it I shall put it away 
 His wife replied Oh great king do not be grieved 
I hope that you O king will depart from your intention and go with me to where the Buddha is Present this fragrant necklace to the Worldhonored One and collect the noble teaching thus accumulating a kalpas merit The king agreed with her 
He kowtowed to the ground and withdrew to his royal seat The king said to the Buddha The fragrant necklace of the spirit of the sea was presented to me by Poli Of sixty thousand wives there was none who did not want to obtain it 
Your disciples Worldhonored One firmly keep their fast Such is their honest faith 
How meritorious Thereupon the Worldhonored One accepted the fragrant necklace and he spoke the stanzas If one uses many precious flowers the hairdo will become beautiful If one widely accumulates the fragrance of virtue ones rebirth will change for the better 
The scent of herbs and fragrant flowers does not go against the wind close to the Path and spreading widely the scent of a virtuous one goes everywhere 
Regarding the fragrance of sandalwood and tagara and the fragrant flower of the blue lotus even though one may say This is genuine none could be compared to the scent of the precepts 
When the fragrance of a flower is weak one must not call it genuine But the scent of keeping the precepts reaches the gods and is most excellent 
When one embodies the precepts and does not deviate in ones conduct the mind becomes tranquil and is delivered and one is thereby distanced free from Maras path 
After the Buddha had expounded the stanzas he again informed the king  The fame of the merits of fasting reaches far and wide When Lady Mallika observes the fast of the Buddhas Doctrine for one day and one night this is better than if for instance the sixteen great countries were filled with precious objects and one were to take them and give them away If one compares the merits it is like comparing Mount Sumeru and a single bean 
If one accumulates merit and applies oneself to wisdom one may attain nirvana 
The king and his wife and his ministers great and small were all happy They dedicated themselves to the practice of the Doctrine 
The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables Once the Buddha was on Mount Grdhrakuta in Rajagrha In the city there were fifty sons of the elders They went to where the Buddha was did obeisance withdrew and sat down 
The Buddha explained to them the Doctrine relative to impermanence suffering emptiness and selflessness Affection is like a dream Having come together people will soon part Although esteemed and honored one still feels sorrow 
When all misfortunes are completely appeased one will be in absolute peace Upon hearing the Doctrine the fifty people were happy and they wished to be his disciples The Buddha said 
Welcome monks Their hair fell off of itself and they donned the robe of the Doctrine to become ascetics 
These ascetics had relatives and friends who were elders When the elders heard that they had gone forth they were very happy for them They went to Mount Grdhrakuta to meet them and said in praise of them 
You were eager to obtain fine gain and now you have the determination They set up an altar for them and invited the Buddha and his Sangha 
The next day the Buddha and his Sangha came to the dwelling to eat After the meal he expounded the Doctrine and they departed in the afternoon 
Those ascetics who had recently become adepts hankered after their kin and wanted to revert back to mundane life The Buddha knew what was on their minds As he was about to leave through the gates of the city he saw that in the foul mud covered by night soil in the ditch of a field there grew lotus flowers They were colorful and their scent was clear 
So the Buddha quickly went back to them and spoke the stanzas Just as in a ditch in the field near a major road there grows a lotus flower with a clear delightful scent  
The mundane person remains in the cycle but the wise one takes leave of it as a disciple of the Buddha 
Having spoken the stanzas the Buddha returned to the mountain 
The worthy Ananda came forward and said to the Buddha When you were near the ditch in the field Worldhonored One I did not understand the meaning of the two stanzas you proclaimed there 
I would like to hear what they mean 
 The Buddha informed Ananda Did you see that in the impurity of foul mud on the night soil in the ditch there grew lotus flowers Yes I saw them The Buddha said 
Ananda when man is in the world he proceeds from birth to birth Considering a life of a hundred years more or less one goes through love for wife and child hunger and thirst cold and warmth sadness or happiness Moreover there are one misfortune two good fortunes the three poisons the four errors the five aggregates the six entrances the seven consciousnesses the eight wrongs the nine vexations and the ten evils to contend with They are all like the impurity of foul mud the night soil accumulated in the ditch in the field 
All of a sudden there comes a person who realizes that the world is impermanent who is intent on applying himself to the Path develops his determination for purity concentrates his spirit destroys false notions and ultimately brings about his attainment of the Path He is like a lovely lotus flower that grows in foul mud He by himself attains the Path and saves his kin as well All beings will open up in full understanding 
He is also like the scent of a flower that overwhelms the stench When the fifty monks had heard the Buddhas exposition of the Doctrine their determination became firmer and they attained arhatship 
The Fool Once the Buddha was in the land of Sravasti 
At that time there was a brahman in the city who was going on eighty years and whose wealth was immeasurable As a person he was foolish and niggardly and very difficult to convert He was not aware of the virtue of the Path nor did he understand the nature of impermanence But he still built a fine dwelling 
The brahman always managed and directed everything by himself The Buddha saw with his eyes of the Path that this old mans life would not last all day and that he would go to the nether world He could not know that himself and he was simply too busy with his preparations anyway His spirit did not have any merit 
The Buddha led Ananda to his gate He asked the old man how he felt Are you not too tired 
This dwelling you are building now for what purpose is it 
 The old man said In the front room I shall welcome visitors and in the hall in the back I shall dwell by myself In the side rooms both east and west I shall have my children my possessions and servants In summer I shall mount my cool terrace and in winter I shall go to my warm room 
 The Buddha said to the old man For a long time I have heard about you aged virtuous one I thought of postponing our conversation but I happen to have important stanzas Alive or dead they are beneficial 
Verses of the Doctrine with Parables down with me to discuss them The old man answered Right now I am very busy I cannot afford to sit down to talk Come again at a later day and I shall have a good chat with you 
The important stanzas you mention you can expound them now Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas I have a son I have riches the fool ponders anxiously but he is not himself 
In winter I shall stay there A fool often ponders in advance but he does not know about the upcoming turn of events 
A fools foolishness goes to the extreme when he says that he is wise When a fool confidently calls himself wise he is called an utter fool 
The brahman said You have spoken these stanzas well You are really keeping me up now Come later and we shall discuss them again The Buddha was grieved then and he left 
Later on the old man walked under a rafter which fell and hit his head His life was lost immediately His family wept and it shocked his four neighbors 
The Buddha had not yet gone far when this mishap took place When the Buddha returned to the village he met tens of brahmans They asked the Buddha where he had come from and the Buddha said 
Earlier when I arrived at the house of the deceased old man I expounded the Doctrine to him but he did not believe in the Buddha s words 
Now he has all of a sudden gone to the nether world He again fully explained the meaning of the previous stanzas to the brahmans Upon hearing them they were delighted and attained the Path 
Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas A fool approaches a wise one just like a ladle that scoops something flavorful Even if he associates with the wise for a long time he still does not know the Doctrine 
An intelligent person approaches a wise one just like a tongue that tastes something flavorful Even though he associates with the wise for just a while he immediately understands the essence of the Path 
When a fool acts he brings calamity on himself He readily performs evil bringing grave misfortune on himself 
If ones action is not wholesome afterward one feels remorse It brings on a tearful countenance The retribution comes from ones previous practice 
Then when the brahmans had heard these stanzas they increased their sincere faith They did obeisance to the Buddha were delighted and carried out their dedicated practice 
Once the Buddha was in the pure abode of Anathapindada in the land of Sravasti expounding the Doctrine to gods and men 
At that time King Prasenajit had a widowed daughter called Vajra  She had returned as a young widow Her father the king felt sorry for her and constructed a separate palace for her elegant livelihood He gave her five hundred singing girls to amuse her 
Among them was an elderly servant called Kubjottara who used to go to the market to buy ointments and powder inc cense and flowers 
Once she saw a huge crowd of men and women leave town each holding incense and flowers 
So she asked them 
Where are you going The crowd replied The Buddha has appeared in this existence the most revered one in the three worlds He will deliver all beings and all will obtain nirvana 
 When Kubjottara heard this she was delighted and full of joy So she thought to herself That I meet the Buddha now in my old age is a merit of my previous existence She immediately took part of the incense money to buy beautiful flowers 
She followed the crowd and went to where the Buddha was She did obeisance stepped aside scattered the flowers and burned the incense and then listened attentively to the Doctrine 
After she had left the The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables market she handled some incense But on account of listening to the Doctrine and pursued by her previous behavior the scent of the incense was sweeter and its weight twice as heavy did not like her being late and they all reproached her 
As a loyal servant Kubjottara stated the facts In this existence there is a noble teacher the most honored one in the three worlds When he beats the unsurpassed drum of the Doctrine it reverberates throughout the trichiliocosmos Those who went to listen to his Doctrine were countless 
Truly I followed and listened to his Doctrine 
That is why I was delayed When the followers of Vajra heard her explanation that the meaning of the Doctrine of the Worldhonored One was very profound unheard of in this world they were delighted and joyful and they sighed What did we do wrong that we alone did not hear it So they asked Kubjottara to expound it to them 
Kubjottara said I am a lowly person and my words are unclear I do not dare to expound it 
I beg you to send me to seek his advice again and I shall explain it according to his command They immediately sent her out and told her again 
Communicate to us the complete proceedings  When Kubjottara had yet to return the servants of Vajra were in the courtyard restless as a child waiting for his mother The Buddha informed Kubjottara If you go back and expound the Doctrine many will be saved 
As for the right deportment when expounding the Doctrine first set up a high seat When Kubjottara had received the instructions she reported in full the noble command and they were all very delighted They took off their garments and piled them up to form a high seat 
When Kubjottara had cleansed herself she received the Buddhas majestic power and expounded the Doctrine as empowered Vajra and the others more than five hundred people had their doubts resolved They destroyed their evil and attained the path of streamenterer 
The exposition of the Doctrine was so beautiful that they were not aware of being consumed by fire In one moment they burned to death and were reborn in heaven 
The king led his attendants to rescue them from the fire but when he saw that they were burned he prepared the coffins and shrouds After the burial he went to where the Buddha was He did obeisance to the Buddha withdrew and sat down on his usual throne 
The Buddha asked the king where he came from 
The king brought his hands together and said My daughter Vajra was so unfortunate as to catch fire unexpectedly Everything was completely burned I am just back from her coffin and shroud 
Please Worldhonored One tell me about that unknown  The Buddha informed the great king In the past there was a city called Benares There was an elders wife who led five hundred ladies out of the city to conduct a large sacrifice 
The rule was that it was not to be tolerated that someone from another family came near No matter whether close or distant those who came were thrown into the fire 
There was an aspirant for Buddhahood in the world then called Kala He lived in the mountains In the morning he came begging for alms and in the evening he quickly returned to the mountains 
Kala came upon the sacrifice on his begging rounds When the elders wife saw him she was furious They all grasped him and pushed him into the fire When his whole body was ablaze he used his supernatural power and flew up in the air 
The women were terrified and repented their misdeed in tears They knelt deeply raised their heads and stated W e women were foolish ignorant of your utter truthfulness We fools were so deranged as to disgrace your divine spirit 
The women erected a stupa and worshiped his relics The Buddha expounded to the great king the stanzas When a fool commits evil he cannot understand it He will burn pursued by misfortune and his misdeed will turn into a blazing fire 
As for the place a fool is looking forward to he does not think he will have any suffering But when he is about to fall into a place of distress then he knows it is not good 
a The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables The Buddha informed the great king The elders wife at the time is your present daughter Vajra 
The five hundred servants are the present five hundred singing girls including Kubjottara 
Good and evil follow a person just as the shadow follows the form When he had proclaimed this Doctrine the mighty and lowly in the land devoutly subjected themselves 
Adept at the various methods of the six arts astronomy geography healing through medicine landslides and earthquakes playing dice and chess playing of artful music cutting out garments embroidering silk slicing prepared viands and blending flavors he was equally versed in human affairs 
I shall put myself to the test traveling through the countries and I shall overcome any opposition My name will spread over the four seas and my expertise will hit the sky Then they will record my achievements on bamboo and silk and my merits will be handed down for a hundred generations Thereupon he set out on his way and arrived in a country 
Entering the marketplace he looked around and saw a man sitting down and making a bow out of a horn While he was separating the strings and fashioning the horn his hands looked as if they were flying His adjustments were swift as he made the bow The buyers pressed around him vying with each other 
I did not anticipate feeling inadequate for not learning to make a bow 
 So he followed the bowmaker and sought b The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables to be his disciple 
His art was so ingenious that he even surpassed his teacher He then gave away his possessions took his leave and went away 
While on his way to another country he had to ford a river There was a boatman who was handling his boat as if he were flying He was turning going up and down with incomparable swiftness 
Again he thought to himself My skills may be numerous but I have never gained experience with a boat It may be a humble skill but I do not know it and I should learn it and be equipped with all ten thousand skills So he followed the boatman and sought to be his disciple 
In time he knew what was right or wrong He was making turns while managing the boat far better than his teacher He then gave away his possessions took his leave and went away 
Again he reached another country The king s palace was beyond compare in the world So he thought to himself The carpenter who built this palacehow skillful he is 
I must again apply myself so that my mind will be satisfied So he sought out the carpenter and wished to be his disciple He honored him with all his heart and took up the ax 
In time he gained complete understanding of the measurements of square and round of compass and square He knew completely the timberwork the carved designs and the inlay work His natural genius was evident and his work instantly surpassed that of his teacher 
He roamed around the world through all sixteen great countries He overcame his opponents and mastered their skills Every single word and every single step there was none who ventured to respond 
With his supernatural power the Buddha transformed himself into an ascetic Leaning on a staff and holding his alms bowl he came right up to him 
In the land where the brahman came from there was no Doctrine of the Path He had not yet seen an ascetic and wondered who this man was 
He would ask him at the right moment 
I am someone who manages himself He again asked 
Like a large rock that cannot be moved by the wind a c wise ones mind is grave He is not moved by slander or praise 
Just as a deep pool is still and pure the wise one learns the Path and his mind is pure and joyful 
When the ascetic had spoken these stanzas he ascended into the sky and manifested himself as the Buddha The brightness of his thirtytwo marks and eighty secondary marks was pervasive and illuminated heaven and earth He descended from the sky and said to that man The quality of the Path gives me the strength to transform and manage myself 
 Thereupon the man fell prostrate in obeisance kowtowed and asked 
 The Buddha informed the brahman The five precepts the ten wholesome  the four immeasurables the six perfections the four trances The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables and the three deliverances these are the methods of managing oneself 
The wonderful skills of the six arts of the bowmaker the boatman and the carpenter these are all beautiful adornments elements of specious fame 
He wished to be his disciple and the Buddha informed him 
Welcome ascetic His hair fell off of itself and he became an ascetic 
The Buddha explained to him the essence of the four noble truths and the eight deliverances He subsequently attained the path of arhatship 
Once the Buddha was in the land of Sravasti 
Five hundred li from the land there was a village of fifty or sixty families in the mountains A poor family lived in the village The mother was pregnant and in the tenth month she gave birth to twin boys They were beautiful beyond compare 
Fifty or sixty days after their birth their father had been pasturing the cows and returned home worn out He withdrew and lay down on his bed Their mother had left for the field to gather firewood and had not returned The two small boys looked around but did not see their parents 
We are being punished for our longing for riches and honor in a previous life for letting ourselves go and for spending some thought about momentary happiness Ever since then we have been experiencing suffering on our long journey We feel sorrow now but what can we resort to The other answered We were young then 
We shall just have to face it together What else is there to say The father heard his two sons making such reproaches and he was very surprised Ah they must be evil spirits that have come to bring disaster How can small children only several tens of days old say such words 
I am afraid that they will later kill their parents and destroy the family 
I must kill them while they are still very young a not yet grown up The father left in a state of fright He shut the door and went to the fields to gather firewood He wanted to start a fire to burn them to death 
The mother was on her way back and she asked her husband what the firewood was for 
The husband said Very weird Such were the nature of their words They were like demons out to destroy their own family 
I want to burn them to death while they are still young When the mother heard this she was disconcerted She was doubtful and did not believe it and she said It would be better to wait for a few days and listen together to what they are saying For a few days she tried to listen to their talk 
Subsequently when husband and wife were leaving by the door they overheard their sons inside making reproaches as before When the husband and wife heard this again they thought it very weird And so they piled up firewood with the secret wish to burn them 
The Buddha saw with his divine eye that the husband and wife wanted to burn their two children to death He felt grieved They were pitiable but their former merits would save them He went to their village his luminous light shining everywhere 
Great and small in the village were startled and went to where the Buddha was They did obeisance to the Buddha and there was none who was not glad They knew that the Buddha was the highest spirit unequaled in the three worlds 
The Buddha arrived at the house of the twin children When the two children saw the Buddhas light their joy The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables was unbounded The parents were startled too and they each carried one child to where the Buddha was 
We do not know what kind of demons these children are 
When the Buddha saw the children he laughed heartily From his mouth came a fivecolored light illuminating the whole of heaven and earth 
The Buddha informed the parents of the children and also the young and old of the village These two children are no demons but meritorious children 
Formerly at the time of the Buddha Kasyapa they used to be ascetics They had been friends and comrades as youngsters and when they had gone forth each was zealous When they were about to obtain the Path a heterodox notion suddenly came up and they were checked content with worldly splendor Because of their merits however they were reborn in heaven and they descended as kings as lords and as elders but when this notion had suddenly arisen they fell further and regressed 
They did not obtain nirvana but experienced the cycle of birth and death They were constantly dragged through a successive number of eons and they were suddenly reborn as twins 
They have just now been reborn in my time 
Because they have worshiped the Buddha ever since they deserve salvation because of their remaining merits Through the extinction of their evil and the rise of their merit they are conscious of their previous lives So I the Worldhonored One have deliberately come to save them 
If I did not save them they would unreasonably be burned by fire Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas Superior persons are physically without desire They shine brightly wherever they are Even though they may experience suffering or happiness they manifest wisdom without pride 
A wise superior person does not have worldly possessions He does not aspire for son wealth or country He constantly guards the path of moral conduct and wisdom and does not covet false riches and honor 
A wise person knows that excitement is like a tree in the sand When a friends resolve is not yet strong one follows beauty tainted by its essence 
When the Buddha had expounded this the children saw the Buddha and immediately jumped up with joy just as eightyearold children do They became ascetics and attained arhatship 
When the villagers young and old had seen the Buddhas radiant appearance and had also seen that the childrens appearance had changed their joy was great and they attained the path of the streamenterer The doubts of the parents were lifted and they also obtained the eye of the Doctrine 
b The Arhat Once there was a country called Nadika in the vicinity of the Southern Sea The peoples normal occupation was gathering pearls and sandalwood 
There was scarcity in the world at that time Possessing only Purna he was afraid they would not make ends meet and was very sad 
The slave Purna said to his master Please do not be sad I Purna will deliberate on something and within months I shall make you surpass your brother The master said 
If you can definitely achieve this I shall set you free as a worthy person The wife of the master had some pearls and other things and gave them to Purna as his capital 
Then when the tide came in the people in the city went to the shores to gather firewood 
In the firewood there was the fragrance of gosirsa sandalwood It could cure serious illnesses One ounce was worth a thousand taels of gold One could not always obtain it in the world at that time 
Purna knew this He bought it for two coins took it home and divided it into ten 
There was an elder then who had contracted a serious illness He The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables had to have two ounces of this fragrant gosirsa sandalwood as his medicine He had sought for it for a long while but could not obtain it 
Purna took it to him and got two thousand taels of gold 
When he had sold everything in this way the wealth he had accumulated was ten times greater than the older brothers The master was grateful for Purnas kindness 
He did not break his word and set him free as a worthy person to enjoy himself as he pleased 
Thereupon Purna bade farewell and applied h i m s e l f to the Path He went to the land of Sravasti did obeisance to the Buddha knelt deeply and said to the Buddha The place I came from is insignificant but I find happiness in the qualities of the Path I c hope that you Worldhonored One will show me your k in d n e s s and save me The Buddha said 
Welcome Purna His hair fell off of itself The robe of the Doctrine covered him and he became an ascetic The Buddha expounded the Doctrine to him and he subsequently attained arhatship 
He sat down and thought to himself I now have the six superknowledges and the freedom of life or ruin and all this because of my masters kindness 
I went to where the Buddha was and such was what I have learned The master answered 
I would like to meet the Worldhonored One and receive his teaching Purna replied Just wholeheartedly provide for food vessels The Buddha has the three penetrating insights He will certainly come himself 
I hope that you will condescend generously to save us all  The Buddha knew his intentions and so he went with his five hundred arhats each with his magic power to his house 
He came to where the Buddha was and fell prostrate in obeisance He withdrew and sat down on his royal seat When he had cleansed himself after the meal the Buddha extensively explained his bright Doctrine to the master and to the king and his assembled officials They all accepted the five precepts and became the Buddhas disciples 
They rose stood in front of the Buddha and praised Purna You were diligent as a layman and having gone forth you obtained the Path Your supernatural qualities are so lofty and farreaching that our family and country have been saved How shall we recompense your kindness 
 Thereupon the Worldhonored One praised Purna and spoke the stanzas When ones thoughts are calm when ones verbal behavior has ceased and when one is delivered through what is right one is at rest with everything extinguished 
When one has discarded desire and is without attachment when one has done away with the hindrance of the three realms and when all aspirations have ceased one is said to be a superior man 
In a village or in the wilds on level ground or on a high shore wherever an arhat has passed there is none who is not saved 
They find happiness in seclusion but common people do not Delightfully without aspirations they do not long for anything 
After the Buddha had spoken the stanzas the master and the king increased their joy They worshiped for seven days and attained the path of the streamenterer 
An Account of Thousands Once the Buddha was in the land of Srvast There was an aged monk called Panthaka who had only recently become a monk He was ignorant by nature and so the Buddha had five hundred arhats instruct him daily In three years he still did not achieve understanding of even a single stanza 
The Buddha had pity on him and so he called him and gave him the following stanza Guard your mouth and control your mind The body must not commit anything wrong He who behaves thus can be delivered from the world 
 Panthaka was moved by the Buddhas kindness He was glad his mind opened up and he was able to recite the stanza 
The Buddha informed him Your age may now be advanced you have achieved reciting the stanza Everyone knows it One must not think of it as odd 
I shall now explain its meaning to you 
Listen well and with all your heart As Panthaka listened to the teaching the Buddha explained to him that the body is the basis for the three  the mouth for four and the mind for three He explained about the contemplation of their origin and their extinction and that one ceaselessly revolves in the five destinations and the three realms Because of this one either ascends to heaven or falls into the abyss but also because of this one attains the Path and nirvana comes naturally He distinctly explained immeasurable wonderful things to him 
Panthakas mind suddenly opened up and he attained arhatship 
At that time there were five hundred nuns living in a separate pure abode Daily the Buddha sent a monk to expound the a The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables scriptural Doctrine One day it was Panthakas turn to go 
When the nuns heard this they all chuckled in anticipation When he comes tomorrow we shall say the stanza backwards and make him ashamed and speechless When Panthaka went to the nuns abode the next day they all came forward young and old did obeisance looked at each other and laughed When he sat down they gave him food and after the meal he washed his hands and they invited him to expound the Doctrine 
 When the young nuns wanted to say the stanza backwards they could not open their mouths They were frightened and reproved themselves They kowtowed and repented their wrongdoing 
Panthaka then one by one distinguished the elements just as the Buddha had explained the bases of body and mind evil and merit internal and external the ascent to heaven and the obtaining of the Path concentration of the spirit annihilation of notions and entering into concentration 
When the nuns heard his explanation they thought immediately it was peculiarly uncanny They were wholeheartedly glad and they all entered the path of the arhat 
Later Prasenajit the king of the land invited the Buddha and his congregation for an assembly in his main hall Wishing to demonstrate Panthaka s imposing spirit the Buddha gave him his alms bowl to carry and he followed behind 
The doorkeeper recognized him and detained him He did not allow him to enter You are an ascetic who does not understand a single stanza Why would you be invited 
I am a layman and yet I know the stanzas How much more should an ascetic but you are without knowledge There is no point in being charitable toward you You cannot enter 
So Panthaka remained outside the gate while the Buddha sat down in the hall When they had passed the water Panthaka took the bowl stretched his arms and handed it from afar to the Buddha 
The king his ministers his wife the crown prince and the four classes of the congregation saw the arms coming in but they did not see the body In amazement they asked b the Buddha whose arms they were 
The Buddha said They are the arms of the monk Panthaka He recently attained the Path 
I let him take my bowl earlier but the doorkeeper did not allow him to enter That is why he stretches his arms and gives me my bowl 
 They immediately invited him in His spirit was twice as imposing as usual 
The king said to the Buddha I have heard that Panthaka is by nature ignorant He just knows one stanza Why did he attain the Path The Buddha informed the king 
Panthaka understands the meaning of one stanza Its purity of reason has entered his spirit His body mouth and mind are calm pure as celestial gold 
Someone may have studied much but if he does not understand and practice it he merely ruins his consciousness What is the advantage Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas 
Although one is capable of reciting a thousand stanzas and has incorrect understanding of them it would be better to learn one important thing which extinguishes evil thoughts 
Although one is capable of speaking a thousand words what is the advantage if they are meaningless 
Although one may often recite the scriptural texts what is the advantage if one does not understand them 
If one understands one verse of the Doctrine and practices it one may attain the Path 
After the Buddha had spoken the stanzas two hundred monks attained arhatship The king his ministers his wife and the crown prince were all very happy 
Once the Buddha was in the land of Sravasti in a pure abode and expounded the Doctrine to gods and men 
Then there was a brahman in that land an elder by the name of Ramadatta He The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables had limitless wealth The possessions of his f a m il y were immeasurable 
According to the rules of the brahman class one must display extensive largesse in order to show ones fame Dispensing the family riches he used them as gifts Arranging for the pancavarsika  he established worship to more than five thousand brahmans In five years he had offered clothing bedding medicine rare precious objects and implements for the sacrifices all highly coveted things 
For the elder Rmadatta the brahmans conducted sacrifices during the five years to the gods the four mountains the five sacred peaks the constellations water and fire There was nothing that was not complete They made incantations asking that the elder would experience prosperity for a long time 
When the five years were over on the very last day he was most generous following the rules of the elders Golden bowls were filled with silver grain and silver bowls were filled with golden wheat Elephants and horses carriages servants valuables personal adornments of the seven precious things parasols shoes deerskin clothes staffs couches washing pitchers and vessels beds and sleeping mats everything they had to have eightyfour thousand things he gave them all On that very day they all came to the great gathering 
When the Buddha saw this he sighed Why is this brahman of noted family so foolish 
His gifts are great but the meritorious recompense is small It is like sowing seeds in fire what benefit can one obtain 
If I do not transform myself he will be barred from entering the Doctrine for a long time 
Thereupon the Worldhonored One rose and arranged his clothes in a dignified way He transformed himself and emerged from the earth emitting a very bright light that shone all over the gathered multitude Young and old were surprised at this wondrous sight They were startled and terrified not knowing what the spirit was 
The elder Rmadatta and the whole multitude touched the ground with their heads and did obeisance to the Buddha 
The Buddha saw that everyone in the crowd had respectful minds and because of their reverential demeanor he then spoke the stanzas Every month one may perform a thousand sacrifices uninterruptedly throughout ones entire life but it is better to be mindful of the Doctrine for a single moment 
The merits one brings about in one such moment are superior to those of an entire life Although during the hundred years of ones lifetime one may serve the god of fire it is better to worship the Buddha Dharma and Sangha for a single moment 
The merits of one moment of homage are superior to those of a hundred years 
Thereupon the Worldhonored One informed Ramadatta Giving is fourfold 
What are the four 
First although one gives much the meritorious recompense one obtains is small Second although one gives little the meritorious recompense one obtains is great Third one gives much and the meritorious recompense one obtains is also great Fourth one gives little and the meritorious recompense one obtains is also small 
What is meant by one gives much and the meritorious recompense one obtains is small 
It is when a person is foolish and makes sacrifices by killing living beings when he drinks spirits and sings and dances when he dissipates his wealth and does not have meritorious wisdom 
What is meant by one gives little and the recompense one obtains is small 
When one gives scantily and with evil intention to a man of the Path Both are foolish and therefore have no merits 
What is meant by one gives little and the merits one obtains are great 
When one can serve a moral person with kindness After the man of the Path has eaten one strenuously applies oneself to recitation For one who does this even though it is little his merits are very great What is meant by one gives much and the merits one obtains are great 
When for instance a farmers soil is rich or poor what he gets as a yield is not the same At that moment when the elder Ramadatta and the people gathered there had seen the Buddha s transformation and when they had heard his exposition of the words of the Doctrine they were all very glad All gods a people and spirits attained the way of a streamenterer 
The five thousand brahmans all became ascetics and attained arhatship 
Young and old who lived in the house of their master Ramadatta accepted the five precepts and also attained the Path 
The king of the land and his high officials all accepted the precepts and took refuge  They became lay disciples and attained the eye of the Doctrine 
Once when the Buddha was in a pure abode in Sravasti teaching there was a man in the land of Rajagrha who was terribly foolish He was not pious toward his parents he was rude to the good and he was disrespectful toward his elders As his house was in decay and things never went according to his wishes he took to serving the fire in the hope of gaining good fortune 
As for his way of serving the fire just when the sun would go down he would light a large pyre He knelt and did obeisance towards it sometimes until late at night When the fire was extinguished he stopped 
He acted in this way for three years but he did not gain any good fortune He further served the sun and moon 
As for his way of serving the sun and moon in the daytime when the sun had risen and at night when the moon was bright he did obeisance respectively toward the sun and the moon When they had gone down he stopped 
He acted in this way for three years but he again did not gain any good fortune He then served the gods 
He burned incense knelt and did obeisance He offered fine fragrant flowers spirits and dried meats pigs and sheep cows and calves Consequently he became poor and thus did not obtain good fortune He was distressed and downcast 
He heard that in the land of SravastI there was a Buddha honored by all gods I must go and serve him and I certainly expect to obtain good fortune 
When he reached the gate of the pure abode and looked up to the Worldhonored One the Buddhas bright appearance was dazzling and his looks were extraordinary just like the moon among the stars Seeing the Buddha he was glad He kowtowed folded his hands and said to the Buddha I have grown in foolishness not aware of the Buddha Dharma and Sangha 
That is why I have come from afar to seek refuge wishing to be saved with good fortune 
 The Buddha informed him What you have served are all sorcery bogeymen and sprites Your prayers and sacrifices are like a mountain but your misdeeds are like the rivers and the sea 
If you seek good fortune by killing living beings you are far from good fortune It just makes you suffer a hundred eons without others respect When one prays and sacrifices using the pigs and sheep of the whole world the misdeed is like Mount Sumeru and there is not even an iota of good fortune How would you not be affected by knowing that your expenditures have been in vain 
Furthermore you have not been pious toward your parents You have treated the worthy with unconcern and you have no respect for your elders You are proud and haughty and your three poisons abound As your wrongs become more serious every day why would you obtain merit 
If you are capable of a change of heart if you treat the worthy with respect if your demeanor is dignified and reverential if you serve your elders if you reject evil and believe in good and if you develop yourself and exalt kindness four merits will increase day by day and you will never be ailing 
What are the four 
Two your strength will be strong Three you will be safe and without illness Four you will add years to your life and your end will not be untimely 
If you practice unremittingly you may obtain the Path too Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas When someone sacrifices to the spirits in order to seek merit and later anticipates a reward he cannot expect even one of the four merits 
It is better to pay homage to the worthy If your practice is truly reverential and always respectful of your elders the four merits will naturally take effect appearance strength longevity and happiness 
When that man had heard these stanzas of the Buddha he was very glad and gained pious understanding He kowtowed and did obeisance He again said to the Buddha Covered by the impurity of my misdeeds I have accumulated evil for nine years but I was fortunate to be converted by kindness 
I do wish that you Worldhonored One will let me be an ascetic The Buddha said Welcome monk His hair fell off of itself and he became an ascetic 
He internally reflected on anapana and attained arhatship 
Evil Conduct Once the Buddha was in the land of Rajagrha He sent an arhat called Sumana to the south of Kasmir with the Buddhas hair and nails to a temple with a stupa in the mountains Five hundred arhats always stayed there Morning and evening they burned incense circled the pagoda and offered prayers 
In those mountains there were five hundred monkeys They witnessed the men of the Path worshiping at the pagoda and so they immediately went together to the bank of a deep torrent Carrying mud and pushing stones they likewise built a stupa Erecting a tree as a flagstaff they attached a silk banner at its tip 
The mountain waters then suddenly rose and the five hundred monkeys immediately drowned Their spirits were reborn in the second or Trayastrimsa heaven in a palace with the seven precious things Clothing and food came naturally 
Where did we come from to be reborn in heaven With the heavenly eye each then saw his previous appearance the body of a monkey Just like the men of the Path they were playfully building a pagoda Although their bodies were drowned their spirits had attained rebirth in heaven 
We must descend now to show our gratitude to our old corpses They all took their servants and with flowers incense and music they descended to their old corpses They scattered the flowers burned incense and went seven times around them 
In the mountains at that time there were five hundred brahmans With their heretical path and heterodox views they The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables did not believe in demerit or merit When they saw that the heavenly persons were scattering flowers making music and walking around the corpses of the monkeys they asked in amazement 
Such is the merit gained by playfully building a pagoda If you will earnestly serve the Buddha your merit will be difficult to describe 
You gentlemen c hold heterodox views and do not believe in what is right Toiling for a hundred eons you will not gain a thing It would be better for you all to go to Mount Grdhrakuta 
The merits gained by serving and offering prayers will be endless So they all rejoiced and went to where the Buddha was 
The heavenly persons said to the Buddha Recently we had the bodies of monkeys but we experienced your kindness Worldhonored One and we attained rebirth in heaven Regretfully we did not meet you O Buddha Therefore we now take refuge They again said to the Buddha 
What evil conduct did we do in a previous existence that we experienced those monkey bodies 
Even though we built a pagoda our bodies drowned The Buddha informed the heavenly persons 
A long time ago there were five hundred young brahmans They all went to the mountains in search of the path of an immortal 
In the mountains at that time was an ascetic who wanted to mend his pure abode on the mountain with mud He went down to get some water His body was so light that it seemed like he was flying The five hundred brahmans were envious and they all laughed at him  
If he does not stop getting water in this way he will shortly drown once the torrential mountain waters come The Buddha informed the heavenly persons The ascetic who was running up and down at that time was myself 
The five hundred brahmans were the five hundred monkeys 
They jestingly performed a misdeed and they personally experienced its retribution Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanza One may jestingly do evil but having performed the bodily act one sadly experiences the retribution 
The Buddha informed the heavenly persons Even though you were animals in your recent existence you still could playfully erect a stupa Now you have attained rebirth in heaven your sins are extinguished and you thrive in good fortune 
Having returned to earth now you have personally received the proper teaching Because of this you will be free from any suffering for a long time After the Buddha had said this the five hundred heavenly persons attained the Path 
When the five hundred brahmans gathered on the riverbanks heard about the retribution of demerit and merit they sighed We have applied ourselves to a seer for quite a number of years but we have no results yet The monkeys who playfully perform merit and obtain rebirth in heaven are much better The qualities of the Buddhas path are so truly wonderful Thereupon they kowtowed at the Buddhas feet and wished to become his disciples 
When the Buddha said Welcome monks they became ascetics 
After strenuous daily development they attained the path of the arhat 
Once the Buddha was in a pure abode in the land of SravastI expounding the Doctrine to gods and men 
At that time the second son of the king of the country was called Virudhaka When he was twenty years old his attendants and officials forced out his father the king He killed his older brother the crown prince and made himself king 
An evil minister called Nali said to King ia Virudhaka O king at the time you were crown prince you went to your family home in the land of the Sakyas When The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables you looked in on the Buddhas pure abode you were scolded by the sons of the Sakyas and thoroughly reviled because of your mothers lowly birth 
At that time you announced that when you became king you would see to this Now the time has come 
You should mobilize your troops and horses and exact revenge He made the necessary arrangements and leading his soldiers and horses was about to attack the land of the Sakyas 
The Buddha had a second disciple called Mahamaudgalyayana The disciple saw that King Virudhaka was leading his troops to attack the land of the Sakyas and avenge an old grievance and that he would destroy the four types of disciples He felt great pity and went to where the Buddha was 
 The Buddha informed Mahamaudgalyayana Even though I know that you have the knowledge and virtue that can relocate the people of the land of the Sakyas in a safe place all things and beings have seven things from which there is no escape 
What seven 
Seven causality Even though one may want to avoid these seven things one cannot obtain freedom 
If you can do this with your supernatural power the burden of the demerit of the former retribution cannot be left behind Thereupon Mahamaudgalyayana did obeisance and left 
According to his own idea he chose four or five thousand friends and danapatis of the people of the land of the Sakyas placed them in a vessel and moved them to the stars in the sky 
When King Virudhaka had attacked the land of the Sakyas and killed three hundred thousand people he led his army and returned to his country 
Thereupon Mahamaudgalyayana went to where the Buddha was He did obeisance to the Buddha prided himself and said King Virudhaka has attacked the land of the Sakyas I your disciple have saved four or five thousand people of the land of the Sakyas with your supernatural power  Buddha 
Have you gone and looked at the people in the vessel He said I have not gone to look at them yet The Buddha said 
First go and look at the people in the vessel Mahamaudgalyayana let the vessel come down through his power of the Path and he saw that the people there had all died Thereupon Mahamaudgalyayana was depressed and mournful and felt sorry for their suffering He returned and said to the Buddha The people in the vessel are all dead now 
My virtue and supernatural power were not able to counter the demerit of their former retribution The Buddha informed Mahamaudgalyayana There are these seven things The Buddha and the nobles the seers and men of the Path may hide them or disperse their bodies but none can avoid these seven things Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke ib the stanzas 
Neither in the sky nor in the ocean nor hiding among the crevices of mountains is there a place to escape from the misfortune of ones previous evil 
All beings suffer and cannot escape from the cycle of old age and death Only the kind and wise do not have thoughts of others wrong and evil 
When the Buddha had said this countless people sitting nearby heard the Buddhas explanation of the doctrine of impermanence They were all sad knowing that retribution is hard to avoid Then they joyfully attained the Path and realized the status of streamenterer 
The Rod There once was a country called Hsienti An aged monk lived there who suffered from a long illness He was emaciated and filthy He was lying in a pure abode in Hsienti but no one looked after him 
The Buddha led five hundred monks to where he lived He told the monks to look after him to make rice gruel for him but when they smelled his foul place they despised him 
The Buddha had Sakra ruler of the gods bring some hot water and the Buddha himself washed the body of the sick monk with his vajra hands The earth shook and there was a burst of sudden bright light Everyone was startled 
They kowtowed did obeisance and said to the Buddha You  Buddha are the Worldhonored One You are incomparable in the three worlds possessed of the virtues of the Path Why do you condescend to wash this sick and filthy monk 
 The Buddha informed the king of the land and the whole gathering The reason why the Tathagata has appeared in the world is precisely because of this distressed one who has no one to look after him 
When honoring a sick ascetic a man of the Path or any poor and lonely old person the merit is immeasurable Ones wishes will be fulfilled Merits will come just as the five rivers keep flowing As ones qualities are gradually consummated one may attain the Path The king said to the Buddha 
Now what misdeed did this monk previously do that he is stricken by illness for many years beyond any cure The Buddha informed the king 
Conforming to the kings severity the officer personally displayed a chilling effect on all When he wanted to whip someone he demanded a price When he obtained something the whipping was light but when he obtained nothing it was heavy 
When the officers life ended he fell into hell He was very maliciously flogged and when his demerit was extinguished he appeared ic again but only to be among animals and be constantly beaten for more than five hundred existences When his demerit had ended he became a man and was constantly hampered by a grave illness The pain did not leave him 
The king of the land at that time is now Devadatta 
The officer is the present sick monk 
The sage is myself 
In my previous existence I was treated with lenience The whip did not touch me That is why I the Worldhonored One personally washed him 
When someone performs good or evil misfortune or good fortune follows him 
Even in another birth and death cycle it cannot be avoided Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas He who strikes at the virtuous falsely defaming those who are without offense his misfortune is tenfold His calamity is sudden and without pardon 
Then when the sick monk had heard these stanzas of the Buddha and the events of his former lives he acknowledged his former behavior As he subdued his thoughts and reproved himself his ailment was instantly cured in front of the Buddha His person safe and his mind at rest he attained arhatship 
The king of Hsienti was delighted and gained pious understanding He subsequently received the five precepts and became a pure believer He carried them out till his death and attained the path of a streamenterer 
Once the Buddha was in the land of Sravasti in the pure abode of the garden of Anathapindada in the Jetavana expounding the Doctrine to gods men dragons and demons 
In the east there was a land called Uttaravati There were five hundred brahmans who were going together to the Ganges River On its bank there were three sacrificial ponds By washing away their impurities they sought to become immortals in their nakedness in accordance with Nirgrantha law 
Their way led through a vast marsh and they got lost and could not pass it They had become short on provisions along the way and looking from a distance they saw movement in a tree which appeared as if alive with a spirit They thought someone was there and rushed to the tree 
When they realized there was nothing the brahmans raised their voices and lamented loudly They were distressed by hunger and thirst and dying of exhaustion in this marsh 
The spirit of the tree appeared as a man and asked the brahmans Men of the Path where do you come from and where do you want to go now They replied with one voice 
We want to go to the divine ponds and cleanse ourselves hoping to become immortals Today we are hungry and thirsty 
 The spirit of the tree then raised his hands and food and drink of a hundred flavors abundantly flowed from his hands giving them all the food and drink required When they were all fully fed and satisfied the remaining food and drink were adequate to keep them supplied for the rest of the way 
When they were about to part they went to the spirit and asked What virtuous deed did you previously perform that you bring about such loftiness  The spirit answered The Scriptural Text 
I formerly lived in the land of Sravasti The high a official of the land was then called Sudatta Providing food for the Buddha and his monks he bought koumiss on the market but there was no one to pick it up He looked all over and finally engaged me to pick it up 
After they had passed around the water to cleanse themselves I solemnly listened to the Doctrine We were all glad judging it to be immeasurably wholesome 
I then fasted and did not eat upon my return in the evening My wife asked in surprise I wonder what is bothering you I answered Nothing 
When I was walking in the market I saw the elder Sudatta and we both gave food to the Buddha in the park He invited me to fast the fast being one of the eight prohibitions  My wife became angry and said with indignation Gautama confuses the common  
If you do not forget about him trouble will come from it As she kept pressuring me I ate with her 
Then at night my lifes fortunes ended at midnight As a spirit I came to be born here 
Because my foolish wife ruined my rules of fasting and because I did not complete those deeds I came to be born in this marsh and became the spirit of this tree 
As for the merit of picking up the koumiss from my hands come food and drink If I had completed the rules of fasting I would have been reborn in heaven 
Sacrifices sow the roots of calamity just as night and day creepers grow 
They piously accepted it and turned around back to Sravasti Their way led through a country named Kausambl There was an elder called Ghosila who was kind to others and respected by all 
We want to go to SravastI and to where Sudatta is Choosing the rules of fasting we long to receive them and obtain merit Ghosila was in raptures of joy 
He proclaimed that those of his kindred who could go with him and receive the regulations of fasting should unite with the five hundred men and answer his call He vowed to lead them They all talked it over and left with dignity 
Before he had reached the Jetavana he encountered Sudatta on this way He looked back and asked his followers who this man was 
They answered 
Sudatta The crowd of brahmans was glad 
We were looking for him and we found him They rushed to meet him and unanimously said in praise The spirit of the tree has praised your virtue Respectfully and candidly he has fully explained his admiration That is why we have come to place ourselves in your care 
I have a revered teacher called the Tathagata He helps mankind 
When they met with the Tathagata their gladness was hard to measure They fell prostrate in obeisance withdrew and sat aside They all knelt deeply and said to the Worldhonored One We initially left home and wanted to go to the three ponds to cleanse ourselves and seek to be immortals 
Please show us your supreme spirituality Thereupon because of their behavior the Worldhonored One expounded the stanzas One may be naked and cut ones hair submit to the rod and wear a coarse garment one may cleanse oneself squatting on a rock but how could his doubts be undone 
When he does not attack kill or burn and when he does not seek to win but is kind and loving toward the world there is no enmity where he goes 
When the five hundred brahmans had heard the stanzas they were very glad They all became ascetics and attained the path of arhatship Ghosila and his kindred obtained the eye of the Doctrine 
The monks said to the Buddha What virtuous deed had the five hundred brahmans and elders previously done to obtain the Path so swiftly The Worldhonored One informed them 
A long long time ago there was a Buddha in the world called Kasyapa He explained to his disciples that I would come at the time of the five defilements 
At that time there were a thousand brahmans and elders who said these same words Let us meet the Buddha Sakyamuni The brahmans of that time are now these brahmans 
The elders of that time are now those with Ghosila 
That is why they have met me and have understood The monks were very glad did obeisance and followed the instructions 
Volume Three Similes with Old Age Once the Buddha was in the land of SravastI in the pure abode of the Jetavana After his meal he expounded the Doctrine of immortality to gods and men to the ruler to his ministers and his people and to the four classes of disciples 
Then there were seven elder brahmans from afar who had come to where the Buddha was They kowtowed folded their hands together and said to the Buddha We strangers would humbly like to listen to your noble way of conversion We should have taken refuge a long time ago but there were many impediments 
 When the Buddha had accepted them as ascetics he told the seven men to stay together in one quarter 
But after these seven men had seen the Worldhonored One and subsequently were able to practice his Path they did not reflect on the nature of impermanence They sat together in their quarters just thinking of worldly things They were speaking in a low tone or loudly laughing not reflecting on success or failure Their lives were daily nearing the end time was running out 
They were just laughing with joy together confused about the three realms c of existence With his three penetrating knowledges the Buddha knew that their lives were about to end He felt sorry for them He stood up went to their quarters and informed them 
All beings rely on five things What are the five 
One they rely on their youth Two they rely on their upright appearance Three they rely on their great strength Four they rely on their wealth 
While you seven sirs are speaking in a low tone or loudly laughing what do you rely on Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas Why joy and why laughter when mindfulness should always be ablaze 
Profoundly shrouded in darkness it would be better to seek for light 
Relying on it is considered to be safe but it is the source of a great deal of imagining that brings forth illness How could one know it is not real 
When one becomes old beauty fades When ill one loses luster The skin slackens and muscles shrink The fate of death is close 
When the body dies the spirit goes just like a driver abandoning his chariot When the flesh has dissipated and the bones are scattered how can one rely on a body 
After the Buddha had spoken the stanzas the seven monks understood Their expectations ceased and they attained arhatship in front of the Buddha 
Once the Buddha was in a pure abode in SravastI expounding the Doctrine to gods and men and to the ruler 
Then there was a village of brahmans In the more than five hundred houses there were five hundred young brahmans practicing their brahmanical arts They were arrogant and did not respect their elders They considered haughtiness and selfimportance normal 
The five hundred brahmans discussed among themselves The ascetic Gautama calls himself a Buddha with the expedient knowledge of the three penetrating insights There is none who dares argue with him 
Let us question him on different points and we shall know how he is They then prepared offerings and invited the Buddha 
The Buddha went with his disciples to the village of the brahmans They took their seats passed the water around and after the meal they washed their hands 
They happened to be on their begging round in the village The Buddha knew that formerly they had been very wealthy beyond compare and that they had been high officials So the Buddha asked the young brahmans Do you know the elder brahmans They all said yes 
He further asked 
They were high officials before with countless riches Then a why are they now on their begging round They all said 
Their wastefulness was unprincipled That is why they remain poor The Buddha said to the brahmans In the world there are four things which men are unable to practice But he who does them obtains prosperity and does not become poor 
What are the four 
One when in the prime of life and strong do not be arrogant Two keep zeal at an advanced age and have no desire for debauchery Three when you possess riches and precious things be constantly mindful of giving Four take up studies with a teacher and accept his true words 
He is like an old heron waiting by the empty pond never catching anything Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas If one is indolent night and day and does not stop debauchery when old if one possesses riches but does not practice giving and if one does not accept the Buddhas words one will be oppressed by these four and defraud himself 
If one has not practiced pure conduct and has not acquired wealth in old age one is like a heron watching an empty pond If one does not keep the precepts and has not accumulated wealth in old age one will be emaciated and his energy exhausted 
In old age one is like an autumn leaf and walks in a shabby garment As life goes by swiftly and abandonment is constantly present regrets are useless 
The Buddha informed the brahmans In a generation there are four periods during which one may gain merit by practicing the Path In this way one may obtain salvation and escape from any suffering 
What are the four 
One the period in which one possesses strength in youth Two the period in which one possesses property when rich and honored Three the period in which one has experienced the fine field of merit of the Buddha Dharma and Sangha Four the period in which when reflecting on things one feels the sorrow of parting 
When one experiences these four things ones wishes will all be fulfilled 
One will certainly gain the Path Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas Night and day life will come to an end but one may exert oneself at the right opportunity The world is truly impermanent Do not doubt that you will fall into the underworld 
Apply yourself to kindling the lamp of your mind Train yourself and seek wisdom Be free from impurity and do not be tainted Hold up a candle and contemplate the place of the Path 
When the Buddha said this he emitted a bright light illuminating heaven and earth The five hundred young brahmans then understood They straightened their clothes and hair stood up and did obeisance at the Buddhas feet They said to the Buddha 
Welcome monks and they immediately became ascetics and attained arhatship 
The villagers young and old all attained the Path and there was none who was not glad 
Holding Oneself Dear Once there was a land called Tamra Seven li from the city there was a pure abode Five hundred ascetics constantly dwelled there reading the scriptures and practicing the Path 
There was an old monk called Mahallaka As a person he was not bright The five hundred men of the Path had to instruct him but he did not master a single stanza in the course of several years The whole community despised him and the people did not share their gatherings with him 
Later when the king of the land invited the men of the Path to come to his palace to conduct worship the monk Mahallaka said to himself I was born into this world so dull that I do not know one stanza and I am held in contempt by the others What a life this is 
 So he took a rope and went underneath a big tree in the garden in the rear intent on hanging himself 
With his eye of the Path the Buddha saw this from afar He transformed himself into the spirit of the tree He appeared half as a human being and reprimanded him saying Oh monk 
Why do you do this Mahallaka then fully informed him of his hardship 
The transformed spirit reprimanded him saying You cannot do this Yes listen to my words 
Once at the time of the Buddha Kasyapa you were a Tripitaka ascetic with five hundred disciples Because of your great learning you despised all others Sparing of the meaning of the scriptures you initially would not teach anything Therefore in every existence you were born into your faculties were dull 
Why destroy yourself Thereupon b The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables the Worldhonored One showed his divinely brilliant appearance and spoke the stanzas If someone holds himself dear he should cautiously watch over what should be guarded If in his aspirations he wants to understand he should apply himself to what is right without resting 
Oneself being first one should study by oneself Having profited one may instruct others 
When applying oneself one should first correct oneself and correct others later A wellregulated person acquires wisdom He certainly changes into a superior person 
If one cannot benefit oneself how can one benefit others 
When the mind is regulated and the body correct what wish will not be fulfilled 
What one has initiated earlier one will later experience The evildoer experiences evil himself just as surely as a diamond pierces a pearl 
When the monk Mahallaka had witnessed the Buddhas brilliant personal appearance he trembled with both grief and joy and kowtowed at the Buddhas feet He reflected on the meaning of the stanzas and immediately entered the state of concentrative mind In the presence of the Buddha he subsequently attained arhatship He knew countless matters of his former lives and penetrated the essence of all the scriptures of the Tripitaka 
The Buddha told Mahallaka to don his robe take his bowl and have a meal in the kings palace where he was to preside over five hundred men of the Path These men of the Path were your five hundred disciples in your previous existence If you again expound the Doctrine to them you will help them obtain the Path and make the king understand and believe in the nature of evil and merit He at once accepted the Buddhas instructions 
He went straight to the palace and sat down on the seat of honor 
The assembled monks all became angry and wondered why but they respected the kings intention and did not dare scold him They thought Mahallaka was foolish and did not have any understanding about donations and that thinking was too exhausting for him 
Mahallaka then gave him a donation of the Doctrine He sounded like the tremor of thunder and his clear words came down like rain The men of the Path who were sitting were startled They repented and all attained arhatship 
Expounding the Doctrine to the king there was nothing he did not explain All ministers and officials attained the path of the streamenterer 
Once the Buddha was in the land of Sravasti There were five hundred brahmans who were constantly seeking advantage over the Buddha 
They wanted to defame him but the Buddha knew their thoughts by means of his three penetrating insights He felt pity for them and wanted to save them but their condition had not matured yet and the causal condition was not yet at hand When all their demerits and merits were in the proper condition he naturally would bring on the causal condition to match up with their demerit and merit These brahmans had previously had some merit and they deserved to be saved their merit had led them on and brought about an appropriate way 
The five hundred brahmans deliberated among themselves and said We shall make a butcher kill some living creatures and invite the Buddha and his community of monks The Buddha will most certainly accept the invitation and praise the butcher at which point we shall come forward and deride him 
 Thereupon the butcher invited the Buddha for them 
Today we shall take advantage of the Buddha If he praises the merit of the danapati we shall use this to deride him because before and after he has killed living beings and performed demerit 
If the Buddha explains the original demerit we shall rebuke him for todays merit 
In either case we shall now have the advantage over the Buddha When the Buddha arrived he sat down passed around the water and put down the food Thereupon the Worldhonored One contemplated the thoughts of the crowd They deserved to be saved So he stuck out his tongue covering his face and licking his ears 
By committing evil he becomes evil just as sowing the seeds of bitterness   Evil collects its own demerit and good collects its own merit 
They all have their own maturation and they do not mutually cross each other By practicing what is good one obtains good just as sowing something sweet  
After the Buddha had spoken the stanzas the minds of the five hundred brahmans opened up in understanding They immediately came forward and did obeisance to the Buddha They fell prostrate folded their hands together and said to the Buddha We were foolish and degraded 
 The Buddha accepted them and they all became ascetics 
When the villagers young and old had seen the Buddhas transformation there was none who was not delighted They all attained the Path and were called noble ones without any further reference to a butcher 
When the meal was over the Buddha returned to his pure abode 
The World Once there was a brahman king called Toweihsieh The king practiced ninetysix kinds of heresies 
One day he suddenly had a wholesome thought that he wanted to practice extensive giving As was the rule for brahmans he accumulated the seven precious things mountainhigh and used them for his giving When someone came begging he would allow him to take one handful and leave This went on for several days but the hoard did not decrease 
The Buddha knew that this king deserved salvation for his previous merit He changed into a brahman and went to his land 
The king came out to meet him They exchanged greetings and he asked him how he was and said What do you seek 
I come from afar I would like to beg for some precious jewels and use them to build my dwelling The king said 
Take a handful and go 
 The brahman took a handful went seven steps returned and put the handful back in its original place 
The king asked Why do you not take them The brahman replied 
That is why I do not take anything The king said 
Take three handfuls So the brahman took them went seven steps returned again and put them back in their original place 
When the king asked the brahman why he had acted in this way again he replied 
This will do to take a wife But then I will not have any left for the fields servants oxen or horses I calculate that again it will not suffice 
That is why I ceased to act When the king told him to take seven handfuls the brahman took The Scriptural Text 
Verses of the Doctrine with Parables them went seven steps returned again and put them back 
The king said What is on your mind now The brahman answered 
That is why I do not take anything The king said Take the whole hoard of precious things 
The king was utterly surprised and again asked why The brahman answered 
It would be better to appease ones mind and seek for the unconditioned Path That is why I do not take anything The kings mind opened up and he wished to serve the illuminating teaching 
Thereupon the brahman manifested the splendid luminous appearance of the Buddha He leaped in the air and spoke the stanzas Even if one had a hoard of precious jewels as high as heaven or even if they were to fill the world it would still be better to experience the Path 
What is unwholesome appears to be wholesome and what is lovely appears to be unlovely What is painful appears to be pleasant but the madman is destroyed by this 
Then when the king saw that the Buddhas splendid appearance illuminated heaven and earth and when he further heard these stanzas he was in raptures of delight and joy The king and his ministers then accepted the five precepts and they attained the path of streamenterer 
Speaking about the Buddha Once the Buddha was in the region of Magadha underneath the tree of great joy  the most excellent spot of the Path Having subdued Mara by the strength of his virtue he was sitting and reflecting May the drum of the law of immortality be heard in the trichiliocosmos Formerly the king my father sent five men 
The reward for their merit should be conferred These five men were in the land of Benares 
When the Tathagata stood up under the tree his majestic demeanor with the primary and secondary marks radiated across heaven and earth and his imposing spirit caused to tremble bringing joy to those who saw it 
He had parted with his relatives and left his house in search of a teacher applying himself to the Path Looking up to His Revered Excellence he felt a mingling of fright and joy 
He descended by the side of the road raised his voice and said in praise Your imposing spirit moves people and your dignified demeanor is outstanding What teacher have you served that you have obtained this countenance 
The Buddha spoke the following stanzas to Upaka The eightfold right was a selfawakening by myself I cannot leave it and I am untainted My craving has ceased and I have destroyed the web of desire 
In my resolve I am alone without companion Having completed everything I have become a Buddha and thus have I understood the Noble Path 
Upon hearing the stanzas Upaka was downhearted for he did not understand So he asked the Worldhonored One 
Gautama where are you going The Buddha informed the brahman I want to go to the land of Benares to beat the drum of the Doctrine of immortality and to turn its unsurpassed wheel Among the multitude of sages of the three worlds there has never been anyone who as I will do now has turned the wheel of the Doctrine to lead the people to enter nirvana Upaka was overjoyed 
Excellent excellent it is when you say so O Buddha 
As he had not yet reached his teacher he spent the night along the way Late at night his life suddenly ended 
When the Buddha saw with his eye of the Path that he had died he felt pity for him and said The world of beings is foolish in thinking that life has permanence Having met the Buddha and departed he has perished alone When the drum of the Doctrine reverberates he alone will not hear it 
Passing through a number of eons when will he be saved The Buddha in his compassion spoke the stanzas Having seen the truth pure and without defilement and having crossed the abyss of the five predestinations a Buddha has arisen illuminating the world in order to do away with all suffering 
It is difficult to be born in the human destination as well as to obtain ones full span of life It is difficult ie rare for the world to have a Buddha and it is not easy to hear and grasp the Buddhas Doctrine 
When the Buddha had spoken these stanzas five hundred gods and men in the sky heard them They were delighted and all attained the path of the streamenterer 
Save us from this painful heat Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas 
Happiness Once three hundred li southeast of Rajagrha there was a village of mountain people with over five hundred homes They were unyielding as people and difficult to convert to the Path 
Through their merits in a former world they deserved to be saved and thereupon the Worldhonored One transformed himself into an ascetic He went to the village to beg for alms 
After he had begged for alms he left the village and sat down under a tree and entered samadhi on nirvana For seven days he did not pant breathe move or turn 
When the villagers saw this they thought his life had ended They said to one another The ascetic is dead 
We shall all give him a burial Each took a bundle of firewood for the pyre When the fire was lit and the firewood used up the Buddha rose from his seat and manifested his divine transformation of the Path His light was brilliantly shining and moving in the ten directions After he had manifested the transformation he returned to his seat underneath the tree 
We were ignorant of why you O supernatural person are free from any illness or grief or why you are not hungry or thirsty or why you did not suffer from heat Thereupon the Worldhonored One smiled with a peaceful complexion and spoke the stanzas 
My life is at peace I am not ill with any illness While everyone has illness I conduct myself without illness 
My life is at peace I do not grieve by sorrow While everyone has sorrow I conduct myself without sorrow 
My life is at peace I am pure and unconditioned Happiness is my food just as for the Shining Gods 
My life is at peace calm and unconcerned How could the fire from a countrywide heap of firewood burn me 
Then when the five hundred men in the village had heard him expound the stanzas they all became ascetics and attained arhatship All the villagers young and old believed in the Buddha Dharma and Sangha 
The Buddha quickly went to the Bamboo Grove together with the five hundred men 
When the sage Ananda had seen that the Buddha had come together with those who had attained the Path he came forward and said to the Buddha What special qualities do these monks have that they make you Worldhonored One personally go to save them The Buddha informed the Reverend Ananda 
When I had not yet become a Buddha there was in the world apratyekabuddha who usually stayed in these mountains Under a tree not far from a village he wanted to enter parinirvana  
The villagers took firewood and set fire to the pyre They gathered his relics put them in a precious urn and buried it on a mountain top They all had an earnest wish which was to obtain the Path later The nirvana of such an ascetic was a joyous event 
That is why I the Tathagata went to save them When the Buddha had said this countless gods and men all attained the Path 
Once the Buddha was in a pure abode in Sravastl There were four monks who were sitting under a tree They asked one another What is most sorrowful in the whole world 
 One said 
Among the sorrows in the world none surpasses lust One said 
Among the sorrows in the world none surpasses anger One said 
Among the sorrows in the world none surpasses hunger and thirst Another said 
Among the sorrows in the world none surpasses fear Their dispute about the meaning of sorrow went on without end 
The Buddha knew what they were disputing and went to where they were He asked the monks What are you arguing about They then stood up did obeisance and gave a full explanation of what they were arguing about 
The Buddha said to the monks 
Your arguments do not measure up to the meaning of sorrow Among the sorrows in the world none surpasses the possession of a body 
Hunger and thirst cold and heat anger fear lust and misfortune or enmity all come from the body The body is the source of all sorrows and the origin of calamities 
It makes ones thoughts weary and brings extreme anxiety Its stress is tenthousandfold Wriggling in the three realms one is malicious to another When one is attached to a self the birth and death cycle does not cease 
If one wants to leave worldly suffering one must seek for quietude If one properly guards the body and controls his thoughts and is tranquil and without the rise of any vain imaginings one may obtain nirvana 
This is the utmost pleasure Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke these stanzas No heat surpasses lust and no poison surpasses anger No suffering surpasses the body and no ordinary pleasure surpasses nirvana 
What is without pleasure is of little joy small disputation and minimal wisdom If one seeks what is great through contemplation one obtains the great pleasure 
  am the Worldhonored One I have long understood what it is to be free from grief I have rightly transcended the three realms and I alone have subdued the Maras 
The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables b After the Buddha had spoken the stanzas he informed the monks Formerly countless ages ago there was a monk with the five superknowledges called Atibalaviryaparakrama In solitude underneath a tree in the mountains he sought the Path 
Then there were also four creatures who always maintained their security in his neighborhood The first was a pigeon the second a crow the third a venomous snake and the fourth a deer 
These four creatures went looking for food in the daytime and in the evening they returned to spend the night 
One night the four creatures asked each other What is the most serious cause of sorrow in the world The crow said Hunger and thirst are the most serious 
Its apprehensions are immeasurable That is why I have left the worldly realm to apply myself to the Path I extinguish my bad thoughts and do away with imaginings I do not covet the four great elements 
When ones distress has forever ended he will know great peace When the four creatures heard this their minds opened up The Buddha informed the monks 
The four creatures then are you four people now 
In a previous existence you had already heard the meaning of the root of suffering why then did you argue again When the monks heard this they felt ashamed and reproved themselves 
Immediately they attained arhatship in the presence of the Buddha 
Pleasure Once when the Buddha was in a pure abode in SravastI there were four monks in their first stages of study 
Drinking wine together during a happy occasion with relatives and playing music song and dance these are utmost pleasures Another said 
When ones wives are just right their ornamented garments fresh and new when their perfume is fragrant and when they give rein to the passions as one likes this is utmost pleasure 
 The Buddha knew that the four persons deserved to be saved but that they had thoughts about the six desires without considering their own impermanence So he called the four monks and asked them While you were sitting there together under a tree what were you discussing 
 When the four monks truthfully related what they were most happy about the Buddha informed the four What you were discussing is completely in the path of distress and great danger It is not the way of enduring peace and c The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables utmost pleasure 
All things flourish in spring but decay in autumn and winter Ones relatives may mean joy and pleasure but they will all go away Riches carriages and horses become the shares of the five families The beauty of wives rules love and hate 
When a common man dwells in the worldly realm he gives rise to the misfortune of enmity He endangers himself and exterminates his own family His sorrows are immeasurable The suffering of the three woeful destinations and the eight hardships are enormous 
Therefore monks reject the worldly realm and seek for the Path 
Attaining nirvana is utmost pleasure Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas What is loved brings distress and what is loved also brings fear Without love  wherewith the distress and wherewith the fear 
Without any affection wherewith the distress and wherewith the fear 
Covetousness brings distress and covetousness also brings fear If one is freed from any covetousness wherewith the distress and wherewith the fear 
When one longs for the Doctrine and moral conduct is fulfilled when one is utterly sincere and knows shame and when one approaches the Path in ones personal conduct one is held dear by the crowd 
When it is possible that desire does not arise when one thinks what is right and tells it so and when ones mind is free from covetousness one is certain to cross the stream and be delivered 
The Buddha informed the four monks Once there was a king called Puan He was on friendly terms with the four kings of his neighboring countries He invited these four kings to a feast and for a whole month they wined and dined and amused themselves 
On the day of parting King Puan asked the four kings Living in the world what do you think is most pleasant One king said Games are most pleasant 
A happy meeting with relatives and music are most pleasant Another king said When while amassing many riches ones desires are in accord with ones wishes this is most pleasant Another king said Giving reign to ones passions in lust this is most pleasant King Puan said What you are discussing sirs is the basis of suffering the origin of distress 
Obtaining the Path issues forth happiness When the four kings heard this they were delighted and gained pious understanding The Buddha informed the monks King P uan at the time was myself 
The four kings were the four of you 
We had this discussion before Therefore I shall a not offer any explanation now The birth and death cycle goes on as creepers grow 
How can one rest at all Then when the four monks had heard these meaningful words again they felt shame and remorse for their error But their minds opened up They extinguished their evil thoughts eradicated their desires and attained arhatship 
Anger Once the Buddha was on Mount Grdhrakuta in Rajagrha 
Devadatta and King Ajatasatru were discussing how to destroy the Buddha and his disciples The king ordered his countrymen not to serve the Buddha When the Buddhas community of monks went begging for alms they could not receive any donation 
The Venerable Sariputra Maudgalyayana Kasyapa and Subhuti and also the nuns such as Mahaprajapatl all led their disciples to another country Only the Buddha and five hundred arhats stayed on Mount Grdhrakuta 
Devadatta went to King Ajatasatru and consulted with the king The Buddhas disciples are scattered now but there still are five hundred disciples in the Buddhas presence 
Please O King invite the Buddha to come to the city tomorrow I shall make five hundred big elephants drunk When the Buddha enters the city I shall provoke the drunken elephants so that they will trample him to death and make an end to his kind 
I shall be the Buddha instead and convert the world Upon hearing this King Ajatasatru was happy and he immediately went to where the Buddha was He kowtowed and did obeisance and said to the Buddha  Tomorrow I shall arrange for a modest gift I would like humbly to invite you Worldhonored One and your disciples to a meal in my palace The Buddha knew his plan and answered 
We shall go tomorrow morning The king withdrew and left Upon his return he said to Devadatta The Buddha has accepted my invitation In agreement with our previous plan you must make the elephants drunk 
Look out and wait for him The next day at mealtime the Buddha and his five hundred arhats The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables entered the gate of the city Five hundred drunken elephants came forward trumpeting They rushed against the walls and knocked down the trees 
The five hundred arhats flew up into the air Only the Venerable Ananda stayed by the Buddhas side while the drunk elephants all charged straight toward the Buddha The Buddha merely raised his hand and his five fingers appropriately changed to five lion kings They all roared with the same voice and made heaven and earth tremble 
The king and his subjects were all overawed 
The Worldhonored One slowly came forward and arrived at the kings palace After he had eaten with his arhats he recited a formula 
The king said to the Buddha My nature is not bright I believed in calumny and I started doing evil My scheme was not right 
Please have great mercy and forgive me for my foolishness Thereupon the Worldhonored One informed Ajatasatru and the whole great multitude In the world there are eight things that increase slander all stemming from fame Furthermore by coveting gain and b honors one brings about great sins unending for eons 
Which eight 
Gain and loss defamation and fame praise and ridicule suffering and pleasure 
People have been slandering each other from of old till now 
The intelligent are eulogized Yes they are praised as proper and worthy When a wise man keeps the precepts he is not ridiculed 
No one is maligned who is as pure as an arhat The gods admire him and he is praised by Brahma and Sakra 
After the Buddha had spoken the stanzas he again informed the king Once there was a king who liked to eat the meat of wild geese He used to dispatch a hunter to spread his nets and catch geese The hunter presented a goose a day to provide for the kings meal 
Then there was a goose king who flew down at the head of five hundred geese to seek for food The goose king fell into the net and was caught by the hunter The other geese kept flying about in consternation and did not leave 
There was a particular goose who kept fluttering about and followed without avoiding bows and arrows It cried in a piteous way spitting blood never ceasing day and night 
When the hunter saw this righteous behavior he felt compassion He then set the goose king free so that he might go with the others When the flock of geese had reclaimed their king they surrounded him full of joy 
The hunter then told everything to the king The king also sensed the righteous act and henceforth stopped catching geese The Buddha informed King Ajatasatru The goose king at that time is myself 
The particular goose is the worthy Ananda 
The flock of five hundred geese are the present five hundred arhats 
The king who ate geese is you now great king 
The hunter then is Devadatta now 
Since his former existence he has constantly desired to harm me Because of the power of my great compassion he was saved Disregarding his enmity I have brought about my becoming a Buddha 
 When the Buddha explained this the king and his ministers were all delighted 
Defilements Once there was a man without brothers When he was a child his parents loved him dearly They were compassionate and diligent and wanted him to grow up perfect They took him to teachers and urged him to study writing 
But the child was arrogant and never paid any attention He discarded in the evening what he had received in the morning He did not remember anything Thus it was for several years and he did not know anything 
His parents called him back to let him manage the familys affairs But their child was boastful and was not diligent in his endeavors The family consequently became destitute and everything seemed to slip away 
The son was heedless and did not care to keep any records selling off family possessions He was buoyant and did as he pleased He let his hair become disheveled went barefoot and wore unclean clothes He was stingy and impudent and did not heed shame and disgrace 
First of all he harbored resentment against his parents and then he reproved his teachers The spirits of my ancestors are unwilling to help me They let me weep even though I am in such dire straits It would be better to serve the Buddha and be able to obtain merit 
 So he went to where the Buddha was and did obeisance He came forward and said to the Buddha  Buddha your Path is vast and it does not exclude anyone I wish to be your disciple 
I beg to receive your permission The Buddha c The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables informed him Well if you want to seek for the Path you must practice the pure ways You bring common worldly taints if you enter my Path 
 Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas Nonrecitation is a verbal taint Want of diligence is a taint for the household Want of dignity is a taint on appearance 
Stinginess is a taint on charity Unwholesomeness is a taint on conduct In this world and the next evil is always a taint As for the taint among taints none is worse than foolishness 
When the man had heard the stanzas he understood his arrogance and foolishness He accepted the Buddhas instructions and responded with joy 
Reflecting upon the meaning of the stanzas he repented and reformed He served his parents with filial piety and respected his teachers He studied the path of the scriptures and diligently conducted his affairs as a layman He followed the precepts and kept control of himself 
Three years later he went back to where the Buddha was He fell prostrate in obeisance and he related in good faith My respect is utterly real and I have made my image complete Rejecting evil and doing what is wholesome I am congratulated by both high and low 
Welcome his hair fell off a and he immediately became an ascetic Inwardly he reflected on tranquility and insight the four truths and the right path As his zeal increased daily he attained arhatship 
The Righteous Once there was an elder brahman called Satyaka Nirgrantha 
He had five hundred disciples but he was haughty and proud of himself without any regard for the world He plated his belly with a sheet of iron When someone asked him why he said Because I am afraid my knowledge may overflow When he heard that the Buddha had appeared in the world to convert people to the Path which has illuminated the world far and wide he harbored jealousy and at no time was he at ease 
He said to his disciples I hear that the ascetic Gautama calls himself a Buddha I shall go now and ask him very profound and subtle questions that will make his heart palpitate and he will not know what to say He immediately went with his disciples to the Jetavana and lined up outside the gate 
From a distance they saw that the Worldhonored Ones majestic splendor was as grand as the sun that has just risen Their five feelings were aroused and their joy was mingled with fear They then advanced to the front and did obeisance to the Buddha The Buddha told him to sit 
After they were seated Nirgrantha asked the Buddha What is said to be a follower of the Path 
What is said to be a learned one 
What is said to be an elder 
What is said to be an upright person 
What is said to be an ascetic 
What is said to be a monk 
What is said to be a sage 
What is said to be the attainment of the Path 
What is said to be the maintenance of the precepts 
If you can explain these to me I wish to become your disciple Thereupon the Worldhonored One contemplated the questions and answered with the following stanzas 
A socalled learned one is not necessarily eloquent One who is without fear and apprehension and guards what is wholesome is a learned one 
One is not called an elder because of his advanced age Although his appearance is mature and his hair white he may just be foolish 
But one who cherishes the Doctrine of the truth who is selfcontrolled and benevolent and whose knowledge and understanding are pure he is an elder 
One is called upright not when one is as beautiful as a flower or is one who jealously covets vain ornaments and whose words differ from his conduct  
But who can discard evil after cutting off its roots who is wise and without hatred he is said to be upright 
A socalled ascetic is not necessarily someone who has taken the tonsure while he continues to lie covet and desire like a common man 
But one who can stop evil and who expounds the Way extensively calms his thoughts by extinguishing his bad intentions he is said to be an ascetic 
A socalled monk is not someone who obtains his food by begging while he continues to aspire for salvation with wrong conduct and seek fame for its own sake 
But one who discards sinful actions and who purely practices clean living whose wisdom enables him to destroy evil he is a monk 
A socalled sage is not someone who does not speak while entertaining impure thoughts only externally controlled 
But one whose thoughts are unconditioned and whose internal behavior is pure one who is tranquil here and everywhere he is a sage 
A socalled possessor of the Path refers to someone who saves not a single being but the whole world doing no harm in the Path 
When one is versed in the Doctrine it does not mean he is eloquent 
He may have little learning but if he personally relies on his conduct according to the Doctrine and if he keeps the Path and does not forget it he is versed in the Doctrine 
When Satyaka Nirgrantha and his five hundred disciples heard these stanzas of the Buddha they were delighted and their minds opened up They rejected their haughtiness and all became ascetics Nirgrantha alone manifested the mind of a bodhisattva and his five hundred disciples all attained arhatship 
Practicing the Path Once there was a brahman who had gone forth in his youth to study Until the age of sixty however he was unable to obtain the Path 
If at sixty one had not attained the Path according to the rules of the brahmans one should then return home take a wife and live at home He had a son who was upright and lovely At the age of seven he exhibited great intelligence in his study He was eloquent and sometimes said things that were beyond peoples grasp 
Exhausted he fell prostrate on the corpse and when he rose again his relatives admonished him and took him away by force to prepare the corpse for burial outside the city 
The brahman thought to himself I reckon that my weeping now will not do any good It would be better to go to King Yamaraja and beg for my sons life 
 Thereupon the brahman cleansed himself fasted and offered flowers and incense 
Where is the place that King Yamaraja holds his court He kept going for several thousands of li and when he arrived deep in the mountains he saw brahmans who had attained the Path 
What do you sir seek by asking about the place where King Yamaraja holds his court He answered 
I had a son who surpassed others in eloquence and wisdom He suddenly passed away recently I cannot get over my grief and vexation 
I want to go to King Yamaraja to beg him for my sons life I want to bring him back to his family and raise him and prepare for my old age  The c The Scriptural Text 
The place where King Yamaraja holds his court is not a place a living person can go to We shall show you sir the right direction If you go more than four hundred li westward from here there is a large stream and in it is a city This is a city where divine spirits stay when they are on an inspection round in the world 
When he arrived by the stream he saw a marvelous city Its palaces and houses were like those of the Trayastrimsa gods 
The brahman went to the gate burned incense raised his feet and recited incantations wanting to meet King Yamaraja 
When King Yamaraja gave the order to meet and question him the brahman stated At a late moment in my life I had a son and wanted to prepare for my old age I brought him up for seven years but recently his life ended Please great king be merciful and generous 
Give me back my childs life King Yamaraja said 
Your son sir is now disporting in the eastern garden 
He then went ahead embraced him and wept for him He said While I was thinking of you night and day my meals and sleep were not pleasant Did you ever think of the suffering of your parents The small child was frightened and rebuked him saying 
I have heard that the ascetic Gautama knows how to transform mans spirit 
I shall go and ask him Thereupon the brahman returned to where the Buddha was 
The Buddha then was in the Jetavana of SravastI expounding the Doctrine to his great multitude When the brahman saw the Buddha he kowtowed did obeisance and gave a full explanation of the circumstances to the Buddha He is truly my son but he does not want to be called so On the contrary he says that I am a foolish old man 
Why is it so The Buddha informed the brahman You are really foolish 
Father and mother wife and child they come together because of certain circumstances just like a guest who rises and departs Bound by foolishness one still reckons them to be ones own One does not recognize them as the basis of ones sorrow and distress Immersed in the cycle of birth and death one does not rest yet 
Only the wise do not covet affection He is aware of suffering but rejects its cause as such He diligently cultivates the scriptural precepts Since he has done away with any imaginings his cycle of birth and death has ended 
 Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas When a man cares for his wife and child but does not contemplate the principle of disease death will come all of a sudden just as quickly as swirling waters 
When a father and son are not saved what hope would there be for other relatives 
Relying on a relative when ones life has ended is like a blind man holding on to a torch 
When wisdom unravels such intention one may perform the scriptural precepts Diligently practicing to cross the world one may completely remove suffering 
Stay far away from any abyss just as the wind blows away the clouds He who has extinguished his imaginings has insight Wisdom is best in the world 
The wise one a The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables receives the right teaching and ends the cycle of birth and death 
He knew that life was impermanent and that wife and child are just like transient guests He kowtowed and made an obeisance Upon his wish to become an ascetic the Buddha said 
Excellent His hair fell off of itself and he donned the robe of the Doctrine He immediately became a monk By reflecting on the meaning of the stanzas he extinguished his craving and did away with any imaginings There on his seat he attained arhatship 
Miscellaneous Once the Buddha was in Sravasti expounding the Doctrine and making conversions Gods and dragons demons and spirits and the ruler and the people went to listen at three moments 
The king at this time was called Prasenajit As a man he was arrogant and given to pleasure His eyes were deluded by lust and his ears were confused by sounds His nose was attracted to fragrances his mouth was unrestrained about the five flavors and his body was conditioned to subtle smooth things 
He became fat unable to ride in a carriage Whether lying down or standing up he was indeed short of breath His breath was obstructed and his breathing interrupted which constantly b alarmed him He was groaning whether sitting or standing and constantly suffered from the weight of his own body 
While his attendants supported him he made inquiries withdrew and sat down his hands folded together 
Worldhonored One from a great distance I have humbly come to visit you asking your counsel free from any procedure I do not know what my crime is that my body has become so bloated 
I myself cannot perceive why I have become so 
 The Buddha informed the great king There are five things that The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables make a person corpulent One frequent meals two fondness for sleep three merriment four absence of grief five uneventfulness 
These are the five things and being fond of them makes one corpulent 
If one does not want to be corpulent one will become lean having diminished ones food not caring for it Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanza One must always be mindful At each meal know frugality Accordingly ones painful needs will diminish 
When the king heard the stanza his joy was immeasurable He immediately called his cook and informed him Accept the recitation of this stanza At mealtime expound the stanza to me before serving the meal The king took his leave and returned to the palace 
When the cook offered a meal he forthwith expounded the stanza When the king heard the stanza he was glad and he diminished his meal a spoonful each day As his meals diminished little by little his body consequently became lighter and he eventually became as lean as before 
When he saw his condition he was happy and remembered the Buddha So he stood up walked to where the Buddha was and did obeisance The Buddha told him to sit down and asked the king Your horses and carriage and your followers are in their usual condition now 
Why did you come on foot The king was glad to say to the Buddha 
You know what is best The Buddha informed the great king People in the world are so ignorant about impermanence They keep desiring all their lives long not thinking about performing merits When someone has died the spirit leaves and the body remains in the grave 
As man is impermanent he ages as does an ox He just grows and becomes fatter without any wisdom 
Birth and death are wearisome and coming and going are distressing As one intently covets the body one experiences unending suffering 
The wise know suffering and thereby reject the body They extinguish bad thoughts and do away with desire When their craving has ended they are free from rebirth 
When the king had heard the stanzas he was glad and readily understood the meaning He then became intent on starting on the unsurpassed right Path Those who had been listening were countless and they all gained the eye of the Doctrine 
Hell In the land of SravastI there was once a brahman teacher called Purana Kasyapa He had a following of five hundred disciples No one whether the king or the people failed to wait on him 
The Buddha had recently attained the Path and arrived in SravastI from Rajagrha with his disciples 
Thereupon Purana Kasyapa became jealous and wanted to destroy the Worldhonored One He expected to be respectfully served all alone So he led his disciples to meet with King Prasenajit and made a plea We elders have applied ourselves to the old teachers of the land 
Yet you  King forsake me and want to serve only him Now I would like to probe the qualities of the Path with the Buddha and to know who will be victorious 
May you O King serve the winner all your life The king said 
Very well So the king went to where the Buddha was in his majestic carriage Having greeted him he informed him Purana Kasyapa wants to thoroughly test the power of the Path with you Worldhonored One I wonder if you Worldhonored One would agree The Buddha said 
After a period of seven days I shall test his transformation The king installed two high seats in a fine place in the wide plain east of the city They were forty chang high and adorned with the seven precious things He made a display of pendant streamers c The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables and adjusted the seats 
Thereupon Purana Kasyapa and his disciples arrived first at his seat and he was about to climb the steps A demon king called Pancika saw Kasyapas vain jealousy and raised a big storm blowing at his high seat His seating turned over and the pendant streamers flew about It rained sand and shingles and their eyes were blinded 
Meanwhile the high seat of the Worldhonored One was stable and did not move at all the Buddha and his great multitude came in a solemn way and they directed themselves toward the high seat After he had mounted it straightaway the whole community of monks quietly sat down 
The king and his ministers kowtowed even more respectfully and they informed the Buddha Please confer your divine transformation suppress our wrong views and let the people in the land clearly hold faith in what is right and true Thereupon the Worldhonored One all of a sudden was not visible on his seat 
Purana Kasyapa knew there was no way out He hung his head down in shame and did not dare lift up his eyes 
Thereupon the adamantine hero raised his adamantine bolt and fire came from the tip of the bolt He pointed it at Kasyapa  Why do you not show your transformation sir Kasyapa was terrified 
He abandoned his seat and left his five hundred disciples also removed themselves and scattered 
The majestic countenance of the Worldhonored One did not delight them in their distress He returned to the Jetavana to the garden of Anathapindada On the other hand the king and his ministers were very happy and withdrew 
 Purana Kasyapa was ashamed for his disciples When they reached the bank of a river he lied to his disciples When I throw myself into the water now I shall certainly be reborn in the brahma heaven 
If I do not return know that I am happy there His disciples waited for him but he did not return They discussed among themselves Our master has certainly gone to heaven Why should we stay 
One by one they threw themselves into the water hoping to follow their master Unknowingly led by their wrongdoing they all fell into hell 
Later when the king heard about the event he was quite startled and felt uncanny He went to where the Buddha was and inquired Why did master Purana Kasyapa and his followers err so The Buddha informed the king Master Purana Kasyapa and his followers did two serious wrongdoings 
Because of these two wrongdoings they had to fall into hell They were prompted by their misfortune and threw themselves into the river Their bodies have died and their spirits have departed but the suffering they experience is immeasurable 
That is why a wise one controls his thoughts Internally he does not engender what is unwholesome and externally evil does not arise 
When for instance a frontier town is in contact with bandits there is nothing to fear if the defense is solid People inside are safe and the bandits outside cannot come in A wise one guards himself in the same way Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas The Scriptural Text 
He who by false assumptions seeks a bribe whose actions have not been correct who finds fault with good people and who administers the world on the basis of false accusations such a man led on by his own wrongdoing throws himself into a pit 
As in defending a frontier town be firm both outside and inside just so guard your thoughts What is wrong will not arise If however ones actions are deficient one brings on sorrow causing one to eventually fall into hell 
After the Buddha had spoken the stanzas he again informed the king A long time ago there were two monkey kings each heading five hundred monkeys 
One king became jealous and wanted to kill the other king He schemed to rule all alone and went on the attack He repeatedly failed however and retreated in shame 
He arrived at the shore of a great sea In a bay there was a heap of foam on the water and as the wind was blowing it was piling up several hundred chang high In his foolishness the monkey king thought it was the Snowy Mountain and he said to his group I have long heard that there is a great Snowy Mountain in the sea 
The others wondered why he did not come out They thought he was certainly very happy and jumped in one by one thus depleting the group in drowning The Buddha informed the king 
The jealous monkey king at that time was the present Purana Kasyapa The group was Purana Kasyapas present five hundred disciples 
That other monkey king was myself 
Because Purana Kasyapa was involved with jealousy in his earlier existence led on by his wrongdoing he threw himself into a heap of foam bringing an end to his group and depleting his kind He has now slandered me again and they have all jumped into the river 
The retribution for his evil will make him burn for eons without any limit When the king heard this he gained pious understanding 
Similes with the Elephant Once when Rahula had not yet attained the Path his nature was rude and his words untrustful 
The Buddha ordered Rahula Go to Amrayastika and stay in its pure abode Guard your mouth control your mind and diligently develop the scriptural precepts 
 Rahula accepted the instructions did obeisance and left He stayed there for ninety days and felt shame and regret He could not rest night or day 
He rushed forward and greeted the Buddha He arranged a rope bed and adjusted his clvara  The Buddha occupied the rope bed and told Rahula Take some water with your washing bowl and wash my feet for me Rahula accepted the instruction and washed the Buddhas feet 
When it was done the Buddha said to Rahula 
Do you see the water to wash the feet in the washing bowl Rahula said to the Buddha 
Indeed I see it The Buddha said to Rahula 
Can one use this water for food and drink to wash the hands or to rinse the mouth Rahula said 
One must not use it again This water was originally clean but having washed your feet it is defiled now 
That is why one must not use it again The Buddha said to Rahula  The same applies to you Even though you are my son and the grandson of the king even though you have given up worldly splendor and emoluments to become an ascetic you do not pay attention to strenuous pursuit while controlling your thoughts and guarding your mouth The impurity of the three poisons fills your feelings just like this water which cannot be used again The Buddha further said to Rahula 
Throw away the water in the washing bowl  a The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables Rahula immediately threw it away and the Buddha said to Rahula 
Even though the washing bowl is empty may one not fill it again with food and drink He said 
Because it is known as a washing bowl that has been defiled The Buddha said to Rahula The same applies to you Even though you are an ascetic your mouth is not trustworthy Your disposition is overbearing and you do not pay attention to strenuous pursuit 
You have a bad reputation just like the washing bowl that must not be filled up with food The Buddha kicked away the washing bowl with his toes and it rolled of its own accord jumping away several times before it stopped 
The Buddha said to Rahula Would you be careful with this washing bowl afraid it might break Rahula informed the Buddha A basin to wash the feet is something cheap 
 The Buddha said to Rahula The same applies to you 
Even though you are an ascetic you do not control your body and mouth Many are injured by your harsh words You are not loved by the multitude and the wise do not cherish you When your body dies and your spirit leaves you will be twisting in the three woeful destinations 
As you are born and die your suffering will be immeasurable not pitied by any Buddha or noble one just as you said not to care for the washing bowl When Rahula heard this he felt shame and fear 
The Buddha informed Rahula Let me explain it with a simile 
Once a king had a huge elephant who was fierce and keen in battle His strength was superior to that of any of the five hundred smaller elephants 
That king raised an army and wanted to attack an opposing country He dressed up the elephant with iron armor and assigned an elephant master to control it He tied a couple of halberds to the two teeth of the elephant He also attached two doubleedged swords to his two ears and tied curved swords to the four legs of the elephant 
The elephant just hid his trunk guarding it and did not use it to fight The elephant master was glad knowing that the elephant was protecting his life 
An elephants trunk is soft and if it is hit by an arrow the elephant will die 
When the elephant had been fighting for a long time however he would thrust his trunk looking for a sword The elephant master did not like it because he thought that this fierce elephant did not have any regard for his own life Thrusting his trunk looking for a sword he wanted to hold it with the tip of his trunk The king and his ministers were concerned about this huge elephant and they decided not to let him fight again 
 The Buddha informed Rahula Men commit nine evils but they merely have to guard their mouth just as this huge elephant guarded its trunk and did not fight 
Why so He was afraid to be hit by an arrow and die 
That is why man likewise guards his mouth He must fear the three woeful destinations and the suffering in hell 
If he commits all ten evils and does not guard his mouth he might lose his life like this huge elephant who thrust its trunk in a fight not counting on being hit by an arrow 
The same applies to man when all ten evils are committed and he does not reflect on the three woeful destinations and the suffering of the poisons 
If however he performs the ten wholesome actions controls his body mouth and mind and commits no evil he may obtain the Path and be free from the three destinations and the calamity of repeating the cycle of birth and death Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas 
With trustworthiness I shall save people without moral precepts When for instance an elephant is tame it may be mounted by a king A wellregulated person is most respected and is bestowed trust 
When Rahula heard the earnest admonitions of the Buddha he was moved and encouraged He remembered them and did not forget He was full of zeal but mild and his forbearance was like the earth His imaginings quieted down and he attained the path of the arhat 
b The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables Once the Buddha was in the pure abode of the Jetavana in the land of Sravasti proclaiming the great Doctrine to the disciples of the four divisions to gods dragons and spirits and to the ruler and his subjects 
At that time there was an elder layman called Hotitan  He came to where the Buddha was did obeisance to the Buddha withdrew and sat aside He folded his hands knelt deeply and said to the Worldhonored One I have long been receiving your great teaching looking up to you and serving you but under the pressure of personal matters I have been incapable 
Please be merciful The Worldhonored One had him take a seat and asked him where he had come from and his name He knelt deeply and answered 
My name is Hastidamaka and at the time of the former king I was the kings elephant tamer The Buddha asked the layman how many principles are necessary in taming elephants and he replied 
I always tame a big elephant by using three things 
Which three 
One a firm hook I hold its mouth with it and place the reins Two by diminishing its food I always let it grow lean Three I lash it with a rod making it feel pain 
With these three things I can tame it well The Buddha further asked 
That is the right way to tame it If you have subdued it what can you use it for He replied If it is subdued it may be mounted by a c king and one may let it fight It will advance or retreat as you wish without resistance The Buddha further asked the lay disciple 
Is there just this method 
To tame an elephant there is just this way The Buddha informed the lay disciple You can only tame an elephant You must further be able to tame yourself  So he said 
I wonder what taming oneself may mean 
Please Worldhonored One teach me what has not yet been made known The Buddha informed the lay disciple I also have three things by which I subdue everyone and by means of subduing oneself one gains access to the realm of the unconditioned 
One control ones verbal actions in utmost sincerity Two suppress ones corporeal vigor through pure compassion Three extinguish ones cover of mental foolishness through wisdom 
With these three things one may be delivered from everything be free from the three woeful destinations realize the unconditioned and not experience any sorrow or suffering caused by the cycle of birth and death Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas 
Basically my minds actions are pure and it always acts in contentment I have completely rejected its fetters and regulated it like an elephant restrained by a hook 
If one finds happiness in the Path and is not negligent and if one can always guard his thoughts one may pull himself out of corporeal suffering just like an elephant leaving a pitfall 
Although one is always well trained like the Sindhu or the fine elephants it would be better to be selfdisciplined 
He is unable to go there nor can others do it Only one who disciplines himself can reach the plane of the selfdisciplined 
When the lay disciple heard the stanzas his joy was immeasurable He understood deep inside and immediately attained the eye of the Doctrine Those who were listening were countless and they all attained the Path 
Craving Once the Buddha was in the land of Rajagrha in a pure abode on Mount Grdhrakuta expounding the great Doctrine for gods and men and for dragons and spirits 
Then there was a man who had left his family his wife and child and who came to where the Buddha was He did obeisance to the Buddha and asked to be an ascetic The Buddha immediately accepted him as an ascetic He instructed him to sit underneath a tree and reflect on the qualities of the Path 
Having received his instructions the monk went deep into the mountains more than a hundred li from the pure abode He sat alone among the trees and reflected on the Path for three years but his thoughts were not firm and he wanted to return He thought that to leave his family in search of the Path was difficult and it would be better to return quickly to see his wife and child 
After he thought thus he rose and left the mountains 
With his noble penetrating insight the Buddha saw that this monk deserved to obtain the Path that he was returning because of his foolishness 
With his supernatural power the Buddha transformed himself into an ascetic He went in the opposite direction and they met along the way 
This place is flat Let us sit down and talk Thereupon the two men sat down and talked at ease 
We shall readily enjoy ourselves and later make plans again All of a sudden there appeared an old monkey who had left the forest He was in a place without any trees and living there 
The transformed ascetic asked the monk Why is this monkey all alone on the plains 
There are no trees 
How does he enjoy himself The monk replied to the transformed person I have been seeing this monkey for a long time He has come to live here for two reasons 
Which two 
One because of his wife and child and many relatives he could not obtain sufficient food and drink but it was his joy to give full rein to his mouth 
Two night and day he constantly went up and down the trees so that the soles of his feet were worn down and he could not find any rest 
For these two reasons he left the trees to come and live here At the moment the two men were talking they again saw the monkey going away and returning to the trees 
The transformed ascetic said to the monk Did you see the monkey go back to the trees He answered I have 
This animal is foolish He left the trees but then enters them again while his group remains restive and he is not wearied with the trouble The transformed man said The same applies to you sir 
What is the difference this monkey 
For two reasons you sir have come and entered these mountains 
Which two 
because your wife and dwelling were a prison Two because your child and relatives were shackles 
That is why you sir have come in search of the Path to end the suffering attendant on birth and death Now you want to return to your family to renew your shackles and reenter the prison Love and affection lead straight to hell The transformed ascetic  chang tall then showed his primary and secondary marks 
His golden light shining everywhere he moved the whole mountain Flying birds and running animals came looking for the light They all recognized their former lives and deeply repented their misdeeds 
Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas When for instance the roots of a tree are very firm although it is cut down it will still grow again If ones craving mind is not completely done away with one will soon experience suffering again 
Like a monkey who has left the trees but who although delivered hastens back to the trees such acts are repeated by people Having left their prison they reenter it 
A covetous mind is a constant stream Its practices are accompanied by arrogance When ones imaginings are set on desire one is covered and does not see anything 
While all intentions are widely flowing and the fetter of craving acts like a creeper one can eradicate the root of the intentions only by perceiving them distinctly through wisdom 
Now as craving is lush notions are its tendrils When covetousness is deep without bottom old age and death will increase through it 
When the monk saw the brightness of the Buddhas light and heard the words of the stanzas he was struck with fear He fell prostrate in obeisance confessed his sin and apologized for his misdeed Internally he immediately removed himself counted his breath and as a result of his tranquility and insight attained arhatship in front of the Buddha 
All the gods had come to listen and they were all glad They scattered flowers and worshiped and their praises were immeasurable 
b Volume Four Once when the Buddha was in the land of SravastI expounding the Doctrine to gods and men there was a brahman elder in the city whose wealth was immeasurable He was stingy and not fond of giving He used to close the gate during meals and did not like to have guests When it was mealtime he would order his gatekeeper to close the doors firmly and not let anyone enter the gate unless he had a good reason 
The elder would immediately think of nice food and order his wife to prepare food and drink He instructed her to kill a plump chicken blend it with ginger and pepper and broil it 
An arrangement of dishes was made on the spot and he ordered that the outside gate be closed Husband and wife both sat down and their small child was placed in the middle In this way they drank and ate together 
The parents took the chicken meat and fed the child They did this a number of times and did not abandon the practice 
The Buddha knew that this elders former merit should save him and so he transformed himself into an ascetic Watching while they sat down eating he appeared in front of their seats He uttered incantations and further mentioned that with some giving one could obtain great merit 
When the elder raised his head and saw the transformed ascetic he immediately scolded him saying You may be a man of the Path but you are shameless Why do you give offense while I sit eating with my household The ascetic a The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables answered 
Why would I be ashamed The elder asked I and my household we are enjoying ourselves 
Why would I be ashamed The ascetic replied You have killed your father and married your mother and you worship your enemy not knowing any shame 
But you say to me a beggar how shameful I am Thereupon the ascetic spoke the stanzas The sprouting creeper is not cut off and yet you just keep enjoying your desire for food You feed your enemy and augment the tombs A foolish person is always pressed 
In a prison there may be hooks and irons but a wise person does not consider them to be a prison When a fool sees the adornments of wife and child his mind is firmly attached to them 
The wise explain craving as a prison very solid and difficult to leave 
When the elder heard these stanzas he was startled and asked earnestly Man of the Path why do you expound these words The man of the Path answered 
The chicken on your table was your father in a previous existence Because of his stinginess he was constantly reborn among chickens to be eaten by you sir 
This small child was a flesheating devil  and you sir were a trader Your father had boarded a ship and gone to sea A sudden current shipwrecked him in the land of the raksasas and he was eaten by a raksasa 
And so when his life ended after five hundred existences the raksasa came to be your son sir Because your remaining evil is not over yet he came with the intention to harm b you 
Your present wife was your mother in a previous existence sir Because her love was so strong she now is your wife still 
You are foolish now and you do not know your previous lives You killed your father and fed your enemy and you have taken your mother as your wife The wheel of birth and death in the five destinations turns without end Going round in the five destinations who can know 
Only a man of the Path sees this world and observes the other A fool does not know How would he not be ashamed 
 Thereupon the elders hair was suddenly standing on end and he was terrified The Buddha manifested his awesome supernatural power and revealed to him his former lives When the elder saw the Buddha he immediately recognized his former lives He subsequently repented apologized to the Buddha and accepted the five precepts 
Once the Buddha was in the Jetavana in Sravasti expounding the Doctrine 
There was a young monk then who had gone to the city on his alms round He saw a young woman whose beauty was beyond compare His thoughts kept longing for her Bound by delusion he could not free himself 
When the men of the Path who were his fellows in study went to ask him what was ailing him the young monk explained all that was on his mind 
I want to do away with my thoughts of the Path and follow my craving but my wish is not fulfilled 
I am sick with grief His fellow students reproved him but it did not enter his ears So they forced him and helped him to go to where the Buddha was They reported the whole matter to the Worldhonored One 
The Buddha informed the young monk Your wish is easy to obtain It is not worth any grief I shall expediently solve this for you 
Stand up and eat and drink When the monk heard this he gained confidence and was glad and his sadness was immediately over 
Then the Worldhonored One led this monk and his great multitude to the city of Sravasti to the home of the beautiful woman The woman had died and they had laid her corpse out for three days Her household was in mourning and could not stand to bury her Her body was putrid and swollen with impurities flowing out 
The Buddha informed the monk The The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables c beautiful woman you were longing for is now like this Everything is impermanent 
 Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas Seeing beauty the mind is fascinated It does not reflect on seeing it as impermanent The fool considers what is beautiful to be good 
How would he know that this is untrue likes to be wrapped up in lust like a silkworm weaving a cocoon The wise one is able to give it up Without ogling he removes all suffering 
One whose thoughts are loose sees lust as pure His craving mind increases and he consequently builds his own prison 
He who awakens his mind and destroys his lust always thinks that desire is impure and he consequently leaves his evil prison He can do away with the calamities of old age and death 
Thereupon when the young monk saw that this woman had been dead for three days that her countenance was swollen and rotting and that the stench was hard to approach and when he further heard the stanzas with the Worldhonored Ones pure instructions he was sorry and his mind opened up He knew he had been wrong He did obeisance to the Buddha kowtowed and repented his error 
He took refuge in the Buddha and was led back to the Jetavana Throughout his life he was full of zeal and he attained arhatship 
When the countless people in the crowd understood that the desire for beauty was impure their belief in the nature of impermanence was confirmed Their coveting minds ceased and they attained the Path 
Once the Buddha was in a pure abode of Sravasti expounding the Doctrine to gods people and dragons 
There was an elder there whose wealth was immeasurable He had a son twelve or thirteen years of age 
When his parents died he was young and did not know about livelihood and how to manage the affairs of the family He wasted the riches and within a few years they were gone He went begging some time after but he still could not provide for himself 
His father had a relative an elder whose great riches were immeasurable One day the elder met him and he asked him about his circumstances The elder took pity on him took him back with him and regulated everything He gave him his daughter in marriage and provided him with servants carriages and horses 
But as a man he was lazy He did not keep any accounts and could not provide for their livelihood Squandering and depleting his wealth they were more distressed by hunger every day 
Because of his daughter the elder gave him more riches but he squandered them as before They consequently became destitute 
The elder frequently gave him money but he used it recklessly Thinking that he could not get any result he wanted to take the wife away and marry her to another 
While he was talking it over with his kindred the daughter overheard them and went back to tell her husband My family is powerful and can take me away from you because you cannot provide a living What will you do 
What plan will you make When he heard his wifes words he felt shame and thought to himself Yes my merit is meager and I am full of mistakes I am not versed in the ways of a family livelihood or of making a living I am going to lose my wife now and I shall be begging just as before 
After love one becomes covetous 
How shall I cope with it He reflected and reflected and then he had an evil idea He led his wife into their chamber and said I now want to die with you in the same place He stabbed his wife on the spot and then stabbed himself Both were dead 
The slaves panicked and ran to inform their elder The elder and the young and old were alarmed and when they came to have a look they confirmed that they were dead A funeral was held with their coffins and shrouds as was a The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables the established custom in the land 
They kept thinking about the woman and did not leave A while later the elder heard that the Buddha was in the world converting and expounding the Doctrine and that those who saw him were very glad as they forgot their sorrow and did away with their distress He thus led the family young and old to where the Buddha was They did obeisance to the Buddha withdrew and sat aside 
The Buddha asked the elder where he came from 
Why are you so sad and unhappy The elder said My house is unfortunate I gave my only daughter in marriage but she happened to meet a foolish husband who could not provide for a livelihood When I wanted to take away his wife he killed his wife and himself 
On our way back we come to visit you Worldhonored One The Buddha informed the elder 
The poison of covetousness destroys the self and ones family It even harms all beings a fortiori man and wife 
 Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas The fool binds himself with his covetousness and he does not seek to cross to the other shore He longs for riches hurting others and himself too 
A mind that desires is a field in which lust hatred and delusion are the seeds Therefore when one gives to him who has passed beyond worldly things the merits obtained are immeasurable 
When associates are few but goods numerous a merchant is frightened and afraid Exploiting his emotions bandits will harm his life That is why the wise do not covet anything 
Then when the elder heard the Buddhas exposition of the stanzas he was delighted and happy He forgot his sorrow and removed his distress Still in their seats young and old and all who were listening destroyed their two million evil misdeeds and attained the path of the streamenterer 
Once the Buddha was in a pure abode in Sravasti expounding the Doctrine to gods dragons spirits and the ruler and his subjects 
Then there were two wandering fellows who were very good friends They always followed each other and did things together as if they were one without any difference The two men deliberated and decided that they wanted to be ascetics They both went to where the Buddha was did obeisance knelt deeply and folded their hands 
Do give us your permission The Buddha accepted them and they then became ascetics 
The Buddha ordered them to stay together in one room 
While the two were staying together they just thought of worldly desires and pleasures Again and again they sighed for sensuous appearances Talking about their seductive exploits they were totally attached to them and did not forsake them Their fondness did not cease 
With his eye of wisdom the Buddha knew that their thoughts were disturbed and that their minds were rampant with desire They were unable to settle down their thoughts and thus they could not be saved 
The Buddha made one of them go away and transformed himself into that man He entered the room and asked The ideas we have in mind do not go away We might both go and have a look 
The Buddha magically created a prostitute b The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables in the village They both entered her dwelling and said to her We men of the Path have received the Buddhas prohibitory precept not to perform any sexual act 
If the mind allows then it becomes desire Why necessarily just five desires 
If one can swiftly destroy the five desires he is a brave one 
Without desire and without fear one is undisturbed and without grief When desire is removed and fetters are undone he is someone out of the abyss for a long time 
After the Buddha had spoken the stanzas he manifested his brilliant appearance When the monk saw this he was ashamed and repented of his wrongdoing He fell prostrate and did obeisance to the Buddha who again expounded the Doctrine to him He was glad and gained understanding and he attained arhatship 
When the other man returned he saw that his companions expression was happier than usual So he asked his companion why he was like that 
The companion then gave an explanation according to the facts The Buddhas great compassion had caused the rescue Having received the Worldhonored Ones mercy he had been able to escape from every suffering 
Thereupon the monk further spoke the stanza If day and night one thinks of desire and the mind wanders not giving any thought to curbing it one will then long for her foul exposure on seeing a woman When ones imaginings are extinguished one is free from sorrow 
When his companion the monk heard this stanza he immediately started reflecting He did away with his desire extinguished his imaginings and attained the eye of the Doctrine 
Nurturing by Gain Once the Buddha led his disciples to the pure abode of Ghosila in c the land of Kausambi and expounded the Doctrine to gods men spirits and dragons 
The king was called Udayana He had a wife who practiced benevolence and was famous for her purity He valued her principles and respected her privately 
When he heard that the Buddha had come to make conversions he made preparations for both to go to where the Buddha was They did obeisance to the Buddha withdrew and sat down according to their regular rank 
The Buddha explained to the king his wife and the ladies in waiting the nature of the following impermanence suffering the void why man is reborn that what comes together must separate that meeting with enmity is painful that one is reborn in heaven because of ones merits and that one enters the abyss because of ones evil 
The king and his wife were happy and gained pious understanding Each accepted the five precepts and became a man and wife with pure faith They saluted the Buddha and withdrew returning to the palace 
There once was a brahman called Magandika who had a most lovely daughter unequaled in the society When she was sixteen years old no one could find fault with her He offered a reward of a thousand taels over a period of ninety days to find that she was not an upright woman the money would be given away but no one complied 
As she attained womanhood she should find someone to marry 
He pondered on the possible person If there is anyone who is as upright as my daughter I shall give him my daughter 
I have heard about the monk Gautama of the Sakya clan His appearance is golden and rare in the world The Scriptural Text 
Verses of the Doctrine with Parables I shall go and give this daughter in marriage to him So he took her to the Buddha did obeisance and informed the Buddha My daughters loveliness is unequaled in society She has grown up and should marry but there is no suitable companion in society 
Your daughters beauty sir is considered good by her family but my beauty is considered good by the Buddhas My good appearance and beauty are in principle not the same 
She is like a painted vase filled with excrement What is particularly fine about that 
Her beauty is local attached to the great villains of her eyes ears nose mouth and body The beauty of an outward appearance is a great personal calamity It destroys ones house and extinguishes ones family It kills relatives and harms children 
I stand alone all by myself Although I am afraid of real danger how much less would I accept your disastrous and villainous offspring Go away sir I do not a accept her 
 Thereupon the brahman became angry and left He went to King Udayana praised the attractiveness of his daughter and told the king By her looks this daughter should be your concubine Because she is of age I present her to you now O king When the king saw her he was happy and immediately accepted her 
She respectfully agreed to be his second subordinate wife He conferred his official seal gold and silver and precious things on Magandika who respectfully agreed to be his councilor 
When this woman obtained her rank she was always jealous and her witchcraft misled the king She spoke ill of the first wife and not just once 
But the king put her to shame saying You allure me but your words are insolent 
The deportment of that person ie the first wife is honorable and yet you speak ill of her The thoughts of this woman were malicious as she still wanted to harm her She kept on speaking ill and the king was somewhat perplexed 
His first wife kept her fast and she alone did not comply with the order He repeated it and called her three more times but she kept her fast and did not move The king was in a great rage and sent someone to drag her out He had her tied up in front of his palace and prepared to shoot her dead 
But his wife was not afraid as she wholeheartedly took refuge in the Buddha The king himself shot at her but the arrow returned to him Another shot and it returned at once And so it was with several more arrows 
The king had great fear by then Untying her he asked What artifice do you have that you bring this about His wife replied 
How well said He immediately sent Magandika away and the second wife was returned to her parents He correctly established his first wife in the palace 
The king his first wife the women of the palace and the crown prince made preparations to leave and along with their ministers they all went to where the Buddha was They did obeisance withdrew sat down and listened to the Doctrine with their hands folded 
The king then gave the Buddha a complete explanation of the event according to the facts 
The Buddha said to the great king A bewitching woman has eightyfour attitudes but there are eight main attitudes detested by the wise 
Namely which eight 
One jealousy two false anger three insulting four imprecation five repugnancy six greediness seven fondness for embellishment eight a poisonous mouth These are the eight main attitudes 
The Buddha informed the great king The demerit and the merit performed by man has each its own real nature The retribution reflected in each experience is tenthousandfold never equal If b one practices the six qualities and keeps the fast the merits are numerous 
Praised by the Buddhas one will finally be reborn in the brahma heaven and the happiness based on merit will come naturally When the Buddha said this the king his wife the ladies in waiting and great ministers all opened up their minds and obtained the Path 
The Ascetic Once the Buddha was in a pure abode in Sravasti expounding the Doctrine to gods dragons spirits the king and his subjects 
Then there was a young monk At daybreak he donned his robe and with staff and bowl in hand he went to a large village on his alms round 
By the side of the main road there was a vegetable garden cultivated by an official At the edge of the garden he planted millet In the outer grassy area of the garden he had installed a net to discharge arrows If an animal or thief were to disturb it an arrow would be discharged upon touching the net killing the intruder 
A beautiful young girl guarded this garden alone If someone wanted to go in she called out from afar and showed the way to safely enter Someone who did not know the way was sure to be killed by a discharged arrow 
However while this girl was on guard all by herself she sang melancholy songs Her voice was clear and bewitching Of those who heard it there was none who did not halt his chariot or horse They turned around and mincing their steps they wanted to hurry to her but they lingered about and did not go further 
The Buddha saw with his three penetrating insights that if this monk went a little further he would be killed by an arrow Through his merit he deserved to obtain the Path although he was misled by foolishness and overwhelmed by the screen of desire The Buddha had pity on his foolishness and wanted to save him He changed himself into someone clad in white and went to his side 
Stop your thoughts and drive away desire If one does not sever desire a thought will accordingly run its course You must restrain yourself with force When one has renounced home but is indolent the m in d is still tainted 
He whose conduct is indolent must exert his will not suspend it If conduct is not clean or pure how could it bring about the great treasures 
If one is not trained and hard to instruct he is like a tree withered by the wind A person is of his own making 
Having spoken these stanzas he returned to his own appearance His primary and secondary marks were evident and his light illuminated heaven and earth Anyone who saw it had his delusion cleared away and his confusion ended They were all back in their element 
When the monk saw the Buddha his mind suddenly opened up as when observing a light in darkness He immediately fell prostrate and did obeisance to the Buddha He kowtowed repented his wrongdoing confessed and apologized to the Buddha When he had deeply understood tranquility and insight he attained arhatship and followed the Buddha back to the pure abode 
The countless who heard this all attained the eye of the Doctrine 
The Brahman Once in the land of Ssuhotieh there were big mountains called Ssuhsiucheto In the mountains there were more than five hundred brahmans who excelled in the superknowledges They said to each other 
What we have attained is exactly nirvana Meanwhile the Buddha had just appeared in the world to establish the Doctrine to open up the gate of immortality The brahmans heard about it but they did not go to meet him They deserved to be saved however because of their previous merits The Buddha went to them alone without a companion 
At the entrance of the road he sat down under a tree As his mind concentrated in meditation Csamadhi light emitted from his body and illuminated the whole mountain The whole mountain was ablaze as if it were on fire 
They recited incantations over water and tried to extinguish it They exhausted their divine powers and were unable to extinguish it They felt strange and gave up and then left the mountains following the road In the distance they saw the Worldhonored One meditating under a tree as if the sun had risen at the edge of the golden mountains 
They wondered what kind of spirit he was They approached him and gazed at him 
The Buddha bade them sit down and asked them where they came from 
The brahmans replied We are staying in these mountains and we have long been practicing the Path but at dawn a fire suddenly started burning the trees in the mountains 
We were frightened and left The Buddha informed the brahmans This is the fire of merit It does not harm anyone 
Among the ninetysix kinds there never was this master They said  
We have heard that the son of King Suddhodana called Siddhartha was not happy with his majestic position and that he has gone a forth in search of Buddhahood 
Might he not be the one The disciples asked the masters to question the Buddha on whether the practices of the brahmans were correct or not 
The masters and the followers all rose and said to the Buddha The scriptural doctrine of brahmans called the four nonobstructions including astronomy geography regnal rule rules which govern the people and the ninetysix kinds of magical arts are the rules that should be practiced Are these scriptural texts the way to nirvana 
Please O Buddha explain and disclose what we have not yet heard The Buddha informed the brahmans 
Listen well and think about it Countless eons of previous lives I have constantly been practicing these scriptures Having attained the five superknowledges too moving mountains and stopping currents I still passed through countless cycles of birth and death I neither attained nirvana nor did I hear of someone who had attained the Path 
Such practices as yours cannot be those of brahmans 
 Thereupon the Worldhonored One sighed and spoke the stanzas When having crossed the stream one is desireless like Brahma and knows that the formations have ended I call him a brahman 
When because he does not have two doctrines he is pure and has crossed the abyss and his fetters of desire are undone I call him a brahman 
One is not called a brahman because one has matted hair When one sincerely practices in accord with the Doctrine he is pure and wise 
When one has adorned ones hair but has no wisdom for what purpose is a simple coarse garment 
When inwardly one is not free from attachment what is the gain in ones outward rejection 
When one has removed lust hatred delusion conceit and all evil like a snake casting off its skin I call him a brahman 
When one has relinquished worldly things and does not utter harsh words and is mindful of the eightfold path I call him a brahman 
When having done away with affection one has left home become free from desire and removed attachment to craving itself I call him a brahman 
When one shuns the places where people gather does not fall into a gathering of gods and does not revert back to any gathering I call him a brahman 
When one is knowledgeable concerning ones previous lives where one has come from time and again when ones cycles of birth and death have ended when one understands the profundity of the Path and one is as wise as the one who is silent  I call him a brahman 
After the Buddha had spoken the stanzas he informed the brahmans As for what you have practiced you think that you b have already attained nirvana Just like fish in shallow water how could you have lasting happiness 
It is actually missing in your lives When the brahmans heard his teaching an inner joy arose in their five feelings They knelt deeply and said to the Buddha that they wished to be his disciples 
Their hair fell off naturally and they immediately became ascetics Because they had previously conducted themselves in purity they attained the Path and became arhats The gods dragons and spirits of the mountains all attained the Path 
Nirvana Once the Buddha was on Mount Grdhrakuta near the city of Rajagrha together with one thousand two hundred fifty monks 
Should we rather raise troops to attack them In the land there was a wise lord the prime minister called Varsakara who replied 
Yes indeed The king said to Varsakara  The Buddha is not far from here With his three insights of a noble sage there is nothing he does not see clearly 
If I want to attack them will I gain a victory or not When the prime minister received the instruction he had a wagon and horses prepared and went to the pure abode When he arrived he did obeisance to the Buddha his head touching the ground 
The Buddha bade him sit down and he took a seat The Buddha asked the prime minister where he came from and the minister replied 
 The king sends me He kowtowed at the Buddhas feet and asked how he was whether he was taking his meals as usual 
The Buddha then asked the lord Are the king the people and the subjects of his land all in peace The minister said that the sovereign of the land and the people were all receiving the Buddhas grace 
He informed the Buddha The king feels The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables dislike toward the country of Vrji and wants to attack it Can he according to your noble opinion  Buddha gain a victory The Buddha informed the minister 
If the people of the country of Vrji are carrying out seven rules one cannot have victory over them 
The king must think carefully He must not initiate anything recklessly The minister then asked the Buddha what the seven rules were 
The Buddha said The people of Vrji frequently gather together to discuss the right Doctrine While developing merit they guard themselves and take this to be their norm This is namely the first  
The people of the country of Vrji the ruler and his ministers are in constant harmony They are very loyal in their duties Whether instructing or carrying out their duties they do not offend anyone This is namely the second  
The people of Vrji are involved in observing the Law There is nothing they do not attend to and they also do not dare commit any violation Superior and inferior comply with the rules This is namely the third  
The people of Vrji are courteous and respectful Men and women are separate but the old and young are together They do not commit any breach of the rules of proper c deportment This is namely the fourth  
The people of Vrji piously care for their parents and are obedient to their elders They receive instructions on the acceptance of the precepts and consider this to be a national rule This is namely the fifth  
They venerate the gods of the soil and grain They respectfully comply with the four seasons and do not neglect farming This is namely the sixth  The people of the country of Vrji honor the Path and respect virtue 
When someone has come from afar they worship him and provide clothing bedding and medicine This is namely the seventh  
Now when the lord of a country acts according to these seven rules he cannot easily be endangered Even if all the people in the world went to attack him they could not gain a victory The Buddha informed the minister 
If the people of Vrji were to observe even a single rule one still must not attack them 
How much less when they observe all seven such rules Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanza An advantageous victory must not be relied on Even if one wins one shall suffer further yet 
When Prime Minister Varsakara heard the stanza expounded by the Buddha he immediately attained the Path Young and old at the meeting all attained the path of the streamenterer 
The minister then rose from his seat and said to the Buddha The affairs of the state are very troublesome I wish to return 
Please excuse me The Buddha said 
You may but keep this event in mind He then rose from his seat did obeisance to the Buddha and left Upon his return he reported everything to the king who then gave up his attack He upheld the Buddhas majestic teaching and thereby transformed his nation 
The people of Vrji then came and obeyed his orders Superiors and inferiors were respectful to one another and the land consequently prospered 
The Birth and Death Cycle Once the Buddha was in the pure abode of the Jetavana in the land of Sravasti widely expounding the wondrous Doctrine to gods and men and to the king and his high officials 
There was an elderly brahman who was dwelling along the road and his wealth was immeasurable He had a son who was twenty years of age and who had recently married not yet fully seven days Husband and wife respected each other and their words were in harmony The wife said to her husband 
He fell to the ground was injured badly and died The whole family young and old was in a frenzy as they ran to where the son was Calling out to heaven they mourned but then stopped and came to their senses again Kinsmen far and near came in countless numbers and they were all very grieved 
Thereupon the Worldhonored One was saddened by their foolishness He went to ask how they were When the household of the elder young and old saw the Buddha they were moved and did obeisance They stated their hardship in detail 
Whose son is it after all 
Who are his relatives Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas Life is like a fruit that ripens always in fear that it might fall Having come into being all experience suffering Who then can bring about immortality 
From the beginning one finds pleasure in desire Because of lewdness one enters the shadow of the womb Having received a form life moves like lightning flowing night and day and difficult to halt 
This body is a mortal thing but the spirit is a formless entity If life expires it will be reborn but evil and merit are not lost 
Beginning and end are not one generation but delusion remains longer as a result of desire One creates and experiences ones own suffering and happiness Although the body dies the spirit does not perish 
When the elder heard the stanzas he understood their meaning and forgot his sorrow He knelt deeply and said to the Buddha What evil did this son commit in his previous life that he met an untimely death in his wonderful life 
Please explain the misdeed he committed previously The Buddha informed the elder Well in the past there was a young child who played with bow and arrows among the divine trees Nearby there were three other people 
When they saw a sparrow high on a tree the young child wanted to shoot it down The three people urged him on If you can hit the sparrow people will praise you as a hero The young child thought it was fine He drew his bow and shot the sparrow which died instantly falling to the ground 
They passed through the cycle of birth and death for countless eons They encountered each other wherever they existed and all met and experienced their evil One of the three people had merit however and he is now in heaven One is reborn in the sea and has transformed there into a dragon king 
This young child was previously reborn in heaven and was the son of a god When his life ended he descended and was reborn as your son  elder He fell from the tree and when his life ended he was immediately reborn in the sea as the son of the transformed dragon king On the very day of his rebirth a transformed bird king with golden wings took him and ate him up 
Now two are distressed and weep in three places I would say 
Because they joined him in their merriment the retribution of these three is to weep Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas The spirit creates the three realms and the five places both wholesome and unwholesome While one quietly proceeds they arrive in silence 
The essence of form desire and formlessness all depend on ones former conduct Just as a seed accords with its former appearance  retribution naturally follows ones shadow 
b The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables When the Buddha had spoken the stanzas he wanted to open up the mind of the elder So he manifested his previous life with his power of the Path fully showing the events in heaven and among the dragons 
The elders mind opened up and he rose with joy He knelt deeply folded his hands and said to the Buddha I and the young and old wish to be your disciples O Buddha dedicating ourselves to the five precepts and becoming upasakas The Buddha then conferred the precepts and once again expounded the Doctrine and the meaning of impermanence to them 
The Advantage of the Path Once there was a king who ruled according to the right Doctrine and the people longed for a change But he had no heir apparent and this was sad 
When the Buddha came to his country he went out to visit the Honored One Listening to the scriptures he was glad and he immediately accepted the five precepts He observed them respectfully with all his heart but his only wish was to have a son Night and day he was zealous not lax during the three moments 
He had a servant who was eleven years old and who constantly served him The servant was faithful trustful served the Law and did not lose the dignity of his demeanor He was humble forbearing and zealous With all his heart he applied himself to the recitation of scriptural stanzas 
All of a sudden he fell seriously ill and it resulted in his death but his spirit returned and became the kings son He was reared to adulthood and at fifteen years of age he was established as the heir apparent 
When the life of the king his father had ended by way of inheritance he became the king He was arrogant and licentious lewd and lustful Night and day he was indolent and he did not manage the affairs of the land His officers of state gave up the court and the people suffered from calamity 
The Buddha knew that this behavior was not in agreement with his office and so he led his disciples to that country 
When the king heard about the Buddhas arrival he did exactly as the late king He welcomed him with a large crowd kowtowed to the ground withdrew and The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables sat on the kings seat 
The officers the people the officials and ministers are they all their usual selves The king said As a young man I am unable to find tranquility yet 
In this land there is no one else The Buddha said to the king Do you know now O king where you actually came from or what merit you have performed to obtain this royal position The king said I wonder In my ignorance I do not understand 
I do not know where I came from in the previous world The Buddha said to the great king Actually one becomes a king through five things 
Which are the five 
One through giving one becomes a king all people offer with reverence palaces and halls and ones wealth is without limit 
Two constructing temples and worshiping the Buddha Dharma and Sangha with bedding and decorative hangings through this one becomes king 
Three personally revering the Honorable Things and all venerables through this one becomes a king All people do obeisance to him 
Four forbearance of the three of the body and the four of the mouth and seeing that the mind is without its three evils through these one becomes a king All who see this are glad 
Five in learning one always strives for wisdom Through this one becomes a king When making decisions about the affairs of the land all respectfully apply them 
When one practices these five things one will be a king in every existence Then the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas When one knows how to wait on his superiors the ruler his father his teacher and men of the Path when he is trustful moral charitable learned and wise he will finally be lucky and peaceful in his rebirth 
When one had merit in his previous life he will be honored among men in the next existence When one brings peace to the world with the Path and serves the Doctrine all will follow him 
The king is the lord of his ministers and people He always loves his subjects with compassion He leads in accord with the precepts of the Doctrine and he exemplifies the Doctrine propitious or otherwise 
Dwelling in safety he does not forget danger As his thinking is clear his merit gradually increases As for merits recompense it does not matter whether one is revered or despised 
The Buddha said to the king At the time of your previous existence O King you were a servant of the great king You faithfully served the Buddha and the Doctrine with purity You served the Sangha with respect your relatives with piety and your lord with loyalty 
It was thus that your merit followed you and you became the kings son complementing the kings splendor 
Now you are honorable but you are on the other hand indolent 
If you are a king you must practice the five things 
What are the five things 
One guiding all people without being condescending or abusive 
Two training the officers and receiving and giving in timely fashion 
Three mindfulness to the development of ones actions while the merits do not cease 
Four trust in the right admonitions of loyal ministers and do not accept slandering words that will harm those in the right 
Five do not allow the mind to be negligent covetous and desirous for affection 
If one practices these five things ones fame will extend to the four seas and prosperity will come naturally 
If one forsakes these five things no principle will work When people are in straits their thinking is confused When officers are weary their authority does not function 
When loyal ministers do not dare to admonish and their thoughts are heedless the land is not managed 
In such conditions you will lose your good name and later you will have no a The Scriptural Text 
Verses of the Doctrine with Parables merit Thereupon the Worldhonored One further spoke the stanzas When one leads a society by practicing what is right and refrains from wrong and one controls his thoughts and overcomes all evil such a one is a righteous king 
When ones perception is proper and one bestows kindness and one is compassionate and likes to benefit others benefiting them with impartiality all feel close to such a one 
When the Buddha had said this the king was very glad He rose and stood in front of the Buddha He fell prostrate in obeisance confessed and apologized to the Buddha He immediately accepted the five precepts 
Once the Buddha was in the land of SravastI in the pure abode of the Jetavana expounding the unsurpassed great Doctrine to gods and men to the king high officials and the four classes of disciples 
In the south of the land of SravastI there were deep mountains A wild elephant often appeared there which had three colors white blue and black 
The king wanted to have a famous great fighting elephant So he dispatched someone to catch it and bring it back to be tamed by an elephant master Within three years the elephant could be mounted and ordered into battle 
At that time there also was a divine elephant brought forth by a dragon Its body was as white as snow and its tail as red as cinnabar The two tusks looked like they were gold colored When the hunter saw this exceptionally fine elephant he returned to inform the king that there was another big elephant of such an appearance and fit to be ridden by a great king 
The king immediately called more than thirty elephant catchers and ordered them to catch this elephant 
They all went to where the elephant was and set a snare to catch it but the divine elephant knew what was on their minds So it immediately came forward as if to fall into their trap When they all came and wanted to catch it the elephant became angry and rashly kicked and jumped at them Those nearby were killed and those further away fled but the elephant did not give up its pursuit 
On the flanks of the mountain there were young men of the Path full of vigor and daring They had been applying themselves to the Path in the mountains for a very long time but they had not yet attained a concentrated mind When one of the men of the Path saw from a distance the elephant chasing after and killing people he felt pity and wanted to rescue them full of confidence and brave 
When the Buddha saw this from afar he was afraid that this monk would be killed by the divine elephant So he went to the elephants side and emitted a great bright light When the elephant saw the Buddhas light its anger ceased and its wrath was dispelled It did not chase and kill people any longer 
When the monk saw the Buddha he drew back and did obeisance to him 
The Buddha then spoke the stanza to the monk Do not recklessly disturb a divine elephant You will only bring suffering and calamities on yourself Evil intentions mean ones death and that one will never reach a wholesome place 
When the monk had heard the stanza he immediately kowtowed confessed and apologized for his wrongdoing He inwardly and deeply rebuked himself and really felt himself to be wrong In front of the Buddha he immediately attained arhatship 
The men who had been catching the elephant came to their senses again Those who had fled returned and they all attained the Path 
Once the Buddha was on Mount Grdhrakuta in Rajagrha 
King Bimbisara then had a high official who had committed an offense He discharged him and moved him to the mountains in the south a thousand li from his country Moreover nobody lived there and the five cereals did not grow 
But when the high official arrived there the spring water flowed in excess and the five cereals grew b The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables in abundance Those who were suffering from hunger or cold in the countries in the four quarters all came to this mountain Within a few years there were three or four thousand families 
The three elders among them and the senior members deliberated among themselves A country without a ruler is like a body without a head They went to where the high official was and installed him as their king 
The high official replied to the elders If you take me as your king it should be in conformity with the rules of a king High officials left and right and both civilian and military leaders high and low should visit my court One should present women to fill my palace 
 The elders of the land said Indeed We accept your commands 
They should be in conformity with the rules of a king So they established him as their king They placed in offices ministers as well as civilian and military leaders high and low They incited the people to construct the city walls and build houses a palace and pavilions But the people were subjected to suffering and they could not take it any more 
They started to think and began to plot against the king villainous ministers and associates took the king out hunting They led the king into a marshy wilderness thirty or forty li from the city with the intention of killing him 
The king asked those around him Why would you want to kill me They replied 
Families are in ruin they plot against the state The king informed them Sirs it is of your own making It is not my doing If you unjustly kill me the spirits will know about this 
Let me have one wish so that I shall have no animosity in dying So he made the wish 
If you nevertheless kill me now I go without any real crime against the people Should I die I wish to become a flesheating devil and enter my old body again 
I shall avenge this grievance Thereupon they strangled him abandoned his corpse and left 
After three days the kings spirit became a flesheating devil and was in his old body again He was called Atavaka He then rose entered the palace and sucked up the new king the ladies of his harem and the villainous ministers around him He killed them all 
The devil left the palace in anger and wanted to kill everyone 
The three elders in the land tied themselves with a straw rope and went to the flesheating devil to surrender voluntarily This was done by villainous ministers The populace could not have known this We implore your leniency 
I have to obtain human flesh as nourishment 
He is wrathful and does not consider what may be grievous The three elders said The land is yours O king Therefore it should be as before but the nourishment you need will be a different matter The elders of the land issued an order that the people should all draw lots to determine the sequence in which the families should provide an infant to serve as live food for the devil king 
Among the three or four thousand families there was just one household whose members were the Buddhas disciples They were zealous in their home and did not violate the five precepts They drew the lots with the rest of the people and obtained the first lot 
They happened to have an infant who would be the first to be fed to the devil king 
They went far away to Mount Grdhrakuta and did obeisance to the Buddha They repented their wrongdoings and rebuked themselves The Buddha saw their suffering with his eye of the Path and he spontaneously declared Because of this infant I shall save countless people He then flew alone to the devils gate 
He manifested his bright form which illuminated the palace 
He immediately went out and saw the Buddha He became malicious and wanted to spring forward and suck up the Buddha but the light pierced his eyes Shouldering a mountain and spitting fire he changed everything to dust Only when he became weary after a long while did he surrender 
The Buddha expounded the scriptural texts to him and after carefully listening to the Doctrine he accepted the five precepts and became an upasaka 
The whole family loudly cried and followed the child Those who looked on were countless grieving for them as the officer carried the child in his arms lifted this food and placed it in front of the devil 
The devil then took this child lifted the food and went in front of the Buddha He knelt deeply and said to the Buddha I am different from the people of the land if I take the child as my food I have now accepted your five precepts O Buddha and I do not have to eat this child any more 
I present him to you O Buddha So the Buddha accepted him expounded the Doctrine and made an incantation 
The Buddha placed the child in his bowl and took him out through the palace gates He returned him to his parents and informed them Raise the infant in good health Do not be sad any longer 
 Of all the people who saw the Buddha there was none who was not startled They wondered what spirit it was 
What merit does this child have that he was rescued him alone 
The devils food was taken away and returned to the parents 
 Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas among the great multitude The quality of the precepts can be depended on Its meritorious reward will always follow He who sees the Doctrine is most respected among men 
He finally keeps himself far from the three evil predestinations When the precepts are heeded one removes any fear Meritorious reward is most revered in the three worlds Demons dragons or a snakes poison cannot harm a person who maintains the precepts 
When the Buddha had spoken the stanzas countless people saw the Buddhas radiant appearance and they knew that he was the most honorable one beyond compare in the three worlds They were all converted and became the Buddhas disciples They were glad on hearing the stanzas and all attained the Path 
Once the Buddha was in the Deer Park in the land of Benares expounding the Doctrine to a countless multitude to gods and men dragons and demons and kings and their subjects 
The crown princes of large kingdoms and their attendants and the eldest sons of the princes of smaller kingdoms more than five hundred people went to where the Buddha was They did obeisance to the Buddha withdrew and sat aside listening to the Doctrine The crown princes then said to the Buddha Your Path  Buddha is fine wondrous and difficult to reach 
Has there from of old ever been a king a crown prince a high official or the son of an elder who has forsaken officialdom love and happiness to become an ascetic The Buddha informed the crown princes 
Happiness and love in the societies of the world are like an illusion a mirage a dream or an echo 
Kings and crown princes because of three things one cannot obtain the Path 
What three 
One one is arrogant and does not have the mindfulness to study the fine meaning of the Buddhas scriptures in order to save ones spirit 
Two one is covetous and not mindful of being charitable to the poor and distressed The wealth accumulated by officials and military officers is not shared with the people so that only their capital increases 
Three one cannot forsake lust and desire for affection and reject the distress of its prisonlike confines in order to become an ascetic extinguishing all hardships and developing ones person 
Therefore whosoever is b The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables born a bodhisattva is regal and removing these three things one attains Buddhahood 
There are three more things 
What three 
One study when young and lead the people to transform while governing the land so that they will practice the ten wholesome  
Two in middle age give away your possessions to the poor and lonely while your officials and military officers are as happy as the people 
If you do not practice the three things you simply will not obtain anything Thereupon the Worldhonored One stated 
Once in a previous world I was a noble universal sovereign called Emperor Nemi ruling with the seven precious things There were palaces and pools lodges and theaters and also officials crown princes their wives and ladies elephants and horses and kitchen servants each eightyfour thousand strong 
Nemi had a thousand sons who were brave and skillful One of them was worth a thousand men He flew through the air and traveled throughout the four seas He was sovereign in his actions and no one was higher than he was 
His lifespan was eightyfour thousand years He governed according to the Doctrine and did not do wrong to his people 
The noble king then thought to himself Mans life is short impermanent and hard to preserve I should just perform acts of merit and thereby seek the truth of the Path 
 So the king ordered his barber If you see that my hairs is white inform me  After a very long period tens of thousands of years the barber informed the king You have a white hair The king ordered him to pull it out and put it on the table 
When the king saw the white hair he wept and decreed The first messenger has suddenly come again Now that my hair is white I must go forth and become an ascetic to seek the natural Path He lifted the hair in his palms and spoke the stanza My hair on top of my body has grown white now and I am depleted 
Thereafter  he governed the world simply as a great king He again ordered his barber If you see that my hairs is white inform me After a very long period the barber again informed him You white hair The king ordered him to pull it out held it in his hands and spoke the stanza 
He became the crown prince of a noble king These three noble kings again became father and son High above they were emperors of the gods down below they were noble lords and in the middle they were crown princes thirtysix times each to end and yet to begin for several thousands of tens of thousands of years When I practiced these three things I realized Buddhahood 
The father in those times is myself now 
The crown prince is the worthy Sariputra 
The kings grandson is the worthy Ananda 
Following one another they were reborn and in this process they became kings in order to transform The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables the world 
Therefore I am especially honored and I am beyond compare in the three worlds When the Buddha said this the king and his crown prince and all the other crown princes were very glad They accepted the Buddhas five precepts became upasakas and attained the path of the streamenterer 
Good Fortune Once the Buddha was on Mount Grdhrakuta in Rajagrha turning the wheel of the Doctrine of the three vehicles for gods and men and for dragons and demons 
Through the actions of a former Buddha the brahmans disciples deserved to obtain the Path They all went together to the bank of the river They arranged their seats and started a discussion by asking themselves As to the actions of the peoples in various societies what can we consider good fortune in the world 
We disciples do not understand They went to their teacher did obeisance and with folded hands said We disciples have been studying for a long time We know well what we have studied but we have not heard what the countries consider to be good fortune The nirgrantha informed them Splendid is your question 
In Jambudvipa there are sixteen great countries and eightyfour thousand small countries Each country has its own good fortune whether it is gold or silver crystal lapis lazuli the divine brightmoon gem elephants or horses chariots beautiful women coral The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables shells line music a phoenix or a peacock the sun the moon the stars a precious vase the four classes  a brahman or a man of the Path These are the signs of good fortune held dear a by the countries 
These are the signs the good fortunes of countries The disciples said Could there rather be another very special good fortune which is beneficial to oneself by which one may finally be reborn in heaven The nirgrantha replied Since the time of former teachers there has never been anything that surpasses these 
No book records anything superior The disciples said Recently we heard that someone of the Sakya clan has gone forth to practice the Path He sat upright for six years subdued Mara  and became a Buddha His three penetrating insights are unhindered 
How about it O great teacher The teacher and his followers more than five hundred disciples went along the mountain roads to where the Buddha was They did obeisance to the Buddha and took their positions as brahmans They folded their hands knelt deeply and said to the Worldhonored One As for the good fortune in every country such are what the people are fond of but we wonder if there is still something else that excels these 
 The Buddha informed the brahmans What you sirs are discussing refers to worldly things By following them you may know good fortune By going against them you may know misfortune 
The doctrine of good fortune as I know it is that if you practice properly you will obtain merit and be forever free from the three worlds 
You will bring about nirvana Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas The Buddha is honored above any god The Tathagata always shows what is meaningful when there is a brahman a man of the Path who comes to ask what is good fortune 
The Buddha feels pity and expounds what is really important Devout happiness is the true Doctrine It is the utmost good fortune 
And if one does not follow god or man in the hope and quest for luck and if one does not pray and sacrifice to the spirits this is the utmost good fortune 
Friendship with a worthy selection of a good companion constant and foremost performance of merits and acceptance of the truth with all ones being this is the utmost good fortune 
If one does away with evil and follows what is wholesome if one avoids liquor knows moderation and does not lust after female beauty this is the utmost good fortune 
If one is learned and practices the precepts if one zealously applies oneself to the rules and if one develops oneself free from any strife this is the utmost good fortune 
If one is pious as a layman and filially serves ones parents if one regulates ones family and cares for wife and child and if ones conduct is not deficient this is the utmost good fortune 
If one is not arrogant or conceited if one knows satisfaction and remembers to be thankful and if one recites the scriptures properly and in a timely fashion this is the utmost good fortune 
If one often patiently accepts what one hears and if one is happy to meet an ascetic and quickly heeds his every exposition this is the utmost good fortune 
If one observes the fast and develops pure conduct if one persists in meeting the wise and stays close to the sages this is the utmost good fortune 
If one practices the qualities of the Path through faith if one corrects ones intentions and directs himself toward the removal of doubt and if one wants to rid b The Scriptural Text Verses of the Doctrine with Parables himself of the three evil predestinations this is the utmost good fortune 
If one practices liberality with an impartial mind if one serves those who have attained the Path and respects gods and men this is the utmost good fortune 
If one always wants to free himself from desire delusion and hatred and if one is able to practice insight into the true Path this is the utmost good fortune 
If one rejects envious efforts and can faithfully apply oneself to the development of the Path and if one constantly resorts to matters that are of concern this is the utmost good fortune 
If everything in the world is established with a great compassionate mind and if this brings about benevolence and peace to all beings this is the utmost good fortune 
When the wise dwell in the world and always practice behavior reflecting good fortune and when they bring about the perfection of their wise insight this is the utmost good fortune 
When the brahmans teacher and disciples heard the Buddhas exposition of the stanzas they were glad and their minds opened up They were very happy came forward and said to the Buddha Very wonderful Worldhonored One 
Extraordinary in the world There is a reason why we were deluded and unable to gain insight yet 
We hope Worldhonored One that you will have compassion and save us We wish personally to take refuge in the Three Honorable Things of the Buddhas Doctrine We need to become ascetics and long to behave as such from now on 
 When the Buddha said Excellent 
Welcome monks they immediately became ascetics 
They internally reflected on anapana and attained arhatship 
The countless listeners all attained the eye of the Doctrine 

The Lord dwelling at Rajagriha on the Vulture Peak together with a great gathering of  beings all of these Arhats  their outflows being dried up undefiled fully controlled quite free in heart well free and wise thoroughbreds great Serpents their work being done their task getting accomplished their burdens laying down their own weal becoming accomplished with fetters which bound these to becoming extinguished hearts quite free by right understanding in perfect control of whole mind with the exception of one single person ie the Venerable Ananda 
Make it clear now Subhuti to Bodhisattvas the great beings starting from perfect wisdom how Bodhisattvas the great beings go forth into perfect wisdom Herein the Venerable Sariputra thinks to himself 
Will this Venerable Subhuti the Elder expound perfect wisdom of himself through the operation and force of ownpower in revealing wisdom or through the Buddha's might 
The Venerable Subhuti knowing through the Buddha's might the Venerable Sariputra to be in such wise discoursing says to the Venerable Sariputra 
Whatsoever Venerable Sariputra the Lord's Disciples teach all this is to be known as Tathagata's work 
In dharma which Tathagatas demonstrate the devoted ones train and realize true nature and hold this in mind 
Herein nothing which these teach contradicts true nature of dharma 
THE EXTINCTION OF SELF Herein the Venerable Subhuti by the Buddha's might said to the Lord 
The Lord says 'Make it clear now Subhuti to Bodhisattvas the great beings starting from perfect wisdom how Bodhisattvas the great beings go forth into perfect wisdom' As one speaks of a 'Bodhisattva' which dharma does this word 'Bodhisattva' denote 
Lord I see neither this dharma 'Bodhisattva' nor any dharma called 'perfect wisdom' 
Since I neither find nor apprehend nor see this dharma 'Bodhisattva' nor any dharma called 'perfect wisdom' what Bodhisattva do I instruct and admonish in what perfect wisdom 
And yet O Lord as this is pointed out a Bodhisattva heart is known as neither cowed nor stolidneither despairing nor despondent as one neither turns away nor is dejected or trembling neither is frightened or terrified it is just this Bodhisattva this great being which comes to be instructed in perfect wisdom 
It is precisely this which is recognized as the perfect wisdom of any Bodhisattva as one's instruction in perfect wisdom 
As a Bodhisattva courses in perfect wisdom and is developing suchthis one so trains oneself as one does not pride oneself on or with any thought of enlightenment  
This thought which is no thought is this something which is 
Is here existing or can one apprehend in this state of absence of thought either a 'here is' or a 'here is not' 
Is this now a suitable question which the Venerable Sariputra asks whether this thought which is no thought is something which is 
So what is this absence of thought 
Well do you expound this Subhuti you whom the Lord declares to be foremost of any who dwell in Peace 
as one does not pride oneself on any thought of enlightenment is a Bodhisattva considered as incapable of turning away from full enlightenment and as one who never ceases from taking perfect wisdom to heart 
Whether one perseveres in training on the level of Disciple or Pratyekabuddha or Bodhisattva  does one listen to this perfection of wisdom take this up bear this in mind recite this study this spread this among others and in this very perfection of wisdom does one train and exert oneself In this very perfection of wisdom does one endowed with skill in means exert oneself concentrating on procuring any and all dharmas which constitute a Bodhisattva 
In just this perfection of wisdom any and all dharmas which constitute a Bodhisattva and in which one trains and exerts oneself are indicated in full detail 
Any being which aspires to train for full enlightenment also listens takes up bears in mind recites studies and spreads this perfection of wisdom Any being which is endowed with skill in means exerts oneself in just this perfection of wisdom with the aim of procuring any and all dharmas which constitute a Buddha Subhuti 
It is truly regrettable as I while unable to find either thing itself merely in words might cause a Bodhisattva to arise and to pass away 
And why 
This is why this is neither continuous nor notcontinuous neither discontinuous nor notdiscontinuous 
A Bodhisattva being as unafraid as this unfathomable and perfect wisdom is indicated can be recognized as not lacking in perfect wisdom and as one in this irreversible stage of Bodhisattva standing firmly in consequence of not taking one's stand anywhere 
So too a Bodhisattva coursing in perfect wisdom and developing as such neither does nor even can stand in form feeling perception impulse and consciousness due to this factas one stands in or is set in view regarding form etc as such one courses only in its formative influence and one can neither gain perfect wisdom exert oneself upon nor fulfill this 
As one does not fulfill perfect wisdom neither can one go forth to allknowledge so long as one remains trying to appropriate the essentially elusive 
In perfect wisdom form feeling perception impulse and consciousness isare not appropriated So the nonappropriation of form etc is not form etc  and perfect wisdom also cannot be appropriated 
This concentrated insight of a Bodhisattva is called 'the nonappropriation of all dharmas' 
It is vast noble unlimited and steady not shared by any of the Disciples or Pratyekabuddhas 
Allknowledge cannot be taken hold of as it cannot be seized through any sign Could allknowledge be seized through a sign Srenika the Wanderer could not gain faith in this our doctrine and tradition 
Srenika the Wanderer believes resolutely in cognition of allknowing and as a faithfollower he enters cognition with a limited scope He does not take hold of these skandhas Nor does he review cognition with joyful zest and pleasure He views this neither as from inside form etc nor as from outside nor as from both inside and outside nor as from other than form etc 
He takes true nature of dharmas as his standard and resolutely believes in signlessness such as he neither takes hold of any dharma nor apprehends any dharma which he even might appropriate or release He does not even care about Nirvana 
This also can be known as a Bodhisattva's perfect wisdom as he does not take hold of form etc and he does not enter Nirvana midway before he realizes ten powers of Tathagatas his four grounds of selfconfidence and the eighteen dharmas peculiar to a Buddha 
Herein too is known as a Bodhisattva's perfection of wisdom 
Further any Bodhisattva coursing in perfection of wisdom and developing this considers and meditates on what perfection of wisdom is on one demonstrating perfect wisdom and on perfect wisdom as dharma which does not exist which cannot be apprehended 
How can a Bodhisattva become known as 'taken hold of by perfect wisdom' as form does not possess the ownbeing of form and as well the other skandhas as perfect wisdom does not possess ownbeing of perfect wisdom and as allknowledge does not possess ownbeing of allknowledge 
It is so Sariputra 
Even so the Bodhisattva training in this goes forth to allknowledge 
As any and all dharmas are unborn and do not go forth 
It is thus any Bodhisattva coursing in perfect wisdom comes nearer allknowledge 
Subhuti speaks further concerning the Bodhisattva 
For one actually courses in the idea 'I am a Bodhisattva' as a basis 
So how does a Bodhisattva course as one coursing in perfect wisdom 
One does not course in skandhas nor in any sign of such skandas nor in ideas such as 'skandhas are signs' nor in production of skandhas nor in any stopping or destruction of such nor in any idea such as 'skandhas are empty' or 'I course' or 'I am a Bodhisattva' 
One courses but one does not entertain such ideas as 'I course' 'I do not course' 'I course and I do not course' 'I neither course nor do I not course' and the same  with 'I will course' One does not go near any dharma at all as all dharma are unapproachable and unappropriatable 
So a Bodhisattva purely cognizes and is as undifferientiated concentrated insight 'Not grasping at any dharma' by name or appearance and regardless whether vast noble unlimited and steady not shared by any of the Disciples or Pratyekabuddhas 
No Sariputra 
The Lord Well said Subhuti 
And thus a Bodhisattva trains herein as one trains in perfect wisdom 
So how do these exist 
As these do not exist so these exist And so since these do not exist  these are called  ignorance  People not diligent and untrained in such have settled down in these 
Depending on this link as a basic fact beings now construct past future and present dharmas 
Thusly constructed are any and all dharmas which yet do not exist and these beings as such neither know nor see any path as it truly is 
As one trains thus is a Bodhisattva trained in allknowledge 
As O Lord someone asks  Does this illusory one train in allknowledge does one come near this does one go forth to it How does one explain it 
Subhuti Well said O Lord 
Do you think Subhuti form feeling perception impulse and consciousness is one thing and illusion another 
Do you think Subhuti this notion 'Bodhisattva' this denomination this concept this conventional expression  is the five grasping skandhas 
A Bodhisattva training oneself in perfect wisdom trains oneself as an illusory person for full enlightenment 
And as this is true of form this is true also of six sense organs and of five grasping aggregates 
Do Bodhisattvas newly set out in this vehicle not tremble hearing this exposition 
Subhuti Who are a Bodhisattva's good friends 
Regarding what the Lord is saying as speaking of 'Bodhisattva' what is meant by this word 'Bodhisattva' 
Nothing real is meant by this word 'Bodhisattva' 
A Bodhisattva trains oneself in nonattachment to any and all dharmas The Bodhisattvas great beings awake in nonattachment to full enlightenment in a sense in which one understands any and all dharmas 
It is clear also to me this understanding through which a Bodhisattva is called 'great being' 
Is this thought which is no thought something which is 
Sohow can Venerable Sariputra ask or even say 'is such thought which is no thought something which is' 
How great is this which entitles one to be called 'armed in great armor' 
The Lord Here the Bodhisattva the great being thinks thus 'countless beings do I lead to Nirvana yet here is neither one leading to Nirvana nor any being led thus' However many beings one may lead to Nirvana yet neither has any being been led to Nirvana nor had any led others to it 
As such is this true nature of dharmas seeing this nature as such is illusory 
Subhuti just as a clever magician or magician's apprentice conjures up at these crossroads a great crowd of people and makes these vanish again 
What do you think Subhuti is anyone killed by anyone or murdered or destroyed or made to vanish 
No indeed Lord 
The Lord Even so a Bodhisattva great being leads countless beings to Nirvana and yet not any being has been led to Nirvana nor has one led others to it 
So it is 
As allknowledge is not made not unmade not affected 
So it is 
For form feeling perception impulse consciousness is neither bound nor freed 
But what now is the form of which you say is neither bound nor freed and what this Suchness of form etc 
The form of any illusory being is neither bound nor freed Suchness of form of an illusory being is neither bound nor freed In reality it is not here at all it is isolated it is unproduced 
This is the great armor the great nonarmor of a Bodhisattva a great being armed as the great armor set out in this great vehicle mounted on the great vehicle 
It is thus O Lord a Bodhisattva great being is armed with great armor and is set out in the great vehicle is mounted on the great vehicle But what is this great vehicle 
Whence does it go forth and whither 
Where does it stand 
Who or what being goes forth by means of this great vehicle 
By means of perfections a Bodhisattva sets out From this triple world one goes forth One sets out to where is no objective support whatsoever Such is a Bodhisattva a great being going forth but not going forth to anywhere 
Nor does one set out in this as one does not stand anywhere yet stands on allknowledge by way of making a stand nowhere 
And finally by means of this great vehicle no one goes forth no one has gone forth no one will go forth 
As neither of these dharmas exist  one going forth and this by which one goes forth  neither can these be got at Since any and all dharmas do not exist what dharma could go forth by what dharma 
Subhuti 
The Lord speaks of the 'great vehicle' Surpassing the world with its Gods beings and Asuras such a vehicle goes forth It is the same as space and exceedingly great 
As in space so in this vehicle is room for immeasurable and incalculable beings 
Such is this great vehicle of the Bodhisattvas these great beings One neither sees its coming nor going and its abiding as such does not exist 
The Lord Well said Subhuti 
So it is 
Have I O Lord spoken of the great vehicle without transgressing against perfect wisdom 
Through the Buddha's might O Lord moreover a Bodhisattva setting out on this journey does not approach the goal of full Bodhisattvahood from any beginning nor any ending nor from any middle either 
Bodhisattvas are as boundless as form feeling perception impulse and consciousness are boundless One does not approach any idea such as 'a Bodhisattva is form' etc This also does not exist and is not apprehended 
Thus in each and every way neither do I get at any of the dharmas which constitute a Bodhisattva nor do I see any dharma which the word 'Bodhisattva' denotes 
Perfect wisdom also is neither seen nor got at 
As in each and every way these dharmas are neither seen nor apprehended what dharma does one instruct and admonish through what dharma in what dharma 
It is as with any self or notion hereof Although we speak of a 'self' yet absolutely any self is some 'thing' uncreated Since herein all dharmas are without ownbeing what is form etc which cannot be seized and which is something uncreated 
Thus any fact such as all dharmas are without ownbeing is the same as any fact that these are uncreated Yet noncreation of any and all dharmas differs from these dharmas 
And yet one cannot apprehend as other than uncreated all dharmas regardless whether these are thought of as constituting a Buddha or a Bodhisattva or one marching to enlightenment 
If any Bodhisattva as this is being taught is not afraid one can know 'this Bodhisattva this great being courses in perfect wisdom develops investigates and meditates on and as such' At such a time as a Bodhisattva investigates these dharmas in perfect wisdom at such a time one does not approach form and other skandhas nor go to any of these 
For nonproduction of form etc is not form etc 
Any nonpassingaway of form etc is not form etc Nonproduction and form are herein neither two nor divided Inasmuch as one calls any thing 'form' etc one makes a count of what is not two 
Thus Bodhisattvas investigate in perfect wisdom any and all dharmas in any and all modes as such may merely indicate yet one does not at any time approach form feeling perception impulse or consciousness 
Sariputra As I understand the teaching of the Venerable Subhuti a Bodhisattva also is nonproduced 
Yet as a Bodhisattva is nonproduced how does one go on this difficult pilgrimage and how can one possibly endure any experience of sufferings which one is said to undergo for the sake of beings 
I do not look for a Bodhisattva going on any difficult pilgrimage 
One generating a perception of difficulties is unable to work the weal of countless beings 
On the contrary one forms the notion of ease one forms this notion of all beings whether men or women are one's parents and children and thus one goes on pilgrimage of a Bodhisattva 
As I myself aspire to be quite free from all sufferings just so all beings aspire to be quite free from all sufferings In addition regarding all beings one forms the notion 
I do not desert all these beings I aspire to set these free from any measureless heap of sufferings And I do not produce towards any a thought of hate even though I might be dismembered a hundred times It is thus a Bodhisattva lifts up one's heart As one dwells as one whose heart is this way one neither courses nor dwells as one perceiving difficulties 
And further a Bodhisattva produces the thought as in each and every way a self does not exist and so not got at so in each and every way all dharmas do not exist and are not got at Such a one applies this notion to all dharmas inside and outside 
But as the Venerable Sariputra said nonproduced is the Bodhisattvaindeed it is so nonproduced is any Bodhisattva Sariputra 
Further is just such a Bodhisattva nonproduced or dharmas also which constitute one 
Are only dharmas which constitute a Bodhisattva nonproduced or also any state of allknowledge 
Is just the state of allknowledge nonproduced or also any and all dharmas which constitute it 
Are just dharmas which constitute allknowledge nonproduced or also any common people 
Are just any common people nonproduced or also dharmas which constitute these 
If Venerable Subhuti the Bodhisattva is nonproduced and also dharmas which constitute one as such and also the state of allknowledge and also dharmas which constitute this and also any common people and also dharmas which constitute these  surely the state of allknowledge is reached by a Bodhisattva without any exertion 
I do not wish for any attainment of any unproduced dharma nor reunion with one 
So is unproduced attainment got at through unproduced dharma or through produced dharma 
Is production a dharma which is a nonproduction or is nonproduction dharma which is production 
To talk of production as nonproductiondharma is not intelligible 
Nonproduction is just talk 
In the first rank of preachers of dharma should the Venerable Subhuti be placed 
This is the Lord's Absolutethe essence of Disciples without any support so in whatever way these are questioned these find a way out do not contradict true nature of dharmas nor depart from such 
Sariputra Well said Subhuti And what is this perfection of the Bodhisattvas which allows these to not lean on any dharmas 
As any Bodhisattva remains unafraid as this deep perfection of wisdom is being taught one can know such a one is adjusted to perfection of wisdom and one is not lacking in this attention to true facts about dharmas 
How is it a Bodhisattva does not lack in attention being adjusted to perfect wisdom 
For if a Bodhisattva is not lacking in attention one automatically lacks in adjustment to perfection of wisdom 
And if one does not lack in adjustment to perfection of wisdom one is lacking in attention 
But if in a Bodhisattva the two facts that one is not lacking in attention and one is not lacking in dwelling in perfection of wisdom belong together then all beings also will not be lacking in dwelling in perfection of wisdom because these also dwell not lacking in attention 
One knows attention is without ownbeing in the same way in which beings are without ownbeing attention has no real existence in the same way in which beings have no real existence attention is isolated in the same way in which beings are isolated attention is unthinkable in the same way in which beings are unthinkable acts of mental attention do not undergo any process which leads to enlightenment in the same way in which beings do not undergo any process acts of attention do not in any real sense undergo any process which leads to enlightenment any more than beings do 
PREAMBLE At this time many Gods are coming to the assembly and taking their seats Sakra Chief of Gods with forty thousand Gods of the Thirtythree the four worldguardians with twenty thousand Gods belonging to the retinue of the four Great Kings Brahma ruler of this world system with ten thousand Gods belonging to the company of Brahma and five thousand Gods of the Pure Abode 
And yetthe might of the Buddha with his majesty and authority surpasses even the splendor of these Gods a reward for the deeds these have done here even in this past 
These many thousands of Gods Subhuti have come to this assembly and taken seats as we want to hear about perfect wisdom from the Holy Subhuti and to listen to his advice to the Bodhisattvas to his instruction and admonition how these Bodhisattvas stand in perfect wisdom how train in it how one devotes oneself to it 
The Gods not yet aspiring to full enlightenment should do so 
Any however being certain to have got safely out of this world  are unfit for full enlightenment as these are not willing to go from compassion back into birthanddeath 
And why 
The Lord Well said Subhuti 
You well encourage Bodhisattvas 
Subhuti now says to the Lord 
For the Lord in presence of Tathagatas leads for our sake the holy life with enlightenment as his view 
Even as he definitely develops Bodhisattva realization  disciples still instruct and admonish him in these perfections and by his coursing herein is revealing utmost cognition to and for beneficence of unlimited beings 
Listen now Kausika and attend well as I teach you how a Bodhisattva stands in perfect wisdom 
Through standing in emptiness one stands in perfection of wisdom 
not on form feeling perception impulses consciousness not on eye ear nose tongue body mind not on forms sounds smells tastes touchables mindobjects not on eyeconsciousness etc until we come to not on mindconsciouness etc until we come to not on the elements ie earth water fire wind ether consciousness not on the pillars of mindfulness right efforts roads to psychic power faculties powers limbs of enlightenment limbs of the Path not on the fruits of Streamwinner OnceReturner NeverReturner or Arhatship not on Pratyekabuddhahood nor on Buddhahood 
One does no t take one's stand on any ideas like 'form feeling perception impulse or consciousness is permanent or impermanent' 'form etc is ease or ill' 'form etc is self or not self' 'form etc is lovely or repulsive' or even that 'form etc is empty or apprehended as something' 
One does not take one's stand on any notion such as the fruits of the holy life derive their dignity from something called 'Unconditioned' 
Or a NeverReturner is worthy of gifts and without once more returning to this world realizes Nirvana elsewhere 
Or an Arhat is worthy of gifts and just here in this very existence will win Nirvana in the realm of Nirvana leaving nothing behind 
Or a Pratyekabuddha is worthy of gifts and will win Nirvana after rising above the level of a Disciple but without having attained any level of a Buddha 
Or even a Buddha is worthy of gifts and will win Nirvana in the BuddhaNirvana in the realm of Nirvana leaving nothing behind once one rises above the levels of a common being of a Disciple and of a Pratyekabuddha wroughts the weal of countless beings leads to Nirvana countless hundreds of thousands of niyutas of kotis of beings assures countless beings of Discipleship Pratyekabuddhahood and full Buddhahood is standing  on the stage of a Buddha and does a Buddha's work even now on this a Bodhisattva does not take one's stand 
If even here upon this one does not take one's stand how does one stand and train oneself 
The Venerable Subhuti through the Buddha's might read his thoughts and said What do you think Sariputra where does Tathagata stand 
Even so a Bodhisattva stands and trains oneself 
One decides this as the Tathagata does not stand anywhere nor not stand nor stand apart nor not stand apart so also I stand Just so one trains oneself as Tathagata is stationed so also I stand and train myself Just so one trains oneself as the Tathagata is stationed so do I stand well in place as without a place to stand upon Even so Sariputra a Bodhisattva stands and trains oneself 
What could one wish any beings to be like who are worthy to listen to the doctrine from the Holy Subhuti Subhuti read these thoughts and said 
Beings like a magical illusion are these not in truth just an illusion 
Like a magical illusion are these beings like a dream 
For not two different things are magical illusion and beings are dreams and beings 
Any and all objective facts also are like a magical illusion like a dream 
A fully enlightened Buddha also you say is like a magical illusion is like a dream 
Subhuti Even Nirvana I say is like a magical illusion is like a dream How much more so anything else 
Even Nirvana Holy Subhuti you say is like an illusion is like a dream 
If perchance here could be anything even more distinguished of such too I say is like an illusion like a dream 
Hereupon the Venerable Sariputra the Venerable Purna son of Maitrayani the Venerable Mahakoshthila the Venerable Mahakatyayana the Venerable Mahakashyapa and the other Great Disciples together with many thousands of Bodhisattvas said Who Subhuti are these grasping this perfect wisdom as here explained Hereupon the Venerable Ananda said to these Elders Bodhisattvas incapable of falling back grasp this or beings persons reaching sound views or Arhats in whom the outflows are realized as dried up Subhuti No one grasps this perfect wisdom as here explained ie 
Sakra conjured up flowers and scattered them over the Venerable Subhuti 
As you say Kausika 'these flowers do not issue forth at all neither from mind nor from trees shrubs or creepers' for this which never issues forth is not a flower Note to interpolation 
So it is 
The Bodhisattva so trains oneself  as Holy Subhuti points out Subhuti 
As one thus trains one does not train to achieve any results of a Streamwinner nor in any other fruits of the holy life even up to Buddhahood 
For as one trains oneself on any of these stages one trains oneself in or as buddhanature or toward pure and undifferientiated cognition of allknowledge and so in the immeasurable and incalculable Buddhadharmas 
So in this one trains oneself neither for the increase of form feeling perception impulse or consciousness nor yet for their decrease  neither to appropriate form etc nor to let them go 
As one thus trains a Bodhisattva trains in allknowledge and dedicated thusly goes forth to allknowledge 
Sakra now says to Sariputra 
In the exposition of the Venerable Subhuti 
And as you ask How or where does a Bodhisattva search for perfect wisdom' the answer is 
One should not search for such in form nor in any other skandhas nor in any thing which is other than form or other than any other skandhas 
Subhuti 
And why 
Perfect wisdom is great unlimited measureless and infinite because form feelings etc are so 
Hence one does not settle down in any such conviction that this is a great perfection' and unlimited perfection' a measureless perfection' or infinite perfection' This is how and why perfect wisdom is a great perfection unlimited measureless and infinite 
For one cannot apprehend the beginning middle and end of form or any such skandhas 
In such a way as this perfect wisdom is infinite perfection by reason of this infinitude of objects 
And further still any being is endless and boundless as one cannot get at any beginning middle or end 
How is it Holy Subhuti this perfect wisdom is an infinite perfection by reason of this infinitude of beings 
Well Kausika what factual entity does the word being' denote 
Is herein  any being showing up  
No indeed Holy Subhuti 
So as no being whatsoever is showing up how is herein an infinitude of these beings 
For if any Tathagata with a voice of infinite range with this deep thunder of a voice pronounces for aeons countless as the sands of the Ganges this word being' being' C would this Tathagata hereby produce or stop any being whatsoever either in this past future or present 
No indeed Holy Subhuti 
CONFIRMATION Hereupon these Gods around Indra Brahma and Prajapati and these hosts of men and women around Rishis as well thrice shouted forth in triumph 
So do I as I met a Tathagata Dipankara in the bazaar of Dipavati the royal city possess the fullness of this perfection of wisdom so Dipankara a Tathagata predicted one day I am to be fully enlightened and said to me 
WORLDLY ADVANTAGES OF PERFECT WISDOM The Lord sees these Gods assembled and seated and the monks nuns laymen and laywomen assembled and seated and he speaks thus to these Gods 
The Four Great Kings 
Sakra Brahma and other Gods likewise promise to protect any follower of perfect wisdom 
It is wonderful O Lord by taking up etc this perfection of wisdom one gains many advantages even here and now 
Does one taking up perfection of wisdom take up all the six perfections 
The Lord 
And further by taking up etc perfection of wisdom one gains advantages even here and now 
The quarrels contentions and contradictions of any opposing this dharma simply vanish away the intentions of opponents remains unfulfilled 
This is one advantage even here and now Here we have an herb Maghi by name which is a cure for all poison 
Suppose a viper famished is to see a creature and pursue it following the scent in order to eat it but now this creature goes to a patch of Maghi and stands here we know the smell of the herb causes the snake to turn back 
And why 
It is perfect wisdom which appeases all evil  from  greed to seizing on Nirvana   and does not increase it 
And these Gods and all these Buddhas and all these Bodhisattvas protect this follower of perfect wisdom 
Wrath and conceit does not increase Neither enmity nor ill will take hold of one such as this not even a tendency towards these 
One turns mindful and friendly 
It is wonderful how this perfection of wisdom is set up for the control and training of the Bodhisattvas 
The Lord 
As a great lore is this perfection of wisdom a lore without measure a quite measureless lore an unsurpassed lore a lore which equals the unequalled is this perfection of wisdom 
As one trains oneself in this lore one is intent neither on disturbing one's own peace nor others 
The Bodhisattva the great being training in this lore uncovers and reveals full enlightenment gains the gnosis of allknowing 
Further as here or wherever this perfection of wisdom is written down in a book and is put up and worshipped where it is taken up borne in mind etc any beings so engaged can come to no harm except as inclined toward such for past deeds 
Just the same too Kausika humans and ghosts go to the terrace of enlightenment or to its neighborhood or its interior or to the foot of the tree of enlightenment and cannot be hurt by humans or ghosts or be injured by these or taken possession of even with the help of evil animal beings except for in compensation for former deeds 
In this these past future and present Tathagatas come to uncover and reveal their enlightenment and in this promoting and revealing to these beings fearlessness lack of hostility lack of fright 
Just so Kausika any place in which one takes up bears in mind etc perfection of wisdom in it beings cannot be hurt by beings 
Perfection of wisdom makes any spot of earth wherever it is into a true shrine for beings  worthy of being worshipped and adored  into a shelter for beings coming to it a refuge a place to rest and final relief 
One of these two a son or daughter of good family has written down this perfection of wisdom made a copy of it this one now puts it up and honors reveres worships and adores this with heavenly flowers incense perfumes wreaths unguents aromatic powders strips of cloth parasols banners bells flags with rows of lamps all round and with manifold kinds of worship 
The other deposits in Stupas relics of the Tathagata having gone to Parinirvana this one takes hold of these and preserves these honors worships and adores these with heavenly flowers incense etc as the other does 
I question you on this point and you may answer to the best of your ability 
The Tathagata as acquiring and knowing full enlightenment or allknowledge in which practice does the Tathagata train in order for such an allknowledgepersonality to have been revealed 
So the Tathagata does not derive any name from the fact one acquires this physical personality but from the fact one acquires allknowledge 
And this allknowledge of Tathagatas comes forth as a result of taking up just this perfection of wisdom The physical personality of Tathagatas on the other hand is the result of the skill in means of perfection of wisdom And this very sameness is a sure foundation for  cognition of allknowing by others Supported by this foundation the revelation of cognition of allknowing takes place the revelation of Buddhabody of Dharmabody and of Sanghabody 
Acquisition of the physical personality is thus the cause of cognition of allknowing 
Once thus gone to Parinirvana my relics also are worshipped 
The son or daughter of good family having made a copy of the perfection of wisdom and worshipping it begets different merit 
For by worshipping the perfection of wisdom one worships cognition of allknowing 
How can it bepeople of Jambudvipa who do not copy this perfection of wisdom nor take it up nor study it nor worship it do not know the Lord is teaching such as the cultivation of the perfection of wisdom is greatly profitable 
The Lord 
What do you think Kausika how many of the people of Jambudvipa are endowed with perfect faith in the Buddha the Dharma the Sangha 
So it is Kausika 
Only a few people of Jambudvipa are endowed with perfect faith in the Buddha the Dharma and the Sangha Fewer than these few are ones attaining the fruits of a Streamwinner and after this the fruit of a OnceReturner or of a NeverReturner Fewer still are any attaining Arhatship Fewer still realize Pratyekabuddhaenlightenment 
Fewer still are any who raising these thoughts thusly to full enlightenment and strengthening such thoughts now in addition dwell with vigor exerted 
Fewer still are any who coursing and striving toward perfection of wisdom abide on any irreversible Bodhisattvastage Fewer still coursing and striving steadily in perfection of wisdom are any who come to know full enlightenment Fewer still coursing and striving in perfection of wisdom do actually know full enlightenment 
Now as to any Bodhisattvas standing on any irreversible Bodhisattvastage knowing and revealing full enlightenment these expound perfection of wisdom to other sons and daughters of good family who are earnestly intent who train themselves and strive in perfection of wisdom And these in their turn take up perfection of wisdom study and worship it 
Here are on the other hand countless beings who raise thoughts to enlightenment who strengthened such thoughts of enlightenment which course towards enlightenment  and perhaps just one or two of these can abide on any irreversible Bodhisattvastage 
For full enlightenment is difficult to reveal and indeed is hard to come up to if one has inferior vigor is slothful or displays characteristics defined as an inferior being allows inferior thoughts notions intentions and wisdom 
So if someone wants quickly to know full enlightenment one indefatigably and continually hears and studys this very perfection of wisdom 
One comes to understand thisas Bodhisattvas Tathagatas train in perfection of wisdom also oneself need train in such for she is Tathagatas Teacher 
In any case upon any Tathagata's disappearance into final Nirvana Bodhisattvas run back to this very perfection of wisdom 
Here and now Kausika if someone builds for the worship of the Tathagata once having disappeared into final Nirvana many kotis of Stupas made of the seven precious things enshrining herein such relics of Tathagatas and all one's life honor these with flowers etc does this one on the strength of such actions beget a great deal of merit 
Indeed such a one does O Lord 
Vastly different is any merit of someone truly believing in this perfection of wisdom who trustingly confiding in this resolutely intent on this serene in one's faith with one's thoughts raised to enlightenment in earnest intenthears this learns this bears this in mind recites and studies this spreads demonstrates explains expounds and repeats this illuminates this in detail to others uncovers this meaning investigates this with one's mind and who using wisdom to one's fullest extent thoroughly examines this who copies this and preserves and stores away the copy so this good dharma lasts long so this guide of the Buddhas might not be annihilated so the good dharma might not disappear so the Bodhisattvas great beings might continue being assisted since this guide does not give out  and who finally honors and worships this perfection of wisdomwell Kausika vastly different is any merit of any devotee of perfection of wisdom compared not only with a person building many kotis of Stupas made of seven precious things enshrining the relics of Tathagatasit is even more vastly different than any merit of one completely filling the entire Jambudvipa with such Stupas 
It is vastly different than any merit produced by all beings in a fourcontinent world system even as each single one of these built such a Stupa 
Or equally as all beings in a small chiliocosm or in a medium dichiliocosm or in a great trichiliocosm were to do likewise 
Or if to put an imaginary case forthall beings in any great trichiliocosm simultaneously became human beings and each one of these built such a Stupa and if each one of these having built all such Stupas and honoring such for an aeon or the remainder of an aeon still any devotee of perfection of wisdom has vastly different merit than any kind or amount of merit resulting from the effect of the meritorious deeds of all such beings as were to erect and worship those countless Stupas 
So it is O Lord 
For any person honoring perfection of wisdomin an absolute sensesuch a one honors any and all past future and present Buddhas in all world systems which can all be simultaneously comprehended by only the cognition of a single Buddha 
Such a one's merit is different than any kind or amount of merit of all beings in great trichiliocosms countless like the sands of the Ganges even if each single being in these built a Stupa and if each one of these having built all such Stupas and were to honor these for an aeon or the remainder of an aeon 
So it is Kausika 
The merit of any devotee of perfection of wisdom is entirely different such is immeasurable incalculable inconceivable incomparable illimitable 
From perfection of wisdom allknowledge of Tathagatas comes forth from allknowledge has come forth the cult of the relics of Tathagata 
Kausika do take up perfection of wisdom recite study and explain it 
The Lord 
So it is Kausika 
perfection of wisdom Buddhas of any and all times come to reveal and know full enlightenment 
Thanks to just this lore ten wholesome ways of acting are revealed in the world the four trances associated with the limbs of enlightenment the four Unlimited associated with the limbs of enlightenment the four formless attainments upheld by the limbs of enlightenment the six superknowledges associated with the limbs of enlightenment in short the eightyfour thousand articles of dharma cognition of Buddha cognition of selfexistent inconceivable cognition 
However as at times it seems no Tathagatas are in the worldit is Bodhisattvas endowed with skill in means as a result of hearing the outpouring of perfection of wisdom in any past  full of pity for beings come into this world out of pity who foster in the world the ten wholesome ways of acting the four trances as dissociated from the limbs of enlightenment etc 
Just as thanks to the disk of the moon all the herbs stars and constellations are illuminated according to their power and strength so as Tathagata seem to pass beyond and this good dharma seems to have disappeared in any seeming absence of Tathagatas whatever righteous upright outstanding or wholesome life is conceived and manifested in worlds all coming forth from the Bodhisattva is brought forth by one is spread from one's skill in means 
But skill in means of Bodhisattvas is known as coming forth from perfection of wisdom 
Which are these advantages 
These devotees do not die any untimely death nor from poison or sword or fire or water or staff or violence 
As these bring to mind repeat and apply this perfection of wisdom the calamities which threaten these from kings and princes from king's counselors and king's ministers do not take place As kings etc may try to do harm to these who again and again bring to mind repeat and apply perfection of wisdom such kings etc do not succeed for perfection of wisdom upholds such devotees 
For this perfection of wisdom entails an attitude of friendliness and compassion amongst and within all beings 
Hereupon one hundred Wanderers of other sects approached the Lord with hostile intent 
Sakra Chief of Gods perceived these Wanderers from afar and he reflected 
Surely these Wanderers of other sects are approaching the Lord with hostile intent 
Hereupon Sakra Chief of Gods recalls as much of this perfection of wisdom as he is learning from the Lord brings it to mind repeats applies and spreads it 
The Wanderers of other sects hereupon reverently saluted the Lord from afar and went off on their way 
So now it occurred to the Venerable Sariputra For what reason do these heretical Wanderers reverently salute the Lord from afar and now depart on their way 
As Sakra Chief of Gods perceived the thoughts of such hostile Wanderers of other sects he recalled this perfection of wisdom brought it to mind repeated applied and spread it with the object of turning back the Wanderers of other sects who wanted to quarrel dispute and obstruct and prevented these from approaching this place the perfection of wisdom is being taught 
 Herein Mara conjured up a fourfold army and is moving towards the place the Lord is 
Now again it occurs to Sakra chief of gods Surely I can see this is Mara the Evil One who has conjured up a fourfold army moving towards the place the Lord is 
But the array of this army is not the array of King Bimbisara's army nor of King Prasenajit's army not of the army of the Sakyas or of the Licchavins 
Hereupon Sakra recalls just this perfection of wisdom brought it to mind repeated applied and spread it 
Immediately Mara the Evil One is seen as turning back again and going on his way 
The Gods of the Thirtythree conjured up heavenly Mandarava flowers flew through the air and scattered these over the Lord 
It is seen how Mara and his host have no chance to enter any beings who preach and develop this perfection of wisdom or which course in it 
Any beings hearing and studying perfection of wisdom are endowed with no small wholesome root These who come to hear of this perfection of wisdom fulfill duties also under the Jinas of other times How much more so any studying and repeating it who are trained in Thusness progress to such and make endeavours regarding such these are people honoring Tathagatas 
For it is in this perfection of wisdom one searches for allknowledge 
Just as all jewels are brought forth by a great ocean and are searched for through it just so the great jewel of allknowledge of Tathagatas is searched for through the great ocean of perfection of wisdom The Lord 
PERFECT WISDOM AND THE OTHER PERFECTIONS Ananda The Lord does not praise perfection of giving nor any of the first five perfections he does not proclaim their name Only perfection of wisdom does the Lord praise its name alone he proclaims 
So it is Ananda 
For perfection of wisdom controls the five perfections 
Ananda 
No Lord 
The same is true of the other perfections 
What do you think Ananda is wisdom inconceivable which turns over the wholesome roots by the dedication of these to allknowledge 
Yes it is inconceivable completely inconceivable 
Perfection of wisdom is given it's name by us from supreme excellence  
Through perfection of wisdom these wholesome roots dedicated to allknowledge are given the name of 'perfections' It is due to this dedication of wholesome roots to allknowledge this perfection of wisdom controls guides and leads the five perfections 
The five perfections are in this manner contained in this perfection of wisdom and the term 'perfection of wisdom' is just a synonym for the fulfilling of all six perfections 
In consequence as perfection of wisdom is proclaimed all six perfections are proclaimed 
So far the Tathagata has not proclaimed all the qualities of perfection of wisdom qualities which one acquires by learning studying and repeating perfection of wisdom 
So it is Kausika 
Sakra 
The Lord Well said Kausika 
Moreover as anyone repeats this perfection of wisdom many hundreds of Gods come near many thousands many hundreds of thousands of Gods so as to listen to Dharma 
Even when one may not be willing to talk these Gods still expect through their respect for Dharma a readiness to speak is induced in such a one as this and this one now feels an urge to expound this 
This again is another quality which someone acquires just here and now by learning studying and repeating perfection of wisdom 
Moreover the minds of any discoursing on this perfection of wisdom remain uncowed in front of these four assemblies These have no fear of being plied with questions from hostile persons 
For perfection of wisdom protects these ones 
Immersed in perfection of wisdom one does not see the hostility nor any who act with hostility nor any who want to be hostile 
In this way upheld by perfection of wisdom one remains unaffected by censure and fear 
These qualities also someone acquires just here and now while learning studying and repeating this perfection of wisdom 
In addition one is dear to one's mother and father to friends relatives and kinsmen to Shramanas and Brahmanas 
One is competent and capable of refuting in accordance with Dharma any counterarguments which may arise and is able to deal with counterquestions 
These qualities also someone acquires just here and now while learning studying and repeating perfection of wisdom 
Moreover Kausika among the Gods of the Four Great Kings any Gods setting out for full enlightenment make up their minds to come to this place here as someone puts up a copy of perfection of wisdom and is reverent toward and concentrated in this These come look upon the copy of this perfection of wisdom salute this respectfully pay homage to this learn study and repeat this 
So also do these depart again And this applies to all Gods up to even the Highest of Gods 
And any son or daughter of good family pray the Gods Nagas Yakshas Gandharvas Asuras Garudas Kinnaras Mahoragas beings and ghosts in any ten directions in countless world systems do with the help of this book see perfection of wisdom salute respectfully pay homage learn study and repeat such as it is as also these return to their respective worlds and these ones also give to any ones abiding in these places as well just this gift of dharma 
Do not however think Kausika only in this four continent world the Gods of the realm of sensedesire and of the realm of form who set out for full enlightenment decide to come to this place 
Not so as well Kausika do you view it 
No all the Gods in the great trichiliocosm setting out for full enlightenment decide to come to this place These come look upon a copy of this perfection of wisdom salute it respectfully pay homage to it learn study and repeat it 
For very powerful Gods and even other supernatural beings decide to come to this place 
How does one know these Gods or even other supernatural beings have come to this place to hear etc perfection of wisdom 
As one perceives anywhere a sublime radiance or smells a superhuman odor not smelled before now one can know for certain a God or other supernatural being is present is come near 
Further clean and pure habits attract such Gods etc and makes them enraptured overjoyed full of zest and gladness But divinities of minor power having before occupied such a place as these come to manifest decide to leave it 
For these cannot endure the splendor majesty and dignity of such very powerful Gods etc 
As these very powerful Gods etc decide to come to such a one repeatedly any such devotee of perfection of wisdom gains an abundance of serene faith 
This is another quality which any son or daughter of a good family acquires just here and now 
And many Bodhisattvas one beholds chanting just this perfection of wisdom delighted by its chorus which proclaims how allknowledge is gained how the Buddhafield is purified 
In this direction in this part of the world in this world system under this name the Tathagatas demonstrate Dharma surrounded and accompanied by many thousands of Bodhisattvas and Disciples nay by many hundreds of thousands of niyutas of kotis of Bodhisattvas and Disciples As one beholds such dreams one sleeps at ease one awakens at ease 
No trend of thought arises in this one from excessive eagerness of food 
A devotee of perfection of wisdom has no strong desire for food and only a mild interest in it even as a monk who practices Yoga and who emerged from trance merely as one's thoughts overflow with other interests 
For to the extent one gives oneself up to devotion to development of perfection of wisdom to such extent do heavenly beings provide one with heavenly food 
But again Kausika as someone makes a copy of perfection of wisdom and is reverent towards and concentrated in it but does not learn study repeat and apply this and as someone else truly believes in the perfection of wisdom trustingly confides in it and resolutely intent on it serene in one's faith one's thoughts raised toward enlightenment in earnest intent hears learns bears in mind recites and studies such as this perfection of wisdom provides for spreads demonstrates explains expounds and repeats such as this is illuminates it in detail for others uncovers meaning investigates with one's mind and using one's wisdom to the fullest thoroughly examines copies and preserves and stores away the copy so such good dharma lasts long so this guide of Tathagatas might not be annihilated so good dharma does not disappear so Bodhisattvas these great beings continue to be assisted since their guide does not fail  and finally honors and is reverent toward and concentrated in this perfection of wisdom well Kausika this latter begets vastly different merit 
Any aspiring to acquire these distinguished qualities here and now will diligently imitate such a one as this and these truly believe in perfection of wisdom etc as their guide does not fail 
If Kausika on this one hand you are given this Jambudvipa filled up to the top with relics of the Tathagatas and if on this other hand you could share in a written copy of this perfection of wisdom and if now you have to choose between the two which one do you take Just this perfection of wisdom Lord 
For I see such as within my esteem for this Guide of Tathagatas in true understanding this also is the body of Tathagatas 
by perfection of wisdom 
As come forth from perfection of wisdom are these relics of Tathagatas revered and herein as one reveres just this perfection of wisdom now also the reverence of these relics of the Tathagata is brought to fulfillment as the relics of Tathagata come forth from perfection of wisdom 
It is as with my own godly seat in Sudharma the hall of Gods As I am seated on it the Gods come to wait on me 
But as I am not the Gods out of respect for me pay their respect to this seat circumambulate it and go away again 
For these recall as seated on this seat Sakra the Chief of Gods demonstrates Dharma to Gods of the Thirtythree 
The relics of Tathagatas on this other hand are true deposits of allknowledge but these are neither true conditions nor reasons for production of such cognition 
As the cause of cognition of allknowingness perfection of wisdom is also revered and concentrated upon through relics of Tathagata 
For this reason of the two lots now mentioned I choose just this perfection of wisdom 
But it is not because I lack in respect for the relics of Tathagata Even choosing thusly I have real respect for these for these relics are worshipped as these are pervaded by this perfection of wisdom 
And if I had to choose between a copy of perfection of wisdom on this one side and even a great trichiliocosm filled to the top with relics of the Tathagata on this other I still choose just this perfection of wisdom for the same reasons 
For the relics of Tathagata are true deposits of cognition of allknowingness but such cognition itself is come forth from perfection of wisdom 
So just here of these two lots I choose just this perfection of wisdom 
SIMILE OF THE WISHING JEWEL It is like a priceless jewel with the property of preventing beings and ghosts from entering the place it is put 
If someone oppressed by the wind applies this jewel as one's body is inflated one holds back that wind and prevents it from getting worse appeasing it 
It has similar effects applied to a body burning with bile choked with phlegm or painful as a result of a disease arising from a disorder of the humors 
It illuminates the blackest darkness of night 
In the heat it cools the spot of earth it is placed 
In the cold it warms it 
Its presence drives vipers and other noxious animals from districts which are infested with these 
If any woman or man is bitten by a viper one need only show these this jewel and its sight counteracts that poison and makes it depart 
Such are the qualities of this jewel If one has a boil in the eye or clouded eyesight or a disease in the eye or a cataract one need only place this jewel on the eyes and its mere presence removes and appeases these afflictions Such are its qualities 
Placed in water it dyes the water all through with its own color 
Equally as wrapped or bound in a blackblue or yellow or red or crimson cloth or into cloth of any other color it dyes the water into which it is thrown the color of the cloth 
It also clears up any turbidity which may have arisen in the water 
Do these jewels Kausika belong to the world of the Gods or to the people of Jambudvipa 
As such these are infinitely inferior to these heavenly jewels But the ones among the Gods are fine and full of all possible qualities As this jewel is now put in a basket or even placed upon it this basket still is desirable after the jewel had again been taken out 
In the same way O Lord the qualities of cognition of allknowing are derived from just this perfection of wisdom 
On this account the relics of Tathagatas thus gone to Parinirvana are reverently concentrated upon For these are true repositories of the cognition of allknowingness 
And as any demonstration of Dharma by Buddhas and Lords in all world systems is venerated and held in reverence as it comes forth from perfection of wisdom so also the Dharmadiscourser's demonstration of Dharma 
As a king is revered as his royal might gives courage to a great body of people so also the speaker of Dharma because through this might of this Dharmabody one such as this gives courage to a great body of people 
But the relics of Tathagatas are revered for this same reason one reveres demonstrations of Dharma and expositors of Dharma 
SUPREME VALUE OF THE PERFECTION OF WISDOM So now O Lord as here are two lots and as not only this great trichiliocosm but as all world systems countless as the sands of the Ganges filled with relics of Tathagatas is established as this first lot and a copy of perfection of wisdom as this second lot and I am invited to choose either and to take such I take just this perfection of wisdom 
My respect for these is a real one But it is perfection of wisdom pervading allknowledge such as these relics of Tathagatas are revered as these come forth from allknowledge 
In consequence any reverence for and concentration upon perfection of wisdom is in effect a worship of Buddhas these Lords past future and present 
Moreover O Lord anyone who aspires to see in accordance with Dharma the Buddha these Lords who just now exist in immeasurable and incalculable world systems needs course now in perfection of wisdom make endeavours in and develop such as this is 
The Lord 
All Tathagatas owe their enlightenment to just this perfection of wisdom  whether these live in this past future or present 
Does a Bodhisattva course only in the perfection of wisdom and not in the other perfections 
One such as this courses in all these six perfections 
But it is just this perfection of wisdom which controls the Bodhisattva as one gives a gift or guards morality or perfects oneself in patience or exerts vigour or enters into meditative trance or has insight into Dharmas 
One cannot attain to any distinction or difference between these six perfections all being upheld by skill in means and dedicated to perfection of wisdom dedicated to allknowledge 
The one truly believes perfection of wisdom trustingly confides in such studies copies repeats and discourses regarding such since their guide does not fail 
And as this one hears this exposition this one also unhesitatingly resolves to not abandon this perfection of wisdom surely so greatly profitable so great an advantage so great a fruit so great a reward endowed of such and great qualities   this one guards and preserves such as this is for such is exceedingly hard to develop and by oneself one honors reveres and adores this 
Now the other person first venerates this and now gives a copy to another son or daughter of a good family who having aspirations towards this and eager asks for such 
Which one of these two persons begets greater meriton this one hand the one who intends to give this all away or on this other hand the one who does not 
I question you on this point and you may answer to the best of your abilities 
If this one person by oneself is to honor the relics of Tathagata after one's Paranirvana minister revere and preserve these relics and now if this other not only oneself honors these relics of the Tathagata ministers reveres and preserves these but in addition reveals these to others gives these away and shares them knowing hereby the reverence of these relics will become even more widespread and from compassion and true sympathy for beings so answer now Kausika which one of these two persons begets great merit and which a different kind of merit 
If in addition this one goes to persons who are fit vessels for this perfection of wisdom and shares this with these one begets still different merit 
And so too Kausika is great indeed any merit of someone who instigates all beings in Jambudvipa to observe ten ways of wholesome action and establishes these in these ways 
To be sure Lord great this seems to be 
Different even still is any merit of someone who makes a copy of this perfection of wisdom believes in and has faith in such faith serene and firm who constantly reveals one's thoughts toward enlightenment and with earnest intention gives this perfection of wisdom to another Bodhisattva who steadily reveals one's thoughts to enlightenment who does first of all perfect oneself by tireless writing and reciting and after much zealous labor one persuades the other Bodhisattva explaining this perfection of wisdom instigating to such filling one with enthusiasm for this making such a one rejoice in this and does by one's words lead one to this educate one in this illuminate these benefits to such a one cleanse one's thought and remove one's doubt and who addresses such a one as follows 
After this you go on to educate an infinite number of beings in the complete extinction of the substratum begotten of beginningless rebirths in other words in the revelation of the realitylimit As this one intends to reveal this completely this one's merit is infinite and different still from any worldly merits 
And this is true even if it is compared with the merit of someone who establishes in the observation of the ten wholesome ways of acting all the beings in world systems of any size even in all the world systems in existence or not in existence numerous as the sands of Ganges River 
Or if it is compared with that of someone establishing others in the four trances the four Unlimited the four formless attainments the five superknowledges in any number of world systems 
In each case any person not only writing this perfection of wisdom and reciting it by oneself but writing such for others and revealing such completely to these easily begets a different type of merit than merit itself 
Moreover Kausika one also begets a different merit still as one may be conversant with the meaning while reciting this perfection of wisdom and having written such for others still reveals such completely expounds and lights this up both in it's meaning and letter 
Can any one now expound this perfection of wisdom 
The Lord 
For in any time a counterfeit of perfection of wisdom may arise 
How might one recognize in any time if and when the counterfeit perfection of wisdom is expounded 
The Lord 
As these announce to expound perfection of wisdom these actually expound its counterfeit 
These expound the counterfeit perfection of wisdom by teaching impermanence of form feeling perception impulse and consciousness is to be interpreted as destruction of these just mentioned skandhas 
To strive for such insight according to them is coursing in perfection of wisdom 
But on the contrary do not view impermanence of these skandhas as destruction of such 
For to view things in such a way means to course in the counterfeit perfection of wisdom 
For this reason Kausika does one with understanding expound effortlessly and correctly the meaning of truth and in perfection of wisdom 
By so expounding this one realizes different and limitless merit 
THE PERFECTION OF WISDOM UNLIMITED AND DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER SPIRITUAL GIFT And any such merit is quite different than if one even thought of oneself as or even attempted to accept responsibility for any ability whatsoever to establish any beings in say any number of world systems even in the fruit of a Streamwinner 
And such holds good also for the fruit of any OnceReturner of any NeverReturner and of any Arhat 
Any Bodhisattva of true and right intention merely recognizes this goaless goal indicates such and puts before themselves this path for the beneficence of any and all limitless beings 
For it is perfection of wisdom which brings about any fruit of any OnceReturner of any NeverReturner and of any Arhat 
And any Bodhisattva increases one's endurance by reflecting this way for as by training oneself in perfection of wisdom one comes to obtain dharmas which sooner or later constitute a Buddha and one comes ever nearer to revealing for the benefit of any and all beings full enlightenment 
For one knows by training oneself in this training coursing in and struggling in such one brings forth any and all fruits of holy life from fruits of a Streamwinner to Buddhahood 
Any merit of any person sharing perfection of wisdom also is vastly different from any one establishing in Pratyekabuddhahood any number of beings in any number of world systems 
Moreover Kausika as someone reveals any such thing as is for full enlightenment to the hearts of as many beings as are in Jambudvipa and someone else not only indicated how it is possible for these to reveal their very hearts to full enlightenment but also in addition gives these a copy of this perfection of wisdom or as one such as this presents a copy of this perfection of wisdom to an irreversible Bodhisattva in consideration of any possibility that this Bodhisattva may allow oneself to be trained in such make endeavours about and develop such and as a result of any growth increase or abundance of the perfection of wisdom fulfill the Buddhadharmas now compared with the former person one begets a vastly different type of merit for certainly once one is awakened to full enlightenment one cannot help but to indicate the end to the sufferings of countless beings 
Thus one's merit is vastly different even as the other person thinks to raise to full enlightenment the hearts of any number of beings in any number of world systems 
The first presents a copy of this perfection of wisdom to any number of beings in any number of world systems beings which are irreversible from full enlightenment who definitely set out for such yet the second person in addition expounds this to these ones according to the meaning and according to the letter 
Does this one not on the strength of this beget much great merit 
The Lord 
Still Kausika vastly different is any merit of someone who in addition instructs and admonishes in this perfection of wisdom these irreversible Bodhisattvas aspiring to quickly realize full enlightenment 
To the extent any Bodhisattva comes nearer to full enlightenment to such an extent one is instructed and admonished in the perfection of wisdom for such brings one nearer and nearer Suchness 
One's merit now becomes still larger in consequence of the fact one comes nearer to full enlightenment 
Subhuti 
You fortify these belonging to the Bodhisattvavehicle help these and stand by these 
Any holy disciple wanting to give help to all beings as such fortifies Bodhisattvas in their attitude to full enlightenment helps these and stands by these 
For begotten of perfection of wisdom is full enlightenment of Bodhisattvas 
But as the Bodhisattvas do train themselves in the Bodhisattvatraining in these six perfections so now do these produce this thought of enlightenment so even now do these awaken to full enlightenment The Supreme Merit of Dedication and Jubilation Maitreya On the one side we have on the part of a Bodhisattva meritorious work which is founded on this Bodhisattva's rejoicing at the merit of others and on one's dedication of merit to the utmost enlightenment of all beings on the other side is on the part of all beings the meritorious work founded on giving on morality on meditational development Among these the meritorious work of a Bodhisattva founded on jubilation and dedication is declared to be vastly different excellent sublime unequalled and equaling the unequalled 
Such ones consider in each of three time periods in each single direction in each single world system the Tathagatas  as quite immeasurable quite beyond reckoning quite measureless quite inconceivable infinite and boundless fully revealing final Nirvana in the realm of Nirvana and leaving nothing behind  their tracks cut off their course cut off their obstacles annulled and dissolved guides through the world of becoming their tears dried up with all their impediments crushed their own burdens laid down with their own weal reached in whom any fetters of becoming are extinguished whose thoughts are well freed by right understanding and who have attained and maintain completely equanimous perfection in control of their entire hearts One considers these from right here beginning with an appearance of this thought of enlightenment proceeding throughout and beyond any time and any realization of full enlightenment through finally entering or a revelation of Nirvana as Suchness and a totality of Nirvana which leaves nothing behind and a dissolution of any spans of time beyond even any thought in considerations of some vanishing of good Dharma as exposited by each of these Tathagatas One considers this mass of morality this mass of concentration this mass of wisdom this mass of emancipation this mass of vision and cognition of emancipation of such Buddhas and Lords In addition one considers any store of merit associated with six perfections with achievement of qualities of Buddha and nature and with perfections of selfconfidence and of powers and also anyone associated with any perfection of superknowledges of comprehension of vows and any store of merit associated with the accomplishment of cognition of allknowingness with solicitude for beings any great friendliness and great compassion and immeasurable and incalculable Buddhaqualities 
And one also considers the full enlightenment and its all encompassing residual happiness borne of contentment from right actions and contemplation and perfection of sovereignty over all dharmas and such an accomplishment of immeasurable and unconquered supreme wonderworking power which finally conquers all and this power of the Tathagata's cognition of what is truly real which is without a slightest of defiled covering attachment or obstruction unequalled equal to unequalled incomparable without measure and such power of Buddhanature and cognition preeminent among these powers the obtainment of such supreme ease which results from four grounds of selfconfidence and the obtainment of Dharma through realization of this ultimate reality of all dharmas 
One also considers the turning of the wheel of Dharma the carrying of the torch of Dharma the beating of the drum of Dharma the filling up the conch shell of Dharma the wielding of the sword of Dharma the pouring down of the rain of Dharma and the refreshment of all beings through the gift of Dharma through its presentation to them One further considers any store of merit of any and all who are educated and trained by demonstrations of Dharma  whether these concern any dharmas of Buddhas or any of Pratyekabuddhas or of Disciples  who believe in these who are fixed on these who are bound to end up in full enlightenment 
One also considers the store of merit associated with these six perfections of all Bodhisattvas of whom Buddhas and Lords have predicted full enlightenment 
A Bodhisattva considers any store of merit of all persons who belong to the Pratyekabuddha vehicle and of whom the enlightenment of said Pratyekabuddha is predicted 
One considers the meritorious work founded on giving morality and meditational development of the four assemblies of Buddhas and Lords ie 
One considers the roots of good planted during all this time by Gods Nagas Yakshas Gandharvas Asuras Garudas Kinnaras and Mahoragas by beings and ghosts and also by animals at any such time as Buddhas and Lords demonstrate Dharma and as these enter Parinirvana and as these had entered Parinirvana  due to Buddhas and Lords due to Dharma due to Sangha and due to persons of right mindculture 
In one's meditation the Bodhisattva piles up the roots of good of all these all this quantity of merit without exception or remainder rolls this into one lump weighs this and rejoices over this with the most excellent and sublime jubilation the highest and utmost jubilation with none above it and unequalled equaling the unequalled 
I turn over into full enlightenment this meritorious work founded on jubilation May this feed full enlightenment of myself and of all beings A Metaphysical Problem Now as concerns these foundations through which any person belonging to the Bodhisattvavehicle rejoices concerning these objective supports and points of viewdoes one apprehend in such a way as these objective supports and views are treated as signs 
No these have not 
For in a greedy person also as one discriminates a nonexisting entity  and ponders on such  thinking permanence in impermanence ease in suffering any self in what is truly not any self loveliness or not in what is thought either repulsive or not  here arises a perverted perception perverted thought perverted view 
And as the foundation  the objective support the point of view are nonexistent so is enlightenment so is the thought of enlightenment and so all dharmas or points of viewwhat thought does one turn over into full enlightenment or what meritorious work founded on jubilation does one turn over into what utmost right and perfect enlightenment 
This is neither rightly intended nor understood to be taught or expounded in front of a Bodhisattva who has newly set out in the vehicle 
For one may lose whatever little faith one may have gleaned whatever little affection serenity and respect which one may have gathered 
Only in front of an irreversible Bodhisattva is this rightly intended understood taught and expounded Alternatively a Bodhisattva propped up by a good friend is hereby not cowed nor becomes stolid nor cast down nor depressed does not turn the mind away from this nor has one's back broken nor tremble be frightened be terrified 
Thusly any thought by which one has rejoiced and turned over or dedicated any wholesome root connected with jubilation  any such thought of rejoicing is at the time of turning over extinct stopped departed reversed 
Or what is any thought which turns over into full enlightenment  meritorious work founded on jubilation 
Or as no two thoughts can ever meet how can anyone by one thought turn over or dedicate another thought 
Neither is it possible to turn over nor overturn nor transform any thought as far as its own being is concerned 
The Bodhisattvas newly set out in the vehicle need to beware of being afraid upon hearing this exposition 
And how does someone who takes hold of the meritorious work founded on jubilation succeed in taking hold of any thought connected with jubilation and how does one who turns over this thought connected with jubilation succeed in turning it over 
Here the Bodhisattva considers any merit connected with these timeless Buddhas and Lords in the way we described before 
One piles up wholesome roots of all these all of any quantity whatsoever of wholesome roots without exception and remainder rolls such into one lump weighs this and rejoices over this 
One thus thinks to turn this meritorious work founded on jubilation over to full enlightenment 
How can the Bodhisattva when one thus turns over be without perverted perception perverted thought perverted view 
The Bodhisattva must not as a result of any thought by which one is turning this over become one perceiving any thought 
It is thus meritorious work founded on jubilation becomes such as is turned into or rather perhaps revealed as full enlightenment 
Subhuti 
If one does not perceive any thought identifying it as 'this is that thought' as such a Bodhisattva has no perverted perception thought or view But if one perceives the thought by which one turns this over identifying it as 'this is that thought' as such one becomes one who perceives thought 
But any Bodhisattva turns over rightly not wrongly as one perceives and brings to mind any thought which turns over in such a way as one regards it as 'just extinct' extinct as 'stopped departed reversed' and as one reflects thusly as what is extinct cannot be turned over and as this extinctness as 'stopped departed reversed' is the very dharmic nature also of any thought by which one turns over and also of the dharmas through which one turns over as well as of the dharmas to which one turns over it is thus any Bodhisattva turn this over 
If while one turns over one brings to mind any dharmas as extinct stopped departed reversed and any dharma into which it is turned over as inextinguishable this  becomes something which is turned over into full enlightenment 
If further one considers no dharma can be turned over into a dharma it becomes something which is turned over into full enlightenment 
It is thus by which any Bodhisattva who turns over is without perverted perception thought or view for one does not settle down in any process of dedication 
If further one perceives any thought cannot cognize any thought neither of itself nor another nor can dharma cognize dharma now too this has become something which is turned over into full enlightenment 
This is the supreme maturity of any Bodhisattva 
But if on the other hand a Bodhisattva perceives any accumulation of merit one cannot turn it over into full enlightenment due to one settling down in some process of dedication 
If further one reflects this  accumulation of merit is isolated and quietly calm and also any meritorious work founded on jubilation is isolated and quietly calmone turns over into full enlightenment 
But if in addition one does not even perceive any conditioned events are calmly quiet and isolated such is perfection of wisdom of such a Bodhisattva But one does not turn over into full enlightenment if one perceives this to be any wholesome root of Buddhas the Lords having gone to Parinirvana or as this wholesome root by which it is turned over is just as illusory and is of the same kind has the same mark belongs to the same class has the same ownbeing 
For Buddhas and Lords do not allow a dedication to take place through a sign 
One neither brings to mind nor turns over any wholesome root to full enlightenment if one brings about a sign by reflecting anything which is past is extinct stopped departed reversed what is future has not yet arrived and of any present no stability is got at and that this which is not got at has no sign or range 
But such and said wholesome root becomes something which is turned over into full enlightenment on condition of one bringing to mind such and said sign but does not treat it as any sign 
It is thus the Bodhisattva trains oneself herein 
This is known as one's skill in means 
When through skill in means one turns over any wholesome root one is near to allknowledge 
The Bodhisattva wanting to train oneself in this skill in means however constantly commits to hearing just this perfection of wisdom studying it and asking questions derived from it For without the help of perfection of wisdom one untaught cannot enter on the work of dedication by means of perfection of wisdom 
But one does not make a statement to any effect such as thanks to perfection of wisdom it is possible to transform any meritorious work into full enlightenment 
For stopped are any such personal lives stopped are any such karmaformations calmly quiet isolated lacking in basis 
Moreover as this person has brought about a sign and made a discrimination one perceives what is truly real in what is not truly real as it were truly real and one would transform a basis into what is without basis 
Buddhas the Lords do not allow one's wholesome roots to become something which is in this way transformed into full enlightenment for even these become to one so inclined a great basis 
Even the Parinirvana of Buddhas and Lords one so inclined treats as a sign and discriminates thusly one believes oneself to get at Nirvana from a viewpoint and this is not the dedication carried out by one who perceives any basis which the Tathagatas have called a source of great welfare 
For this process of dedication is not without poison not without torn 
It is just as with foods seeming excellent but is really poisonous Its color smell taste and touch seem desirable but nevertheless as poisonous it is best shunned and not eaten by circumspect people 
Although food stupid people might think it best to be eaten 
The color smell taste and touch of this food promise happiness but its transformation in any person eating it surely leads to a painful conclusion 
Just so some perceivers of a basis who seize badly the meaning of what is well taught badly distinguish it badly master it and misunderstand it not understanding the meaning as it really is these instruct and admonish others to consider the mass of merit of the past future and present Buddhas and Lords in the way described before to rejoice at it and to turn over into full enlightenment the meritorious work founded on jubilation 
Thus this turning over since it is being carried out by means of a sign is turned into poisonousness It is just like the poisonous food mentioned before Here can be no turning over for someone who perceives a basis For a basis is poisonous and has a range 
Herein a person who belongs to the vehicle of Bodhisattvas does not train oneself thus 
Here the son or daughter of a good family who belongs to the vehicle of Bodhisattvas and who does not want to calumniate Tathagatas thus rejoices over all and any wholesome root and turns it over thus I rejoice in this wholesome root which is considered in the way in which Tathagatas with their Buddhacognition and their Buddhaeye know and see it its kind such as it is its class such as it is its quality such as it is its ownbeing such as it is its mark such as it is and its mode of existence such as it is And I thus turn this over in such a way as these Tathagatas can allow this wholesome root to be turned over into full enlightenment As one thus rejoices thus turns over a Bodhisattva becomes free from guilt 
The righteousness of Buddhas the Lords is rejoiced in 
This wholesome root becomes something which is turned over into full enlightenment 
And one does not calumniate any Tathagatas In this way one's turning over becomes a nonpoisonous turning over a great turning over a turning over into the dharmaelement it becomes perfect quite perfect through this earnest intention and resolve of one thus turning over Moreover someone who belongs to the vehicle of Bodhisattvas turns this over with understanding all morality concentration wisdom emancipation vision and cognition of emancipation are unincluded in any world of sensedesire the world of form the formless world and as such these are neither past future nor present For everything that is in any three periods of time or in any triple world is unincluded in ultimate reality 
In consequence the turning over is also unincluded and so is the dharma ie 
But on the other hand as one settles down in what one may turn over and treats it as a sign one now turns it over wrongly 
This is the right method of turning it over 
The Lord 
You perform the office of the Teacher as you demonstrate Dharma to the Bodhisattvas 
As the Buddhas and Lords know and see this wholesome root in this dharmahood its kind such as it is its class such as it is its quality such as it is its ownbeing such as it is its mark such as it is its mode of existence such as it is so I rejoice in it as these 
And as these grant permission so I turn it over Considerations of Merit This heap of merit of a Bodhisattva which is born from this turning over of any Dharmaelement is declared to be superior to the accumulation of merit on the part of someone instigating to and establishing in the ten wholesome ways of action all beings in the great trichiliocosms which are countless as the sands of the Ganges 
It remains superior also if these beings would gain the four trances or the four Unlimited or the four formless attainments or the five superknowledges or equally if these become Streamwinners etc to 
If all beings in all world systems set out for supreme enlightenment and if Subhuti each single Bodhisattva were to furnish for aeons as countless as the sands of the Ganges all these beings in the various great trichiliocosms countless as the sands of the Ganges with all which may be neededbut give this gift while perceiving a basisand now proceeding in this manner we imagine all these beings are a single one and if each single Bodhisattva for aeons countless as the sands of Ganges did furnish all these Bodhisattvas with all these may ever need and treat these with respect if thus each single one of all these Bodhisattvas all together would give this gift do not these Bodhisattvas on the strength of this beget a great deal of merit 
A great deal indeed O Lord 
And yet this accumulation of merit due to giving on the part of any Bodhisattvas perceiving a basis is infinitesimal and even different as concerns merit when attempts are made to compare any such merit with anything whatsoever which may or even may not be begotten by someone belonging to the vehicle of Bodhisattvas and who as taken hold of by perfection of wisdom and by skill in means affects this or any wholesome root so as to indicate to such it's turning over into full enlightenment by means of this turning over of the dharmaelement 
For although the basisperceiving Bodhisattvas give a good many gifts these also reckon these gifts up as 'good' and 'many' Now upon this twenty thousand Gods of the Four Great Kings with folded hands paid homage to Lord and said 
This transformation into allknowledge of wholesome roots by any having been taken hold of by perfection of wisdom and by skill in means is a great transformation of Bodhisattvasfor it surpasses any and all accumulation of merit derived from giving of any Bodhisattvas basing such giving on something however great it may be So now again upon this one hundred thousand Gods of the Thirtythree rain down on Lord heavenly flowers incense perfumes wreaths ointments aromatic powders jewels and garments These worship the Lord with heavenly parasols banners bells flags and with rows of lamps all around and with manifold kinds of worship 
This transformation of dharmaelement is surely a great transformation of any Bodhisattva as it is in deed and view different than any and all heaps of accumulated merit resulting from gifts of Bodhisattvas having a basis in anything whatsoever for this great transformation is taken hold of by perfection of wisdom and skill in means All the other classes of Gods appear on this scene worshipping Lord and now raise their voices saying 
Let us also in the same manner consider the case of all beings in countless world systems which having made a vow to gain full enlightenment and having raised thoughts to enlightenment give gifts on the extensive scale described before 
In this other hand we consider a Bodhisattva taken hold of by perfection of wisdom and by skill in means who takes hold of the wholesome roots of all the Buddhas Bodhisattvas Pratyekabuddhas and Disciples and of all other beings also the wholesome roots which have been planted will be planted and are being planted and who rejoices over these all in the way described above Then infinitesimal and different is any accumulation of merit on the part of the former Bodhisattvas who give gifts while perceiving a basis  just because of this perceiving of any basis Subhuti The Lord describes the jubilation over the wholesome roots of all beings as a most excellent jubilation 
For what reason is this jubilation a most excellent one 
If any person belonging to the vehicle of Bodhisattvas does not seize on this past this future and present dharmas does not mind these does not get at these does not construct nor discriminate these does not see nor review these if one considers these with this conviction'all dharmas are fabricated by thought construction unborn not come forth not come not gone' and this 'no dharma is ever produced or stopped in this past this future or present' if one considers any dharmas in such a way herein one's jubilation is in accordance with the true nature of such dharmas and so is one's transformation  into full enlightenment 
The meritorious work founded on giving on the part of Bodhisattvas who perceive a basis who have a basis in view is infinitesimal and quite different when compared with the transformation of the wholesome root by any Bodhisattvas 
Moreover Subhuti someone who belongs to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas wanting to rejoice in the wholesome roots of all Buddhas and Lords rejoices in such a way As emancipation is unoriginated  so the gift so the morality etc so the jubilation so the meritorious work founded on jubilation as emancipation so transformation so Buddhas and Lords Pratyekabuddhas and Disciples who have entered Parinirvana as emancipation so transformation so are any dharmas which are seen as past or stopped and likewise the dharmas which are seen as future or not yet produced and the dharmas which are seen as present or proceeding just now as emancipation so all seen as past future and present Buddhas and Lords 
This is the second reason why the jubilation of the Bodhisattva is a most excellent one 
Let us now consider this case here as all these beings in countless world systems are definitely set out for full enlightenment and so in order to advance to full enlightenment these for countless aeons undertake the obligation of observing morality ie 
good conduct of body speech and mind  but while perceiving a basis 
Nevertheless their accumulation of merit is infinitesimal compared with this of a Bodhisattva's limitless equanimity derived from jubilation  merely due to this simple fact in which these beings in countless world systems perceive a basis 
And the same is true if all these beings for countless aeons practice patience although these were ever so much abused struck and reviled or if these practice vigour and under no circumstances would be cast down or conquered by sloth and torpor or finally if these enter the trances 
As long as any such as these carry out such practices while perceiving a basis any merit is infinitesimal compared with this of any Bodhisattva who rejoices over the wholesome roots of all beings with the most excellent yet equanimous jubilation and transforms this wholesome root into supreme enlightenment 
Perfection of wisdom is realized as allknowledge 
So it is Sariputra as you say 
Veneration towards perfection of wisdom polishes away obscurities revealing light O Lord 
I pay homage to perfection of wisdom 
Our being is permeated by her light so all fear and distress may be forsaken within her revelation 
Veneration of her aquires the five eyes and shows this path to all beings 
Her knowledge disperses the gloom and darkness of delusion 
She never produces any dharma because she cast off any residues relating to both kinds of coverings these produced by defilements and these produced by any thing whatsoever She does not stop any dharma herself unstopped and unproducedis this perfection of wisdom 
She is mother of the Bodhisattvas on account of emptiness of own mark 
As the donor of the jewel of all Buddhadharmas she brings about the ten powers  
The perfection of wisdom of Buddhas the Lords sets in motion this wheel of Dharma 
Predominance of Perfect Wisdom Over Other Perfections How does a Bodhisattva stand in perfection of wisdom how attend and pay homage to it 
Sakra now asks Sariputra 
Wherefrom and for what reason does this question of the holy Sariputra arise 
Sariputra It arises as I hear it said a Bodhisattva being taken hold of by perfection of wisdom and skill in means transforms into allknowledge any socalled meritorious work founded on jubilation 
Ones such as these delve even beyond the entire meritorious works founded on giving morality patience vigour and trance of all Bodhisattvas observing any basis whatsoever It is just perfection of wisdom which guides these five perfections in their intention and direction on this path toward allknowledge 
Just as Kausika people born blind one hundred or one thousand or one hundred thousand of them cannot without a leader go along a path and get to a village town or city  just so Giving Morality Patience Vigour and Trance cannot alone be called 'perfections' for without perfection of wisdom these are as if born blind here now without their leader and unable to traverse the path to allknowledge and still less can these reach allknowledge 
However as Giving Morality Patience Vigour and Trance are taken hold of by perfection of wisdom now these are in deed and propriety termed 'perfections' for these five perfections acquire this organ of vision which enables these to evolve along this path to allknowledge and to reach allknowledge 
Nothing Procured by Perfect Wisdom Sariputra said to the Lord 
How does any Bodhisattva consummate perfection of wisdom 
By pure cognition and establishment in one's view of the nonconsummation of form feeling perception impulse and consciousness 
The nonconsummation of the five skandhas this is called 'consummation of perfection of wisdom' 
When perfection of wisdom is consummated by such a consummation what dharma or what of any phenomena whatsoever does it procure 
So O Lord perfection of wisdom does not even procure allknowledge 
This is wonderful O Lord to see any extent to which perfection of wisdom neither produces nor stops any dharma 
If any Bodhisattva perceives this also one might keep far away from perfection of wisdom treating this as worthless and insignificant and fail to act on it 
This is quite true 
For here perfection of wisdom is lit up and here form does not become lit up nor other skandhas nor any fruits of this holy life up to Buddhahood 
Perfection of wisdom is great perfection O Lord Why the Perfection of Wisdom is Great Perfection of Wisdom is here stated as the Great Perfection not bad for st Century The Lord Tell what you think Subhuti in what manner is perfection of wisdom a great perfection 
This neither makes form  greater nor smaller and does not assemble nor disperse form etc 
This also neither strengthens nor weakens the powers of Tathagata nor does this assemble or disperse these 
This does not even make allknowledge greater or smaller nor does this assemble or disperse it 
In the event any Bodhisattva perceives even this one courses not in perfection of wisdom so how much more so if one forms the notion Thus do I endowed with cognition of allknowing demonstrate dharma to beings thus do I lead these beings to final Nirvana For this apprehension of these beings is a basis fact for when one says I lead these beings to final Nirvana this cannot be an outcome of perfection of wisdom This indeed is a great basis of apprehension on one's part 
For the absence of ownbeing in beings needs to be known as belonging to the very essence of perfection of wisdom 
One needs know this perfection of wisdom is without ownbeing in the same way in which beings are without ownbeing also perfection of wisdom is unthinkable because beings are naturally as well also perfection of wisdom has an indestructible nature because beings do as well and perfection of wisdom taken as it naturally is does not undergo any process which leads to enlightenment as wellfor beings as these are naturally do not undergo such a process  also this way in which Tathagatas arrive at full possession of powers is understood as the way in which beings arrive thus at full possession of their power 
Bodhisattvas reborn here resolutely believe or have direct knowing in deep perfection of wisdom without hesitation doubt or stupefaction here these decease and enduring beyond any duration do these practice 
Thus it is Sariputra 
Any such Bodhisattvas as decease in other world systems in which one honors and questions Buddhas the Lords are reborn here and upon hearing this deep perfection of wisdom being taught identify perfection of wisdom as teacher and are definitely convinced beyond even such questions one is face to face with ones teachersuch a one can know one sees the teacher As perfection of wisdom is being taught and as one listens attentively pays respect to this even before one hears this and does not cut this story shortsuch a Bodhisattva is known as one practicing for long even beyond duration 
Is it at all possible to hear perfection of wisdom to distinguish and consider her to make statements and to reflect about her 
Can one explain or learn such as because of certain attributes tokens or signs this is perfection of wisdom or such as here this is perfection of wisdom or over therethat is perfection of wisdom 
Nor can perfection of wisdom be understood other than by the skandhas elements or sensefields 
Causes and Consequences of Disbelief It is quite possible some Bodhisattvas although perhaps seeing or having seen many hundreds many thousands many hundreds of thousands of Buddhas and have led and continue to lead the holy life in any present 'time' may nevertheless have no faith in perfection of wisdom 
The reason is now as whenever some have no respect for this profound perfection of wisdom as it is taught even in the presence of Buddhas and Lords 
From the lack of respect without faith and firm belief in perfection of wisdom these lack also in accord either in body or in thought Lacking in accord these do not know see recognize or make known this perfection of wisdom 
Hereby these calumniate perfection of wisdom 
To calumniate perfection of wisdom means to calumniate allknowledge and hereof the past future and present Buddhas 
Such activities cut down the welfare and happiness of allbeings and these will collect karma conducive to the great hells 
As these have raised such karmaformations these will be reborn in great hells for many hundreds of years many thousands of years indeed for many hundreds of thousands of niyutas of kotis of aeons 
From one great hell these will pass on to another After a long time this world of these is consumed by fire Yet such as these are hurled into the great hells in another world system and again these pass on from great hell to great hell 
When also such as this world is consumed by fire yet still these are hurled into the great hells in another world system here still these pass on from great hell to great hell 
When also this world is consumed by fire this karma of ones such as these is still unexhausted still has some residue of efficacy and deceasing now here these are still reborn in great hells and experience great sufferings in these until the time when yet even this world is once more consumed by fire 
These still as even unto our ownselves as we see experience a karma which involves many painful feelings 
And why 
Does not even the effect of the five deadly sins bear no proportion to this misconduct of mind and speech 
All these ones opposing perfection of wisdom and dissuading others from it are beings like unto ones by and to whom are not granted any vision 
As a matter of fact regard these as defamers of dharma as mere rubbish as pitchguards as mere vipers 
Sariputra 
The Lord has not told us about the length of time such a person must spend in the great hells 
Leave that alone Sariputra 
If this were announced anyone hearing it needs to beware lest hot blood spurt from their mouths lest any incur death or deathly pain lest harsh oppression weigh any down lest the dart of grief enter their hearts lest any drop down with a big fall lest any shrivel up and wither away lest any be overpowered by great fright 
Sothe Lord refused to answer the Venerable Sariputra's question 
For a second time for a third time the Venerable Sariputra spoke thus to the Lord 
Because one has brought about accumulated piled up and collected this karma of mind and speech one must sojourn for a long while in the great hells 
The mere announcement of the measureless magnitude of one's pain will be a sufficient anxiety to virtuous sons and daughters of good family 
The mere announcement will turn any of these away from activities conducive to the ruin of dharma so even now these cause formations of merit and these ones will not reject the good dharma even to save their lives for these do not wish to meet with such pains 
For so great a heap of demerit is begotten by such false teaching 
The Lord 
Just here are deluded beings persons who having left the world for the welltaught DharmaVinaya decide to defame to reject to oppose this perfection of wisdom 
But to oppose the perfection of wisdom is to oppose the enlightenment of Buddhas and Lords 
And this means one opposes such allknowledge of Buddhas and Lords in this past future and present 
To oppose allknowledge means to oppose Dharma 
To oppose Dharma means to oppose the community of Disciples of Tathagatas 
For what reason do these lack faith and oppose this perfection of wisdom 
Such as these are beset by Mara 
One's karma is conducive to weakness in wisdom and so one has no faith or serene confidence in profound Dharma 
Moreover Subhuti this person will be one who is in the hands of friends which are other than good or may be one who has not yet practiced or one who has settled down in the skandhas and determined a basis for things or one who exalts oneself and deprecates others looking out for faults 
Endowed also with these four attributes is this person believing this perfection of wisdom needs opposition whenever and wherever this is being taught 
It is hard to gain confidence in perfection of wisdom if one is unpracticed lacks in wholesome roots and is in the hands of any friend who may be other than good this friend being any one possessed of less than right intent speech action and concentration toward countless beings 
How deep indeed Lord how profound is perfection of wisdom as being so hard to gain confidence in 
Form is neither bound nor freed because form has no ownbeing as innate inherent or individualized in any true or absolute sense 
Any starting point of any material process  is neither bound nor freed within or beyond any perceptibility because any starting point of any material process is without ownbeing 
Any end of material process is likewise without ownbeing because in this same way any truly profound explicitness of being beness or presence cannot exist as any part of a nonexistent ownbeing of some present form 
Discursive facts within and of themselves are ephemeron illusive and transitory 
The Lord So it is Subhuti 
Because purity of form is identical with purity of fruit and purity of fruit is identical with purity of form 
It is thus this purity of form and this purity of fruit can neither be multiplied nor counted as two nor are these one divided 
And Subhuti not even can these be counted as one as these have no basis no ground from which to determine any singleness 
It is thus as this purity of form comes from purity of fruit and purity of this fruit from this purity of form 
And the same relevance exists between purity of form and purity of allknowledge The same applies to any other skandhas whatsoever 
And why 
Well said Subhuti 
The Lord even announces these sources of attachment 
It is an attachment if one perceives any skandhas are empty or past dharmas are past dharmas future dharmas are future dharmas and present dharmas are present dharmas Such are merely names It is an attachment if one forms any notion such as someone who belongs to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas begets a great a heap of merit through one's first production of any thought of enlightenment Such are merely signs In which manner Subhuti is any thought of enlightenment a source of attachment 
One is attached as one perceives of any thought of enlightenment as this is a  first thought of enlightenment and one now thinks to convert such to full enlightenment while conscious one is doing so 
For it is quite impossible to turn over essential original nature of thought by thought 
To reveal or have such revealed in this way one does not waste any self or thing away and the manner which one rouses others to Suchness is the sanction of Buddhas 
Well said Subhuti you make Bodhisattvas aware of these points of attachment 
Say on O Lord and the Venerable Subhuti listened in silence 
The Lord 
It is in this way of being as this one is conscious that one rejoices in all dharmas with no outflows of Buddhas and Lords thought of as either past or of some future or even this present After such rejoicing one simply turns over into full enlightenment any wholesome root which is associated with one's act of jubilation 
As a matter of difference however this true nature of even these dharmas is neither past nor future nor present for such lie quite outside any of these three periods called time 
The Lord 
Also all dharmas are isolated as essential nature And the isolatedness of essential nature to all dharmas is identical with perfection of wisdom 
Here do all dharmas have the character of not being fully known by the Tathagatas 
Nature for such as these is nonature and nonature are these as nature All dharmas have one mark only ie no mark 
It is for such a reason all dharmas have a character of not being fully known by Tathagatas 
And nature of all dharmas is not nature and nonature is their nature 
It is thus all these points of attachment are abandoned 
Subhuti 
Unthinkable O Lord is perfection of wisdom 
Perfection of wisdom is neither some'thing' thought can know nor which thought may even have any access to 
A Bodhisattva courses as perfect wisdom if while coursing one does not course in skandhas or if one does not course in any conviction such as skandhas are impermanent or are empty or these are neither defective nor entire 
And if one does not even course in any conviction such as form is neither any defectiveness nor entirety of itself as form and the same for any 'other' skandhas one courses as perfect wisdom but only inasmuch as any perceptible manifestation to any of us may allow or to such a greater or lesser degree as one may for one's self make perceptible 
One courses in perfect wisdom if one does not course in any idea such as form is with attachment or without attachment 
And as for form so for any other skandhas the sight organ etc to even such as feeling born from eye contact so for any physical elements the six perfections the thirtyseven wings of enlightenment the powers any grounds of selfconfidence any analytical knowledge the eighteen special Buddhadharmas and fruits of holy life from the fruit of a Streamwinner to allknowledge 
When one courses thus a Bodhisattva does not generate attachment to anything from form to allknowledge 
For allknowledge is unattached it is neither bound nor freed and here is nothing whatsoever which can rise above or beyond this such as this is even unto any self 
It is wonderful O Lord how deep is this Dharma I mean perfection of wisdom 
The Lord Well said Subhuti 
It is just as if any Tathagatas during one's entire life speak in praise of space without hereby increasing the volume of space and space does not diminish either while one is not speaking in praise for it 
Or it is as with an illusory man Praise neither penetrates him nor wins him over When here is no praise he is neither affected nor frustrated 
A doer of what is hard is any Bodhisattva who while coursing in perfection of wisdom neither loses heart nor gets elated who persists in making endeavours about this and does not turn back 
Homage is paid to any Bodhisattvas who are armed with this armor 
Armed with great armor is a Bodhisattva a liberator is any Bodhisattva when one wants to be armed with an armor and win full enlightenment for the sake of beings who are like space who are like the realm of dharma 
Such is one who wants to liberate like unto space one who aspires even to get rid of space one who has won this armor of this great perfection of vigor this Bodhisattva who is armed with this armor for the sake of beings who are like unto space who are like unto this realm of Dharma 
Please O Lord command me to shelter defend and protect any son or daughter of good family who bears in mind this perfection of wisdom 
Sakra can you see any dharma which you intend to shelter defend and protect 
Not so holy Subhuti 
So when a Bodhisattva stands in perfection of wisdom as this is being expounded just this is one's shelter defense and protection 
One does however want to arrange shelter defense and protection for a Bodhisattva coursing in view of perfect wisdom 
What do you think Kausika are you able to arrange shelter defense and protection for an echo 
Subhuti 
One does not think about such does not review identify or perceive such and knows such dharmas do not exist their reality does not appear cannot be found cannot be got at 
Conclusion Hereupon and through the Buddha's might the four Great Kings in this great trichiliocosm and all these Sakras Chiefs of Gods and all these great Brahma Gods and Sahapati the great Brahma all came to this place the Lord is Reverently these are saluting the Lord's feet with their heads and are walking three times round the Lord and are now standing on one side Through the Buddha's might and through his miraculous power their minds were impressed by sight of a thousand Buddhas 
Maitreya also the Bodhisattva the great being will as he wins the supreme enlightenment at this very spot of earth teach this very same perfection of wisdom 
And what this name corresponds to cannot be got at One speaks of a 'name' with reference to any merely nominal entity Even perfection of wisdom cannot be found or got at In so far as this is a word in so far is this perfect wisdom in so far as this is perfect wisdom in so far is this a word 
For what reason does Maitreya the Bodhisattva the great being as he wins the supreme enlightenment preach just this very same perfection of wisdom at this very spot of earth in just these same words 
Subhuti 
Perfectly pure indeed is perfection of wisdom 
This is pure as space is pure and skandhas are stainless and any defiling forces cannot in truth take hold of such as these 
Perfect wisdom is perfectly pure for like space or an echo such is unutterable incommunicable and offers no basis for apprehension 
It is indeed a great gain to these sons and daughters of good family such as these even come to hear of such perfection of wisdom How much greater the gain as these take up bear in mind recite study spread teach explain and master this Their eyes ears nose tongues and bodies come to be free from disease and their minds free from stupefaction These do not die any violent death 
Many thousands of Gods follow closely behind 
Whenever on the eight fourteenth and fifteenth day one talks Dharma any son or daughter of good family teaches perfection of wisdom so here as well one begets a great deal of merit 
So it is Subhuti 
Desirous of hearing Dharma these all of these protect any preacher of Dharma who teaches perfection of wisdom to any with right intentions and the propensity to listen and learn 
This also is a reason why such a person begets a different type of merit than any which might be considered as great merit 
But this is most precious in entire world systems this perfection of wisdom which is being undertaken for the benefit and happiness of these worlds by showing all dharmas as being neither produced nor destroyed neither defiled nor purified 
And perfect wisdom does not cling to any dharma nor defile any dharma nor take hold of any dharma Any and all dharmas neither exist nor are any got at As it is not apprehended perfection of wisdom is without any stain 'To be free from stains' is the same thing as perfect wisdom and it is the same thing such as skandhas are free from stains as perfect wisdom is without any stain 
A Bodhisattva courses in perfect wisdom if one does not perceive even this for beyond perception and concepts is perfect wisdom 
The Second Turning of the Wheel of Dharma So hereupon a great many thousands of Gods in this intermediate realm call out aloud with cries of joy waving their garments and saying We now indeed see this second turning of the wheel of dharma taking place in Jambudvipa The Lord 
This is a great perfection of any Bodhisattva who unattached to all dharmas wants to know full enlightenment and who yet is not enlightened about any dharma or who turns the wheel of dharma and yet does not show up any dharma 
For no dharma is here got at no dharma is indicated and no dharma moves on any dharma 
For absolutely reproduction is alien to all dharmas Nor does nor can any dharma turn back any other dharma 
So it is Subhuti 
For emptiness does neither proceed nor recede and such holds good also for the Signless and the Wishless 
But no one has demonstrated this no one has heard this no one has received this and no one realizes this in this past present or future 
Nor by this demonstration of dharma has anyone ever been made worthy of gifts 
This is perfection of such as nothing whatsoever is not as space is not something which is 
Perfection of wisdom equals any such as unequalled dharmas are not apprehended 
Perfection of wisdom is isolated on account of absolute emptiness 
Perfection of wisdom cannot be crushed as dharmas are not apprehended 
Perfection of wisdom is trackless as both body and mind are absent 
Perfection of wisdom has no ownbeing neither comes nor goes 
Perfection of wisdom is inexpressible as any dharmas are not discriminated 
Perfection of wisdom is nameless as any skandhas whatsoever cannot be apprehended 
Perfection of wisdom does not go away as having not come hither no dharma ever goes away 
One cannot partake of this perfection of wisdom as no dharma can be seized 
Perfection of wisdom is inexhaustible as indelible to inexhaustible dharma 
Perfection of wisdom has no genesis as no dharma ever really comes about 
Perfection of wisdom does nothing as no doer can be apprehended 
Perfection of wisdom does not generate  anything as any and all dharmas are without self 
Perfection of wisdom does not discipline as this past future and present periods are not apprehended 
Perfection of wisdom is as a dream an echo a reflected image a mirage or an illusion and is indicated as precision of nonproduction 
Perfection of wisdom is free from defilement as greed hate and delusion have no ownbeing 
Perfection of wisdom knows no purification as no possible receptacle  can be apprehended 
Perfection of wisdom is spotless as space is spotless 
Perfection of wisdom is free from impediments as spontaneously present throughout and beyond any and all mental attitudes to dharmas 
Perfection of wisdom has no mental attitude as it is imperturbable 
Perfection of wisdom is unshakeable as is stability of any realm of dharma 
Perfection of wisdom knows no greed as here is no falseness in dharmas 
Perfection of wisdom does not rise up as here is no discrimination in dharmas 
Perfection of wisdom is quiet as no sign is apprehended as all dharmas Perfection of wisdom is faultless as perfection of all virtues 
Perfection of wisdom is undefiled as imagination is something which is not 
Neither living nor dying being is found as perfection of wisdom as the realitylimit 
Perfection of wisdom is unlimited as the manifestation of all dharmas does not rise up 
Perfection of wisdom is undifferentiated as all dharmas are still but speciously indicated 
Perfection of wisdom is untarnished as such is free from any longing for some jewel of Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas 
Perfection of wisdom is undiscriminated as this is basic identity to all which is discriminated 
Perfection of wisdom is infinite as any nature of dharma is unlimited 
Perfection of wisdom is unattached as this is nonattachment to all dharmas 
Perfection of wisdom is unconditioned as all dharmas are impermanent and merely an indication of such as this is 
Perfection of wisdom is as space as any nature of dharma is identical as impermanence 
Perfection of wisdom is Empty as any or all dharmas are not apprehended 
Perfection of wisdom is markless as here is no reproduction in dharmas 
Perfection of this is of total emptiness as endless and boundless 
Perfection of this is as the wings of enlightenment such as is pillars of mindfulness etc as these cannot be apprehended 
This is perfection of Emptiness of the Signless of the Wishless as the three doors to deliverance cannot be apprehended 
This is perfection of the eight deliverances as these cannot be apprehended 
This is perfection of the nine successive stations as the first trance etc cannot be apprehended 
This is perfection of the four Truths as ill old age and death cannot be apprehended 
This is perfection of the ten perfections as giving etc cannot be apprehended 
This is perfection of the ten powers as such cannot be crushed 
This is perfection of the four grounds of selfconfidence as absolutely such cannot be cowed 
This is perfection of the analytical knowledges as such is unobstructed when unattached to allknowledge 
This is perfection of Suchness as Tathagatas as here is no falseness in any and all dharmas 
This is perfection of any as Selfexistent as all dharmas have not ownbeing 
Possessed of siddhis which are eventually realized as already in place beyond any common worldly determination as to why or how any dharma whatsoever comes to be these who taking up this perfection of wisdom bear in mind study spread and explain this even now perform such acts 
These beings are endowed with more than trifling wholesome roots These are beings honoring many Buddhas and who again and again question these 
Sariputra now reading Sakra's thoughts says 
As an irreversible Bodhisattva any person becomes and is so regarded who when just this deep perfection of wisdom is being taught and explained has faith in it and trusting firmly believing this one's heart full of serene faith reveals to all sentient beings bodhicitta a thought directed towards enlightenment takes up expounds reveals writes down repeats andor develops this perfection of wisdom trains in Thusness progresses toward Thusness and yet makes no effort about Thusness as basis or object 
For this perfection of wisdom is exceedingly profound and herein someone with diminutive wholesome roots who is unwilling to ask questions learns nothing when face to face with any Buddhas and Lords in any time and who does not practice as yet in any time cannot just here believe in this very profound perfection of wisdom 
As to any who neither believe in this nor understand this and who decide to reject this within these three times these reject this deep perfection of wisdom as this is being taught and this in consequence of inadequacy as regards their development of wholesome roots 
Sakra now said to the Lord 
I pay homage O Lord to perfection of wisdom One pays homage to cognition of allknowing as one pays homage to perfection of wisdom The Lord So it is 
For from this comes forth allknowledge of Buddhas the Lords and conversely perfection of wisdom is brought about as such which comes forth from cognition of allknowing 
How does a Bodhisattva coursing in perfection of wisdom become one who stands in perfect wisdom How does one make efforts in regards to perfection of wisdom 
The Lord Well said well said Kausika 
Well said again well said Kausika since you have decided to question Tathagata about this matter for in this questioning you have been inspired by Buddha's might 
Here Kausika a Bodhisattva coursing in or as perfect wisdom does not make any stand in form feeling perception impulse or consciousness does not develop as any basis any notion such as 'this is form this is feeling this is perception this is impulse' or 'this is consciousness'for this means one makes efforts about any or all of these as form feeling perception impulse or consciousness 
One does not apply oneself to any notion such as this is form this is feeling etc 
Subhuti 
So it is Sariputra 
One does not stand in any notion such as form feeling perception impulse or consciousness is deep Insofar as one does not stand in any such notion as 'one makes efforts about form etc' one does not make efforts about any such notion as form  etc is deep In so far as one makes no efforts about any such notion one does not stand in any notion as form etc is deep Qualifications of a Bodhisattva Who Obtains Perfect Wisdom Sariputra 
Only when presented to an irreversible Bodhisattva to any Bodhisattva predestined to enlightenment is deep perfection of wisdom understood and only so may this herein be taught 
What is the fault in teaching this perfection of wisdom in front of an unpredestined Bodhisattva 
If Kausika unpredestined a Bodhisattva obtains this perfection of wisdom for vision praise worship and hearing and if one remains unafraid as one hears this one can be sure this one comes from afar is set out for long in this vehicle and this one's wholesome roots are well matured It is not long from now onwards until this one receives the prediction to supreme enlightenment One can be sure this prediction is near and comes to one before one passes by one two or three Tathagatas And of course one pleases the Tathagatas whom one passes by pleases these permanently and so one sees to it the vision of these Tathagatas bears the fruit of the prediction so it leads one to the prediction to supreme enlightenment  
Once come from afar O Lord set out for long in this great vehicle with wholesome roots well matured is this Bodhisattva obtaining this perfection of wisdom for vision praise worship hearing and understanding How much more so if one not only hears this but also takes this up bears this in mind preaches studies spreads explains and repeats such as this 
So it is Sariputra as you have said 
Just as we are sure a person belonging to this vehicle of Bodhisattvas when one dreams that one sits on the terrace of enlightenment is actually near to supreme enlightenmentjust so we can be sure a person who fulfils these conditions just outlined has come from afar and is set out for long in the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas and is near this prediction to enlightenment 
We can be sure Buddhas the Lords will predict this Bodhisattva to win full enlightenment 
For a Bodhisattva is set out for long in this vehicle and one's wholesome roots are mature if one gets to this deep perfection of wisdom even if one gets no further than hearing this 
For the thoughts of beings not without an abundance of accumulations of karma conducive to the ruin of dharma become adverse to this deep perfection of wisdom do sway away from this Through the abundance of such karma beings who do not collect wholesome roots find neither satisfaction nor faith in this realitylimit 
But any such beings who do find satisfaction and faith in this are people who collected wholesome roots well collected these 
A person coming out of a huge wild forest one hundred miles big up to a thousand miles big might see certain signs which indicate a town or other inhabited place such as cowherds or cattle keepers or boundary lines or gardens or groves 
One feels happier and robbers no longer worry this one 
Just so a Bodhisattva for whom this deep perfection turns up can know one is quite near to supreme enlightenment and before long one will receive the prediction to such 
For this sign has appeared to this one ie one has received this deep perfection of wisdom for vision praise worship hearing andor understanding 
So it is Sariputra 
May you make clear also this section 
Sariputra A person desirous of seeing the great ocean might travel to it As long as on one's travels one sees a tree or the sign of a tree a mountain or the sign of a mountain one knows the great ocean is still far away 
But when one no longer sees either tree or mountain one knows the great ocean is quite near to here 
For this great ocean gradually slopes away and within it there is neither tree nor mountain 
So although one may not yet see the great ocean directly before one's eyes one nevertheless can be quite certain the ocean is quite near not much farther away from here 
Similar is the case of any Bodhisattva hearing this deep perfection of wisdom One can know thiseven although perhaps one has not yet been face to face with these Tathagatas and predicted to supreme enlightenment nevertheless one is quite near this prediction 
For one has received this deep perfection of wisdom for vision praise worship hearing andor understanding 
Likewise in this spring O Lord as last year's leaves are withered away one can see sproutings on many trees The people of Jambudvipa are glad because as these see these symptoms in the woods these ones know soon also flowers and fruits come out For they see such signs in the trees 
Just so O Lord one can be sure that a Bodhisattva when one receives this deep perfection of wisdom as this even turns up for one such a one has become matured in one's wholesome roots for a long time It is just because of the existence of these wholesome roots in such a one this deep perfection of wisdom has bent over to whoever this is Then any divinities who see the Buddhas of any past are delighted overjoyed and enchanted as these feel surely it is not long until this Bodhisattva receives this prediction to full enlightenment since also with any Bodhisattvas of any past these are the symptoms of their coming prediction to full enlightenment 
Likewise O Lord a woman pregnant with a heavy womb is twisted and all weary she does not walk about a great deal takes little food finds little rest speaks little has little strength but many pains often cries out aloud and abstains from habitual cohabitation She realizes she experiences all these unpleasant feelings in her body as a result of indulging in unwise attention in the past practicing it developing it making much of it 
As these symptoms are being seen in her one can be sure before long she will give birth to a child 
Just so when for a Bodhisattva this deep perfection of wisdom turns up for the sake of vision praise worship hearing andor understanding and if as one hears this one's thought delights in this and one develops aspirations toward this so one can be sure before long one will receive prediction to full enlightenment 
This is because these Bodhisattvas practice for the weal and happiness of the many out of compassion for the world 
How does a Bodhisattva which courses toward perfect wisdom become increasingly perfect 
A Bodhisattva courses toward perfect wisdom as this coursing itself being neither any growth nor any diminution of form feeling perception impulse andor consciousness and is reviewed as one reviews neither dharma nor nodharma 
Subhuti 
Ultimately form is as unthinkable as any skandhas or things being thought of as going together to makeup other things 
What is Bodhisattva practice and what is the meaning of the word 'practice' 
A Bodhisattva neither constructs power nor ground such as selfconfidence nor Buddhadharmas nor even allknowledgefor power or ground as selfconfidence Buddhadharmas or even allknowledge is as unthinkable as any and all dharmas 
Deep O Lord is one's learning realizing and understanding as perfection of wisdom is indicated as such 
It is not surprising many obstacles arise to any reciting reading writing studying contemplating andor understanding perfection of wisdom as such 
Many obstacles to one's reciting reading etc this perfection of wisdom are always present 
For Mara the Evil One is seen as making many difficulties as even here for one of these one hurries with one's task of copying this out 
O Lordas Mara the Evil One is seen as any presenting preventative obstacles to this studying perfection of wisdom how can any beings actually study this and through whose might can these progress 
The Lord 
Through might of Buddhas Lords and Tathagatas these study these progress and train in or as Thusness 
This same nature of Buddhas and Lords which stands holds and maintains immeasurable and incalculable worldsystems brings to mind and upholds anyone learning and studying perfection of wisdom 
Is this Buddha's might sustaining power and grace which Bodhisattvas deeply study as perfection of wisdom and progressively train in or as Thusness 
So it is Sariputra 
As such these are known to Tathagatas these are sustained and seen by Tathagatas and the Tathagatas behold these with this Buddha eye 
And these Bodhisattvas which study perfection of wisdom progressively train in or as Thusness stand as such with no true ground in any decision to enlightenment 
Just to study perfection of wisdom without progressively training in or as Thusness these do not stand poised in Suchness but nevertheless are known to Tathagatas sustained and seen by Tathagatas and the Tathagatas behold these with this Buddha eye 
With continual study of perfection of wisdom the mental excitation is greatly profitable to these a great advantage fruit and reward 
For as aiming at ultimate reality perfection of wisdom is set up for penetration by all beings into this nature of what dharmas truly are 
As in this South these spread to this East and as well this North and West  at any time this Dharma Vinaya is as freshly made cream and as good law dissolves as DharmaBody  
Sariputra Will perfection of wisdom at the last of time in the last period be deeply widespread in this northern direction in this northern part of the world 
Bodhisattvas in this North which deeply study perfection of wisdom are these many or few 
These are many a good many Bodhisattvas in this North But only a few are among these which deeply study perfection of wisdom and which as this is being taught are not demoralized by it As set out for long in this vehicle are known already beings such as these which pursue question and worship Tathagatas  one's thus gone as one's thus come 
Such as these are perfection of wisdom and allknowledge as related to this 
As diamond resolve  and irresistibly these approach full enlightenment 
Coursing in practice of Bodhisattvas we are this we indicate the way to full enlightenment of many hundreds of living beings yea many niyutas of kotis of living beings 
We indicate perfect enlightenment to these instigate and empower help such to come forth help these to establish such help these to irreversible right effort and action And as these are thought as my thought these daughters and sons of good family belong to the vehicle of Bodhisattvas who make this vow 
As these are confirmed in their faith these attain to rebirth yet in many Buddhafields and even here come face to face with Tathagatas which indicate Dharma and as such these hear in deep detail perfection of wisdom 
It is wonderful to think this past and future as present dharma is nothing Tathagatas do not experience such as unawareno dharma is not cognized yet beyond even purityaware as space Neither is conduct as anything anywhere nor anybeing unaware Such as these cognize even conduct of Bodhisattvas who are zealous for enlightenment yet even of the slightest earnest intent for these too exert vigour if even of slight 
And yet O Lord among these born of good family who at any time deeply study this perfection of wisdom and exert themselves on behalf of these six perfections and of the benefit of all beings and seek search and strive deeply to obtain perfection of wisdom some still do not obtain this while others obtain this without striving to get this 
So it is Sariputra 
In this past and future or as present dharma is nothing Tathagatas do not see hear and feel such as unaware 
It is further true at these times in these periods some Bodhisattva who hunt and search for perfection of wisdom do not get this 
It is of such impetus of this former wholesome root these realize perfection of wisdom in spite of the fact these do not now hunt and search for this 
Will only these Sutras in accord with six perfections come to this one and no others 
Here also other profound Sutras come to this son or daughter of good family of their own accord 
It is as a rule Sariputra that Bodhisattvas which indicate this teaching for others on their way to full enlightenment helping these in their quest for such help them to irreversibility and these who also train in this after these pass through this present birth on their own these deep Sutras come to these Sutras which are in accord with nonapprehension of a basis and which accord with emptiness and also accord with the six perfections 
The Lord proclaims virtues of sons and daughters of good family 
Are any obstacles here which arise in such ones 
The Bodhisattvas discoursing this perfection of wisdom either understand this after a long time or as understanding is generated it immediately becomes disturbed 
We gain no firm footing in it we derive no enjoyment from itwith such words these take their leave 
As such thoughts derive from a source seemingly devoid of serene faith these think I am not predestined for perfection of wisdomand get up and leave 
Or as these merely see and think this book does not name the place they're born does not mention their own name and clan nor of their mother and father nor of their family these may decide to not listen to perfection of wisdom and take their leave Each time these take their leave again and again these take to birthanddeath for as many aeons as they have productions of thought and still even now at some point during these aeons these ones may make new efforts 
All this and for what reason 
Bodhisattvas refusing to listen deeply to perfection of wisdom cannot go forth to spiritual dharmas be these worldly or supramundane 
The Perfection of Wisdom and the Sutras of the Disciples In addition some of us may or may not recognize whether or not we belong to this vehicle of the Bodhisattvas and some give up and think to abandon perfection of wisdomthis understanding beyond knowledge which nourishes this cognition of allknowing 
Many of us do not learn and understand perfection of wisdom and thus presently do not want to train in both worldly and universal spiritual dharmas nor do we avail ourselves of these 
As we do not learn and understand perfection of wisdom we cannot avail ourselves of worldly or universal spiritual dharmas 
Though all possess this identical potential some get rid of and abandon perfection of wisdom which is the root of the comprehension of worldly and universal spiritual dharmas as these are and instead decide to look for support in what are different branches 
As a dog spurns a morsel of food offered by it's master and takes a mouthful of water from a servant instead just so beings recognized as implicitly related to this vehicle of Bodhisattvas spurn perfection of wisdom which is the taproot revealing cognizance of allknowing yet decide to look for the core for growth for Buddhahood in vehicles of Disciples as Sravakas and Pratyekabuddhas which corresponds to branches leaves and foliage 
This also may be seen as done to them by Mara 
Again all beings have equal potential yet do not equally recognize concentrated right effort and mindfulness towards perfection of wisdom and apply this hereby nourishing cognition of allknowingStill most of us at one time or another get rid of abandon spurn or even simply forget perfection of wisdom and decide to study as if superior to this Sutras by which we welcome the level of a Disciple or Pratyekabuddha which are compared to branches leaves and foliage 
A Bodhisattva does not train in the same way in which a being recognized as belonging to the vehicle of a Disciple or Pratyekabuddha is trained 
How does a Disciple and Pratyekabuddha train 
Bodhisattvas train ourselves differently 
Also propensities allowing karma neutralizedthe eventual clearing of obstructions to the realitylimit any may become revealed to full enlightenment and advancement to parinirvanathe whole immeasurable universe of beings With this right intention a Bodhisattva engages all the exercises which bring about the wholesome root 
But one boasts not regarding thisFor imagine a being which unable to see an elephant would try to determine it's color and shape 
Is this an intelligent thing to do 
The same is true of any persons who belong to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas who do not understand this perfection of wisdom and ask no questions Yet while desirous of full enlightenment these spurn this and prefer to look to the Sutras which welcome the level of Sravakas or Pratyekabuddhas 
Also this is seen as being done to any one of these by Mara 
If a person who desires jewels would not look for them in the great ocean but in a puddle in a cows footprint and would thus in effect equate the great ocean with the water in a cow's footprint would this one be using one's potential for intelligence wisely 
Subhuti 
Well and now the same applies to any beings which vow to this vehicle of Bodhisattvas whichthough we make ourselves available to perfection of wisdom we nevertheless cut ourselves off from continuous exposure and reference to this without plunging or probing at all times in all times exceedingly deeper as a means of perfection to endless placeless timeless wisdom 
The decision to seclusion to the fruits of a holy life from the fruit of a Streamwinner to Pratyekabuddhahood to enter Parinirvana after one has in this very life freed thought from the outflows without further clinging that means to be in accord with the level of a Sravaka as Disciple or Pratyekabuddha 
Bodhisattvas do not focus thought only to such as this 
But as beings which vow to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas and without knowing and understanding Sutras which accord with the six perfections spurn perfection of wisdom and prefer these Sutras which welcome this level of Sravakas as Disciples or Pratyekabuddha our wholesome root is yet immature our intelligence still obscured and yet lacking in profound qualities our resoluteness still weak 
We may reflect as a mason or mason's apprentice who wants to build a palace of the size of the Vaijayanta palace and who takes its measure from measuring the car of sun or moon 
In truth and ultimately undeniable my friend such is done unto ourselves by this turn within and pandering to what is wantonly believed to be the sole needs and comforts of singularity and individual appeasement and while yet donning a cloak of austerity hereby yielding still only a mask of humilityand misleading and contrived wisdom 
So suppose a person who first sees a universal monarch and makes determinations from the signs of what is seen in his complexion shape beauty and majesty 
If the person were unable to make a distinction and then this one were to say to the commander of a fort just like this is the universal monarch in complexion shape beauty and majesty if this one were to in other words equate universal monarch with the commander of a fort would this be an intelligent thing to do 
The same applies to persons who avow themselves to this Bodhisattvavehicle and who in some future reject this perfection of wisdom and seek for allknowledge through sutras associated with level of Sravaka as Disciple or Pratyekabuddha 
This also is seen as done to these ones by Mara 
On the contrary I certainly do not say Bodhisattvas seek for allknowledge through the Sutras associated with the level of Sravaka as Disciple or Pratyekabuddha Bodhisattvas certainly do not go forth to reveal supreme enlightenment unless trained in what Tathagatas have announced in the perfection of wisdom as the skill in means of these Bodhisattvas 
Here now Subhuti Tathagatas seeing this advantage in perfection of wisdom by manifold methods show this to Bodhisattvas instigate and introduce these ones to this fills these with enthusiasm about this make these rejoice at this entrusts these with this in the knowledge herein that any Bodhisattva may become irreversible to full enlightenment 
Subhuti do these Bodhisattvas appear to be very intelligent who having obtained and met with the irreversible the great vehicle and then again abandon this turn away from this and prefer an inferior vehicle 
If a starving man refuses superior and excellent food and prefers to eat inferior and stale food is he using the full potential of his intelligence 
Subhuti 
Just so Subhuti in the future some Bodhisattvas still refuse this perfection of wisdom and prefer the Sutras associated with the level of Sravaka the Disciple or Pratyekabuddha and still seek allknowledge through Sutras which welcome the level of Disciple or Pratyekabuddha 
Subhuti 
Also this is seen as being done to these ones by Mara 
A man who had got a priceless gem and who considered it equal to a gem of inferior value and quality is he using the full potential of his intelligence 
Subhuti 
Are these using the full potential of intelligence 
The Lord 
This also is seen as being done to such as these by Mara 
Subhuti Is it at all possible to write down perfection of wisdom 
It is also seen as a deed of Mara as one writes down perfection of wisdom this one either thinks this is perfection of wisdom which is written down or is not perfection of wisdom which is written down or one adheres to perfection of wisdom either in the letters or as something not in the letters 
Moreover Subhuti while these write down perfection of wisdom our minds are on all sorts of things 
places villages towns cities country districts nations royal cities pleasure groves preceptors tales robbers bathing places streets palanquins occasions for happiness occasions for fear women men neuters unsuitable situations mother and father brothers and sisters friends maternal relatives kinsmen chief wives sons and daughters houses food and drink clothes beds seats livelihood obligations occasions of greed hate and delusion on right times lucky times unlucky times on songs music dances poems plays treatise business jokes musical shows sorrows troubles andourselves 
These and other acts of attention Mara the Evil One is seen to arrange as perfection of wisdom is being indicated studied or merely written down and thus he is seen to cause obstacles and confusion of thought to Bodhisattvas 
This also Mara is seen as doing to him 
Moreover difficulties arise about gain honor robes almsbowl lodging and medicinal appliances for use in sickness or alternatively thoughts relishing gainhonor and fame torment Bodhisattvas which indicate explain repeat or merely write perfection of wisdom 
We recognize and avoid seeing these as deeds of Mara 
A Bodhisattva which remains without this more refined knowledge of distinction of the cognition of cognition of skill in means deeply spurns this true perfection of wisdom and seeks instead skill in means in the Sutras which accord with the limitations of Sravakas as Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas 
Secondly it may be that the pupil is quite diligent and aspires to engage to bear in mind indicate study spread or merely to write about this process of perfection of wisdom is clever intelligent and blest with good memory but the one who may guide moves into a different district or is unacquainted with main points unacquainted with details and without higher knowledge 
Or this guide may be untiring in possession of the higher knowledge inspired to indicate perfection of wisdom but the pupil set out for another district or is unacquainted with main points unacquainted with details without higher knowledge 
Further the guru may be a person who attaches weight to fleshly things to gain honor and robes while the pupil is a person of few wishes easily contented and quite detached 
This also causes discord when it is a question of training toward perfect wisdom or of copying this such as this is On the other hand a pupil may be full of faith inspired by merely hearing of the process of perfection of wisdom and of understanding the meaning of this liberal and generous but the lama has no faith is too easily satisfied and does not aspire to expound regarding perfection of wisdom 
Or the pupil may be full of faith and aspire to hear and to understand the meaning but it may be that the guru because some obstacle hinders access to Dharma does not have these Sutras or cannot fathom them a pupil would obviously be out of touch with a guide who has not obtained these 
Or again a guide may aspire to point out while a pupil is not singleminded and aspiring at least to hear this 
Further it may be that the pupil does not want to listen because hindered by sloth weighed down by bodily fatigue but the Rinpoche is willing to point out conversely any guide may although the pupil wants to listen not want to teach because hindered by sloth or physical fatigue 
Misdirection of Aim Moreover while beings write or indicate perfection of wisdom or train in the process someone comes along and belittles life in the hells in the animal world among the Pretas and Asuras saying so ill are all these forms of life so ill are all conditioned things do make an end to just this length of cloth and leave these beings to their fate This also is seen as a work of Mara 
One will do well here to end sensedesires in the world of sensedesires enter into the wellknown trances in the world of form and enter into the wellknown attainments in the formless world Considered in a view with wisdom all this is nothing but rebirth in suffering 
As any of these wise may come to understand all is thus devoid of eternity is impermanent and ill doomed to reversal now these may just here attain to the fruits of holy life from the fruit of a Streamwinner to Arhatship 
However let us now beware of meeting any further with such attainments which are really failures and which abound in suffering 
But nevertheless to some Bodhisattvas this is a source of anxiety  This also is seen as Mara doing this  More Discord between Lama and Pupil Furthermore the Lama may be a monk who is fond of solitude while the pupils prefer a communal life 
He tells them he will give this perfection of wisdom to any coming to where he is but not to any who do not 
And he yet still moves from there to a wilder place with beasts of prey snakes and robbers marked by drought and famine 
So you must be able to experience a great deal of suffering Thus he outwardly rejects these with a subtle device 
All the time he goes to see them he is kept very busy that way and refuses those prospective pupils on the ground that first of all there is someone I must go and see 
This also is a source of discord when this perfection of wisdom is being written and studied 
In such ways Mara appears to bestir himself to prevent people from learning studying teaching and writing this perfection of wisdom 
What O Lord is the reason why Mara is seen to make such great efforts and bestir himself to prevent by this or that device people from learning and studying this process of perfection of wisdom 
Perfection of wisdom is a beginningless and thus endless source of allknowledge of Buddhas the Lords which in its turn is the source of endless devotion of Tathagatas which leads immeasurable and incalculable beings to dissolve their defilements and obscurations by this simple revelation 
So to any having dissolved their defilements Mara is seen as not being able to gain entry and this gives him cause for distress and being dispirited and the dart of sorrow is realized as having vexed him 
In consequence as the process of this perfection of wisdom is being written and studied he is seen as making in his great tribulation a tremendous effort bestirring himself and with this or that device to attempt to prevent the study of this perfection of wisdom 
Mara the Evil One is seen moreover as coming along in a guise of a Sramana a religious mendicant and attempting to cause dissent In order to dissuade the ones born of good family who have but recently set out in the vehicle he will say This is not the great perfection of wisdom which your Honors listen to As it has been handed down in my Sutras as it is included in my Sutras such is the perfection of wisdom 
Thus it is seen as some 'him' or an 'other' attempting to sow doubts in the minds of the Bodhisattvas having but recently set out in the vehicle whose intelligence is usually not too expansive but rather sluggish and limited who are usually lacking in vision and whose enlightenment in any future is not as yet predicted 
Seized by doubt these will not learn study or write this perfection of wisdom 
This also is seen as Mara doing this to them 
Moreover Mara may be seen as coming along in guise of a Buddha with magically created monks around him and maintain that some Bodhisattva coursing in profound Dharmas is one who realizes the realitylimit and should be happy to become a Disciple and NOT a Bodhisattva as this Bodhisattva certainly has 
This also is seen as one of Mara's deeds 
Subhuti when this perfection of wisdom is being written and studied Mara the Evil One produces these deeds which I mention as well as many others 
So it is O Lord 
Whatever is very precious this provokes much hostility 
One can herein expect as a rule many obstacles will arise to this perfection of wisdom 
When overawed by these obstacles someone becomes lazy one can come to know that those people who decide not to learn study and write this perfection of wisdom are people who are seen as beset by Mara have but recently set out in the vehicle their intelligence is small sluggish limited and perverted  and their thought refuses to function in these very sublime dharmas 
The Lord 
So it is Subhuti 
And while it is true that these deeds of Mara which we see as such are bound to arise a great many agencies will arise in their turn which oppose the faults of Mara 
As she falls ill we each do whatever is possible to prevent this mother from dying to keep her alive as long as possible to keep any unpleasantness away from her body 
We now look directly to her give her anything to ease her discomfort and suffering protect her well make much of her and we hope she is free from pain derived from contact with eyes ear nose tongue body or mind or coming from wind bile phlegm or a disorder of the humours or from stinging insects mosquitoes or crawling animals from beings or from ghosts from anything falling upon her or tearing her asunder or from a disastrous crash 
In this way we honor our mother by giving her all this which may ease her suffering allow for her to know how dear she is cherish and protect her as we are aware she is our mother and begetter who in her own great pain brings us into this world and instructs us always in the way of this world 
And these Tathagatas which also dwell in other world systems just now for the weal and happiness of all with great compassion for all and for the weal and happiness of this great body of beings with compassion as this absolute sameness of all beings these bring this perfection of wisdom to mind and are of great zeal as this perfection of wisdom is lasting as it is not destroyed as what's seen as Mara and his host cannot prevent this perfection of wisdom from being taught written and practiced 
So fond are Tathagatas of this perfection of wisdom as much do these cherish and protect its process of perfection 
As her perfection do Tathagatas appear 
As her perfection begets indicates and realizes pure cognition as allknowing this perfection indicates to us and as us this world as it is This allknowledge of Tathagatas appears as her most profound perfection 
How does perfection of wisdom instruct Tathagatas in this world and what is this the Tathagatas call 'world' The Lord 
Subhuti How do five skandhas come to be shown up by perfection of wisdom of Tathagatas or what is shown up by her 
These five skandhas are emptiness as to any ownbeing and devoid of any ownbeing and sameness inasmuch as can be said with any meaning whatsoever of emptiness so can neither crumble nor crumble away 
As this sense this perfect wisdom instructs these Tathagatas in this world 
As emptiness can neither crumble nor crumble away so the Signless the Wishless the Uneffected the Unproduced Nonexistent and allcompleteness of any Realm of Dharma 
How Tathagatas Know Thoughts of All Beings Moreover Subhuti due to this perfection of wisdom Tathagatas quite naturally know immeasurable and incalculable beings as these really are 
Eventually this 'pinnacle' awareness comes about as allknowledge 
This naked realization is of an objectless and purely undifferentiated experience of this uniform nonexistence of any individualized or collective ownbeing within any sentience whatsoever 
Again Tathagatas are naturally aware of thoughts and actions of immeasurable and incalculable beings since 'here' or anywhere in anytime or in anyway for any beings is no real existence 
And even still Tathagatas again due to this perfection of wisdom are naturally aware of the collected thoughts of countless beings as only 'collected thoughts' 
And how do Tathagatas come to be cognizant of this 
This is naturally cognized for as pure awareness this collectedness of thought is realized as equivalent to extinct for any thing called singular lone or individual thought etc speaking also in terms which are 'thought of' as having an existential basis and from some 'point of view' in existence does not exist and is purely cognized as notother than already as infinitely absolute by Tathagatas 
For even as in this consideration of 'the one divided into many' in truth what is this dreamed of 'one anything' other than as a basis  from which to determine its singularity 
This 'one' all 'ones' are exactly identical as being only an instantaneous reflection of an inexplicable and spontaneous interdependence merely seeming to be individuated by habits coming to be established from beyond any thought or knowledge of this process of reification hereby 'creating' first of all this duality called thought itself  so as to attempt to determine some separateness of an illusion of even this nonexistent onenessan appearing of some thing from the essentially pure infinite spaceawareness as ground of any and all being 
Suchness is a wholeness at once of space and primordial awareness 
Here is neither one nor parts of one neither many individual ones nor none 
Tathagatas are cognizant of and realize the infinite and inexhaustible mind of being of beness 
Tathagatas are aware as compassion 
All beings are understood for as cognizant mind these buddhas naturally realize immeasurable nonextinction of space as immeasurable nonextinction of mind 
Tathagatas realize obscurred minds and the cause of obscuration 
Such as Tathagatas realize these minds of people are not actually obscurred by perverted views which as nothing other than wrong ideas are also not sustainedTathagatas realize unobscure thoughts 
Tathagatas realize slack thoughts as well as the reasoning by which they occur 
Tathagatas cognize tensely active thoughts as these are A Tathagata realizes these thoughts are exerted so as to win dispassion and these can no longer be exerted when nothing is left which can be seized upon 
Tathagatas realize thought as this is merely as this might seem 
Anyone merely aware comes to realize as an outflow any thought is nonexistent 
Tathagatas realize any thoughts such as these merely seem to be yet are not as these are 
Tathagatas realize a greedy mind is not mind as empty awareness as mind is not a greedy mind 
Tathagatas realize 'any' mind as free from greed 
Such as these realize any mind as with thoughts of greed is not a greedy mind as thought of greed and even mind nonexist as 'true reality' as mind which forsakes greed is not greed nor even mind as detached from greed Tathagatas naturally realize minds as greedy and as free from greed 
These realize in the same manner minds as hateful and as free of hate as deluded as well as without delusion 
Tathagatas as awareness realize any thoughts of beings 
Tathagatas realize thoughts as not joined to this world of appearance as these do not appear as the world of appearance 
Tathagatas realize extensive or abundant thoughts 
Tathagatas realize thoughts neither diminish nor increase as thoughts can not depart 
Tathagatas realize thoughts as neither great as this which these may be nor lacking as this which these may not 
For here any thought which is thought of as 'here' is no thought nor other nor even awareness as present 
Tathagatas realize thought without limitation as such lean on nothing 
As primordial emptinessawareness Tathagatas realize reacting thoughts as emptiness and as devoid of objective support as these are of subjective sustanence 
Tathagatas realize nonreacting thoughts without 're'occupation as nondual as neither having any ownself nor other against which to react 
Tathagatas realize lower  thoughts as no selfconceited imagining 
Tathagatas realize supreme  thoughts as unimpeded just as the least thought is neither apprehended nor ignored 
Tathagatas realize unconcentrated thoughts as attached to differences  for any such thoughts cannot achieve synthesis due to these being unconcentrated 
Tathagatas realize concentrated thoughts as neither same nor different from dharma for distractions dissolve revealing synthesis and increasingly concentrated and rarified thoughts are like unto space 
Tathagatas realize this which appears as unemancipated thought is already now emancipated as these are nonexistent as 'ownbeing' 
Tathagatas realize emancipated thoughts as these cannot grasp any thought of any past nor of any future or even any present as thought is not even present 
Tathagatas realize imperceptible thoughts as neither here nor perceived as reality as such cannot be discerned for even as such thought being discerned falls short of perfect reality and such cannot be grasped  not by the eye of wisdom not by the heavenly eye how much less by the fleshly eye since it does not come within the range of any of these eyes Furthermore Tathagatas naturally realize tendencies of countless beings to make positive and negative statements about objects 
How do any beings discern dependence on these skandhas of these positive and negative statements 
If we take such statements as Tathagatas continue to exist after death and Tathagatas do not continue to exist after death and Tathagatas do and do not continue to exist after death and Tathagatas neither do nor do not continue to exist after death these statements refer to these skandhas known as 'Tathagatas' only and these statements have no basis in the true reality of Tathagatas 
Eternal are self and the world just that is the truth everything else is delusion And so if one maintains either self and the world are noneternal are both eternal and noneternal neither eternal nor noneternal such statements still refer merely to these skandhas 
Or similarly if one maintains that self and the world are finite or not finite or both finite and not finite or neither finite nor not finite 
Or finally if one says that which is the soul that is the body or one thing is the soul another the body all these statements refer only to skandhas 
It is a result of perfection of wisdom  these Tathagatas realize these positive and negative statements for what these are 
This is how and why as a result of perfection of wisdom  these positive and negative statements are realized as these are 
It is thus Tathagatas reveal to realization Suchness of Tathagatas as of skandhas as Suchness of positive and negative statements 
And just as this is Suchness of skandhas as well is this Suchness of worlds 
As this is said by Tathagatasthese five skandhas are reckoned as world So here Subhuti as such is Suchness of skandhas such is Suchness of these worlds as such is Suchness of this world such is Suchness of all dharmas as such is Suchness of all dharmas such is Suchness as fruit of a Streamwinner so on up to 
as such is Suchness of Pratyekabuddhahood such is Suchness of Tathagatas 
As a result Suchness Suchness of Tathagatas of skandhas of dharmas of holy Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas is just Suchness without a trace of variety such as positivity and negativity as nothing beyond even one nondifferent nonextinguishable unaffected nondual nor with even a question of duality 
In humbleness and compassion of perfection of wisdom Suchness as Tathagatas is neither realized nor not realized as Such is as Suchness 
Thus Tathagatas reveals this world to this infatuated world  preoccupied as unreasoned passion 
Any irreversible Bodhisattvas or Arhats whose right intentions are fulfilled or persons whom achieve as right views these fathomless stations described by Tathagatas as Suchness as Tathagata are enlightened as these 
So it is Subhuti 
Suchness as Tathagatas fully neither do nor do not 'realize' is inexhaustible as Tathagatas are purely aware  of Suchness as such and can describe Suchness as inexhaustiblefor Suchness neither fully 'realized' nor notis infinitely pure awareness  
Fathomless Marks and How They are Fastened So now headed by Sakra Chief of Gods the Gods of the realm of sensedesire and of the realm of form and twenty thousand of the Gods of the realm of Brahma have come to see the Lord salute his feet with their heads and standing to one side these ask 
As fathomless dharmas are revealed how O Lord are the marks fixed onto these 
Marks are fixed on to the fact these fathomless dharmas are empty signless wishless  not brought together not produced not stopped not defiled not purified so as such these nonexist beyond even samsara and nirvana as does also this realm of Dharma and Suchness 
These marks are not fixed on by Tathagatas as these cannot be reckoned among skandhas As these are not dependent on skandhas such are not fixed on by Gods Nagas nor any beings and these cannot be shaken off by the world with its Gods beings and Asuras 
For even this world with its Gods beings and Asuras has just this mark 
The Gods 
The Lord Well said and this is true O Gods 
In accordance with what stands out just as such Tathagatas describe this reality as such Tathagatas fully realize it As such are Tathagatas called 'Tathagata' 
With this process of perfection of wisdom are Tathagatas instructed within worlds 
As Tathagatas are spontaneously interdependent with dharma as also with this perfection of wisdom to this extent are these dharmas which stand without support fully realized by Tathagatas as these take their stand nowhere 
Tathagatas treat Dharma with respect revere worship and adore this as these realize this essential nature of dharma is just perfection of wisdom 
Just as allknowledge of Tathagatas is realized as perfection of wisdom Tathagatas are grateful and thankful for her 
With gratitude and thankfulness Tathagatas  favor and cherish this vehicle for such is this path by which these realize full enlightenment One knows this gratitude and thankfulness of Tathagatas In addition Tathagatas fully know all dharmas as neither made  nor unmade as not brought together 
This is another aspect of the fact this perfection of wisdom simultaneously instructs Tathagatas in this world 
But how can perfect wisdom instruct Tathagatas in this world if all dharmas are unknowable and imperceptible 
All dharmas are indeed unknowable and imperceptible as these are empty and cannot lean on anything It is thus all these dharmas are as perfect wisdom fully known by Tathagatas 
Another reason also perfection of wisdom can be regarded as the instructress of Tathagatas in this world is that none of the skandhas is viewed 
Subhuti How can here be a nonviewing of form feeling perception impulse or consciousness 
As in this continuum arises merely an apparent act of consciousness which has no skandhas as objective support here this nonviewing of form etc takes place 
But just this nonviewing of the skandhas is viewing of the world 
This is the way in which this world is viewed by Tathagatas 
She shows this world as empty unthinkable calmly quiet As purified of itself she shows up the world she makes it known she indicates it yet does nothing 
So it is Subhuti 
How and why does this come to be an unthinkable enterprise 
Unthinkable is Tathagatahood Buddhahood  spontaneous selfexistence which is at all times empty of any self or notions whatsoever truly as this state of allknowledge yet still comes to be revealed as such 
Why is it this incomparable enterprise 
Why is it immeasurable 
Why is it incalculable 
Why is any enterprise equal to such as this unequalled 
Nothing can equal Tathagatas as fully Enlightened Ones as Selfexistent as Allknowing can anything be superior to such as these as totally equanimous 
The Lord 
Also the skandhas and also all dharmas are unthinkable As skandhas  regard or 'show up' as in relation to true essential nature here is neither thought nor volition nor any of these dharmas which constitute thought nor any comparing For and as this reason skandhas and all dharmas are also unthinkable and uncomparable 
These are also immeasurable as one cannot conceive of a measure of any nor all skandhas since such a measure cannot itself exist as a consequence of infinitude  
These are also equal to the unequalled as all dharmas are space 
So do you think Subhuti here even exists any sameness or counting or measure or comparison or thought or any dharma which might even constitute thought 
In like manner Dharma is unthinkable incomparable immeasurable incalculable equal to nothing even such as no equalas Tathagatadharma Tathagatadharma is unthinkable as all thought is as naught is incomparable as such is beyond all comparison Words such as 'unthinkable' and 'incomparable' denote any and all objects as consciousness as do 'immeasurable' 'incalculable' and 'equal to the unequalled' Any measure calculation and sameness is as naught as Tathagatadharma is immeasurable incalculable equal to nothing as such has no equal 
This is immeasurable incalculable equal to nothing as this immeasurableness and incalculability is as space Dharma is incomparable as any sense as space is incomparable 
Spiritual Rebirth Resulting from This Knowledge As any doctrine of unthinkability etc is being taught the minds of hundreds of monks who are ripened are freed from the outflows without further clinging and so are the minds of two thousand nuns in similar ripeness 
The extinction of these four outflows constituted arhatship Six thousand lay brethren and three thousand lay sisters obtain the pure dispassionate unstained eye of Dharma 
Twenty thousand Bodhisattvas secure the patient acceptance of dharmas which fail to be produced The Lords have predicted these to secure enlightenment in this very Bhadrakalpa  
Certainly as a great venture this is set upon 
Allknowledge is entrusted to perfection of wisdom and so is these levels of a Pratyekabuddha and the level of all the Disciples 
An anointed king a Kshatriya who feels strong and secure in his kingdom entrusts all his business concerning his kingly office and the city and the kingdom to his minister and he himself has few cares and his burden is light 
Just so whatever dharmas of Buddhas Pratyekabuddhas or Disciples may be possible are all entrusted to the perfection of wisdom 
It is the perfection of wisdom which in these does the work 
Subhuti In what way is perfection of wisdom set upon so one cannot take hold of this state of allknowledge nor settle down in this 
Do we view Arhatship as any real dharma which we could take hold of or settle down in 
So it is Subhuti 
Reaction of the Gods So nowthe Gods of the realm of sensedesire and of the realm of form said to the Lord 
Unfathomable O Lord is this perfection of wisdom hard to see hard to understand 
Bodhisattvas who resolutely believe in this unfathomable perfection of wisdom fulfill their duties in accord with Jinas of any time must have planted wholesome roots continuously 
If O Lord all the beings in this great trichiliocosm for an aeon or the remainder of an aeon course as any stage of a Faithfollower on the other hand someone for one day only is finding pleasure in patient acceptance of this unfathomable perfection of wisdom and as one searches this as one reflects on this weighs this up investigates this and is meditating on this this latter being unveils realization of view and knowledge as all these things 
With these words they saluted the Lord's feet with their heads thrice walked round the Lord decided to go away from this presence of the Lord took friendly leave of him and moved away Before these had not gone far yet these disappeared from sight and these Gods of the realm of sensedesire departed for the world of sensedesire and these Gods of the realm of form departed for the Brahmaworld 
Future and Past Rebirths Subhuti As a Bodhisattva on merely hearing this immediately believes in this unfathomable perfection of wisdom does not become cowed stolid paralysed or stupefied does not doubt or hesitate but delights to perfect wisdom where does one decease where is one reborn 
Is a Bodhisattva which is endowed with just these qualities crossed in other Buddhafields just as being reborn here 
It is possible any Bodhisattva which is endowed with these qualities is just as being reborn here crossed in other Buddhafields as such honors and questions Buddhas and Lords 
This may be as such honors Maitreya the Bodhisattva and persistently questions him concerning this perfection of wisdom 
Past Deeds of a Bodhisattva Who Fails in Perfect Wisdom On another hand as any Bodhisattva past or present hears this unfathomable perfection of wisdom and yet asks no questions or so doing listens not to any reply this one may be reborn among people and hear this unfathomable perfection of wisdom being taught hesitates and is stupefied and cowed this is one of these who are unwilling to ask questions and listen 
Any Bodhisattva again may have had or does have a right attitude to this unfathomable perfection of wisdom for one two three four or five days and for a certain time has faith in this but again is withdrawn and no longer feels like asking questions about nor listening to this 
It is a fact such a Bodhisattva has not or does not all the time ask questions about nor listen to and pursue this unfathomable perfection of wisdom and as such one may at one time feel urged to pursue and hear this fathomless perfection of wisdom but not so at other times urged to pursue and listen such a one again falls from faith and is disheartened as intelligence is unsteady like cotton wool 
Such a Bodhisattva has but lately set out in the vehicle 
In other words one no longer takes up this perfection of wisdom nor pursues it 
Such a one moves on either of two levels on the level of a Disciple or on the level of a Pratyekabuddha 
Four Similes As a ship is wrecked in the middle of the ocean people die in the water without getting to shore unless these find support on a log or plank or any floating object 
These who manage to gain such support do not die in the water this being so safely and unhindered these cross over to a shore beyond and stand unhurt and uninjured on firm ground 
Different is this case for any Bodhisattva of full faith which accepts this patiently develops a taste for this as full aspiration vigour vigilance resolve earnest intention renunciation a title which is respected joyous zest elation serene confidence affection in this and persistence to realize full enlightenment which gains support as perfection of wisdom in realizing this perfection of wisdom one stands in allknowledge 
As one uses a badly baked jar to carry water in this jar does not last long and actually quickly falls to pieces and melts away 
In its unbaked condition this jar actually soon comes to an end on the ground 
Likewise although any Bodhisattva obtains all these qualities enumerated above from faith to a persistent aspiration for enlightenment as one does not take hold of perfection of wisdom and skill in means one is bound to come to a bad fall in the middle of a bad road in other words one falls on this level of a Disciple or Pratyekabuddha 
But as one which carries water from a river or lake or pond or well or any waterbearing place in a wellbaked jar a jar such as this with the water gets safely and uninjured to the house simply due to the wellbaked condition of this jar 
Just so any Bodhisattva which develops not only these qualities enumerated above but which in addition takes hold of perfection of wisdom and skill in means does not in the middle of a bad road incur a fall and unhurt and uninjured stands in allknowledge 
A person who is exercising little intelligence launches into the water a seafaring vessel which was not caulked or repaired and had been tied to its moorings for a long time overloads it with goods and climbs on board and sets out on it 
This ship is doomed to collapse before it has conveyed the goods across the water When this ship bursts asunder this merchant exercising little intelligence who is unskilled in means loses a huge fortune a great source of wealth 
Just so a Bodhisattva with all the qualities enumerated above but lacks perfection of wisdom and skill in means without realizing the wealth of allknowledge collapses midway incurrs a fall this Bodhisattva loses a great deal of wealth and has also lost a great deal of wealth for others having lost allknowledge which is a huge fortune and a great source of wealth not to mention the collapse in the middle of the bad road resulting in realization unto the level of Disciple or Pratyekabuddha 
An intelligent merchant on the other hand constructs a solid ship and launches it with proper care into the water loads it with goods and distributes these evenly and with a favourable wind this vessel gradually sails to the country which is the goal of this voyage This ship does not collapse in the water it goes to as it is meant to go and the merchant will win great wealth in the shape of worldlike jewels 
Likewise as any Bodhisattva of peerless faith and these other qualities enumerated above in addition is taken hold of by perfect wisdom through her perfection and does not lack skill in means one such as this does not collapse in the middle of a bad road does not incur a fall and stands fully enlightened like unto Suchness 
As any person is aged even advanced in years physically weakened say one hundred and twenty years old and as one falls ill in one's body could one rise from one's bed without being taken hold of by others 
And as one such as this does rise from one's bed this one has not the strength to walk even for half a mile 
Likewise as any Bodhisattva as having developed all these qualities enumerated above does not oneself come to be magnetized by perfect wisdom through her perfection and lacks skill in means although set out for full enlightenment one such as this nevertheless collapses in the middle of a road and incurrs a fall as this one produces subtle obscurities and now realizes the level of Disciple or Pratyekabuddha 
Sohere now as two strong beings take hold of this old and sick being and carefully lift this one up and promise this one may go wherever this one wishes and as far as this one wishes as these are assisting this one and one does not fall along this way to the place one is headed to 
In this same way a Bodhisattva of peerless faith etc and which is assisted by perfect wisdom and her perfection and endowed with skill in means does not collapse in the middle of a road does not incur a fall and is able to reach this station ie 
How does a Bodhisattva which is just beginning stand in perfect wisdom 
Such a Bodhisattva tends to loves and honors good friends 
Any good friends are such as instruct and admonish this Bodhisattva in perfection of wisdom and such as expound its meaning These expound this perfection as follows 
Achieve generosity guard morality perfect patience and exert with vigour enter into concentration  or mastery of perfection in wisdom  all this turn over for no reason 
Do not misconstrue full enlightenment as form or any skandhas 
Intangible also is allknowledge 
Neither long for nor settle in any levels as for instance of Sravaka as Disciple or Pratyekabuddha It is thus Subhuti a Bodhisattva beginning gradually through these good friends enters into the perfecting of wisdom by through and from her unlimited and all permeating perfectness 
How a Bodhisattva Helps Beings Subhuti 
Bodhisattvas survey these highly painful worlds of beings These aspire to realize full enlightenment and still these do not tremble at birthanddeath 
So it is 
Doers of what is difficult are these Bodhisattvas which set out for the benefit and happiness of worlds out of compassion 
 We are a shelter for worlds a refuge a place of rest a complete relief islands lights and leaders of worlds We equanimously reveal full enlightenment and resort to these worlds  with these words these ones make diligent efforts to realize such full enlightenment 
How is any Bodhisattva awakened to full enlightenment and come to be the shelter of worldsThese bring to light the nature of suffering and even by doing this so offer protection from sufferings which belong to these deep skandhas of birthanddeath 
How does this nonembracing come about 
Nonembracing comes about or more accurately is realized regarding form feeling perception impulse and consciousness and is the same as in any skandhas  What comes to be revealed is an inherent nonarising and uniform nonsustainability from which is nonproduction and so nonstopping As no thing whatsoever CAN BE revealed in or of any beginning how could any such thing stop 
One thus learns not to even think to embrace anything as a result of this cognition and visionNonembracing is already established as of itself and timelessly selfexistent 
If form etc and all dharmas  are beyond mere appearance as such these Bodhisattvas fully know and realize all dharmas as here is no discrimination between them 
So it is 
Through this nondiscrimination are all dharmas fully known to Bodhisattvas 
This also is most difficult yet effortless as Bodhisattvas meditate on all dharmas  and neither realize  nor are cowed and these meditate thus 
How are these the islands of worlds 
'Islands' are pieces of land limited by water as rivers or great lakes 
Just so form etc is only limited at its perceived beginning and end and so are all dharmas This limitation of all dharmas is the same as this Calm Quiet this Sublime as Nirvana as this which is Really Existing the Unperverted or Undifferentiated 
Here these Bodhisattvas once having come to realize full enlightenment cannot help but to reveal it's light and susequent knowledge to help dispell this dark obscurity and defiled gloom of noncognizance from beings who for long are enveloped as the membrane of this eggshell of ignorance and overcome by darkness so these illuminate these beings through wisdom 
As these are enlightened Bodhisattvas demonstrate Dharma in order to reveal this absence of production and stopping as but one attribute of infinite quintessential nature of skandhas and also as these very same dharmas which constitute and distinguish ordinary people Sravakas as Disciples Pratyekabuddhas Bodhisattvas and Buddhas indeed all dharmas which are no dharma yet uniform in essence and no thing in general 
As these are enlightened Bodhisattvas demonstrate Dharma by teaching these skandhas are situated as one and the same as this space of worlds 
All dharmas exist in equal balance and exchange as and with space This does not come this does not go this is the same as space Space neither comes nor goes is neither made nor unmade nor affected space neither stands up to nor as such does space last nor endure such is neither produced nor stopped 
The same is true of all dharmas which are as this fashion of space indiscriminate 
As this emptiness of skandhas neither comes nor goes neither does this emptiness of dharmas for dharmas are situated as emptiness and situated as such these dharmas do not depart 
These are situated as signless wishless ineffective as nonproduction nobirth nonarising as absence of relativity and polarity as dream and self as this boundless as this calm quiet as Nirvana as this Unrecoverable these neither come nor go and are situated as immobility these are situated as form etc  and also as full enlightenment of Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas 
Who can understand this perfection of wisdom 
Subhuti 
Bodhisattvas so situated as these fully know this resort these demonstrate and show this as available to all beings 
So it is Subhuti 
Subhuti 
A doer of what is difficult is any Bodhisattva which arms oneself with this armor To immeasurable and incalculable beings I indicate Nirvana The Lord 
This armor of such a Bodhisattva is however not connected with skandhas nor is it put on for any sake of form feeling perceptions impulses or consciousness It is not connected with any level of Sravakas as Disciples or Pratyekabuddhas or any Buddha nor put on for any ownself nature 
Three standpoints one does not aspire to as a Bodhisattva which is armed with this great armor and which courses thus in unfathomable wisdom 
Which three 
For what reason do you say this 
The Lord 
So it is as you say any Bodhisattva making adjustments toward unfathomable and perfect wisdom is regarded as irreversible unto realization Now as such a Bodhisattva does not and can not settle down within unfathomable and perfect wisdom nor in the declarations or counsels of others one does not merely go by 'someone else' whom one puts one's trust in As fathomless perfection of wisdom is taught one is not cowed or stolid nor does one turn one's back one does not tremble nor manifest fright or terror one does not hesitate nor doubt nor get stupefied but one is immersed in and fully saturated is resolutely intent and delights in being totally permeated in and by this vision and hearing One knows in a former life already one explores perfection of wisdom 
By means of what mode does any Bodhisattva which does not tremble as this unfathomable perfection of wisdom is taught apperceive perfect wisdom 
How does one apperceive such a series of thoughts 
The Lord 
As a series of thoughts which indicate space are prone to space steadily yield nonsubstance as space 
And why 
Full awareness is immeasurable and unlimited 
What is immeasurable and unlimitedthis is not form nor any skandha This is not attainment nor reunion nor getting anywhere not any path nor its fruit not cognition nor consciousness no genesis nor destruction nor production or passing away or stopping neither development nor annihilation Such is not made by anything nor does this come from anywhere such does not go to anywhere as such does not stand in any place or spot 
On the contrary such can merely be indicated as immeasurable unlimited As immeasurable infinite space is immeasurable full or infinite awareness 
This is immeasurableness as such does not nay cannot lend itself to being fully known by anything be it form or any skandha or any of these six perfections 
This thought of Tathagatas which considers this depth of dharma and who seated on this terrace of enlightenment has just realized full enlightenment is inclined to carefree nonaction and not to demonstration of dharma 
The Lord 
So it is 
It is wonderful O Lord it is astonishing O WellGone 
Identical with space this dharma is beyond even ultimacy marked with nonobstruction as no trace can be purely cognized of such prior to during or after any dharma which is indicated only by what's best described as objective observation and appearance 
Born as this image of the Lord is Disciple holy Subhuti this Elder 
Subhuti As he is not born is Subhuti the Elder born as this image of Tathagata 
He is born as this reflection of Tathagatas Suchness As neither coming nor going so Subhuti of Suchness neither comes nor goes With nothing whatsoever to establish any beginning Subhuti the Elder simply is this Tathagatas Suchness Suchness as Tathagata and Suchness as all dharmas is this same thingthese are 'both' Suchness and same as Subhuti this Elder 
This image as Subhuti the Elder is Suchness hence this same manner of Tathagatas 
It is in this sense Elder Subhuti is emanated as this image of Tathagatas as a result of the nonestablishable order of Suchness of Tathagata 
Subhuti's Suchness is immutable and unchangeable undiscriminated and undifferentiated Suchness of Tathagatas 
Thusly Subhuti this Elder immutable unchangeable undiscriminated undifferentiated through this Suchness is this very image of any and all Tathagata 
So again just as this Suchness of Tathagatas immutable and undifferentiated is nowhere obstructed so also Suchness of all dharmas is immutable and undifferentiated 
Suchness of Tathagatas and this Suchness of all dharmas are infinite and unlimited Suchness neither two nor any division of any one is possible 
A nondual Suchness however is nowhere is 'from' nowhere 'belongs to' nowhere 
It is as it is Suchness belonging nowhere it is nondual Here through nonproducible Suchness this Elder Subhuti is emanated even as nonimage of all Tathagatas Nonproducible Suchness however is no time not Suchness  and nondual It is in this nonsense  Elder Subhuti emanates as any and all imagery of 'the race' of Tathagatas beyond any and all phenomena 
As Suchness of Tathagata is undiscriminated and undifferentiated at all times and in all dharmas so Suchness of the Emanant Subhuti 
For this reason although this seems a duality in which Subhuti has been conjured up from Suchness of Tathagatas nevertheless nothing is lopped off 'from' any Suchness which as unbound infinity devoid even of any center or direction remains perfect and unbroken as one cannot apprehend any real OR imagined outside agent which could break such apart 
As Suchness of Tathagata cannot be other than or outside Suchness of any and all dharmas so also Suchness of Subhuti So also whatever is or appears as outside Suchness of dharmas this is nothing which is not also Suchness Suchness of Subhuti is here just the same as Suchness of all dharmas Suchness of all Tathagatas 
As such an emanated image of Suchness is Subhuti called emanated such as Tathagatas It is also by and as Suchness of Tathagatas  he conforms to Suchness 
It is just through Suchness of Tathagatas he conforms to any 'past' Suchness as it is also through any 'past' Suchness he conforms to Suchness of Tathagatas Likewise with future and present dharmas as Suchness 
It is through Suchness of Tathagatas he conforms to any such 'thing' as past future and present Suchness and it is through any past future and present Suchness he conforms to Suchness of Tathagatas 
In this sameness of elucidation Suchness of Subhuti and any past future and present Suchness and Suchness of the Tathagatas are not two nor any division such as any past future or present 
Suchness of any and all dharmas and Suchness of Subhuti are anywhere or as anyway not two nor any division 
The Earth Shakes and Many Are Saved As this disquisition of Suchness of the Tathagatas takes place the great earth shakes in six ways stirs quakes is agitating resounding and tumbling as Tathagata remove any obstruction to full enlightenment Subhuti 
It is thus O Gods Subhuti the Elder is emanates as this formless form of Tathagata 
So it is Sariputra 
Yet as this disquisition of Suchness is expounded the minds of three hundred monks are freed from the outflows without any further clinging 
Five hundred nuns obtain the pure dispassionate and unstained dharmaeye 
Five thousand Gods who in the past had made the necessary preparations acquire this patient acceptance of dharmas which fail to be produced 
And the minds of six thousand Bodhisattvas are freed from the outflows without any further clinging 
Perfect Wisdom and Skill in Means Sariputra knows the thoughts of these Bodhisattvas are free from the outflows without any further clinging and asks the Lord for the reason or cause of such 
These Bodhisattvas honor five hundred Buddhas and during all this time are generous disciplined perfecting patience exercise diligence and concentration 
And so although these gain this path of emptiness course in Signlessness put their minds to work on Wishlessness yet still wanting skill in means these realize the reality limit and come forth on the level of Sravaka Disciple or Pratyekabuddha still not coming forth toward the level of a Buddha 
Suppose here is a very huge bird one hundred or up to five hundred miles large but without any wings or with crippled or damaged wings 
This bird now wants to fly down to Jambudvipa from the Heaven of the Gods of Thirtythree In intermediate space the middle of its journey  to Jambudvipa it wants to return to the Gods of Thirtythree is it able to do so Sariputra No Lord 
And can it hope to come down on Jambudvipa without damage or injury Sariputra No Lord 
So it is Sariputra 
Even as a Bodhisattva after one raises one's mind to full enlightenment for countless aeons gives gifts shows discipline perfects patience exercises diligence and has excellent concentration how ever great this setting forth and this thought raised to full enlightenment as one is not upheld by perfect wisdom and lacks skill in means one is bound to fall on the level of Sravaka Disciple or Pratyekabuddha 
Furthermore Sariputra it may be as this Bodhisattva brings to mind and retains in one's mind  of the Buddhas and Lords past future and present the selfdiscipline the concentration the wisdom the emancipation the vision and cognition of emancipation but all this after the manner of a sign this sign being an object of attention a basis of recognition or some such occasion for entrancement This one now neither knows nor sees selfdiscipline of Tathagatas nor their concentration or wisdom or emancipation nor their vision and cognition of emancipation 
Ignorant of these blind to these one hears this word 'emptiness' treats this as a sign and wishes to covert  over into full enlightenment  As consequence such a one as this remains on the level of a Sravaka Disciple or Pratyekabuddha as the fact is this one is not upheld by perfect wisdom and as well does this one lack in skill in means both more silent than a whisper and a gentle wind from space providing innate guidance 
As I understand the meaning of the Lord's teaching although a Bodhisattva is joined to a huge carriage of merit as long as this one is not upheld by perfect wisdom and is without skill in means such a one lacks the good friend and this one's attainment of full enlightenment is uncertain 
So it is Sariputra 
Deep is this perfection of wisdom 
How is it the Lord says full enlightenment is difficult to know  exceedingly difficult to acknowledge as here is no one who can get at enlightenment 
All dharmas are empty 
This dharma for the forsaking of which dharma is demonstrated this dharma does not exist 
As well is this dharma which  might have been enlightened in full enlightenment and this which could have been enlightened and this which might have cognized  and this which could have cognized such all these dharmas are empty 
And Subhuti if full enlightenment were easy to win then countless Bodhisattvas would not turn away from this 
As countless Bodhisattvas do turn away from this here one can discern  full enlightenment is hard to win exceedingly hard to win 
But Sariputra does form feeling perception impulse or consciousness turn away from full enlightenment 
Sariputra No Subhuti 
Is this dharma which turns away from full enlightenment other than form etc 
Sariputra No Subhuti 
Sariputra No Subhuti 
Is this dharma which turns away from full enlightenment other than the Suchness of form etc 
Sariputra No Subhuti 
Does form etc know full enlightenment 
Sariputra No Subhuti 
Is the dharma which knows full enlightenment other than form etc 
Sariputra No Subhuti 
Does Suchness of form etc know full enlightenment 
Sariputra No Subhuti 
Is the dharma which knows full enlightenment other than the Suchness of form etc 
Sariputra No Subhuti 
Should form etc be known in full enlightenment or any dharma other than form etc 
Sariputra No Subhuti 
Sariputra No Subhuti 
Is some dharma which turns away from full enlightenment in Suchness 
Sariputra No Subhuti 
What Sariputra is this dharma which turns away from full enlightenment as we consider this as standing in this nature of dharmas which is just emptiness as so to is this manner of taking no stand in any dharma 
Is it perhaps Suchness is turned away 
Sariputra No Subhuti 
As one adopts this method of considering dharmas as ultimate reality which Subhuti the Elder uses in this exposition indeed here is no dharma which turns away from full enlightenment 
But now Venerable Subhuti here is no longer any ground for the distinction of these who set their hearts on enlightenment into three kinds of persons who differ with respect to the vehicle which these have chosen as described by the Tathagata 
First of all the Venerable Sariputra must ask the Venerable Subhuti the Elder whether he admits even one single kind of being whose heart is set on enlightenment and who uses either the vehicle of the Sravaka Disciples or that of the Pratyekabuddhas or the great vehicle 
Subhuti do you admit even one single kind of being whose heart is set on enlightenment and who uses either the vehicle of the Disciples or that of the Bodhisattvas or the great vehicle 
Sariputra do you see as Suchness of Suchness even one single being whose heart is set on enlightenment ie 
Suchness first of all is not apprehended as of three kinds how much less any being whose heart is set on enlightenment 
Sariputra Not so Subhuti 
Sariputra Not so Subhuti 
The Lord Well said Subhuti 
Through this might and sustaining power of Tathagata you are inspired to say this 
To which enlightenment O Lord will these Bodhisattvas go forth 
How does a Bodhisattva behave how does one train as one wants to go forth in realization to this full enlightenment 
The Bodhisattva adopts the same attitude towards all beings one's mind is even equanimous towards all beings one does not handle others with an uneven mind but with a mind which is friendly well disposed helpful free from aversion avoiding harm and hurt and handles others as if these were one's mother father son or daughter 
One takes the same stance in everything from the meditation on these truths to such a stage as one reaches certainty 
As a Bodhisattva this one is liberated from defilements and samsaric bondage and as one matures any and all beings instigates these to do the same and incites and encourages these 
What O Lord are any attributes tokens and signs of an irreversible Bodhisattva and how do we know any Bodhisattva is irreversible 
Thought as well all these are Suchness not two nor any one divided neither discriminated amongst nor undiscriminated between a Bodhisattva is revealed as within Suchness and not other than this nature of dharma 
Endowed with such attributes tokens and indications of Suchness a Bodhisattva may be borne in mind as irreversible from full enlightenment 
An irreversible Bodhisattva can not pander to Shramanas and Brahmins of 'other schools' telling these what anyone knows is worth knowing or what anyone sees is worth seeing 
A Bodhisattva pays no homage to strange Gods offers these no flowers incenses etc and cannot put one's trusts in these 
A Bodhisattva is no more reborn in places of woe nor does one ever again become a different sex 
As well Subhuti an irreversible Bodhisattva undertakes to observe the ten avenues  of wholesome action 
One observes as one instigates others to observe abstention from taking life abstention from taking what is not given abstention from wrong conduct as regards sensuous pleasures abstention from intoxicants as tending to cloud the mind abstention from lying speech abstention from malicious speech abstention from harsh speech abstention from indistinct prattling abstention from covetousness abstention from ill will abstention from wrong views 
It is true an irreversible Bodhisattva observes these ten ways of wholesome action and instigates any others to observe these incites and encourages these to do so establishes and confirms others in these 
Even in Bodhisattva dreams one never commits offenses against these ten precepts and one does not build on such offenses in one's mind Even in one's dreams an irreversible Bodhisattva keeps the ten wholesome paths of action present in mind 
Also as an irreversible Bodhisattva masters a text of dharma and offers this to others in mind one builds upon the welfare and happiness of all beings as such and one offers this gift of dharma in common to all beings with no distinction 
What's more as deep dharmas are taught a Bodhisattva is not hesitant is not perplexed is not doubtful is not stupefied One only says what is beneficial speaks gently and in moderation One exhibits little sloth and torpor and loses all latent biases to evil Whether one goes out or comes back this mind does not wander but one's mindfulness is fixed 
A Bodhisattvas robe is free from lice one's habits are clean one is rarely ill and afflictions are few 
In one's body these eighty thousand families of worms which are present in the bodies of other beings cannot at all develop as these wholesome roots insure one's place within this whole world 
Subhuti What is known as perfect purity of thought on the part of a Bodhisattva 
As these wholesome roots go on increasing in due course one gains a state of mind in which one developes few cares and is free from treachery deceit crookedness and craftiness 
In addition this perfect purity of thought also consists in transcending through and beyond levels of Sravaka Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas while yet facing these and being in perfect accord with any such ways still just as intent on mutuality and benevolence 
And what's more an irreversible Bodhisattva is not one to attach exclusivity to gain honor or fame or to robes alms bowl lodging or medicinal appliances for use in sickness 
All these dharmas one hears from others are united as perfection of wisdom and also all worldly arts and professions one unites thanks to this perfection of wisdom as this very nature of dharma 
Mara's Deeds So now Mara the Evil One is  the one conjuring up visions of the eight great hells with many hundreds many thousands many hundreds of thousands of Bodhisattvas in these and he says to an irreversible Bodhisattva These Bodhisattvas described by the Tathagata as irreversible are reborn in these great hells 
Just so you also since you are described as irreversible fall into these great hells Confess this this thought of enlightenment is an error 
As you act thus you are one who goes to heaven As the mind of the Bodhisattva does not waver is not put out is certain in one's knowledge an irreversible Bodhisattva cannot possibly be reborn against one's will in the hells this is another token of his irreversibility 
Even so Mara the Evil One is seen as coming along possibly in the guise of a Shramana and saying Give up what you hear up to now abandon what you gain so far As you follow this advice we again and again approach you and say to you 'What you hear just now is not the word of Buddha 
But what I here teach to you this is the teaching of Buddha this is the word of the Buddha' Upon hearing this as any Bodhisattva wavers and is put out one can know such is not predicted by the Tathagata this one is not fixed on full enlightenment  as this one does not stand firmly in this element of irreversibility 
But again even as one hears these words of Mara one does not waver but remains as this nature of dharma to Nonproduction to Nonstopping to the Unaffected this is not one of these who put their trust in others 
An Arhat a monk who has outflows dried up does not go by what is said by merely someone else whom one trusts in but has placed the nature of dharma directly before one's own eyesbefore or beyond anyone or anything whatsoeverand Mara is seen as having no access to one such as this 
Just so any irreversible Bodhisattva can neither be crushed nor inflated by beings belonging to the vehicle of Sravaka Disciples and Pratyekabuddha and one cannot by this very nature backslide into the level of Disciples or Pratyekabuddhas as any such as this are fixed on allknowledge and end up in perfect enlightenment 
It is quite certain any Bodhisattva who stands firmly in the element of irreversibility cannot possibly be led astray by others 
So someone may come to the irreversible Bodhisattva and say A journey in birthanddeath is this coursing in perfection of wisdom and not a journey of someone who is in quest of enlightenment 
If you put an end to all suffering in this very life you no longer experience all the sufferings and disappointments which are bound up with this plane of birthanddeath 
Aye surely in this very life already this personality of yours is finished so why do you think of taking upon yourself another one  Even now the Bodhisattva neither wavers nor is put out even as Mara himself appears to say to this one 
Just look at these Bodhisattvas which for countless aeons present the necessities of life  to Buddhas and Lords which lead holy lives in the presence of countless Buddhas which honor countless Buddhas and Lords and question these about just this vehicle of the Bodhisattvas asks these how a Bodhisattva should stand hear the answer of the Tathagatas and act on it 
In spite of the fact these stand course and exert as they do this very day these do not yet know full enlightenment 
How do you reach full enlightenment ever Even as one does not waver and is not put out then Mara the Evil One seems to conjure up some monks in this place and say These monks are Arhats with outflows dried up These who set out for enlightenment in the meantime have reached Arhatship and are established in it How do you ever reach full enlightenment It is quite certain any Bodhisattva must be irreversible from full enlightenment for as this is being said and expounded one's mind does not waver and is not put out 
As this mind of a Bodhisattva which hears from a stranger these discouraging remarks still does not become excluded from the true nature of dharma and one does not go back on it as one does not change one's mind as one recognizes these deeds of Mara as appearing for exactly what these are it is quite impossible for one which courses correctly in these perfections not to reach allknowledge Mara the Evil One cannot possibly gain entry to a Bodhisattva which not only courses but also trains oneself correctly which does not lack in these practices described by Tathagatas which is completely adjusted to this mental activity which is associated with these perfections 
As any Bodhisattva recognizes these deeds of Mara as one hears discouraging remarks from strangers one does not desist nor slide back nor change one's mind and one perceives these deeds of Mara for exactly what these are this is another token of irreversibility 
So now an irreversible Bodhisattva does not piece together a perception of skandhas ie 
As the irreversible Bodhisattva which through dharmas empty of their own marks definitely entered on this certainty of salvation as a Bodhisattva does not apprehend even this dharma we now behold so this one cannot piece it together or produce it 
One says here a Bodhisattva is irreversible as one patiently accepts the cognition of nonproduction This is another token of irreversibility 
More Tokens of Irreversibility So now an irreversible Bodhisattva is one inquiring even beyond and transcending any level of Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas and proceeding in a direction toward allknowledge 
According to plan one comes to first second third and fourth trance stages and dwells within absorbtion in these four trances One realizes complete mastery over these trances meaning one enters into trances but a future rebirth is not determined by their influence 
This also is known as a mark of irreversibility in irreversible Bodhisattvas 
Also an irreversible Bodhisattva does not attach weight to any name nor to renown title or fame 
One's mind remains undismayed and interested only in the welfare of all beings Whether one goes out or comes back one's mind does not wander and one remains ever mindful When one lives the life of a householder one has no great love for pleasant things and one does not want these too much For it is realized that it's with fear and disgust one possesses all pleasant things 
These incite all beings to realize this supreme happiness these worthy beings these great beings superbeings excellent beings splendid beings powerful of beings sublime beings valiant beings heroes of beings leaders of beings waterlilies of beings lotuses of beings thoroughbred beings Nagas of beings lions of beings trainers of beings 
It is in this spirit which Bodhisattvas live the life of householders in as much as these are impregnated with the power of perfection of wisdom and this is another token of their irreversibility 
So now Vajrapani the great Yaksha constantly follows behind the irreversible Bodhisattva 
Unassailable the Bodhisattva cannot be defeated by either men or ghosts 
So now Subhuti I'll indicate the attributes tokens and signs of an irreversible Bodhisattva 
One is not preoccupied with the kind of talk a person is fond of in society with talk about kings and robbers about armies and battles about villages  cities market towns countries kingdoms and capitals about oneself about ministers and prime ministers about women men and neuters about journeys parks monasteries palaces pools lakes ponds lotus ponds woods gardens and mountains about Yakshas Rakshasas Pretas Pishacas Kataputanademons and Kumbhandademons about food drink dresses ornaments perfumes garlands and ointments about roads crossroads streets markets palanquins and people about songs dances tales actors dancers and wandering singers about the ocean about rivers about islands 
These do not devote themselves to talk which obstructs dharma to the kind of talk which delights the common people but to talk on perfection of wisdom and these are people who do not lack in mental activities which are associated with allknowledge 
Furthermore as an irreversible Bodhisattva definitely terminated one's existence among the Gods whether these belong to the sphere of sensedesire or the sphere of form or the formless sphere one is turned over to just this middle region in Jambudvipa 
For in the border countries are only a few beings with a good knowledge of the arts of poetry of mantras of secret lore of the standard treatises of portents and of the meaning of religion but in the middle region these are turned to abundance 
Furthermore to an irreversible Bodhisattva it does not occur to ask oneself whether one is irreversible or not 
No question about it arises as one is not uncertain about the stage one made and one does not sink down below such 
Just as a Streamwinner has no hesitations or doubts about the fruit of a Streamwinner if that is the stage which is this one's right just so an irreversible Bodhisattva neither questions nor doubts about being on this stage of a Bodhisattva as this stage is one's right stage here is no uncertainties about this stage which is right nor does one sink below such 
A person who commits one of the deadly sins never again until one's death loses this thought of this action one cannot get rid of it or remove it but it follows after one until the time of one's death 
Just so this irreversible mind of an irreversible Bodhisattva learns to stand firm on this irreversible stage which is one's right and even this whole world with its Gods beings and Asuras cannot deflect divert or diverge such a one from this 
Anyone is sure to realize full enlightenment I stand firm on this stage which also I realize as such One can no longer be led astray by others and on the stage which is anyone's by nature one can neither be crushed nor inflated if one in one's nature adheres to the principle of Suchness in and as all and beyond even such as such is 
For as one stands firm on this one's mind is insuperable one's cognition is insuperable 
Suppose Mara the Evil One in the guise of Buddha himself were to come to this one and say Realize Arhatship in this very life You are not predestined to full enlightenment You have not the attributes tokens and signs with which a Bodhisattva must be endowed in order to realize full enlightenment 
Why now do you course in this If the Bodhisattva now experiences a change of heart one can know one is not predicted to full enlightenment by the Tathagatas of the past 
A Tathagata speaks to the effect as one not realizing only Arhatship and not otherwise as one sees and understands I see this surely is as Mara the Evil One who is manufacturing a magical double of the appearance of the Buddha and who wants to estrange any and all beings from supreme enlightenment and now at this Mara turns backthis Bodhisattva certainly in the past is predicted to full enlightenment by the Tathagatas and stands firmly in this irreversible Bodhisattva stage 
as one exudes these qualities so this one is predicted by Tathagatas in the past and stands firm on this irreversible Bodhisattvastage and as one exudes such attributes tokens and signs of an irreversible Bodhisattva this is another token of irreversibility 
In addition to thisan irreversible Bodhisattva gains this good dharma even as this costs one one's life and any belongings 
For a Bodhisattva which acquires this patient acceptance of dharmas which fail to produce or be productive or produced neither hesitates nor doubts as one hears about this unobstructed true nature of all dharmas 
Endowed with these virtues a Bodhisattva is irreversible 
This is wonderful O Lord how great and with what unlimited and measureless qualities a Bodhisattva is endowed 
The Lord 
So it is Subhuti 
Suchness comes to be realized as it's truth of centerlessness boundarylessness beginning and thus endlessness and to which Sravaka Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas as yet have no claim 
Subhuti 
As a Bodhisattva reflects ponders and meditates on these unfathomable positions which are connected through inconceivable perfect wisdom and strives to stand train and progress as is ordained described and explained in this perfection of wisdom  now as one may do so for say one day only how great the deed is which one does during this one day 
As a person moved by considerations of greed had made a date with a handsome attractive and goodlooking other person and as now this other person is held back by yet something or other and could not leave one's house what do you think Subhuti with what would this other person's preoccupations be connected 
Subhuti 
Does this person entertain many such ideas in the course of this day 
Many indeed O Lord 
Merit As one stands trains progresses meditates and strives as is ordained described and explained in this perfection of wisdom one's faults and obscuring defilements dissolve which are a turning away from full enlightenment 
As one Bodhisattva gives one's self up to devotion to perfect wisdom and does deeds for one day only while dwelling completely in mental activities connected with perfect wisdom and yet another Bodhisattva lacks connections with perfect wisdom but gives gifts for countless aeonsmore discretely refined attributes has the Bodhisattva which for one day only makes endeavours connected with perfect wisdom 
A Bodhisattva which for one day only makes endeavours connected with perfect wisdom begets merit other than the greatest merit of another Bodhisattva which for countless aeons gives and bestows gifts on all classes of holy persons from Streamwinners to Tathagatas  but lacks this discretion regarding perfect wisdom 
And as the other Bodhisattva not only bestows gifts as indicated but in addition observes these moral precepts but still lacks in connecting these with perfect wisdom this Bodhisattva which dwells in connection with perfect wisdom begets other merit as this one emerges from this mental work on perfect wisdom and demonstrates dharma 
Even as in addition the other Bodhisattva exerts vigour and makes endeavours about the trances and wings of enlightenment but is still lacking connections in perfect wisdoma Bodhisattva which as one gives this gift of dharma as said before turns this over to full enlightenment one such as this begets a different type of merit all together which benefits all sentient beings than the Bodhisattva which yet does not make such connections in perfect wisdom 
The merit of a Bodhisattva which not only gives this gift of dharma not only turns this over to full enlightenment but employs the kind of turning over which is being taught in this perfection of wisdom begets another type of merit indeedbeyond any reckonings whatsoever of 'greater or lesser' 
So as a Bodhisattva which does all this makes no further efforts than these visible and more tangible ones about it in meditative seclusion  this one's merit is very great perhaps yet still different than this merit of one which also makes effort about this in meditative seclusion and which in addition is taken hold of by perfect wisdom as coursing in her perfection and now is open in this meditative seclusion and is not devoid of perfect wisdom 
How can one say that one begets the greater merit since the Lord has described all accumulations as the result of false discrimination 
In this case also the accumulation of merit on the part of any Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom must be described as just empty worthless insignificant and unsubstantial 
To the extent any Bodhisattva goes on contemplating all dharmas in this manner to this extent this is one which does not lack affinities with perfect wisdom 
Is any distinction made or difference noticed between immeasurable and incalculable 
Subhuti Of what is this term immeasurable a synonym 
Are not all dharmas described as empty 
Yes and simply so as quite empty Tathagata describes all dharmas 
And being empty such are also inexhaustible of emptiness And what is emptiness is also immeasurableness So here and now according to ultimate reality neither distinction nor difference is apprehended between dharmas nor can any 'between' dharmas even begin to be assumed 
As talk these are described by Tathagata 
One merely talks as one speaks of immeasurable or incalculable or inexhaustible or of empty or signless or wishless or 'this Unaffected or Nonproduction nobirth nonexistence dispassion cessation Nirvana 
This exposition is being described by Tathagata as the consummation of demonstrations 
Can something truly have growth or diminution as it is beyond all distinctive words and even characteristics 
So it is Subhuti 
Here is certainly neither growth nor diminution of a perfectionentity 
A Bodhisattva coursing in perfection of wisdom who develops affinities toward perfect wisdom and comes to be skilled in means does obviously not think this perfection of giving grows this perfection of giving diminishes Rather such a one knows this perfection of giving is a mere word and a characteristic As one gives a gift one IS turning any and all 'merit' over thus 
One proceeds in this way as one takes upon oneself these moral obligations as one perfects oneself in patience  as one exerts diligence enters into the trances courses in perfection of wisdom AS one develops and maintains affinities to perfect wisdom 
So now what is this supreme enlightenment 
A Bodhisattva which repeatedly and often dwells in mental activities connected with Suchness dwells near supreme enlightenment and any such as these do not lose these mental activities 
This is certain as here can be neither growth nor diminution of any entity or dharma as such is beyond any and all words and even characteristics and here neither the perfections nor any dharmas can grow or diminish 
As a Bodhisattva realizes full enlightenment is this due to production of the first thought of enlightenment or due to the last thought of enlightenment 
These two acts of thought are nowhere synthesized  
How can any accumulation of a Bodhisattva's wholesome root take place 
What do you think Subhuti is this wick of this burning oil lamp burned up at the first incidence of the flame or at the last incidence of the flame 
Not so O Lord 
Is now this wick being definitely burned up 
No Lord 
Also once this thought thus produced is now past  is this due to its very nature doomed to stop 
As anything is due to its very nature doomed to stop is this destroyed 
Subhuti No Lord  
So as it comes to such a point as by its own nature it is doomed to stop will it now be destroyed 
As this essential nature of this thought involves neither production nor stopping is this now being stopped 
As any dharma is due to this essential original nature stopped already in its own being is this dharma being stopped 
Is now Suchness not in danger of being changed away from overtowering immobility 
Is here and now any thought in Suchness 
Is thought  Suchness 
Is thought other than Suchness 
Can you see a Suchness 
Such a one courses nowhere at all 
As coursing in ultimate reality does any Bodhisattva course in a sign 
Is this sign to the Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom something which is undone by one's meditational development 
The Bodhisattva does not make any efforts while coursing in the course of a Bodhisattva to reach in this present birth any state in which all signs are forsaken 
Does a Bodhisattva's aspiration to perfect wisdom increase as in one's dreams one develops the three doors to deliverance ie the Empty the Signless and the Wishless 
As this increases through development by day this also increases in one who dreams about this 
In one's dreams as one does a deed wholesome or unwholesome is this added on to the heap or collection of one's karma 
The Lord teaches all dharmas are like a dream and infinitely so as in such ie 
On the other hand  this deed is added to the heap and collection of one's karma when upon waking up one thinks the dream over and consciously forms the notion as wanting to kill someone How does one do this 
Empty awareness beyond any objective support raises to or rather reveals result as neither deed nor thought as such simply cannot 
As the Lord describes objective supports as isolated  how can an act of will arise only with objective support and not without 
As in one's dream a Bodhisattva gives a gift and dedicates it to full enlightenment can this gift effectively called dedicated 
Or does emptiness of form reply or emptiness of feeling perception impulses or consciousness 
I do not Even I do not nor can I know these dharmas do not apprehend do not see these in this way in which these words express and these thoughts reflect But certainly this body can not touch these speech can not express these mind can not even consider these 
Can you Sariputra see this dharma endowed with which you have been made into an Arhat Sariputra No Lord 
In this same way this does not occur to a Bodhisattva which courses in perfection of wisdom  this dharma is predestined to full enlightenment that dharma will be predestined this dharma is being predestined that dharma will know full enlightenment As one courses in such a way one courses in perfect wisdom 
This being as it is a Bodhisattva is not afraid as when arriving in a wilderness infested with wild beasts 
Coming to have revealed perfect luminosity steps are taken in one's Buddhafield such as are seen no animals as these are not regarded as 'animals' at all and none have any concept of these as such but rather simply as beings living on divine food As well a Bodhisattva is not afraid when finding one's self in a wilderness infested by robbers 
As Bodhisattvas find pleasure in this wholesome practice of renouncing anything such as belongings and what ever a Bodhisattva exudes nonattachment to even this body having freely renounced all of which is necessary to life 
Thus effort is exerted on behalf of all beings so on any and all occasion also the perfection of effort  is more perfected 
So in a foodless waste also a Bodhisattva is not afraid 
As effort is firmly exerted a Buddhafield is purified in such a way as approaching enlightenment in this Buddhafield is no foodless wastesuch is not even conceivable 
The beings in this field are entirely happy filled with happiness possessed of all happiness And thus all the intentions and plans of these beings are realized as reality Just as with these Gods of the Thirtythree any idea in these minds is sufficient to produce anything whatsoever these desire so effort is exerted so these beings can realize and produce everything by merely thinking of it in their minds In order that their legitimate intentions are fulfilled in order that all beings everywhere and anywhere do not go short of any requirements of life  so is this exerted effort for purity in thought for the benefit of any and all beings as at this occasion also the perfection of concentration is more perfect 
As such a Bodhisattva is not afraid in a district infested by epidemics 
Do not think this is an excessively long time to realizing full enlightenment do not tremble at such a thought 
A Bodhisattva here avoids dwelling on difficulties as such thinks great and long is this limit with no beginning as one single thoughtmoment in other words no absence as no limit Such 'prevents' a Bodhisattva from trembling at any thought such as it will be a long time until full enlightenment 
And this as well Subhuti as these and other fears and terrors be they seen heard felt or known do not cause a Bodhisattva to tremble one knows this  son or daughter of good family is capable of knowing full enlightenment A Bodhisattva here dons the great armor of this thought  
In such a way the Tathagatas have taught and thus teach and apply this as is taught and as such master the perfection of wisdom for the benefit of all beings such that on this occasion also the perfection of wisdom comes to fulfillment Prediction of the Goddess of the Ganges So now a certain woman comes to this assembly and sits down in it She rises from her seat puts her upper robe over one shoulder salutes the Lord with folded hands and says 
As she sees this smile this woman seizes golden flowers and scatters these over the Lord 
This Goddess of the Ganges Ananda is in a future period a Tathagata 'Golden Flower' by name an Arhat fully Enlightened proficient in knowledge and conduct WellGone a knower of the world unsurpassed a tamer of any beings to be tamed a teacher of Gods and people a Buddha a Lord 
In the starlike aeon such appears in this world and realizes full enlightenment As this one deceases here she ceases to be a woman she is seen as a man He is reborn in Abhirati the Buddhafield of the Tathagata Akshobhya in whose presence he leads the holy life After his decease he passes from Buddhafield to Buddhafield never deprived of the sight of the Tathagata 
He goes on passing from Buddhafield to Buddhafield from here to here always choosing such as in which he is not without the Buddhas the Lords 
A universal monarch passes from palace to palace and the soles of his feet never during this entire life tread upon the surface of the earth  and he dies without ever up to the time of his death having trodden with his feet on the ground 
So it is Ananda 
On the contrary these are styled 'immeasurable incalculable' In addition Ananda at this time on this occasion in such a Buddhafield is no wilderness infested with wild beasts or with robbers and no waterless wastes and no districts infested by epidemics and no foodless wastes 
Ananda 
Who is this Tathagata in whose presence this Goddess of the Ganges planted this wholesome root of the first thought of enlightenment and turned it over to supreme enlightenment 
And she actually scattered golden flowers over the Tathagata as she requested of him  supreme enlightenment 
It is as I strewed the five lotus flowers over Dipankara the Tathagata and acquired the patient acceptance of dharmas which fail to be produced Dipankara predicted this future enlightenment with the words 
Oh certainly as this young man I also like to be predicted to full enlightenment And in this way Ananda in the presence of the Tathagata Dipankara this Goddess planted the wholesome root of the first thought of enlightenment  full enlightenment 
Certainly as one who makes the necessary preparations as one who makes the grade this Goddess of the Ganges is predicted to full enlightenment 
How does a Bodhisattva coursing in perfection of wisdom come to reveal to self another and countless beings these humbled revelations as the nonlimitedness of emptiness or how does one enter into concentration on emptiness 
In reference to the Lord saying a Bodhisattva does not realize emptiness how does a Bodhisattva who stands firmly in  this concentration  not realize emptiness 
A Bodhisattva contemplates emptiness which yields it's inherency of the naturalness of all modes  
this is time for complete discomfiture and not realization  So without losing oneself in this concentration one ties one's thought to any objective support  and determines to yield one self to the infinitely apparent perfect wisdom  and one determines within this one will not realize emptiness  Yet the Bodhisattva does not lose any dharmas which act as the  wings of enlightenment One does not affect the extinction of outflows  yet one 'achieves' no limitations As a Bodhisattva dwells in concentration as emptiness  which is one of the doors to deliverance  one also dwells in concentration on Signlessness but without realizing the Signless 
Endowed with dharma of this wholesome root which is thus in place one contemplates this is time for nurturing beings and not for realization Taken hold of by perfect wisdom one does not realize any reality limit 
This person is judicious able to express with ease to formulate views clearly to substantiate one's claims one who always knows the suitable time place and situation for everything In archery this one has gone as far as one can go is successful in warding off all manner of attack most skilled in all arts and foremost through fine achievements in all crafts Of good memory this one is intelligent clever steady and prudent versed in all the treatises has many friends is wealthy strong of body with large limbs with all faculties complete  generous to all dear and pleasant to many Any work undertaken is managed to completion 
Would such a person Subhuti feel every increasing joy and zest 
Now suppose as well this person so greatly accomplished takes one's family on a journey one's mother and father sons and daughters By some circumstances these find themselves in a great wild forest The foolish ones among them feel fright terror and hairraising fear This one however fearlessly says to this family 
I shall soon set you free Then more and more hostile and inimical forces rise up in this forest would this noble person decide to abandon this family and to take oneself alone out of that terrible and frightening forest  this one who is not one to draw back who is endowed with all the force of firmness and vigor who is wise exceedingly tender and compassionate courageous and a master of many resources 
These enemies and adversaries who look for a weak spot who seek for a weak spot do not gain any hold over these one's 
This one is competent to deal with the situation and is able unhurt and uninjured soon to take out of that forest both this family and oneself and securely and safely these reach a village city or markettown 
Just so Subhuti is it with a Bodhisattva which is full of pity and concerned with the welfare of all beings which dwells in friendliness compassion sympathetic joy and impartiality is taken hold of by skill in means and perfect wisdom which has been taken over by one's wholesome roots employing the kind of transformation which is the Buddha's sanction 
Since this one does not abandon all beings this one is thus able to have revealed full enlightenment safely and securely 
At such a time as a Bodhisattva makes all beings an object for one's thought of friendliness and with this highest friendliness ties oneself to these at this time one rises above the factiousness of the defilements and of Mara one rises above the level of Sravaka Disciple and Pratyekabuddha  and one abides in this concentration  
At such a time as a Bodhisattva dwells in this concentration on emptiness which is but one door to freedom one yet does not dwell in concentration as Signlessness nor does this one realize concentration on the Signless 
This is just like a bird which on its wings courses in the air It neither falls to the ground nor does it stand anywhere on any support It dwells in space just in the air without being either supported or settled herein 
Just so a Bodhisattva dwells as this dwelling of emptiness realizes this total permeance of emptiness Just so this one dwells AS this dwelling of Signlessness and Wishlessness and such comes to be revealed as this specific consummation as Signless and Wishless But one does not fall into emptiness neither into Signlessness nor Wishlessness with one's Buddhadharmas remaining incomplete 
It is as with a master of archery strong welltrained perfectly trained in archery He first shoots one arrow upwards He now sends after this another arrow which checks the fall of the first By a regular succession of arrows he would not permit that first arrow to fall to the ground and that arrow is kept in the air until he decides it falls to the ground 
In this same way a Bodhisattva which courses in perfection of wisdom and which is upheld by skill in means does not realize the farthest realitylimit until one's wholesome roots are matured well matured as full enlightenment Only as one's wholesome roots are matured well matured as full enlightenment  does this one realize this farthest realitylimit 
A doer of what is difficult is the Bodhisattva a doer of what is most difficult as one courses and dwells as emptiness one enters into this concentration as emptiness and yet does not realize any realitylimit 
Exceedingly wonderful is this O WellGone 
So it is Subhuti 
For the Bodhisattva does not abandon beings We have made these special vows to reveal this process to freedom from defilement and obscurations to buddhanature for themselves for all beings 
As the mind of a Bodhisattva forms this aspiration not to abandon beings but to set this freeing technique and process in front of these beings and in addition one aspires AS this concentration on emptiness Signlessness Wishlessness this being the three doors of deliverancesuch a Bodhisattva is known as one which is endowed with skill in means and does not realize any realitylimit midway before Buddhadharmas are complete 
Any thought of enlightenment for a Bodhisattva  consists in just this fact  one does not leave beings behind 
As one is thus endowed with this thought of enlightenment and with skill in means one does not midway realize any realitylimit hereby stopping as any result of any thing whatsoever 
In addition to this as a Bodhisattva either actually contemplates these limitless stations being the three doors to deliverance or aspires to contemplate these in this mind one forms this following aspiration For a long time beings such as these have a notion of existence and course in apprehension of basis As in realizing these coursings toward full enlightenment dharma only too naturally comes to be revealed and demonstrated to these beings so these too may forsake whatever erroneous views may be harbored about any basis As a free agent one now enters this concentration on Emptiness on Signlessness on Wishlessness 
A Bodhisattva revealing to oneself one's natural endowment with this thought of enlightenment and skill in means does not midway realize or give way to some realitylimit On the contrary one does not lose concentration on friendliness compassion sympathetic joy and impartiality 
One's faith etc developes as keener and keener one acquires siddhis revealing to self and others the limbs of enlightenment and this path 
mindfulness investigation of dharmas vigor tranquility rapture concentration and evenmindedness  Even so a Bodhisattva reflects thisfor a long time beings as these perceive dharmas course in the apprehension of a basisand develops this aspiration as the former one entering concentration as emptiness 
impermanent is all this not permanent ill is all this not happiness without self is all this not with a self repulsive is all this not lovely Endowed with this thought of perfection of wisdom  and with the previously described skill in means here and now taken hold of by perfect wisdom one does not realize any realitylimit midway before all one's Buddhadharma are complete 
One dwells thus and one enters on concentration as Wishlessness but one does not lose one's concentration as friendliness etc 
Faith persistence mindfulness concentration discernment  develop as keener and keener and one acquires siddhis the limbs of enlightenment and the path 
A Bodhisattva raises the following thought These beings for a long time are in the habit of coursing in the apprehension of a basis and even just now these do so These are for a long time in the habit of coursing in the perception of signs in perverted views in perception of material objects in perception of unreal objects in wrong views and even now these continue to do so 
Thusly it may be that these faults in each and every way may cease to be in these and these faults come to be revealed as inconceivable in them As a Bodhisattva has all beings in mind in such a way is endowed with this recollection of all beings with this production of thought and as skill in means as one is taken hold of by perfect wisdom and as endowed with all these qualities one thus contemplates the true nature of these unfathomable dharmas  through Emptiness or Signlessness or Wishlessness or through these being unaffected unproduced without birth  without any positivity  it is quite impossible such a Bodhisattva which is endowed with such pure cognition could either fall into the Unaffected or become intimate with anything belonging to the triple world 
Irreversibility A Bodhisattva is asked by another Bodhisattva wanting to win full enlightenment Over which dharmas does one come to consummation of realization 
What kind of aspiration does one form in one's mind aspirations which enable a Bodhisattva to not settle in realization of Emptiness or Signlessness or Wishlessness or Unaffectedness or nonproduction or nonpositivity but to go on developing perfection of wisdom As the answering Bodhisattva answers  just emptiness is attended to just Signlessness just Wishlessness just Unaffectedness just nonproduction just nobirth just nonpositivity and does not make manifest this production of the thought of the nonabandonment of all beings or not manifest or indicate skill in means in this answer one can know this Bodhisattva is not in irreversibility predicted to full enlightenment by the Tathagatas previously 
Subhuti And how can a Bodhisattva in regard to this question be regarded as irreversible 
One is known as an irreversible Bodhisattva as whether one hears this perfection of wisdom or not one hits upon the correct answer Subhuti Here are many who course towards enlightenment but a few only could give the correct answer The Lord 
But these who are predestined for it these give the correct answer 
One can be sure that these have planted splendid wholesome roots in the past and the whole world with its Gods persons and Asuras cannot possibly and ultimately overwhelm these 
This is another markas even in dreams neither the level of Sravaka Disciple nor Pratyekabuddha nor anything which belongs to any triple world is seen or known as an object of any longing or appears advantageous 
It is another markas even in dreams one sees oneself as a Tathagata in the middle of an assembly of many hundreds of thousands of niyutas of kotis of persons  seated in a circular hall with a peaked roof surrounded by a community of monks revered by the community of Bodhisattvas demonstrating dharma 
It is another mark as even in dreams one rises into the air and demonstrates dharma to beings as one perceives the halo round the Buddha one conjures up monks who go into different directions to fulfil the functions of Buddhas on other world systems and demonstrate dharma here 
It is another mark as one dreams and remains unafraid when a village town city or kingdom is sacked or sees a huge conflagration spreading or sees wild beasts or other offensive animals or one's head is about to be cut off or as one is subjected to other great fears and terrors and also one sees these fears and terrors to which other beings are subjected 
And immediately as one awakes from this dream reflects how like a dream is all this which belongs to any triple world 
And how does one know here are no states of woe in a Buddhafield of any particular Bodhisattva 
As a Bodhisattva on seeing in dreams the beings reborn in the hells as 'animals' or as Pretas sets up mindfulness and a Buddhafield without such states of woe this is known as the mark which shows one can never again need to be reborn in the states of woe 
Also a Bodhisattva may dream a prophetic dream to the effect that a town or village is on fire and as one wakes up considers thusly 
The attributes tokens and signs in these dreams are the attributes tokens and signs which an irreversible Bodhisattva bears in mind 
This Truth as of utterance of this Truth let this town fire or village fire which is taking place here be appeased cooled extinguished As the fire is extinguished one can know  this Bodhisattva is predicted to full enlightenment by Tathagatas in this past as it is not extinguished one should know this is not so predicted 
A Bodhisattva which succeeds in controlling this fire is on this other hand borne in mind as irreversible Irreversibility and the Magical Power of Veracity And now Subhuti are demonstrated attributes tokens and signs by which an irreversible Bodhisattva is borne in mind 
Subhuti 
As a person man or woman boy or girl  is seized or possessed by a ghost a Bodhisattva which comes across one such as this performs this Act of Truth and says As it is true by Tathagatas of this past  and it is true these intentions are perfectly pure  to the extent this attention to this is perfectly pure to this extent I leave behind thoughts of Sravaka Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas It is this nature to reveal full enlightenment Not to not revealfull enlightenment 
Here is nothing which the Buddhas and Lords which reside in countless world systems do not cognize see feel and fully know 
These Buddhas and Lords which know this earnest intention also reveal full enlightenment As this is truth as this is utterance of Truth may this one depart which seizes and possesses this person with this ghostly seizure So as a result of these words of this Bodhisattva if this ghost does not depart one can know the Bodhisattva has not had one's prediction yet but as this being departs one can know this Bodhisattva has this prediction to full enlightenment Pride and the Magical Power of Veracity This Bodhisattva as we see says I am predicted to full enlightenment by the Tathagatas of this past 
And his efforts are particularly strong and energetic when he has to deal with a Bodhisattva which has but recently set out in the vehicle 
But a recently set out Bodhisattva thinks one's own might drove the ghost away and does not know nor consider that this just may be what is called Mara's might as one's own negative forces within driving one to thoughts of great advantage 
As a result of this  victory over the ghost this Bodhisattva thinks to have had this prediction in this past and despises other Bodhisattvas sneers at these ironically compliments condemns and deprecates these 
The pride arrogance hauteur false pride conceit keeps this one away from allknowledge from supreme cognition of a Buddha from cognition of the SelfExistent  from cognition of allknowing from supreme enlightenment 
As this one meets with Bodhisattvas which are good friends virtuous in character resolutely intent on the sublime earnestly intent skilled in means endowed with irreversible dharma  in this one's conceit these are despised as such does not tend to love and honor these 
In this way in connection with magical power of the enunciation of a Truth Mara the Evil One is seen to be allowed to cause an obstacle to full enlightenment in any Bodhisattva which has recently set out in the vehicle which has little faith has learned little lacks any good friend is not upheld by perfect wisdom and lacks in skill in means 
This also can be known as Mara's deed to any Bodhisattva 
Mara is accredited with using even the annunciation of the name and of the other details connected with it to tempt a Bodhisattva 
The proof is this name you have even as a Buddha and these are the names of your mother your father your brother your sister your friends maternal relatives kinsmen and relations He proclaims these names backwards through seven generations He tells you that you are born in this region this country this village town or marketplace As you have any particular quality he tells you that you have that same quality also in other times Whether this Bodhisattva is dull by nature or keen in faculties Mara tells this one that such is the same in other times as well 
As say a forest dweller or one who begs for food from door to door without accepting invitations or wears clothes made of rags taken from a dust heap or never eats any food after midday or eats a meal in one sitting or sleeps at night wherever one may happen to be or possesses no more than three robes or lives in and frequents cemeteries or one dwells at the foot of a tree or even in sleep remains in a sitting posture or lives in an open unsheltered place or wears a garment made of felt or has few wishes is easily contented detached frugal soft in speech or a person of few words in each case Mara announces that also in other times this same one is endowed with the same quality and that for certain the Tathagatas of the three times must have predicted this one to full enlightenment and to the stage of an irreversible Bodhisattva for now this one has the just mentioned qualities of an austere ascetic and must now in all certainty also have endowments with these from other times 
It may be now a Bodhisattva comes to feel conceit as one thinks of the annunciation of these names and circumstances from other times and of present austere penances as a rigid ascetic 
In the guise of a monk or nun or lay brother or lay sister or Brahmin or householder or mother father brother sister friend or relative Mara is seen as coming to the Bodhisattva and telling this one that in other times one has had this prediction to full enlightenment and to this irreversible stage of a Bodhisattva for the simple reason that now one has these qualities of a rigid ascetic which according to Mara are the qualities of an irreversible Bodhisattva 
Butthe Bodhisattva does not have the attributes tokens and signs of an irreversible Bodhisattva which is described 
This is surely a being seen as beset by Mara unlike these other Bodhisattvas  
Also Subhuti Mara is seen to operate in connection with the prediction of the name which a Bodhisattva will have as a Buddha 
this will be your name when you have won full enlightenment And Mara strangely enough is seen to predict the name which the Bodhisattva had already guessed when pondering over the name one would bear after full enlightenment If the Bodhisattva is weak in wisdom  and without skill in means this one reflects that strangely enough the name which that monk has mentioned is the same guessed by oneself The Bodhisattva compares the name thought out by oneself with the name proclaimed by that monk who is seen as either beset by Mara or was conjured up by Mara or his host and finds that the two agree and concludes oneself has in other times also been predicted to full enlightenment by Tathagatas by name But one has not got the attributes tokens and signs of an irreversible Bodhisattva as are described 
This pride arrogance and conceit which makes one despise these other Bodhisattva keeps one far away from allknowledge and the cognition of a Buddha 
Now even if after one has spent a long time a good long time in erring about and in wandering about  one would again come to want to know full enlightenment by resorting to just this perfection of wisdom and if one were to go to these good friends and regularly approach them and if in one's newfound outlook on life one would first of all censure former ideas vomit them up abhor them throw them back see their error  even then it is still difficult for this one to realize buddhanature 
Among the monks who belong to the vehicle or level of the Sravaka Disciples four unforgivable offences are so serious that as someone has been guilty of one of them that one ceases to be a monk a Shramana a son or daughter of the Shakya 
More serious than those four unforgivable offences is the production of a proud thought when on the occasion of the prediction of one's name a Bodhisattva has despised other Bodhisattvas and produced a thought which is very unwholesome which is more serious than the four unforgivable offences Not only this but it is more serious even than the five deadly sins this production of thought connected with pride  produced on the occasion when a Bodhisattva's future name  is announced That thought is more serious than the five deadly sins In this way even through the mere annunciation of a Bodhisattva's name very subtle deeds seen to be of Mara may arise 
These are recognized for what these are and avoided both by the Bodhisattva oneself and by others 
Faults in Connection with Detachment Furthermore what is seen as Mara the Evil One comes to any Bodhisattva and exhorts and informs these in connection with the quality of detachment which Tathagatas have appraised as detachment and that this means one should dwell in a remote forest in a jungle in mountain clefts burial grounds or on heaps of straw etc 
As this is not the detachment of the Bodhisattva what then is this detachment of a Bodhisattva 
A Bodhisattva dwells detached as one is detached from the mental activities associated with Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas  As one is taken hold of by perfection of wisdom and skill in means and as one dwells in the dwelling of friendliness and of great compassion towards all beings one dwells detached even as one dwells in the neighborhood or village 
A Bodhisattva dwells detached as one passes day and night dwelling in this detachment 
As any Bodhisattva dwells in this dwelling while one lives in remote dwelling places in remote forests in the jungle in mountain clefts and burial grounds thus one dwells detached But as to the detachment recommended by Mara the Evil One ie 
the dwelling in remote forests jungles mountain clefts and burial grounds as this detachment is actually contaminated or tainted by the mental activities associated with Disciples and Pratyekabuddha just so as one does not apply as one practices the perfection of wisdom one does not fulfil these conditions necessary to realize allknowledge 
As a result one dwells in a contaminated dwelling in a mental activity which is not wholly pure 
As one's deeds of body voice and mind are not quite pure one is a dweller in contamination not a dweller in detachment although one may dwell in the remote forest 
At first one despises these which live in the neighborhood of a village though these dwell in the dwelling of wisdom with devices and great compassion though these are habitually quite pure in what these do with their body voice or mind though these are detached from mental activities associated with Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas uncontaminated by them  after this one finds one cannot gain the Trances Concentrations Attainments Emancipations and Superknowledges and these qualities do not reach fulfillment in this person 
Even though a Bodhisattva may dwell in deserted forests hundreds of miles wide with no other company than beasts of prey antelopes flocks of birds uninfested even by the smaller wild animals by Yakshas and Rakshasas and untroubled by the fear of robbers and even though one may settle here for one year or for one hundred years or even for hundreds of thousands of niyutas of kotis of years or for more than that if one does not know this detachment as explained and through which detachment and explanation a Bodhisattva dwells as one who has set out with earnest intentions who has achieved earnest intentions even now one completely devoted to life in the remote forests fails to gladden the heart of hearts as one does not know this  as one is without skill in means as one leans on this detachment clings to it is bent on it indulges in it 
For the detachment of any Bodhisattva which is described does not appear in this one's detachment 
But from a place high up in the air Mara can be seen as saying to the dweller in the remote forest that this dweller does well that one's detachment is the one which Tathagatas have described and one can go on dwelling in just this detachment and in consequence of it one quickly realizes full enlightenment 
As one leaves this isolated place in the forest and comes back to a village one despises Bodhisattvas here monks who are well behaved chaste lovely in character uncontaminated by mental activities associated with Sravakas Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas and living their lives quite pure in body voice and mind 
This one tells these they surely do not dwell in a detached dwelling but in a contaminated and crowded one 
What dweller in a village has ever been exhorted and informed by superhuman beings In this way this one despises the persons who belong to the vehicle of the Bodhisattva 
This one is known as a Candala of a Bodhisattva as a defamer of Bodhisattvas as a mere pretender of a Bodhisattva as a counterfeit Bodhisattva as filth of a Bodhisattva as a robber in the guise of a Shramana a robber of persons belonging to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas a robber of the world with its Gods 
Such a one is surely not yet tended loved or honored 
For such persons have fallen into conceit 
Although a Bodhisattva does not yet tend such persons neither does one not love or honor these as a true Bodhisattva is one who can neither abandon beings nor allknowledge nor full enlightenment as one aspires earnestly to reveal full enlightenment and indicate to countless others how to bring about this revelation themselves as well as the weal of all beings 
On the contrary one who has raised oneself to a height which is such as one considers the weal of all beings also does so one may see through these and other deeds seen to be of Mara always maintain one's mind as anxious to expound the path to beings who have not yet got it a mind which does not tremble and which is not submerged in the wanderings through these triple worlds one has revealed first of all an attitude of friendliness and an attitude of compassion one has revealed the great compassion and is moved by sympathy one has thoughts of joy and in sympathy with the beings who progress whether or not such is obvious and one is impartial for the true nature of dharmas is such as it cannot be apprehended  one forms the resolution 
Thus train oneself This is also known as a Bodhisattva's courageous advance towards one's own higher knowledge 
The Good Friends A Bodhisattva which sets out with earnest intention from the very beginning tends loves and honors good friends 
Who are these good friends of a Bodhisattva 
The Lord The Buddhas and Lords and also the irreversible Bodhisattvas who are skillful in the Bodhisattvacourse and which instruct and admonish one in the perfections who demonstrate and expound perfection of wisdom 
The perfection of wisdom in particular is regarded as a Bodhisattva's good friend 
All the six perfections in fact are good friends of a Bodhisattva 
These are one's Teacher one's path light torch illumination one's shelter refuge place of rest one's final relief island mother father and these lead one to this sublime revealing of undifferentiated awareness and this inherent pure cognition herein to understanding to full enlightenment 
Simply from the six perfections is revealed allknowledge of Tathagatas which in a period which stands completely clear of time as it is known in these triple worlds come to realize full enlightenment and enter Nirvanaand so also the allknowledge of Tathagatas which in all periods of these three times simultaneously realize enlightenment and so these Tathagatas which just now reside in incalculable immeasurable infinite inconceivable world systems 
For the six perfections contain the thirtyseven dharmas which act as wings to enlightenment these contain four Brahmadwellings four means of conversion and any Buddhadharma whatsoever any Buddhacognition cognition of the SelfExistent any unthinkable incomparable immeasurable incalculable unequalled cognition any cognition which equals the unequalled any cognition of allknowing 
In addition a Bodhisattva which trains in these six perfections is a true benefactor to all beings which are in need of one 
But as one wants to train in these six perfections a Bodhisattva must above all hear this perfection of wisdom take it up bear it in mind recite study spread demonstrate expound explain and write of and about this and investigate this profound meaning content and method meditate on this and ask questions regarding this 
For this perfection of wisdom directs these six perfections guides leads instructs and advises these this is their genetrix and nurse 
Because if these are deprived of the perfection of wisdom the first five perfections do not come under any concept of perfections and these are not called perfections 
For all dharmas are isolated and empty 
As all dharmas are isolated and empty how is the defilement and purification of beings conceivable 
For what is isolated cannot be defiled and purified what is empty cannot be defiled or purified and what is isolated and empty cannot know full enlightenment 
Nor can one get at any dharma outside emptiness which has known full enlightenment which will know it or which does know it 
The Lord 
So it is Lord 
Are also Imaking and minemaking empty 
These are O Lord 
Is it just do to this Imaking and minemaking these beings wander about in birthanddeath 
So it is Lord 
To whatever extent beings take hold of things and settle down in these to this extent is defilement in place 
But no one is here defiled And to whatever extent one does not take hold of things and does not settle down in these to this extent does one deconceptualize Imaking and minemaking 
In this sense does one come to continuously participate in revealing and hence forming this realization of the purification of being 
So see Subhuti to whatsoever greater or lesser extent these do not take hold of things and do not settle down in things in direct proportion to this extent here is realized or rather here is revealed purification 
As a Bodhisattva courses thus one courses in perfect wisdom 
This is truly wonderful 
And a Bodhisattva which courses thus courses in perfect wisdom as one now does not course in form or other skandhas 
As one courses thus  a Bodhisattva is not crushed by worlds with various Gods beings and Asuras 
As one courses thus a Bodhisattva comes to reveal the coursing of all persons belonging to the vehicle of Sravaka Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas as it is and gains an insuperable equanimous position 
For Buddhahood is insuperably equanimous and so is Tathagatahood this state SelfExistent beyond any existent self this state of allknowledge in which is nothing knowledgeable 
A Bodhisattva which day and night passes 'time' dwelling on these mental activities associated with perfect wisdom is quite near full enlightenment and quickly comes to reveal such Attentions to Perfect Wisdom and the Pearl of Great Price The Lord So it is Subhuti 
Suppose Subhuti all beings in Jambudvipa simultaneously acquire a human personality and upon raising any thoughts to full enlightenment abide in  these thoughts of enlightenment all life long 
Just sonow  these give gifts to all beings do these Bodhisattvas on the strength of this beget much merit 
These do O Lord 
Truly again Subhuti any son or daughter of good family begets a much different merit who as a Bodhisattva dwells for even one single day only in mental activities connected with perfection of wisdom For as one goes on dwelling day and night in these mental activities one is more and more worthy of the bestowal of sacrificial gifts to any and all beings 
Few beings whatsoever have minds and intentions so full of friendliness as these and except for Buddhas the Lords and Tathagatas of course are matchless without any likeness endowed with unthinkable dharmas 
We survey countless beings with this heavenly eye and what we see fills us with great agitation 
I shall become a savior to all these beings I seek release for these from all suffering But one makes neither this nor anything else into a sign to which one is partial 
This also is this light of a Bodhisattva's natural wisdom this same light by which one cognizes and reveals full enlightenment 
Bodhisattvas which dwell in these dwellings are worthy of the gifts from the worlds which these inhabit and do not turn back upon recognition of full enlightenment 
So here a Bodhisattva dwells in mental work accorded to perfect wisdom as one does not consume one's alms fruitlessly as one points out the path to any and all beings  sheds light over a limitless range is able to set free from birthanddeath any and all beings who subject themselves to these ones and apply themselves attentively and is able to cleanse the organs and faculties of perception and vision of all beings 
As one dwells in mental activities directed towards these goals one brings to mind and maintains mental activities which accord with perfection of wisdom 
As one so accords  one spends days and nights in mental activities which accord with perfection of wisdom 
Suppose a man well versed in jewelry and the different varieties of jewels newly acquires a very precious gem This makes him very glad and elated 
As he again lost this precious gem he is most sad and distressed Constantly and always mental activities associated with this jewel proceed in him and he regrets being parted from it 
But since the Lord teaches all dharmas and all mental activities are lacking in ownbeing and empty how can a Bodhisattva now be as one not lacking in mental activities which accord with perfect wisdom or with allknowledge 
As the mind of a Bodhisattva works on this fact that all dharmas are through their ownbeing isolated and empty and agrees this is so now such a one is one not lacking in mental activities which accord with perfect wisdom and with allknowledge 
So how can a Bodhisattva cognize with no increase in perfect wisdom full attainment of enlightenment how can one know full enlightenment 
In actual fact a Bodhisattva which courses in perfect wisdom neither increases or decreases 
Just as perfect wisdom is empty without increase or decrease just so also a Bodhisattva is empty without increase or decrease 
just as perfect wisdom is empty  without increase or decrease a Bodhisattva arrives at cognition of enlightenment and thus is full enlightenment revealed 
Does emptiness course in perfect wisdom 
So O Lord how does a Bodhisattva course in perfect wisdom 
Do you see perfect wisdom in which the Bodhisattva courses as a real thing 
Do you see as real any dharma which offers no basis for apprehension Is this dharma by any chance produced or can this be produced or is this being produced is this stopped can this be stopped or is this being stopped 
This insight gives any Bodhisattva patience in regards to dharmas which fail to be produced As one is endowed with this one is sure to reveal full enlightenment 
This is quite impossible for a Bodhisattva which courses strives and struggle in this way and progresses in this direction to not reach this supreme cognition of a Buddha the cognition of the allknowing the cognition of a great Caravan Leader 
Can this true nature of all dharmas which consists in the fact that these fail to be produced can this be predestined to full enlightenment 
Do you see as real this dharma which has a prediction to full enlightenment 
I do not see any real dharma which is at any time predestined to full enlightenment 
It is such as any and all dharmas cannot be apprehended that this does not occur to me to think this dharma is known to the Enlightened this dharma can be known to such as these by means of this dharma these recognize full knowledge The View of Bodhisattvas At this time Sakra Chief of Gods is seated amid this assembly and says 
So it is Kausika 
So it is 
Imagine all the beings in Jambudvipa are endowed  with  the ten ways of wholesome action do these on the strength of this endowment beget much merit 
These do O Lord 
how much more soas in addition these train to Thusness progress to thus make endeavours regarding thus thus on their journey these conceive in essence and cognize the whole world with its Gods beings and Asuras 
On their journey these not only conceive and cognize in essence the world with its Gods beings and Asuras but also all the Streamwinners OnceReturners NeverReturners Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas 
These conceive and cognize also in essence Bodhisattvas which are great almsgivers but lack as yet in perfect wisdom and skill in means and equally these with morality as perfectly pure which possess a vast quantity of morality with observation of the moral rules as unbroken flawless unstained complete perfectly pure and unspotted but also as yet lack in perfect wisdom and skill in means and equally any which reveal from within themselves patience and peaceful calm  with thoughts free from hostility which think no thought nor harbor any feelings of malice even while burned at the stake but who lack in perfect wisdom and skill in means and equally any which exert perseverance which persist in trying are free from sloth and remain uncowed in all these do with body voice and mind but which as yet lack perfect wisdom and skill in means and equally these who are fond of the trances and delight in these which are strong and powerful in the trances which are established in the trances which are masters of trances but which as yet lack in perfect wisdom and skill in means 
For as one courses in perfection of wisdom as this is expounded a Bodhisattva conceives of and recognizes in essence the worlds with their Gods beings and Asuras conceives of and recognizes in essence any and all which belong to the vehicle of Sravaka Disciples and Pratyekabuddhasalso the Bodhisattvas which are not skilled in means 
And all these mentioned cannot surpass one such as this for such is this nature and profound balance struck by total equanimityFor a Bodhisattva which courses in perfection of wisdom as this is expounded which complies with thistakes up such a position so the lineage of allknowing is not interrupted and does not keep aloof from Tathagatas 
Training oneself this way one trains in this training of a Bodhisattva and not in the training of Sravaka Disciple or Pratyekabuddha 
Rewards of Perfect Wisdom And the four Great Kings the World Guardians come to any Bodhisattva who trains this way in the perfection of wisdom and these say to this one 
Here are the four begging bowls which you receive as you are seated on the terrace of enlightenment as one which has revealed full enlightenment Not only the four World Guardians come to a Bodhisattva which trains in perfect wisdom as is being expounded but I also come not to mention other Gods 
All the worldly ills which might befall the Bodhisattva which courses in perfect wisdom such as attacks from others etc are prevented from affecting this one in any way 
Ananda just now thinks Is this speech of Sakra Chief of Gods due to his own insight or to the Buddha's might 
To the Buddha's might Ananda to the Buddha's sustaining power is this attributed 
The Lord So it is Ananda 
Conditions Which are seen as Opening a Bodhisattva to Mara's Influence As a Bodhisattva trains in perfect wisdom makes endeavours about this and develops this all the Evil Maras in the great trichiliocosm are seen as being in a state of uncertainty Does this Bodhisattva prematurely realize the realitylimit of the level of Sravaka Disciple or Pratyekabuddha or know full enlightenment Even so as a Bodhisattva dwells as this dwelling for perfect wisdom beings believe with firm resolve that it is the Evil Maras which are pierced by a dart of sorrow 
As a Bodhisattva ever courses toward perfecting wisdom makes endeavours about this and develops this the Evil Maras are resolutely believed to be thinking of how to hurt such a one as this 
As a result these beingsbelieve with unquestioning certainty that these Maras hope now for the Bodhisattva to cower for one's hair to stand on end soeven one single thought concentrated toward full enlightenment or any benevolent equanimity might get extinguished 
Ananda 
What kind of a Bodhisattva is Mara seen as or believed in as confounding and herein called to blame for hurting 
Mara is thus seen as or believed in as confounding or herein called to blame for hurting a Bodhisattva which in time as this perfection of wisdom is taught does not produce a thought of firm belief in what is the actual nature of these various dharmas allknowledge 
Mara is thus firmly believed to gain entry 
Such is this fallaciousness of resolute beliefHeis believed to have already hurt Bodhisattvas which as this deep perfection of wisdom is being taught are seized by uncertainties feel perplexed and think perhaps this perfection of wisdom is so perhaps it is not soor Bodhisattvas which are seen to be lacking a good friend which are believed to have been taken hold of by bad friends who as perfecting of wisdom is taking place either do not hear or do not understand about very deep stations in nature or wisdom and choosing to remain in ignorance of these do not ask how this perfecting of wisdom is developed or Bodhisattvas which cling to someone who upholds any dharma which not being true of any of these dharmas thus says 
I have taken this one as my fitting companion and this suits me Moreover a Bodhisattva might as this deep perfecting of nature as wisdom is taking place say to another Bodhisattva 
Thus it is seen as being Mara coming also to such a Bodhisattvato hurt and gain entry herein 
Furthermore Ananda herein is this thought to be Mara as the one being contented elated or enraptured 
Mara is accredited in one's thinking as being the one who is overjoyed exultant and glad thrilled delighted and jubilant in any case in which a Bodhisattva in one's own laxity despises other Bodhisattvas thinking 
I dwell in the dwelling of detachment but not so these theirs is not this dwelling in detachment And blindly is it thought of as being Mara also who is so joyful as this Bodhisattva keeps far away from revealing full enlightenmentOn the contrary in this imagined joy and contented ecstacy of one who allows themselves to think thus is Mara seen to be this most excellent teacher of the exceedingly tenuous nature of one's disconcerted application of right concentration mindfulness and effort 
Besides this as a Bodhisattva takes on a name or clan or as ascetic qualities are proclaimed one may regard this as a sufficient reason to despise other Bodhisattvas wellbehaved and lovely in character though these are 
But this one has no depth of practice and does not apply qualities of irreversible Bodhisattvas which course toward perfect wisdom nor their attributes tokens or signsAs this one does not exude the irreversible qualities such a one gives rise to defilement seeing as this one thinks to attempt exalting one's self and self's concepts above others and deprecates others and thinks these are not equal to such dharmas as oneself is 
The Evil Maras which are anyone's unpracticed untrained inclinations toward such then foresee that the realms of Mara will not remain empty and the great hells the animal kingdom the world of the Pretas and the assemblies of the Asuras are overcrowded 
And what is thought of as Mara and blamed on this Evil One is seen as becoming even more determined and thinking something such as 
With this kind of start any Bodhisattvas such as this are soon smothered by gain and honor 
Furthermore Ananda as a Bodhisattva fights with any person belonging to the vehicle of the Sravakas or Disciples disputes and quarrels with these abuses and reviles these feels illwill and hatred for these a person comes to think to themselves that Mara thinks surely this son or daughter of good family keeps away from allknowledge this one remains far away from this Now also Mara is thought of as being even more jubilant as any person belonging to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas fights with someone else which also belongs to this vehicle of the Bodhisattvas for he thinks that both these Bodhisattvas remain far from allknowledge But as a Bodhisattvawhich has one's prediction fights with another Bodhisattva which also has this prediction and cherishes malice for one such as this  for many aeons this one does as this one may have such an attitude of mind put on the armor  unless of course one has abandoned allknowledge completely Still in this one here sees that it is not Mara but one's own inclinations attitudes and disconcertedness seen as being Mara which brings these unfortunate circumstances to bearas well it will be one's own right intentions and efforts mindfulness and concentrations which comes to reveal these circumstances as dissolved in equanimity and perfect wisdom The Bodhisattvas Right Attitude Towards other Bodhisattvas Ananda Can one escape from these attitudes of mind or is one definitely condemned to go on putting on the armor for all this length of time 
Ananda a dharma is demonstrated which includes the possibility of escape for persons of the Sravaka Disciplevehicle for persons of the Pratyekabuddhavehicle for persons of the Bodhisattvavehicle 
As to this person which belongs to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas and quarrels with someone else which also belongs to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas as one does not confess one's fault does not promise restraint in future harbors a latent bias towards hate and dwells tied to bias this person does not allow for the teaching of escape ie 
It is not  disciplined for me to mete and perceive faults assumed by me or another of others or to think what is being said or even thought about any faults of others is worth listening to As well neither are any which mete and perceive thusly thought of as such For as I am earnestly intent and intentioned I do not do harm to othersAs I indicate joy and contentment by pointing out any and all things which allow for joy and contentment I head this way asthese toward Nirvana yet nevertheless I bear ill willI truly resolve to not bear ill will even against these which I perceive as having offended against me and I truly resolve to avoid rage and I truly resolve by making diligent and persistent effort in this direction 
Even as my life is in danger I truly resolve not to allow a rage or even a frown to appear on my face To such a Bodhisattva Ananda I teach escape 
This is the attitude which a Bodhisattva adopts also towards persons who belong to the vehicle of the Disciples 
What attitude now does a Bodhisattva have towards other persons avowed to this vehicle of the Bodhisattvas 
The same as towards any Teacher One has the attitude that these Bodhisattvas are my teachers Surely these mount on this same vehicle as I have ascended by this same path are of like intention with me are set out in this same vehicle as I 
As however these dwell in an uncontaminated dwelling in mental activities which accord unto allknowledge now I also train as these 
How a Bodhisattva is Trained in AllKnowledge Subhuti 
In which training O Lord does a Bodhisattva train to be trained in allknowledge 
A Bodhisattva trains in Extinction in Nonproduction in Nonstopping in Nobirth in the absence of positivity in Isolatedness in Dispassion in Space in the element of dharma and Nirvana 
The Lord 
Do you think Subhuti this Suchness which is  Tathagatas which is the prime cause of Tathagata being a Tathagata can this become extinct 
Suchness of Tathagata is primordial essence of Tathagata as a Tathagata is this now produced or stopped or born or does this become or cease to become or does this become isolated or impassioned or dispassionate or does this become like space or does this become of the nature of dharma 
Subhuti No Lord 
NowSubhuti any Bodhisattva which trains oneself trains thus Suchness does not indeed can not get extinctas one trains thus one realizes this perfection of all training 
Any being not training thusly is however incapable of this sublime training A weakling cannot train in this training 
As these which train thusly are the very cream of beings which indicate realization to any and all beings these persevere and reach this state of elevated awareness for these beings 
A Bodhisattva which trains thus is not reborn in the hells nor among animals nor in the realms of the Pretas nor among the Asuras nor in outlying districts  nor in the families of outcasts or fowlers of hunters fishermen or butchers nor in any families of a kind in which one is addicted to the lower deeds 
This one is not blind deaf or oneeyed neither a cripple nor hunchbacked nor a being with withered hand or arm nor limping nor lame or stunned  not tremulous quivering or shaky this one's limbs are not puny nor incomplete nor abnormal such a one is not weak nor have a bad complexion or shape these faculties are not inferior nor incomplete but are in every way perfect and this one also has a melodious voice 
Such a one as this is not a person who takes life or who takes what is not given or who goes wrong about sensedesires or who speaks falsely or maliciously or harshly or who prattles indistinctly or who is covetous or who harbours ill will in one's heart or who has wrong views and does not earn a livelihood in some wrong fashion This one is not reborn among the longlived Gods does not take up bad moral practices does not take hold of unreal dharmas and does not get reborn through the influences of trances and  attainments 
But what is this skill in means of a Bodhisattva 
This is just this perfection of wisdom And this one applies oneself to this skill in means in such a way as endowed with this a Bodhisattva enters into these trances without being reborn through the influence of these trances 
As one trains thus any Bodhisattva incurs the perfect purity of these powers of these grounds of selfconfidence of these Buddhadharmas 
One reaches all this Subhuti As we all know O Lord all dharmas are by nature perfectly pure But now with regard to this whichever dharma does any Bodhisattva incur and reach perfect purity of these powers these grounds of selfconfidence and these Buddhadharma 
A Bodhisattva which trains in perfection of wisdom does not lose heart and remains uncowed although all dharmas are by nature perfectly pure now this is this perfection of wisdom 
But the foolish neither know nor see these dharmas are really so constituted and these neither know nor see the true nature of dharmas even as this comes to be revealed 
On behalf of such beings and things the Bodhisattva struggle on and exert vigour so any who do not know may be enabled to know so any who do not see may choose to see 
In this training these train and here  a Bodhisattva realizes these powers through making these available to countless beings these grounds of selfconfidence and all Buddhadharmas 
As these train thus Bodhisattvas wisely  know these throbbing thoughts and actions of any and all beings of any and all persons as these persons really are 
Much more numerous are saline deserts arid deserts places covered with grass or thorns or steep chasms 
Much more numerous are these which train in the training characteristics of Sravakas Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas 
Furthermore Subhuti in the worlds of beings few do deeds which lead to the authority of a universal monarch Much more numerous are these which do deeds which lead to the authority of a commander of a fort 
Much more numerous are these which mount on the path of Sravakas Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas 
Furthermore few only do deeds which permit these to become Sakra Chief of Gods Much more numerous are those whose deeds lead to the world of  Gods 
Much more numerous are these Bodhisattvas which train in the training of Sravakas Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas 
Much more numerous are any whose deeds lead to Brahma's assemblyJust so few beings only are irreversible to full enlightenment 
Still fewer are these very few which make endeavours about and toward perfecting wisdom Still fewer even are these very very few Bodhisattvas which are irreversible from full enlightenment 
A Bodhisattva which aspires to be numbered among these very very few irreversible Bodhisattvas now train in just this perfection of wisdom and make endeavours about this 
Moreover Subhuti no harsh thoughts arise to a Bodhisattva which thus trains in perfecting this nature as wisdom nor any doubting thought or an envious or mean thought or an immoral thought or a thought of ill will or a lazy thought or a distracted thought or a stupid thought 
The Perfection of Wisdom Comprehends All Perfections It is thus as a Bodhisattva trains in the perfection of wisdom  all the perfections are automatically incorporated taken up followed and included 
The view of individuality includes all the sixtytwo views and even so for a Bodhisattva which trains in this perfection of wisdom all the perfections are included in this 
As long as someone's lifefaculty is present all faculties are included in this Even so for a Bodhisattva which trains in this perfection of wisdom all the wholesome dharmas are included in this
