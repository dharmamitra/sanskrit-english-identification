Hearing about this people thought Now let us get sharp swords made for us and then we can take from anybody what is not given we will make an end of them finish them off once for all and cut off their heads
Here a certain ascetic or Brahmin declares and holds the view In as far as this self being furnished and endowed with the fivefold sensepleasures indulges in them then that is when the self realises the highest Nibbana here and now
Here a certain ascetic or Brahmin declares and holds the view Since this self is material composed of the four great elements the product of mother and father at the breakingup of the body it is annihilated and perishes and does not exist after death
Here a certain ascetic or Brahmin has by means of effortattained to such a state of concentration that he dwells perceiving the world as finite

If he lives the household life Hell regulate this wicked world And for what hes done receive

If in such a case there is such a senior teacher but if there are no senior disciples among the monks who are experienced trained skilled who have attained peace from bondage who are able to proclaim the true Dhamma able to refute any opposing doctrines that may arise by means of the true Dhamma and having done so give a grounded exposition of Dhamma then the holy life is not perfected

In just the same way Citta from the cow we get milk from the milk curds from the curds butter from the butter ghee and from the ghee cream of ghee
In just the same way Citta whenever the gross acquired self is present we do not at that time speak of a mindmade acquired self
In just the same way Poṭṭhapāda if others ask us What is this gross acquired self What is this mindmade acquired self What is this formless acquired self we reply This is this acquired self for the getting rid of which we teach a doctrine whereby defiling mental states disappear and states tending to purification grow strong and one gains and remains in the purity and perfection of wisdom here and now having realised and attained it by ones own superknowledge
In just the same way Vasettha in the Ariyan discipline these five strands of sensedesire are called bonds and fetters
In such cases if there are such senior teachers and such senior disciples but there are no monks of middle standing with these qualities
In the same way many thousands of devas came
In the same way you Prince will come to ruin and destruction if you foolishly and unwisely seek the other world in the wrong way
In the same way you Prince will foolishly enter on hidden dangers by unwisely seeking for another world just as that Brahmin lady did in seeking her inheritance
In the same way Lohicca if anyone should say Suppose an ascetic or Brahmin were to discover some good doctrine and thought he ought not to declare it to anyone else for what can one man do for another he would be a source of danger to those young men of good family who following the Dhamma and discipline taught by the Tathāgata attain to such excellent distinction as to realise the fruit of StreamEntry of OnceReturning of NonReturning of Arahantship  and to all who ripen the seeds of a rebirth in the devaworld
In the same way Prince at a sacrifice at which no oxen are slain
In the same way Prince when this body has life heat and consciousness then it goes and comes back stands and sits and lies down sees things with its eyes hears with its ears smells with its nose tastes with its tongue feels with its body and knows mental objects with its mind

In this case there is an ascetic or Brahmin who does not in truth know whether a thing is good or bad
In this matter Poṭṭhapāda those ascetics and Brahmins who say ones perceptions arise and cease without cause or condition are totally wrong
In this sacrifice Brahmin no bulls were slain no goats or sheep no cocks and pigs nor were various living beings subjected to slaughter nor were trees cut down for sacrificial posts nor were grasses mown for the sacrificial grass and those who are called slaves or servants or workmen did not perform their tasks for fear of blows or threats weeping and in tears

Long I wandered unfulfilled in doubt In quest of the Tathagata
Lord do you teach that the summit of perception is just one or that it is many I teach it as both one and many Lord how is it one and how is it many According as he attains successively to the cessation of each perception so I teach the summit of that perception thus I teach both one summit of perception and I also teach many

Young householder it is by abandoning the four defilements of action by not doing evil from the four causes by not following the six ways of wasting ones substance   through avoiding these fourteen evil ways  that the Ariyan disciple covers the six directions and by such practice becomes a conqueror of both worlds so that all will go well with him in this world and the next and at the breakingup of the body after death he will go to a good destiny a heavenly world

nanda has four remarkable and wonderful qualities
nanda have I not told you before All those things that are dear and pleasant to us must suffer change separation and alteration
nanda have you faith in the Tathagatas enlightenment Yes Lord
nanda the devas from ten worldspheres have gathered to see the Tathagata
A disciple goes forth and practises the moralities
And all those who had at that time been the Great Stewards pupils and had fully mastered his teaching were after death at the breakingup of the body reborn in a happy sphere in the Brahmāworld
And King Renus country was in the centre
And so the Great Steward at the end of the seven days shaved off his hair and beard donned yellow robes and went forth from the household life into homelessness
And the Great Steward dwelt suffusing one quarter with a mind filled with lovingkindness then a second then a third and a fourth quarter
And the Lord has gained companions both learners and those who having lived the life have abolished the corruptions and the Lord dwells together with them all rejoicing in the one thing
And the same with the second the third the fourth jhāna
And then they consulted and deliberated together about the matter concerning which they had assembled in the Sudhamma Hall and the Four Great Kings were advised and admonished on this matter as they stood by their seats unmoving
But what sire is the duty of an Ariyan wheelturning monarch It is this my son Yourself depending on the Dhamma honouring it revering it cherishing it doing homage to it and venerating it having the Dhamma as your badge and banner acknowledging the Dhamma as your master you should establish guard ward and protection according to Dhamma for your own household your troops your nobles and vassals for Brahmins and householders town and country folk ascetics and Brahmins for beasts and birds
But Sunakkhatta would the Tathagata make any statement that was ambiguous Lord does the Blessed Lord know by his own mind what would happen to Patikaputta

He went to the seven Brahmins and the seven hundred pupils and told them of his intentions adding So gentlemen you carry on with reciting the mantras you have heard and learnt and teach them to each other Reverend Steward do as you think fit they replied
In due course King Disampati died and the kingmakers anointed Prince Renu King in his place
In these ways you have spoken in praise of me of the Dhamma and of the order among the Vajjians
Lord in earlier days long ago on the fastday of the fifteenth at the beginning of the Rains in the fullmoon night all the ThirtyThree Gods were seated in the Sudhamma Hall  a great congregation of divine beings and the Four Great Kings from the four quarters were there
Lord let the Blessed Lord have a care what he says let the WellFarer have a care what he says What do you mean by saying that to me Lord the Blessed Lord might make an absolute statement about Patikaputtas coming
On such occasions that is the order in which they are seated and after that came our seats
Reverend Sir spare the king and the land and may the god let it rains
Sunakkhatta you have in many ways spoken in praise of me among the Vajjians saying This Blessed Lord is an Arahant a fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct the WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans the Buddha the Blessed Lord
The gifts given to the Lord are wellbestowed his fame is well established so much so that I think the Khattiyas will continue to be attached to him yet the Lord takes his foodoffering without conceit
The king and the land will be safe and the god will let it rain but if the king points the arrow at the crown prince the prince will be completely safe
The king and the land will be safe but if he looses the arrow upwards as far as his realm extends the god will not let it rain for seven years 
The king will be safe but if he looses the arrow downwards the earth will quake as far as his kingdom extends
The mind bends and tends towards knowledge and vision
Then Brahma Sanankumara assumed a single form then he sat down on the couch of Sakka and said What do my lords the ThirtyThree think
Then the Great Steward thought Brahmā Sanankumara offers me a boon
Then the Great Steward went to his forty equal wives and said Whichever of you ladies wishes to may go back to her own family and seek another husband
Then the six nobles went aside again and consulted together These Brahmins are greedy for women
Then the ThirtyThree Gods sat down each in his proper place saying Let us find out what comes of this radiance and having found the truth of it we will go towards it
Then Lord Brahmā Sanankumāra having assumed a grosser form appeared to the ThirtyThree Gods in the shape of the youth Pancasikha
Then Lord Sakka ruler of the gods seeing the satisfaction of the ThirtyThree uttered these verses of rejoicing
There comes a time friends sooner or later after a long period when this world contracts
Therefore there is no such thing as saying By this discipline or practice or austerity or holy life I will bring my unripened kamma to fruition or I will gradually make this ripened kamma go away
They did so and the King said Gentlemen I remember my word
This was the burden of Brahma Sanankumāras speech
This was the burden of Brahma Sanankumāras speech
This was the burden of Brahmā Sanankumāras speech
This was the burden of Brahmā Sanankumāras speech
This was the burden of Brahmā Sanankumāras speech
Wellproclaimed truly is this Lords Teaching visible here and now timeless inviting inspection leading onward to be realised by the wise each one for himself  and we can find no proclaimer of such an onwardleading doctrine either in the past or in the present other than the Lord

Whoever has developed the four roads to power
Yes sire said the King and he performed the duties of an Ariyan wheelturning monarch
And so Lord Steward just wait seven years and then we too will go forth into homelessness
Gentlemen half a month is far too long Then Reverend Steward just wait seven days while we make over our kingdoms to our sons and brothers
gentlemen one year is far too long Then wait seven months
Gentlemen seven months is far too long Then wait six months
In the second place there is someone in whom the gross tendencies of body speech and thought are not allayed
In the third place there is someone who really does not knew what is right and what is wrong what is blameworthy and what is not what is to be practised and what is not what is base and what is noble and what is foul fair or mixed in quality
Those who have unshakeable faith in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and are endowed with the virtues pleasing to the Noble Ones those beings who have arisen here on account of their Dhammatraining amounting to more than twentyfour hundred Magadhan followers who have passed over have by the destruction of three fetters become StreamWinners incapable of falling into states of woe and certain of enlightenment and indeed there are OnceReturners here too
Very good sir said the six nobles and they went to Prince Renu and spoke to him as the Great Steward had proposed
Well Reverend Steward just wait six years

A child with such fine eyes will be
Abandoning the taking of what is not given the ascetic Gotama dwells refraining from taking what is not given living purely accepting what is given awaiting what is given without stealing

If you renounce those lusts that bind most men 
It might be that Your Majesty might have some regrets about the intended sacrifice I am going to lose a lot of wealth or during the sacrifice I am losing a lot of wealth or after the sacrifice I have lost a lot of wealth
