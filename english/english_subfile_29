said Son why have you let the fire go out and the boy told him what had happenedBut he got no fireBut he is not one of our friends and relatives so why should we trust himBut he might come in some altered shape and thus falsify the Blessed Lords wordsbut he was bound and pinioned on this side by a strong chain with his hands behind his backBut he was unable either to shoot the arrow or to withdraw itBut he who reckons cold and heatBut here the nāga kings are safe the LordBut his disciples have not fully mastered that true Dhamma the full purity of the holy life has not become clear and

see the Blessed Lord the fullyenlightened Buddha Very good Lord said Pancasikha and taking his yellow beluvawood lute he approached the Indasāla CaveBut if the past refers to what is factual not fabulous and which is of advantage then the Tathagata knows the right time to replyBut in this way he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conductBut in this way he only becomes an attendant on one who has attainedBut instead of giving me a proper answer they asked me in return Who are you Venerable SirBut it is because a Brahmin is virtuousbut it is not trueBut it occurred to him It is too early to go to Sāvatthi for almsBut it strikes me that the ascetic Gotama does not say I have heard this or It must have been like this but he says It was like this or like that at the timeBut no such things exist Very good sir said the steward and delivered the messageBut now  Ive seen the Buddha and my doubtsBut now I am an aged teacher of long standing

side saying Lord not long ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and said Soon I shall have been a follower of the Lord for three yearsBut Otthaddha just sat down to one side and said When I have seen the Blessed Lord the Arahant the fullyenlightened Buddha I will goBut Poṭṭhapāda saw the Lord coming from a distance and so he called his followers to order saying Be quiet gentlemen dont make a noise gentlemenBut she said Sir it is not the right time to see the Blessed Lord he is in retreat Well then lady when the Blessed Lord rises from his meditation please tell him what I have saidBut should he choose to leave the worldBut should he choose to leave the worldBut should he worldly wealth renounce Hell gain the wealth thats unsurpassedBut since these qualities are heldBut since you have acknowledged the transgression and confessed it as is right we will accept itBut since you recognise the nature of your transgression and make amends as is right we accept your confessionBut somebody else said No that is not how it isBut something more remains to be done It is wonderful Reverend Ananda it is marvellousBut something more remains to be done It is wonderful Reverend Ananda it is marvellousBut sooner or later after a very long period this world begins to expand againbut sought lodging in the forestBut still they were silentbut still we cannot see any soul emergingBut such ascetics can be found of the first second third and fourth grade in a Dhamma and discipline where the Noble Eightfold Path is foundBut such words would not be in accordance with the truth since the King has invited themBut such words would not be in accordance with the truthBut such words would not be in accordance with the truthBut Sunakkhatta thought I might cause this real Arahant ascetic offenceBut that happiness and satisfaction that is obtained by hearing the Dhamma from the Blessed Lord which is not due to blows and wounds does conduce to dispassion detachment cessation peace higher knowledge enlightenment NibbānaBut that is not when the self attains NibbanaBut that is not when the self attains NibbanaBut that is not where the self experiences the highest Nibbana here and

such Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas who persistently neglect what a Brahmin should doBut that such Brahmins who persistently neglect what a Brahmin should doBut that you should come to the Tathagata to ask the fate of each of those who have died that is a weariness to himBut the ascetic Gotama teaches a true and real way of practice which is consonant with Dhamma and grounded in DhammaBut the boy being absorbed in his games let the fire go outBut the Brahmins just sat down to one side and said When we have seen the Lord Gotama we will goBut the Brahmins said It is far too late sir to go to see the ascetic Gotama todayBut the devas intention is having paid homage to the Lords body with heavenly dance and song to carry him to the north of the city bring him in through the north gate and bear him through the middle of the city and out through the eastern gate to the Mallas shrine of MakutaBandhana and there to burn the body Lord if that is the devas intention so be itBut the Four Great Kings are loftier and wiser than we areBut the history of uncivilized man if it were written would provide a vast list of victims all of them innocent who died or suffered to expiate some portent or monstrumBut the lady was in love with somebody elseBut the Lord overheard this conversation between nanda and Subhadda and he called to Ananda Enough Ananda do not hinder Subhadda let him see the TathāgataBut the Lord as swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his flexed arm or flex it again vanished from this side of the Ganges and reappeared with his order of monks on the other shoreBut the Lords words about Aloof from stench I do not understandBut the majority of the yakkhas do not refrain from these things and to do so is distasteful and unpleasant to themBut the mention of the Metta Sutta is interesting because the Khandha Sutta enjoins the practice of lovingkindness to all beings as a form of selfprotectionBut the one who came back with a load of gold pleased his parents his wife and children his friends and colleagues and he derived joy and happiness from it himself as wellBut the other replied as before so the one companion threw away the hempthread and took the hempclothBut the Tathagata is contenthe does not make a display of himself But the Tathāgata knows that in this assembly there is not one monk who has doubts or uncertainty about the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha or about the path or the practiceBut the Venerable Ananda failing to grasp this broad hint this clear sign did not beg the Lord Lord may the Blessed Lord stay for a century may the WellFarer stay for a century for the benefit and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit and happiness of devas and humans so much was his mind possessed by MaraBut the Venerable Kassapa the Great said to the monks Friends enough of your weeping and wailingBut there can be a distinction of persons in this Lord if such is the case I will even wait four years and at the end of that time let the monks give me the goingforth and the monastic ordinationBut there is Brahmā Great Brahmā the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Lord the Maker and Creator the Ruler Appointer and Orderer Father of All That Have Been and Shall BeBut there will be some beings who will think Let us not kill or be killed by anyoneBut these beings on account of good conduct of body speech or thought of praising the Noble Ones have right view and will reap the kammic reward of right viewBut these beings on account of good conduct of body speech or thought of praising the Noble Ones have right view and will reap the kammic reward of right viewBut these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas having sat down on the bank sink down despairingly thinking maybe to find a dry way acrossbut they are not on the path of truthbut they are not satisfied with the practicebut they are not satisfied with what they have heardBut they could not give an answer and so they asked me in returnbut they dont behave as if they were satisfiedbut they dont find it pleasingBut they were very pleased with even that much and they said We have seen Sakka the ruler of the gods and he has answered the questions we put to him And they became my pupils instead of my becoming theirsBut they will attend the sacrifice at which regular family gifts are given to virtuous ascetics because there there are no beatings or throttlingsBut this generation delights in clinging rejoices in it and revels in itBut those devas who are free from craving endure patiently saying All compounded things are impermanent  what is the use of this But those devas who are free from craving endure patiently saying All compounded things are impermanentBut those monks who were free from craving endured mindfully and clearly aware saying All compounded things are impermanent  what is the use of thisBut those who are enslaved by such things are far from the attainment of the unexcelled knowledgeandconduct which is attained by abandoning all such thingsBut those who dwell composed and resoluteBut those who saw them indulging threw dust ashes or cowdung at them crying Die you filthy beastBut those who wanted to do something did it those who did not wish to did not they did what they wanted to do and not what they did not want to doBut though they have such knowledge they still want to live do not want to die they desire comfort and hate sufferingBut Uttara who had given the charity ungrudgingly with his own hands and with proper concern not as something tossed aside was reborn after death at the breakingup of the body in a good place a heavenly realm in the company of the ThirtyThree Godsbut we did not fully master the true DhammaBut we do not see any soul escaping and that is why Reverend Kassapa I believe there is no other worldBut we who were created by that Brahma we are impermanent unstable shortlived fated to fall away and we have come to this worldBut we who are corrupted by pleasure spent an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment play and enjoymentBut we who are corrupted in mindBut what have wretched Patikaputtas in common with themBut what have wretched Pāṭikaputtas in common with themBut what is called thought or mind or consciousness that is a self that is permanent stable eternal not subject to change the same for ever and ever This is the fourth caseBut whatever larger creatures entered or left the city must all go through this very gateBut whatever larger creatures entered or left the city must all go through this very gateBut when he perceives the disappearance of the five hindrances in himself it is as if he were freed from debt from sickness from bonds from slavery from the perils of the desertBut when it has no life heat or consciousness it does none of these thingsBut when it is deprived of life heat and consciousness it is heavier stiffer and more inflexibleBut when it is not accompanied by a man by effort and by the wind then it makes no soundBut when none of these creatures are put to death and the participants have right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration then that sacrifice is of great fruit and profit it is brilliant and of great radianceBut when Sonadanda had traversed the junglethickets he thought If I ask the ascetic Gotama a question he might say to me That Brahmin is not a fitting question it is not at all a fitting question and then the company might despise me saying Sonadanda is a fool he has no sense he cant put a proper question to the ascetic GotamaBut when the self by the subsiding of thinking and pondering enters and abides in the second jhana with inner tranquillity and oneness of mind which is free from thinking and pondering and is born of concentration and accompanied by delight and joy that is when the self realises the highest Nibbana here and nowBut when the self with the waning of delight dwells in equanimity mindful and clearly aware experiencing in his own body that joy of which the Noble Ones say Happy dwells one who has equanimity and mindfulness and so enters and abides in the third jhana that is when the self realises the highest Nibbana here and nowBut when the signs are seen  when a light appears and a radiance shines forth  then Brahmā will appearBut when this self detached from sensedesires detached from unwholesome states enters and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by thinking and pondering and the delight and happiness born of detachment that is when the self realises the highest Nibbana here and nowBut when with the abandonment of pleasure and pain with the disappearance of previous joy and grief one enters and abides in a state beyond pleasure and pain in the fourth jhana which is purified by equanimity and mindfulness that is where the self realises the highest Nibbana here and nowBut where on such comparison and review they are found to conform to the Suttas and the discipline then the conclusion must be Assuredly this is the word of the Buddha it has been rightly understood by this monkBut where on such comparison and review they are found to conform to the Suttas or the discipline the conclusion must be Assuredly this is the word of the Buddha it has been rightly understood by this monkbut who has not gained the goal of asceticismBut with the Lords passing we shall no longer have a chance to do thisBut would the Khattiyas sprinkle him with the Khattiya consecration No Reverend Gotamabut yet you continue to live according to itIn this case the teacher the doctrine and the disciple are all to blamebut you do not follow it you deviate from itBut you should not regard it like thatBut you should not regard it like thatBut you should not regard it like thatBut you should not regard it like thatBut you should not regard it like thatBut you should not regard it so for I was King Mahasudassana thenBut you after having observed the holy life under the Blessed Lord have been reborn in the inferior condition of gandhabbasBut you Ananda in spite of such a broad hint did not understand and did not beg the Tathāgata to stay for a centuryBut you Lord where have you been I have been right here friend But what did you see Lord I saw nothing friend Or what did you hear Lord I heard nothing friend Were you sleeping Lord I was not sleeping friend Then Lord were you conscious Yes friend So Lord being conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard the great rainfall and floods and the thunder and lightning That is so friendBut Ananda I do not see any place in this world with its devas and maras and Brahmas or in this generation with its ascetics and Brahmins princes and people where the Tathagata will for an eighth time discard the bodyBut Brahmin what is this morality and what is this wisdomBut Citta these are merely names expressions turns of speech designations in common use in the world which the Tathāgata uses without misapprehending themBut friends this Dhamma has been well proclaimed by the Lord the fullyenlightened OneBut Kassapa because there is a very different kind of asceticism and Brahmanism beside this it is right to say It is hard to understand an ascetic or a BrahminBut Kassapa because there is a very different kind of asceticism beside this therefore it is right to say It is hard to be an ascetic it is hard to be a BrahminBut Kassapa when a monk develops nonenmity nonillwill and a heart full of loving kindness then that monk is called an ascetic and a Brahmin But Kassapa when a monk develops nonenmity nonillwill and a heart full of lovingkindness and abandoning the corruptions realises and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind the deliverance through wisdom having realised it in this very life by his own insight then Kassapa that monk is called an ascetic and a BrahminBut Kassapa when a monk develops nonenmity nonillwill and a heart full of lovingkindness and abandoning the corruptions realises and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind the deliverance through wisdom having realised it in this very life by his own insight then Kassapa that monk is termed an ascetic and a Brahmin But Lord such happiness and satisfaction which was due to blows and wounds does not conduce to dispassion detachment cessation peace higher knowledge enlightenment NibbanaBut Lord the majority of yakkhas have no faith in the Blessed LordBut Lord the River Kakutthā nearby has clean water pleasant cool pure with beautiful banks delightfulBut monk I dont know where the four great elements cease without remainderBut monk you should not ask your question in this way Where do the four great elements  the earth element the water element the fire element the air element  cease without remainderBut Prince those ascetics and Brahmins who observe morality and are wellconducted do not seek to hasten the ripening of that which is not yet ripe but rather they wisely await its ripeningBut Reverend Kassapa who has told you that the ThirtyThree Gods exist and that they are so longlivedBy all and if a layman still Theyll respect him for past deedsBy completely transcending all perception of matter by the vanishing of the perception of sensereactions and by nonattention to the perception of variety thinking Space is infinite

soundsBy Nibbāna the Illumineds mind is freedBy not understanding the Noble Truth of Suffering we have fared on by not understanding the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering of the Cessation of

perform twice as many So now come halfway the ascetic Gotama has already come halfway to meet you and is sitting for his midday rest in Your Reverences parkHowever many miracles the ascetic Gotama performs I will perform twice as manyHowever much I might praise the ascetic Gotama that praise is insufficient he is beyond all praiseHowever I have heard it said by aged and respectable Brahmins the teachers of teachers that anyone who withdraws into meditation for the four months of the Rains developing the absorption on compassion can see Brahmā with his own eyes talk with him face to face and consult with himHowever there can be a distinction of personsHowever when those beings made a store of rice and lived on that huskpowder and husk began to envelop the grain and where it was reaped it

Janavasabha my hairs stood on end and I thought He whose name is Janavasabha will not be such a lowranking yakkhaI am no longer under his ruleI am not aware of this thing and therefore it does not existI am so delighted with the Lord that I think the Lord is able to teach me to attain and remain in the deliverance called the BeautifulI am supreme in this regard in superausterityI am supreme in

friends certain devas called Corrupted by PleasureI asked them how this came about and when they could not explain I said There are friends certain devas called Corrupted in MindI asked them how this came about and when they could not explain I said There are friends certain devas called UnconsciousI asked you where the four great elements cease without remainderI clearly perceive that in this assembly there is not one monk who has doubts or uncertainty You Ananda speak from faithI could then pick out the very best of the herd for my kill and having had a good feast of tender meat return to my lairI declare that such a thing is an evil deed rooted in attachment for what can one man do for anotherI declare this to be an evil doctrine rooted in attachmentThis is the second teacher who is

SanghaI got up and leftI got up and leftI grant them life let them be fed with green grass and given cool water to drink and let cool breezes play upon themI had better let them pay homage family by family saying Lord the Malla soandso with his children his wife his servants and his friends pays homage at the Lords feet And so he presented them in that way and thus allowed all the Mallas of Kusinārā to pay homage to the Lord in the first watchI had better make an end of him finish him off once for all and cut his head offI had better take this child to my hermitage take care of him feed him and bring him upI have also heard and received it from the Blessed Lords own lips that it is not possible it cannot be that in one and the same worldsystem two Arahant supreme Buddhas should arise simultaneouslyI have been like a king to kings like Brahma to the Brahmins like a deity to householders and I am giving all this up in order to go forth from the household life into homelessness as I have explained If the Reverend Steward goes forth from the household life into homelessness we will do likewiseI have been reborn among the Kālakañja asuras the very lowest grade of asurasI have been reborn among the Kālakañja asuras the very lowest grade of asurasI have by means of effort exertion attained to such a state of mental concentration that I have thereby recalled various past existencesI have gone to them and said Reverend sirs is it true that you declare that all things began with the creation by a god or Brahma Yes they repliedI have had my fill of human pleasures now is the time to seek heavenly pleasuresI have heard and received this from that community then monks you should neither approve nor disapprove his wordsI have heard and received this from that elderI have

coraltree flower thereI propose to go to visit him Very good Lord said Pancasikha and taking his yellow beluvawood lute he followed in attendance on SakkaI replied that I was Sakka ruler of the gods and they asked me what had brought me thereI said to her Lady please salute the Blessed Lord for me and say Sakka the king of the gods with his ministers and followers pays homage at the Lords feetI said to him You foolish man do you claim to be a follower of the Sakyan Lord what do you mean by this question Sunakkhatta did you not go to see Kaḷāramuṭṭhaka and ask him a question he could not answer and did he not thereupon show signs of anger rage and petulanceI said Do you know a path or a practice whereby an entirely happy world might be brought about and they replied NoI said Have you ever experienced a single night or day or half a night or day that was entirely happy and they replied NoI said Have you heard the voices of deities who have been reborn in an entirely happy world saying The attainment of an entirely happy world has been well and rightly gained and we gentlemen have been reborn in such a realm and they replied NoI said It is amazing it is astonishing that the reverend yakkha Janavasabha should say thisI said Sunakkhatta that naked ascetic Patikaputta is not capable of meeting me face to face unless he takes back his words abandons that thought and gives up that viewI said This is the only straight pathI said What do you think SunakkhattaI say that it is by something more farreaching and excellent that I train them through which theyrecognise as their principal support and the perfection of the holy lifeI served the Sangha cheerfullyI shall spend the Rains here in Beluva Very good Lord replied the monks and they did so but the Lord spent the Rains

forth from the household life into homelessnessI will teach you Dhamma SubhaddaI will therefore go forth from the household life into the homeless state Reverend Steward do as you think fitI will wait four years and then let them give me the goingforth and the ordination But the Lord said to Ananda Let Subhadda go forth Very good Lord said AnandaI wish to go forth from the household life into homelessnessI wish to go forth from the household life into homelessnessI serving you Heard the Noble Ones good words And so Im born a Sakkason Mighty in the Threefold Heaven And resplendent whereas you Though you served the Prince of MeniiIf a Brahmin had the other four qualities he could be recognised as a true BrahminIf a Brahmin is virtuous of increasing virtueIf a company of monks comes to see Ananda they are pleased at the sight of him and when Ananda talks Dhamma to them they are pleased and when he is silent they are disappointedIf a fellow in the holy life quotes Dhamma in the assembly and if you think he has either misunderstood the sense or expressed it wrongly you should neither applaud nor reject it but should say to him Friend if you mean suchandsuch you should put it either like this or like that which is the more appropriate or If you say suchandsuch you mean either this or that which is the more appropriateIf a layman no adversary No foe can stand before himIf a layman thus hell beIf a naked ascetic were to do all these things and if this were the measure and practice of the difficulty the great difficulty of understanding an ascetic or Brahmin it would not be right to say that because any householdercould understand itIf a naked ascetic were to do all these things and if this were the measure and practice of the difficulty the great difficulty of being an ascetic or Brahmin it would not be right to say It is hard to be an ascetic it is hard to be a Brahmin because any householder or householders son  even the slavegirl who draws water  could do this

male or female gandhabbaIf anyone truthfully declaring Wellproclaimed by the Lord is the Dhamma visible here and now timeless inviting inspection leading onward to be comprehended by the wise each one for himself were to say Open are the doors of the Deathless  he would be speaking in accordance with the highest truthIf anyone were to refer to any holy way of life as being fully successful and perfect with nothing lacking and nothing superfluous wellproclaimed in the perfection of its purity it is this holy life they would be describingIf ascetic he becomes Then loved as healer of folks woesIf asked Is there any such at present I should say NoIf asked What conditions ageinganddeath you should answer Ageinganddeath is conditioned by birthIf asked What conditions consciousness you should answer Mindandbody conditions consciousness If asked Will there be any such in the futureIf asked Will there be any such in the futureIf consciousness were not to come into the mothers womb

in himself he knows that it is absentIf he does not leave the world Hell be a wheelrevolving kingIf he does not renounce the world Hell turn the Wheel and rule the earthIf he does so we will put this question to him Lord what is this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples and which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support and the perfection of the holy life At this the wanderers were silentIf he had the other three qualities he could be recognised as a true BrahminIf he lives the household life he will become a ruler a wheelturning righteous monarch of the law conqueror of the four quarters who has established the security of his realm and is possessed of the seven treasuresIf he lives the household life he will become a ruler a wheelturning righteous monarch of the law conqueror of the four quarters who has established the security of his realm and is possessed of the seven treasuresIf he lives the household life he will become a ruler a wheelturning righteous monarch of the lawBut if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness then he will become an Arahant a fullyenlightened Buddha one who draws back the veil from the worldIf he lives the household life he will become a ruler a wheelturning righteous monarch of the law conqueror of the four quarters who has established the security of his realm and is possessed of the seven treasuresIf he performs two I will perform fourIf he practises what he is taught then within seven years he will attain in this life to that unequalled holy life and goal for the sake of which young men of good family go forth from the household life into homelessness by his own knowledge and realisation and he will abide thereinIf he replies This meaning is better expressed like this than like that or The sense of this expression is this rather than that then his words should be neither rejected nor disparaged but you should explain to him carefully the correct meaning and expressionIf he sees that this company is quiet he will most likely want to come and visit usIf he sees that this company is quiet he will most likely want to come and visit usIf he sees that this company is quiet he will most likely want to come and visit usIf he thinks otherwise his head will split in piecesIf he were to deduct anything from it thinking In this way it will be purer he does not see itIf I felt attachment that would distress me and if I were distressed that would be a hindrance to meIf I felt desire lust hatred or aversion that would be attachment on my partIf I give it up they will say What a fool Prince Pāyāsi isIf I give it up they will say What a fool Prince Pāyāsi isIf I give it up they will say What a fool Prince Pāyāsi is how stupidly he grasps at wrong views I will stick to this view out of anger contempt and spiteIf I were to think and imagine these perceptions would cease and coarser perceptions would arise in meIf it refers to what is factual not fabulous but which is not of advantage the Tathagata makes no replyIf it saw land anywhere it flew thereIf it should go out here is an axe here are some sticks here are the firesticks so you can relight the fire and look after itIf layman he will prosper muchIf now I teach Dhamma first to Khanda and Tissa they will understand it quicklyIf one were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing slaying cutting or causing to be cut burning or causing to be burnt there would be no evil as a result of that no evil would accrueIf only he were possessed of the same calm as this order of monksIf only the ascetic Gotama would ask me a question from my own field of the Three VedasIf others praise me the Dhamma or the Sangha you should acknowledge the truth of what is true saying That is correct that is right that is our way that is found among usIf renounced possessionless As Buddha they will worship himIf Sakka Lord of ThreeandThirty GodsIf sensual desire is absent in himself a monk knows that it is absentIf such things did not exist No mother from her son would getIf such wanderers were able to discern in themselves even one of such qualities they would proclaim it with a bannerIf the Ariyan disciple does not act out of attachment illwill folly or fear he will not do evil from any one of the four causesIf the ascetic Gotama will come halfway to meet me I will do likewiseIf the child is a boy one portion will be his and if it is a girl she will become your servantIf the enlightenmentfactor of equanimity is absent in himself he knows that it is

were to give a proper discourse on past lives the monks would listen and remember it Well then monks listen pay close attention and I will speakIf the Lord were to give a proper discourse on past lives the monks would listen and remember it Well then monks listen pay close attention and I will speak Yes Lord the monks replied and the Lord saidIf the Prince has done so why should not weIf the Reverend Sonadanda goes to visit the ascetic Gotama his reputation will decrease and that of the ascetic Gotama will increaseIf the Reverend Steward goes forth into homelessness we will do likewiseIf the wanderers professing other doctrines were able to discern in themselves even one of such qualities they would proclaim it with a bannerIf there is anyone who thinks I shall take charge of the order or The order should refer to me let him make some statement about the order but the Tathagata does not think in such termsIf there were absolutely no clinging sensuous clinging clinging to views to riteandritual to personalitybelief could becoming appearIf there were absolutely no craving for sights sounds smells tastes tangibles mindobjects could clinging appearIf they can do this in the presence of the Lord Buddha Vipassi why should not weIf they on such comparison and review are found not to conform to the Suttas or the discipline the conclusion must be Assuredly this is not the word of the Buddha it has been wrongly understood by this monk and the matter is to be rejectedIf we compare DN we find that that discourse is addressed to the novice Cunda who is quite a different character  but we may wonder whether the two have not become confusedIf with a razorsharp wheel one were to make of this earth one single mass and heap of flesh there would be no evil as a result of that no evil would accrueIf you ask Isnt there another worldBothNeitherIs there fruit and result of good and bad deeds Isnt thereBothNeitherDoes the Tathagata exist after death Does he notBothNeitherIf you come we will make you the winner and let the ascetic Gotama be defeatedIf you develop the emancipation of the heart through lovingkindness illwill has no chance to envelop your heartIf you do so then Mara will find no lodgement no footholdIf you do so your lifespan will increase your beauty will increase your happiness will increase your wealth will increase your power will

you in futureIf you find no such root of contention then you should work to prevent its overcoming you in futureIf you practise accordingly these tainted things will be abandoned and the things that make for purification will develop and grow and you will all attain to and dwell in this very life by your own insight and realisation in the fullness of perfected wisdomIf you want to Sunakkhatta you can go to him and ask him if he knows his fateIf you want union with Brahmā  which you had much better not want  this is the way to attain it ignores the outcome as reported by DAIf you were to be angry or displeased at such disparagement that would only be a hindrance to youIf you were to be pleased happy or elated at such praise that would only be a hindrance to youIf Your Majesty were to tax this region that would be the wrong thing to doIf Ananda there were no birth at all anywhere of anybody or anything of devas to the devastate of gandhabbas of yakkhas of ghosts of humans of quadrupeds of birds of reptiles to the reptile state if there were absolutely no birth at all of all these beings then with the absence of all birth the cessation of birth could ageinganddeath appear No Lord Therefore Ananda just this is the root the cause the origin the condition for ageinganddeath  namely birthIf Ananda you had begged him the Tathagata would twice have refused you but the third time he would have consentedIf Ananda you had begged him the Tathāgata would twice have refused you but the third time he would have consentedIf friends you should discover such a root of contention among yourselves or among others you should strive to get rid of just that root of contentionIf friends you should discover such a root of contention among yourselves or among others you should strive to get rid of just that root of contentionIf gentlemen I gain the kingship I will share it with you If supremely strong he leaves the world He will be the chief of beings No man greater will be foundIgnorance and craving for existence immersed in happiness who supremely blissful experience only perfect happiness such as the Lustrous devasin a longlived group of devas or he is born in the border regions among foolish barbarians where there is no access for monks and nuns or male and female layfollowers or he is born in the Middle Country but he has wrong views and distorted vision thinking There is no giving offering or sacrificing there is no fruit or result of good or bad deeds there is not this world and the next world there are no parents and there is no spontaneous rebirth there are no ascetics and Brahmins in the world who having attained to the highest and realised for themselves the highest knowledge about this world and the next proclaim it  orIn another village

in another silver in another goldIn any case the method of listing items in expanding numerical groups was used on a large scale in the Anguttara Nikaya and in fact quite a number of entries in the lists in this Sutta appear there tooSuch numerical listing has also been compared by different writers from RD onwards to the socalled matrices of the Abhidhamma  partly with the implication that this type of presentation always represents a stratum considerably later than the Buddhas timeIn any case when such numerical lists were in existence they readily lent themselves to expansion and it is likely that the material of this Sutta dates from a variety of periods and because some of it is obviously late this does not mean that other parts are not earlyIn beings subject to ageing to disease to death to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress this wish arises Oh that we were not subject to ageingIn beings subject to birth monks this wish arises Oh that we were not subject to birth that we might not come to birth But this cannot be gained by wishingIn Buddha Dhamma firmly trustingin chatteringIn Dhammas great and lesser waysIn fact he gave up much gold and wealth to go forth both hidden away and openly displayedIn fact I have witnessed this myselfIn fact we do not know to what extent the Buddha himself resorted to the obvious pedagogic device of teaching by numbersIn fact householder if the ascetic Gotama were to come to this assembly we would baffle him with a single question we would knock him over like an empty potIn former lives he thus dispensedIn giving selfcontrol abstinence and telling the truth there is no merit and no merit accruesIn happy place reborn he thereIn happy realm reborn he thereIn happy realm reborn he thereIn him who knows and sees

Theravada school on this scoreIn mindfulness when claimed by death Have now regained it with my helpIn my time the lifespan is short limited and quick to pass it is seldom that anybody lives to be a hundredIn order to give these folk confidence may the Blessed Lord leam the Aṭanaṭa protective verses by means of which monks and nuns male and female layfollowers may dwell guarded protected unharmed and at their easeIn practising for calm and insightIn Realms of Brahmās RetinueIn Rāmagāmas kept by naga kingsIn short the five aggregates of grasping are sufferingin sleepingin companyin evil desiresin mixing and associating with evil friendsIn so doing it became taken with the flavour and craving arose in itin solitudein solitude  would you then say That man must come back and be a slave and work for me as beforeIn such cases Your Majesty should not entertain such regretsIn terms of dhammasIn that case my reputation would suffer and if a mans reputation suffers his income suffersIn that case one might say to him Friend you have failed you have missed your opportunity your teacher is fully enlightened his doctrine is wellproclaimedIn that way we shall put the Reverend Gotama to the testIn the case of painful progress with quick comprehension progress is considered poor on account of painfulnessIn the case of painful progress with slow comprehension progress is considered poor on account of both painfulness and slownessIn the case of pleasant progress with quick comprehension progress is considered excellent on account of both pleasantness and quick comprehensionIn the case of pleasant progress with slow comprehension progress is considered poor on account of slownessIn the course of time the Steward died and King Disampati mourned him saying Alas at the very moment when we had entrusted all our responsibilities to the Steward and were abandoning ourselves to the pleasures of the five senses the Steward has passed awayIn the early morning I went with robe and bowl into Uttarakā for alms with Sunakkhatta as my attendantIn the fifth place after death at the breakingup of the body he arises in a good place a heavenly worldIn the fifth place after death at the breakingup of the body he arises in an evil state a bad fate in suffering and hellIn the first place someone dwells in association with sensedesires with unwholesome conditionsIn the first place an ascetic or Brahmin who has not managed to gain this unexcelled attainment takes his carryingpole and plunges into the depths of the forest thinking I will live on windfallsIn the first place he

dies unconfusedIn the gold chamber was a silver couch in the silver chamber a gold couch in the beryl chamber an ivory couch and in the crystal chamber a sandalwood couchIn the past few days Lord the discussion among the ascetics and Brahmins of various schools sitting together and meeting in the debatinghall has concerned the higher extinction of consciousness and how this takes placeIn the same way a monk with mind concentratedIn the same way the Bodhisatta issues forth stainlessIn the same way monk you have been as far as the Brahma world searching for an answer to your question and not finding it and now you come back to meIn the same way Prince you should consider There is another worldIn the same way Prince you should consider There is another worldIn the same way Sire a monk with mind concentrated purified and cleansedIn the second place he gets a bad reputation for immorality and misconductIn the second place he gets a good reputation for morality and good conductIn the service of their kingIn the third place whatever assembly he approaches whether of Khattiyas Brahmins householders or ascetics he does so diffidently and shylyIn the third place whatever assembly he approaches whether of Khattiyas Brahmins householders or ascetics he does so with confidence and assuranceIn these teachings beautiful in the beginning the middle and the ending which in spirit and in

using foresight in carrying them out and is good at doing and planning he loves the Dhamma and delights in hearing it he is especially fond of the advanced doctrine and discipline  he is content with any kind of requisites robes almsfood lodging medicines in case of illness he ever strives to arouse energy to get rid of unwholesome states to establish wholesome states untiringly and energetically striving to keep such good states and never shaking off the burden he is mindful with a great capacity for clearly recalling things done and said long ago  he is wise with wise perception of arising and passing away that Ariyan perception that leads to the complete destruction of sufferingIn these things there is agreement there let the wise take up crossquestion and criticise these matters with the teachers or with their followers saying Of those things that are unskilful and reckoned as such censurable to be refrained from unbefitting a Noble One black and reckoned as such  who is there who has completely abandoned such things and is free from them the ascetic Gotama or some other venerable teachersIn this case the teacher and the doctrine are praiseworthy and the pupil is also

ascetics and Brahmins about whom this or that is reported  the ascetic Gotamas fame is based on his achievement of unsurpassed wisdom and conductIt is only in you that this evil view has arisenIt is only in you that this evil view has arisenIt is only when the Tathagata withdraws his attention from outward signs and by the cessation of certain feelings enters into the signless concentration of mind that his body knows comfortIt is quoted with translation by KIt is rare for a Tathagata a fullyenlightened Buddha to arise in the world and tonight in the last watch the Tathāgata will attain final Nibbana and this mighty monk is standing in front of the Lord preventing us from getting a last glimpse of the TathāgataIt is right that a man of wisdom should show it by performing miraclesIt is that craving which gives rise to rebirth bound up with pleasure and lust finding fresh delight now here now there that is to say sensual craving craving for existence and craving for nonexistenceIt is the complete fadingaway and extinction of this craving its forsaking and abandonment liberation from it detachment from itIt is the idea of a fool to give this gift the talk of those who preach a

moral practice that the worldling would praise the TathagataIt looked just like the skin that forms itself over hot milk as it coolsIt looks even brighter than the golden robes in which it is clothed Just so AnandaIt seduces a man drawing him into this or that state of becoming so that he is reborn in high states or lowIt should perhaps be stressed that arid as this type of Sutta may appear to

the Reverend Gotama help the people of BrahmaIt would be good to have a declaration about this it would make the multitude have faith and so attain a good rebirthIt would be well if the ascetic Gotama were to explain this to me Then listen Brahmin pay proper attention and I will explain Yes sir said Kūṭadanta and the Lord saidIt would be well if the Lord were to cause some monk to perform superhuman feats and miraclesIt would be well if the Lord were to let these people see him Then Siha prepare a seat in the shade of this dwelling Yes Lord said Siha and did soIt would be well if the Reverend Gotama were to explain the meaning of thisIt would be well Venerable Kassapa to allow these people to see him Well then Siha you announce them to the Lord Yes Venerable Sir said SihaIt would not be right not to give something to those who are not cooking thinking If I make this gift I shall acquire a good reputation in order to adorn and prepare ones heartIts known the youth will be longlivedIts not right its not proper for you to mix with such people That is the way the Brahmins abuse us LordIll have a restIll have a restIll have a restIll stir up energyIll stir up energyIm like a fish thats caught on baited hookJust as a ball of string when thrown runs till it is all unravelled so fools and wise run on and circle round till they make an end of sufferingJust as a bird with wings flies hither and thither burdened by nothing but its wings so he is satisfiedJust as a dulyanointed Khattiya king having conquered his enemies by that very fact sees no danger from any side so the monk on account of his morality sees no danger anywhereJust as a father is beloved by his children so he was with Brahmins and householdersJust as a file of blind men go on clinging to each other and the first one sees nothing the middle one sees nothing and the last one sees nothing  so it is with the talk of these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas the first one sees nothing the middle one sees nothing the last one sees nothingJust as a flax flower which is blue of blue colour of blue lustre or a Benares cloth smoothed on both sides that is blueJust as a hibiscus flower which is redJust as a skilled fisherman or his apprentice might cover a small piece of water with a finemeshed net thinking Whatever larger creatures there may be in this water they are all trapped in the net caught and held in the net so it is with all these they are trapped and caught in this netJust as a skilled turner or his assistant in making a long turn knows that he is making a long turn or in making a short turn knows that he is making a short turn so too a monk in breathing in a long breath knows that he breathes in a long breathJust as an old cart is made to go by being held together with straps so the Tathagatas body is kept going by being strapped upJust as bison circling around keep to the fringes so it is with the ascetic GotamaJust as Brahmās worshipped by the gods So likewise today we worship you Enlightened One and Teacher unsurpassed Whom none can equal in the human world Or in the heavens dwelling of the godsJust as everybody loves a blue yellow or white lotus so they all loved Prince VipassiJust as if on being asked about a mango he were to describe a breadfruittree or on being asked about a breadfruittree he were to describe a mango so Pūraṇa Kassapa on being asked about the present fruits of the homeless life explained nonaction to meJust as if on being asked about a mango he were to describe a breadfruittreeJust as if there were near a town or village many different paths  do all these come together at that placeJust as in the Himālaya mountains the karavīkabird has a voice sweeter more beautiful charming and delightful than all other birds so too was Prince Vipassīs voice the finest of allJust as it is now the people who show respect for mother and father for ascetics and Brahmins for the head of the clan who are praised and honoured so it will be with those who do the oppositeJust as medicine to him whos ill Or nourishment to one whos starving still Bring me gracious lady sweet releaseJust as one hand washes the other or one foot the other so wisdom is purified by morality and this combination is called the highest thing in the worldJust as pleasure might give birth to rejoicing so from pleasant feeling he experiences gladnessJust as pleasure might give birth to rejoicing so from pleasant feeling he experiences gladnessJust as that Sage would be rejoiced if heJust as the banditchiefs whom the King of Magadha has overcome do not heed him or his officers or their attendants so too do they behavejust as the Blessed Lord does nowJust as the devacity of lakamandā is rich prosperous and wellpopulated crowded with yakkhas and wellstocked with food so was the royal city of KusāvatīJust as the devacity of ḷakamandā is rich so was the royal city of KusavatiJust as was the case beforeJust as when a jewel is laid on muslin from Kāsī the jewel does not stain the muslin or the muslin the jewelJust as when butter or oil is burnt no ashes or dust remain so it was with the Lords body only the bones were leftJust like a

Janesabha Pañcasikha Timbarū with Suriyavaccasāneither exist nor not exist after death I have not declared that the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death and that all else is falseNeither lust nor fear could gain a holdNeither moon nor sun appeared no constellations or stars appeared night and day were not distinguished nor months and fortnights no years or seasons and no male and female beings being reckoned just as beingsNeither of these things is possible because pleasure and pain have been measured out with a measure limited by the round of birthanddeath and there is neither increase nor decrease neither excellence nor inferiorityneither The self is conscious after death Never before has the Tathāgata been so honoured revered esteemed worshipped and adoredNext

whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support and the perfection of the holy lifeNigrodha I do not speak for any of these reasonsNine abodes of beings Nine causes of malice Nine conditions rooted in wise consideration When a monk practises wise consideration joy arises in him and from his being joyful delight arises and from his feeling delight his senses are calmed as a result of this calming he feels happiness and from his feeling happy his mind becomes concentrated with his mind thus concentrated he knows and sees things as they really are with his thus knowing and seeing things as they really are he becomes disenchanted with disenchantment he becomes dispassionate and by dispassion he is liberatedNine differences Owing to difference of element

pronounced by Brahmā SanankumāraAmong all the teachers now existing in the world Cunda I see none who has attained to such a position of fame and following as I haveAmong the generation whose lifespan was a thousand years false opinions increasedAmong the people with an eighty thousandyear lifespan girls will become marriageable at five hundredAmong those of a tenyear lifespan no account will be taken of mother or aunt of mothers sisterinlaw of teachers wife or of ones fathers wives and so on  all will be promiscuous in the world like goats and sheep fowl and pigs dogs and jackalsAnanda after you spoke to me about the devotees of Magadha I took my robe and bowl and went into Nadika for almsAnanda as long as the Vajjians meet in harmony break up in harmony and carry on their business in harmony they may be expected to prosper and not declineAnanda dont call it a miserable little town of wattleanddaub right in the jungle in the back of beyondAnanda dont call it a miserable little town of wattleanddaub right in the jungle in the back of beyondAnanda immediately after I heard this voice the yakkha appeared before me as a noble vision and uttered a second cry I am Bimbisara LordAnanda insofar as a monk having known as they really are these seven stations of consciousness and these two spheres their origin and cessation their attraction and peril is freed without attachment that monk Ananda is called one who is liberated by wisdomAnanda so long as such proper provision is madethe Vajjians may be expected to prosper and not declineAnanda the monk Saḷha by the destruction of

worthy of a stupaAnanda there are four places the sight of which should arouse emotion in the faithfulAnanda when once a monk attains these eight liberations in forward order in reverse order and in

the uncorrupted liberation of heart and liberation by wisdom that monk is called bothwaysliberated  and Ananda there is no other way of bothwaysliberation that is more excellent or perfect than thisAnanda whoever has developed the four roads to power practised them frequently made them his vehicle made them his base established them become familiar with them and properly undertaken them could undoubtedly live for a century or the remainder of oneAnanda you may remember this exposition of Dhamma as the Net of Advantage the Net of Dhamma the Supreme Net the Net of Views or as the Incomparable Victory in BattleAnd a great crowd from the royal capital city Ban dhumati eightyfour thousand people heard that Prince Vipassi had gone forth into homelessnessAnd a Khattiya who has performed deeds of both kinds in body speech and thought and whose view is mixed will in consequence of such mixed views and deeds at the breakingup of the body after death experience both pleasure and painAnd a Khattiya who is restrained in body speech and thought and who has developed the seven requisites of enlightenment  will attain to Parinibbana in this very lifeAnd a man of the generation that lived for forty thousand years took what was not givenAnd a man of the generation that lived for twenty thousand years took what was not givenAnd a second wheelturning monarch did likewise and a third a fourth a fifth a sixth and a seventh king alsoAnd a third time the monk said Friend I did not ask you that I asked where the four great elements  earth water fire air  cease without remainderAnd among the generation whose lifespan was five hundred years three things increased incest excessive greed and deviant practicesAnd among the generation whose lifespan was five thousand years two things increased harsh speech and idle chatter in consequence of which peoples lifespan decreased their beauty decreased and as a result the children of those whose lifespan had been five thousand years lived some for twoandahalf thousand years and some for only two thousandAnd among the generation whose lifespan was twoandahalf thousand years covetousness and hatred increased and in consequence peoples lifespan decreased their beauty decreased and as a result the children of those whose lifespan had been twoandahalf thousand years lived for only a thousandAnd among those whose lifespan was two hundred and fifty years these things increased lack of respect for mother and father for ascetics and Brahmins and for the head of the clanAnd anyone who says Feeling is not my self but my self is not impercipient my self is of a nature to feel should be asked Well friend if all feelings absolutely and totally ceased could there be the thought I am this  No LordAnd as he was being driven to the pleasurepark Prince Vipassi saw a large crowd collecting clad in many colours and carrying a bierAnd as he was being driven to the pleasurepark Prince Vipassi saw a shavenheaded man one who had gone forth wearing a yellow robeAnd as he was being driven to the pleasurepark Prince Vipassi saw a sick man suffering very ill fallen in his own urine and excrement and some people were picking him up and others putting him to bedAnd as he was being driven to the pleasurepark Prince Vipassi saw an aged man bent like a roofbeam broken leaning on a stick tottering sick his youth all vanishedAnd as such would he be solicitous for their welfare or not He would not Reverend GotamaAnd at that time there were eightyfour thousand religious residences in JambudipaAnd at that time in the royal capital of Bandhumati there was a vast gathering of six million eight hundred thousand  monksAnd at that time King Mahasudassanas eightyfour thousand elephants waited on him evening and morningAnd exactly the same thing happened with another manAnd for those of a tenyear lifespan there will come to be a swordinterval of seven days during which they will mistake one another for wild beastsAnd have you perceived all the Arahant Buddhas who will appear in the future No LordAnd having gone forth he dwells restrained by the restraint of the rules persisting in right behaviour seeing danger in the slightest faults observing the commitments he has taken on regarding body deed and word devoted to the skilled and purified life perfected in morality with the sensedoors guarded skilled in mindful awareness and contentAnd he with mind concentrated purified and cleansed unblemished free from impurities malleable workable established and having gained imperturbability applies and directs his mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the corruptionsAnd he with mind concentratedAnd he with mind concentratedAnd he with mind concentratedAnd he with mind concentratedAnd he with mind concentratedAnd he with mind concentratedapplies and directs his mind to the knowledge of others mindsAnd how is a monk clearly awareAnd how is a monk contentedAnd how is a monk mindfulAnd how householders son does the Ariyan disciple protect the six directionsAnd how monks does a monk abide contemplating feelings as feelingsAnd how monks does a monk abide contemplating mind as mindAnd how monks does a monk abide contemplating mindobjects as mindobjectsAnd how monks does a monk abide contemplating the body as bodyAnd how monks in short are the five aggregates of grasping sufferingAnd how Sire is a monk accomplished in mindfulness and clear awarenessAnd how Sire is he a guardian of the sensedoorsAnd I said You need not worry Evil OneAnd I Bhaggava who teach this and declare this am wrongly vainly lyingly and falsely accused by some ascetics and Brahmins who say The ascetic Gotama is on the wrong track and so are his monksAnd I Kevaddha have experienced these three miracles by my own superknowledgeAnd if anyone were to say to a monk whose mind was thus freed The Tathagata exists after death that would be a wrong opinion and unfitting likewise The Tathagata does not exist both exists and does not exist neither exists nor does not exist after deathAnd if anyone were to speak thus of King Pasenadi he would be a source of danger to the Kings tenants yourself and othersAnd in a heart full of hatred is there wrong view or right view Wrong view Reverend Gotama And in that time of the people with an eighty thousandyear lifespan there will arise in the world a Blessed Lord an Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha named Metteyya endowed with wisdom and conduct a WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessed just as I am nowAnd in the time of the people with an eighty thousandyear lifespan there will arise in the capital city of Ketumati a king called Sankha a wheelturning monarch a righteous monarch of the law conqueror of the four quartersAnd indeed it is good to see such ArahantsAnd it can happen that a being having fallen from that state arises in this worldAnd it can happen that a being having fallen from that state arises in this worldAnd it may be that those of other sects might say Are the followers of the Sakyan given to these four forms of pleasureseekingAnd just now today Ananda at the Cāpāla Shrine Mara came to me stood to one side and said Lord may the Blessed Lord now attain final NibbanaNow is the time for the Blessed Lords final NibbanaAnd King Bandhuma appointed nurses for Prince VipassiAnd nobody is to come near me except to bring me food Reverend Steward do as you think fit And now today at the Cāpāla Shrine I said These places are delightfulAnd now Ananda go to Kusinara and announce to the Mallas of Kusinara Tonight Vasetthas in the last watch the Tathagata will attain final NibbanaAnd now Lord the Blessed Lord has such monks and disciplesAnd of the generation that lived for ten thousand years some were beautiful and some were uglyAnd of those eightyfour thousand cities I dwelt in just one KusavatiAnd owing to the results of past kamma the divine eye was present to Prince Vipassi with which he could see for a league day and night alikeAnd Prince Vipassi had a sweet voice a beautiful voice charming and delightfulAnd Prince Vipassi was unblinkingly watchful like the ThirtyThree GodsAnd Pāṭikaputta heard that all these people had come to his park and that the ascetic Gotama had gone there for his midday restAnd Pāṭikaputta said Im coming friend Im coming but wriggle as he might he could not get up from his seatAnd Pāṭikaputta said Im coming friend Im coming but wriggle as he might he could not get up from his seatAnd saying So be it the king accepted the chaplains advice he gave grain and fodder capital to those in tradeAnd similarly if you think he has got the right meaning but expressed it wronglyAnd so it is with those ascetics and Brahmins who declare and believe that after death the self is entirely happy and free from diseaseAnd so it is monks that by his penetration of the fundamentals of Dhamma the Tathagata remembers the past Buddhas who have attained final Nibbana cutting through multiplicity blazing a trail have exhausted the round have passed by all suffering he recalls their births their names their clan their lifespan their twindisciples their assemblies of disciples These Blessed Lords were born thus were called thus thus was their clan thus was their morality their Dhamma their wisdom their dwelling thus was their liberation And so Prince Khanda and Tissa the chaplains son received the goingforth at the hands of the Lord Buddha Vipassi and they received ordinationAnd so they will do these things and on account of this they will increase in lifespan and in beautyAnd so Ambattha not only are you and your teacher incapable of attaining this unexcelled knowledge and conduct but even the four paths of failure are beyond youAnd so Ananda feeling conditions craving craving conditions seeking seeking conditions acquisition acquisition conditions decisionmaking decisionmaking conditions lustful desire lustful desire conditions attachment attachment conditions appropriation appropriation conditions avarice avarice conditions guarding of possessions  and because of the guarding of possessions there arise the taking up of stick and sword quarrels disputes arguments strife abuse lying and other evil unskilled statesAnd so Lord I now ask the Blessed Lord Just as there are these various craftsmenAnd so monks the Bodhisatta Vipassi descended from the Tusita heaven mindful and clearly aware into his mothers wombAnd so with mind concentrated purified and cleansed unblemished free from impurities malleable workable established and having gained imperturbability he directs and inclines his mind towards knowing and seeingAnd Sunakkhatta heard of this so he went to the heap of bīraṇagrass in the charnelground where Korakkhattiya was lying struck the body three times with his hand and said Friend Korakkhattiya do you know your fateAnd that man thought It is wonderful it is marvellousAnd the gates of Kusavati were of four colours one gold one silver one beryl one crystalAnd the Lord Buddha Vipassi delivered to them a graduated discourse on generosity on morality and on heaven  showing the danger degradation and corruption of sensedesires and the profit of renunciationAnd the Lord Buddha Vipassi delivered to them a graduated discourse on generosity on morality and on heaven showing the danger degradation and corruption of sensedesires and the profit of renunciationAnd the Lord Buddha Vipassi said to the parkkeeper Keeper go to Bandhumati and say to Prince Khanda and the chaplains son Tissa My lords Vipassi the Blessed Lord the Arahant the fullyenlightened Buddha has come to Bandhumati and is staying in the deerpark of KhemaAnd then the Lord Buddha Vipassi gave to the assembled monks the following preceptsAnd then those beings came together lamenting Wicked ways have become rife among us at first we were mindmade feeding on delightAnd then after the creepers had disappeared rice appeared in open spaces free from powder and from husks fragrant and cleangrainedAnd then monks that being who first arose there thinks I am Brahma the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing the AllPowerful the Lord the Maker and Creator Ruler Appointer and Orderer Father of All That Have Been and Shall BeAnd then monks the Bodhisatta thought With what being present does ageinganddeath occurAnd then Poṭṭhapāda that monk who is perfected in morality sees no danger from any sideAnd then Sire that monk who is perfected in morality sees no danger from any side owing to his being restrained by moralityAnd then Vāseṭṭha it came about that some Khattiya dissatisfied with his own Dhamma went forth from the household life into homelessness thinking I will become an asceticAnd then Vāseṭṭha some of those beings having paired off adopted various trades and this Various is the meaning of Vessa which came to be the regular title for such peopleAnd then Vāseṭṭha those beings that remained went in for huntingAnd then when the savoury earth had disappeared a fungus cropped up in the manner of a mushroomAnd there Sunakkhatta came to me saluted me and sat down to one sideAnd these monks are the eighteen ways in which these ascetics and Brahmins are speculators about the pastAnd these sir are the ṭānāṭā protective verses by means of which monks and nuns male and female layfollowers may dwell guarded protected unharmed and at easeAnd they having seen attained experienced and penetrated the Dhamma having passed beyond doubt having gained perfect confidence in the Teachers doctrine without relying on others said Excellent Lord excellentAnd this being that arose first is longerlived more beautiful and more powerful than they areAnd those beings continued for a very long time feasting on this savoury earth feeding on it and being nourished by itAnd those beings set to and fed on those creepersAnd those beings who in those days indulged in sex were not allowed into a village or town for one or two monthsAnd those eightyfour thousand received the goingforth at the hands of the Lord Buddha Vipassi and they received ordinationAnd those kings who faced him in the eastern region came and said Come Your Majesty welcomeAnd thus you must train yourselves being assembled in harmony and without dissensionAnd to the Lord Buddha Vipassi there occurred spontaneously this verse never previously heardAnd was the Reverend Gotama such as he is reported to be and not otherwiseAnd what about those speculators about the futureAnd what are these thirtytwo marksAnd what do you think VāsetthaAnd what is ageingAnd what is beauty for a monkAnd what is being separated from the lovedAnd what is deathAnd what is distressAnd what is happiness for a monkAnd what is lamentationAnd what is length of life for a monkAnd what is not getting what one wantsAnd what is painAnd what is power for a monkAnd what is sadnessAnd what is sorrowAnd what is the fourth caseAnd what is the fourth wayAnd what is the fourth wayAnd what is the miracle of instructionAnd what is the miracle of telepathyAnd what is the second wayAnd what is the second wayAnd what is the second wayAnd what is the third wayAnd what is the third wayAnd what is the third wayAnd what is there in the world that is agreeable and pleasurableAnd what is this Mirror of Dhamma by which he can know thisAnd what is wealth for a monkAnd what was this conversation aboutAnd what monks is being attached to the unlovedAnd what monks is birthAnd what monks is Right ActionAnd what monks is Right ConcentrationAnd what monks is Right EffortAnd what monks is Right LivelihoodAnd what monks is Right MindfulnessAnd what monks is Right SpeechAnd what monks is Right ThoughtAnd what monks is Right ViewAnd what monks is the Noble Truth of the Cessation of SufferingAnd what monks is the Noble Truth of the Origin of SufferingAnd what monks is the Noble Truth of the Way of Practice Leading to the Cessation of SufferingAnd when he knows that these five hindrances have left him gladness arises in him from gladness comes delight from the delight in his mind his body is tranquillised with a tranquil body he feels joy and with joy his mind is concentratedAnd when Sakka had thus proclaimed these eight truthful statements in praise of the Lord the ThirtyThree Gods were even more pleased overjoyed and filled with delight and happiness at what they had heard in the Lords praiseAnd when that man realised that Pāṭikaputta could not help himself he went back to the assembly and reported the situationAnd when the Dhamma Palace was finished it was hard to look at dazzling to the eyes just as in the last month of the Rains in autumn when there is a clear and cloudless sky the sun breaking through the mists is hard to look at so was the Dhamma Palace when it was finishedAnd when the leader of the second caravan was sure the first caravan had gone forward far enough he stocked up with plenty of grass wood and waterAnd when the Wheel had plunged into the eastern sea it emerged and turned south and King Mahasudassana followed it with his fourfold armyAnd where does this craving arise and establish itselfAnd whereas the monks are in the habit of addressing one another as friend this custom is to be abrogated after my passingAnd which are the six ways of wasting ones substance that he does not followAnd after many hundreds and thousands of years King Daḷhanemi said to a certain man My good man whenever you see that the sacred WheelTreasure has slipped from its position report it to me Yes sire the man repliedAnd Ananda after many hundred many hundred thousand years Queen Subhadda thought It is a long time since I saw King MahasudassanaAnd being unable even with the aid of this parable to get Patikaputta to rise from his seat Jāliya uttered this verseAnd being unable even with this parable to get Pāṭikaputta to rise from his seat Jāliya uttered this verseAnd by not being solicitous for their welfare would he have a heart full of love for them or of hatred Of hatred Reverend GotamaAnd Cunda for the destruction of all such views about the past and the future for transcending them I have taught and laid down the four foundations of mindfulnessAnd householders there are these five advantages to one of good morality and of success in moralityAnd Lord having heard the verses the lady Bhaddā Suriyavaccasā said to me Sir I have not personally seen that Blessed Lord though I heard of him when I went to the Sudhammā Hall of the ThirtyThree Gods to danceAnd Pañcasikha those of my disciples who have fully mastered my teaching have by their own superknowledge realised by the destruction of the corruptions in this very life the uncorrupted freedom of heart and mindAnd Pukkusa I had at that time gone out of the door of the threshingfloor and was walking up and down outsideAnd Pukkusa that man thought It is wonderful it is marvellousAnd Reverend Gotama is there any other sacrifice that is simpler less difficult more fruitful and profitable than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen attributes There is BrahminAnd Ruler of the Gods what things do you call to mind when you admit to experiencing such satisfaction and happiness as this Lord at such a time six things come to mind at which I rejoiceAnd Vasettha whoever of these four castes as a monk becomes an Arahant who has destroyed the corruptions done what had to be done laid down the burden attained to the highest goal completely destroyed the fetter of becoming and become liberated by the highest insight he is declared to be chief among them in accordance with Dhamma and not otherwiseAnd Vāseṭṭha a Khattiya who has led a bad life in body speech and thought and who has wrong view will in consequence of such wrong views and deeds at the breakingup of the body after death be reborn in a state of loss an ill fate the downfall the hellstateAnger lying fraud and cheating Avarice pride and jealousy Coveting doubt and harming others Greed and hate stupor and delusionAnother says to him Sir there is such a self as

hold regular and frequent assemblies they may be expected to prosper and not declineAs long Sire as a monk does not perceive the disappearance of the five hindrances in himself he feels as if in debt in sickness in bonds in slavery on a desert journeyAs the Lord Buddha Vipassi pondered thus his mind was inclined to inaction rather than to teaching the DhammaAs to that Prince I will question you about it and you shall answer as you think fitAs to that Prince I will question you about it and you shall reply as you think fitAs to that Prince I will question you about it and you shall reply as

qualities be omitted leaving three whereby one could be recognised as a true BrahminBut could not one of these three qualities be omittedBut here now is a teacher who is fully enlightened his doctrine is wellproclaimed edifyingly displayed effectual in calming the passions because of that enlightened teacher but the disciple does not live up to the doctrine but deviates from itBut here Cunda is a

I went to Kapilavatthu on some business for my teacher the Brahmin Pokkharasāti and I came to the Sakyans meetinghallBut Ambattha you came here seeking somethingBut Ananda what does the order of monks

throwing themselves down and twisting and turning crying All too soon the Blessed Lord is passing away all too soon the WellFarer is passing away all too soon the Eye of the World is disappearing And there are earthdevas whose minds are earthbound who do likewiseBut Lord why has the Lord declared this Because Poṭṭhapāda this is conducive to the purpose conducive to Dhamma the way to embark on the holy life it leads to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to higher knowledge to enlightenment to NibbānaBut Lord why has the Lord not declared these things Poṭṭhāpada that is not conducive to the purpose not conducive to Dhamma not the way to embark on the holy life it does not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to higher knowledge to enlightenment to

it is not the right time to see the LordFrom the time Ananda when a monk no longer regards feeling as the self or the self as being impercipient or as being percipient and of a nature to feel by not so regarding he clings to nothing in the world not clinging he is not excited by anything and not being excited he gains personal liberation and he knows Birth is finished the holy life has been led

Now let us get sharp swords made for us and then we can take from anybody what is not given we will make an end of them finish them off once for all and cut off their headsHere a certain ascetic or Brahmin declares and holds the view In as far as this self being furnished and endowed with the fivefold sensepleasures indulges in them then that is when the self realises the highest Nibbana here and nowHere a certain ascetic or Brahmin declares and holds the view Since this self is material composed of the four great elements the product of mother and father at the breakingup of the body it is annihilated and perishes and does not exist after deathHere a certain ascetic or Brahmin has by means of effortattained to such a state of concentration that he dwells perceiving the world as finiteHere Lohicca a Tathāgata arises in the world an Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of

who points out what is good for you is one and the friend who is sympathetic is oneHowever Pañcasikha that holy life does not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to superknowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana but only to birth in the Brahmāworld whereas my holy life leads unfailingly to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to superknowledge to enlightenment to NibbanaHowever some of those beings not being able to meditate in leafhuts settled around towns and villages and compiled booksI also teach a doctrine for getting rid of the formless acquired selfI also teach a doctrine for getting rid of the mindmade acquired selfI ask Brahmā Sanankumāra this Doubting him who has no doubts I askI can SireI can SireI go for refuge to the Lord Gotama the Dhamma and the SanghaI have said All these evil unskilled states arise because of the guarding of possessionsI have said Avarice conditions the guarding of possessionsI have said Becoming conditions birthIf there were absolutely no becoming in the World of SenseDesires of Form or the Formless Worldcould birth appearI have said Birth conditions ageinganddeath and this is the way that should be understoodI have said Consciousness conditions mindandbodyI have said Contact conditions feelingI have said Craving conditions seekingIf there were no cravingI have said Mindandbody conditions consciousnessIf consciousness did not find a restingplace in mindandbody would there subsequently be an arising and comingtobe of birth ageing death and suffering No Lord Therefore Ananda just this namely mindandbody is the root the cause the origin the condition of consciousnessI lack nothing none there is who harms meI remember well many hundreds of assemblies of Brahmins of householders of ascetics of devas of the Realm of the Four Great Kings of the ThirtyThree Gods of maras of Brahmas and still they did not know He who has just disappeared  was he a deva or a manI remember well Ananda many hundreds of assemblies of Khattiyas that I have attended and before I sat down with them spoke to them or joined in their conversation I adopted their appearance and speech whatever it might beI replied Monk once upon a time seafaring merchants when they set sail on the ocean took in their ship a landsighting birdI visited the Nigantha Nātaputta and asked him the same questionI was pleased and delighted with the Reverend Kassapas first parable and I wanted to hear his quickwitted replies to questions because I thought he was a worthy opponentI will tell you another seven things conducive to welfareI will tell you another seven things conducive to welfareI will tell you another seven thingsI will tell you another seven thingsAs long as monks develop the enlightenmentfactors of mindfulness of investigation of phenomena of energy of delight of tranquillity of concentration of equanimityIf anything you lack Ill make it good If any hurt you my royal arms shall guard youIf doubt is present in himself a monk knows that it is presentIf he lives the household life Hell regulate this wicked world And for what hes done receiveIf illwill is present in himself a monk knows that it is presentAnd he knows how the nonarising of the abandoned illwill in the future will come aboutIf in such a case there is such a senior teacher but if there are no senior disciples among the monks who are experienced trained skilled who have attained peace from bondage who are able to proclaim the true Dhamma able to refute any opposing doctrines that may arise by means of the true Dhamma and having done so give a grounded exposition of Dhamma then the holy life is not perfectedIf others ask us What is this formless acquired selfIf others ask us What is this mindmade acquired selfIf slothandtorpor is present in himself a monk knows that it is presentIf they wish the order may abolish the minor rules after my passingIf worryandflurry is present in himself a monk knows that it is presentIf the past refers to what is not factual to fables to what is not of advantage the Tathagata makes no replyIf Ananda you are asked Has ageinganddeath a condition for its existence you should answer YesIf however all these conditions are fulfilled then the holy life is perfectedIgnorance and craving for existenceImpermanent are compounded things prone to rise and fall Having risen theyre destroyed their passing truest blissImpermanent are compounded things prone to rise and fall Having risen theyre destroyed their passing truest bliss In another case Mahāli a monk facing east goes into twosided samādhi and both sees heavenly sights pleasant delightful enticing and hears heavenly soundsIn another case Mahāli a monk facing easthears heavenly sounds but does not see heavenly sightsIn growing groups from one to ten Ill teachIn highest heaven I am known by allIn just the same way Citta from the cow we get milk from the milk curds from the curds butter from the butter ghee and from the ghee cream of gheeIn just the same way Citta whenever the gross acquired self is present we do not at that time speak of a mindmade acquired selfIn just the same way Poṭṭhapāda if others ask us What is this gross acquired self What is this mindmade acquired self What is this formless acquired self we reply This is this acquired self for the getting rid of which we teach a doctrine whereby defiling mental states disappear and states tending to purification grow strong and one gains and remains in the purity and perfection of wisdom here and now having realised and attained it by ones own superknowledgeIn just the same way Vasettha in the Ariyan discipline these five strands of sensedesire are called bonds and fettersIn such cases if there are such senior teachers and such senior disciples but there are no monks of middle standing with these qualitiesIn the same way many thousands of devas cameIn the same way you Prince will come to ruin and destruction if you foolishly and unwisely seek the other world in the wrong wayIn the same way you Prince will foolishly enter on hidden dangers by unwisely seeking for another world just as that Brahmin lady did in seeking her inheritanceIn the same way Lohicca if anyone should say Suppose an ascetic or Brahmin were to discover some good doctrine and thought he ought not to declare it to anyone else for what can one man do for another he would be a source of danger to those young men of good family who following the Dhamma and discipline taught by the Tathāgata attain to such excellent distinction as to realise the fruit of StreamEntry of OnceReturning of NonReturning of Arahantship  and to all who ripen the seeds of a rebirth in the devaworldIn the same way Prince at a sacrifice at which no oxen are slainIn the same way Prince when this body has life heat and consciousness then it goes and comes back stands and sits and lies down sees things with its eyes hears with its ears smells with its nose tastes with its tongue feels with its body and knows mental objects with its mindIn the same way Vasettha in the Ariyan discipline these five hindrances are called obstacles hindrances coveringsup envelopingsIn the second place there is an ascetic or Brahmin who has developed psychic powers or a mighty and powerful deva whose earthconsciousness is weakly developed and his waterconsciousness is immeasurable and he makes the earth shudder and shake and violently quakeIn the time of the Lord Buddha Vipassi the lifespan was eighty thousand years in the time of the Lord Buddha Sikhi seventy thousand in the time of the Lord Buddha Vessabhū sixty thousand in the time of the Lord Buddha Kakusandhu forty thousand in the time of the Lord Buddha Konāgamana thirty thousand in the time of the Lord Buddha Kassapa it was twenty thousand yearsIn this case there is an ascetic or Brahmin who does not in truth know whether a thing is good or badIn this matter Poṭṭhapāda those ascetics and Brahmins who say ones perceptions arise and cease without cause or condition are totally wrongIn this sacrifice Brahmin no bulls were slain no goats or sheep no cocks and pigs nor were various living beings subjected to slaughter nor were trees cut down for sacrificial posts nor were grasses mown for the sacrificial grass and those who are called slaves or servants or workmen did not perform their tasks for fear of blows or threats weeping and in tearsIn times gone by in former birthsIn what way Lord do you maintain that it can be faulted Take the case Nigrodha of a selfmortifier who practises a certain austerityIn what ways Ananda do people explain the nature of the selfIn what ways Ananda do people regard the selfIn whatever Dhamma and discipline the Noble Eightfold Path is not found no ascetic is found of the first the second the third or the fourth gradeIn whatever realm the wise man makes his home He should feed the virtuous leaders of the holy lifeIndeed Lord they are on the wrong track themselves who accuse the Lord and his monks of errorIndeed Sire transgression overcame you when you deprived your father that good man and just king of his

worldIt is the rule that the Bodhisattas mother dies seven days after his birth and is reborn in the Tusita heavenIt is the rule that when a Bodhisatta has entered his mothers womb four devas  come to

matters of moral practice that the worldling would praise the TathagataIt may be that the wiseIt may be Cunda that wanderers of other sects might say The ascetics who follow the Sakyan are addicted to a life of devotion to pleasure If so they should be asked What kind of a life of devotion to pleasure friendIt was said There is monks this one way to the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and distress for the disappearance of pain and sadness for the gaining of the right path for the realisation of Nibbāna  that is to say the four foundations of mindfulness and it is for this reason that it was saidIll tell you them in verse to which realm each belongsIm the king of beasts and tries to roarIm the king of beasts and tries to roarJust as a lake fed by a spring with no inflow from east west north or south where the raingod sends moderate showers from time to time the water welling up from below mingling with cool water would suffuse fill and irradiate that cool water so that no part of the pool was untouched by it  so with this delight and joy born of concentration he so suffuses his body that no spot remains untouchedJust as a man going on a long journey might hear the sound of a big drum a small drum a conch cymbals or a kettledrum and he might think That is a big drumJust as a man might be a slave not his own master dependent on another unable to go where he liked and after some time he might be freed from slavery able to go where he liked might think Before this I was a slaveJust as a man might be bound in prison and after a time he might be freed from his bonds without any loss with no deduction from his possessionsJust as a man who had taken a loan to develop his business and whose business had prospered might pay off his old debts and with what was left over could support a wife might think Before this I developed my business by borrowing but now it has prospered and he would rejoice and be glad about thatJust as a man who was ill suffering terribly sick with no appetite and weak in body might after a time recover and regain his appetite and bodily strength and he might think Before this I was ill and he would rejoice and be glad about thatJust as a man laden with goods and wealth might go on a long journey through the desert where food was scarce and danger abounded and after a time he would get through the desert and arrive safe and sound at the edge of a village might think Before this I was in danger now I am safe at the edge of a village and he would rejoice and be glad about thatJust as a skilled bathman or his assistant kneading the soappowder which he has sprinkled with water forms from it in a metal dish a soft lump so that the ball of soappowder becomes one oleaginous mass bound with oil so that nothing escapes  so this monk suffuses drenches fills and irradiates his body so that no spot remains untouchedJust as a skilled potter or his assistant can make from wellprepared clay whatever kind of bowl he likes or just as a skilled ivorycarver or his assistant can produce from wellprepared ivory any object he likes or just as a skilled goldsmith or his assistant can make any gold article he likes  so the monk with mind concentratedJust as a woman or a man or young boy fond of his appearance might examine his face in a brightly polished mirror or in water and by examination would know whether there was a spot there or not so the monk with mind concentratedJust as if a man were to sit wrapped from head to foot in a white garment so that no part of him was untouched by that garment  so his body is suffusedThis is a fruit of the homeless life more excellent and perfect than the former onesJust as if a mighty trumpeter were with little difficulty to make a proclamation to the four quarters so by this meditation Vasettha by this liberation of the heart through lovingkindness he leaves nothing untouched nothing unaffected in the sensuous sphereJust as if a mighty trumpeter were with little difficulty to make a proclamation to the four quarters so by this meditation Vāsettha by this liberation of the heart through compassionJust as if in a pond of blue red or white lotuses in which the flowers born in the water grown in the water not growing out of the water are fed from the waters depths those blue red or white lotuses would be suffusedJust as if Sire in the midst of the mountains there were a pond clear as a polished mirror where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see oystershells gravelbanks and shoals of fish on the move or stationaryKassapa a practiser of selfmortification may do all these things but if his morality his heart and his wisdom are not developed and brought to realisation then indeed he is still far from being an ascetic or a

following the six ways of wasting ones substance   through avoiding these fourteen evil ways  that the Ariyan disciple covers the six directions and by such practice becomes a conqueror of both worlds so that all will go well with him in this world and the next and at the breakingup of the body after death he will go to a good destiny a heavenly worldYour Majesty do you admit that you have put this question to other ascetics and Brahmins I admit it Lord Would Your Majesty mind saying how they replied I do not mind telling the Lord or one like him Well then Your Majesty tell meYour Majesty it happens that a Tathagata arises in the world an Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessednanda has four remarkable and wonderful qualitiesnanda have I not told you before All those things that are dear and pleasant to us must suffer change separation and alterationnanda have you faith in the Tathagatas enlightenment Yes Lordnanda the devas from ten worldspheres have gathered to see the TathagataA disciple goes forth and practises the moralitiesAnd all those who had at that time been the Great Stewards pupils and had fully mastered his teaching were after death at the breakingup of the body reborn in a happy sphere in the BrahmāworldAnd King Renus country was in the centreAnd so the Great Steward at the end of the seven days shaved off his hair and beard donned yellow robes and went forth from the household life into homelessnessAnd the Great Steward dwelt suffusing one quarter with a mind filled with lovingkindness then a second then a third and a fourth quarterAnd the Lord has gained companions both learners and those who having lived the life have abolished the corruptions and the Lord dwells together with them all rejoicing in the one thingAnd the same with the second the third the fourth jhānaAnd then they consulted and deliberated together about the matter concerning which they had assembled in the Sudhamma Hall and the Four Great Kings were advised and admonished on this matter as they stood by their seats unmovingBut what sire is the duty of an Ariyan wheelturning monarch It is this my son Yourself depending on the Dhamma honouring it revering it cherishing it doing homage to it and venerating it having the Dhamma as your badge and banner acknowledging the Dhamma as your master you should establish guard ward and protection according to Dhamma for your own household your troops your nobles and vassals for Brahmins and householders town and country folk ascetics and Brahmins for beasts and birdsBut Sunakkhatta would the Tathagata make any statement that was ambiguous Lord does the Blessed Lord know by his own mind what would happen to PatikaputtaFriend why are all these people gathered here Lord there has been a great storm and two farmers brothers and four oxen have been killedFriends a Tathagata arises in the world an Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans

the mantras you have heard and learnt and teach them to each other Reverend Steward do as you think fit they repliedIn due course King Disampati died and the kingmakers anointed Prince Renu King in his placeIn these ways you have spoken in praise of me of the Dhamma and of the order among the VajjiansLord in earlier days long ago on the fastday of the fifteenth at the beginning of the Rains in the fullmoon night all the ThirtyThree Gods were seated in the Sudhamma Hall  a great congregation of divine beings and the Four Great Kings from the four quarters were thereLord let the Blessed Lord have a care what he says let the WellFarer have a care what he says What do you mean by saying that to me Lord the Blessed Lord might make an absolute statement about Patikaputtas comingOn such occasions that is the order in which they are seated and after that came our seatsReverend Sir spare the king and the land and may the god let it rainsSunakkhatta you have in many ways spoken in

tamed Teacher of gods and humans the Buddha the Blessed LordThe gifts given to the Lord are wellbestowed his fame is well established so much so that I think the Khattiyas will continue to be attached to him yet the Lord takes his foodoffering without conceitThe king and the land will be safe and the god will let it rain but if the king points the arrow at the crown prince the prince will be completely safeThe king and the land will be safe but if he looses the arrow upwards as far as his realm extends the god will not let it rain for seven years The king will be safe but if he looses the arrow downwards the earth will quake as far as his kingdom extendsThe mind bends and tends towards knowledge and visionThen Brahma Sanankumara assumed a single form then he sat down on the couch of Sakka and said What do my lords the ThirtyThree thinkThen the Great Steward thought Brahmā Sanankumara offers me a boonThen the Great Steward went to his forty equal wives and said Whichever of you ladies wishes to may go back to her own family and seek another husbandThen the six nobles went aside again and consulted together These Brahmins are greedy for womenThen the ThirtyThree Gods sat down each in his proper place saying Let us find out what comes of this radiance and having found the truth of it we will go towards itThen Lord Brahmā Sanankumāra having assumed a grosser form appeared to the ThirtyThree Gods in the shape of the youth PancasikhaThen Lord Sakka ruler of the gods seeing the satisfaction of the ThirtyThree uttered these verses of rejoicingThere comes a time friends sooner or later after a long period when this world contractsTherefore there is no such thing as saying By this discipline or practice or austerity or holy life I will bring my unripened kamma to fruition or I will gradually make this ripened kamma go awayThey did so and the King said Gentlemen I remember my wordThis was the burden of Brahma Sanankumāras speechThis was the burden of Brahma Sanankumāras

it may be empty hollow and false but something else may not be well reflected upon yet it may be factual true and unmistakenAgain the truth lies in the middle that transcends untenable extremesAgain

the sutta concludes with a statement of assurance in which the Buddha personally vouches for the effectiveness of the method by declaring the fruits of continuous practice to be either arahantship or nonreturningFirst one applies thought and sustains thought and subsequently one breaks out into speech that is why applied thought and sustained thought are the verbal formationFirst venerable sir the

further and you will see Rajagaha with its lovely parks groves meadows and pondsFollowing the preamble the body of the discourse falls into four parts by way of the four foundations of mindfulnessFools and the wise are alike cut off and annihilated with the dissolution of the body after death they do not existFor a blind man does not see forms with the eye and a deaf man does not hear sounds with the earFor a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the Teachers Dispensation it is natural that he conduct himself thus Willingly let only my skin sinews and bones remain and let the flesh and blood dry up on my body but my energy shall not be relaxed so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength manly energy and manly persistenceFor a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the Teachers Dispensation one of two fruits may be expected either final knowledge here and now or if there is a trace of clinging left nonreturnFor a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the Teachers Dispensation the Teachers Dispensation is nourishing and refreshingFor a fuller discussion see Bodhi Discourse on the Fruits of Recluseship ppFor a long time nanda you have learned the teachings remembered them recited them verbally examined them with the mind and penetrated them well by viewFor a second and a third time those bhikkhus were silentFor a second timeFor a third time the Blessed One said Enough bhikkhus let there be no quarrelling brawling wrangling or disputeFor a third time that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One Wait venerable sirWe are the ones who will be responsible for this quarrelling brawling wrangling and disputeFor a young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion body so how should he do an evil bodily action beyond mere wrigglingFor a young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion identity so how could identity view arise in himFor all fire has a flame a colour and a radiance and it is possible to use all fire for the purposes of fireFor an ordinary person also would utter speech that would be unwelcome and disagreeable to othersFor any well will be your GayāFor either I should refute the recluse Gotamas doctrine or else the Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī or you yourselfFor either I should refute the recluse Gotamas doctrine or else the Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī or you yourselfFor either I should refute the recluse Gotamas doctrine or else the Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī or you yourselfFor even these communities and societies such as the Vajjians and the Mallians exercise the power in their own realm to execute those who should be executed to fine those who should be fined and to banish those who should be banished so all the more so should a headanointed noble king such as King Pasenadi of Kosala or King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of MagadhaFor fear of blame attack and confutationFor he is able to know about the Buddhas of the pastwho attained to final Nibbana cut proliferation broke the cycle ended the round and surmounted all sufferingthat for those Blessed Ones their birth was thus their names were thus their clans were thus their virtue was thus their state was thus their wisdom was thus their abiding was thus their deliverance was thus For how could a human being know or see or realise a superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesFor how could one like myself presume to sit down on a seat without first being invited to do soFor humankind is a tangle but the animal is open enoughFor humankind is a tangle but the animal is open enoughFor humankind is a tangle but the animal is open enoughFor I will go forth under him This man of lofty wisdomFor if I were to teach you the Dhamma as I have heard it and mastered it you would not understand the meaning of my words and that would be wearying and troublesome for me For if there existed any formation that were permanent stable a self or the belonging of a self it would be possible to cling to itFor if these worthy ones did not honour respect revere and venerate such a person then whom could they honour respect revere and venerate and on whom could they live in dependence honouring and respectingFor if when serving someone one becomes worse and not better because of that service then I say that he should not be servedFor if when serving someone ones faith virtue learning generosity and wisdom increase in his service then I say that he should be servedFor in former times five hundred paccekabuddhas dwelt long on this mountain the Gullet of the SeersFor in many discourses the Blessed One has stated consciousness to be dependently arisen since without a condition there is no origination of consciousnessFor in many ways I have stated consciousness to be dependently arisen since without a condition there is no origination of consciousnessFor in many ways I have stated how obstructive things are obstructions and how they are able to
