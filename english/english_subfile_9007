They wont dwell under the same roof with me Theyll dwell under a roof separate from meThey wontin line with senioritybow down to me stand up to greet me salute me with hands placed palmtopalm over the heart or perform forms of respect due to superiors to me From that cause there would be arguing quarreling clashes and disputes in the Saṅgha a split in the Saṅgha a crack in the Saṅgha a falling apart in the Saṅgha a separation in the Saṅgha A monk who sees the seriousness of a split should confess an offense even out of conviction in othersThen the Blessed One having explained the matter to the followers of the suspended monk got up from his seat and leftAt that time the followers of the suspended monk were performing the Uposatha and Saṅgha transactions right there inside the territorywhile the monks who suspended were performing the Uposatha and Saṅgha transactions having gone outside the territoryThen a certain one of the monks who had suspended went to the Blessed One bowed down and sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord the followers of the suspended monk are performing the Uposatha and Saṅgha transactions right there inside the territorywhile we monks who suspended are performing the Uposatha and Saṅgha transactions having gone outside the territoryIf the followers of the suspended monk perform the Uposatha do a Saṅgha transaction in that very same territory in accordance with the motion and announcement formulated by me those transactions of theirs are in accordance with the Dhamma irreversible and fit to standIf you the monks who suspended perform the Uposatha do a Saṅgha transaction in that very same territory in accordance with the motion and announcement formulated by me those transactions of yours are in accordance with the Dhamma irreversible and fit to standWhy is thatThose monks belong to a separate affiliation from you and you belong to a separate affiliation from themThere are these two grounds for being of a separate affiliation Oneself makes oneself of a separate affiliation or a united Saṅgha suspends one for not seeing  for not making amends  or for not relinquishing These are the two grounds for being of a separate affiliationThere are these two grounds for being of common affiliation Oneself makes oneself of a common affiliation or a united Saṅgha restores one who has been suspended for not seeing  for not making amends  or for not relinquishing These are the two grounds for being of common affiliationAnd at that time the monks were arguing quarreling and disputing in the mealhall and in the village They were showing inappropriate bodily and verbal actions toward each otherseizing one another with the handsPeople criticized and complained and spread it about How can the Sakyan contemplatives argue quarrel and dispute in the mealhall and in the village and show inappropriate bodily and verbal actions toward each otherseizing one another with the handsThe monks heard the people criticizing complaining and spreading it aboutThose monks who were modest  criticized and complained and spread it about How can the monks argue quarrel and dispute in the mealhall and in the village and show inappropriate bodily and verbal actions toward each otherseizing one another with the handsThen the monks reported the matter to the Blessed One Is it true monks that you argue quarrel and dispute in the mealhall and in the village And show inappropriate bodily and verbal actions toward each otherseizing one another with the handsIts true O Blessed OneThe Buddha the Blessed One rebuked them  Having rebuked them he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks When the Saṅgha is split and getting along in an uncourteous way not in accordance with the Dhamma then one should sit down in a seat to the extent that We wont exhibit any improper bodily action or verbal action to one another we wont seize one another with the handsWhen the Saṅgha is split and getting along in a courteous way in accordance with the Dhamma one may sit down leaving the interval of a seat And at that time the monks were quarreling arguing and disputing in the midst of the Saṅgha wounding each other with verbal daggersThey couldnt resolve the issueThen a certain monk went to the Blessed One bowed down and sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord now the monks are quarreling arguing and disputing in the midst of the Saṅghawounding each other with verbal daggersIt would be good if the Blessed One could go to them out of sympathyThe Blessed One acquiesced with silenceThen the Blessed One went to the monks and sat down on a seat made ready Having sat down he said to the monks Enough monks Dont quarrel Dont argue Dont make strife Dont disputeWhen that was said a certain nonDhammadeclaring monk said to the Blessed One Wait Lord Blessed One May the Master of the Dhamma dwell at ease devoted to a pleasant abiding in the hereandnow Lord Blessed OneWe will be the ones who deal with this argument quarrel strife and disputeA second time the Blessed One said to the monks Enough monks Dont argue Dont quarrel Dont make strife Dont disputeA second time the nonDhammadeclaring monk said to the Blessed One Wait Lord Blessed OneMay the Master of the Dhamma dwell at ease devoted to a pleasant abiding in the hereandnow Lord Blessed Onex We will be the ones who deal with this argument quarrel strife and disputeThe Discussion of the Quarrel at Kosambī is finishedThen the Blessed One addressed the monks Once monks in Bārāṇasī Brahmadatta was the king of Kāsīrich prosperous with many possessions many troops many vehicles many territories with fullystocked armories  granariesDīghīti was the king of Kosalapoor not very prosperous with few possessions few troops few vehicles few territories with poorlystocked armories  granariesSo Brahmadatta the king of Kāsī raising a fourfold army marched against Dīghīti the king of KosalaDīghīti the king of Kosala heard Brahmadatta the king of Kāsī they say has raised a fourfold army and is marching against meThen the thought occurred to him King Brahmadatta is rich prosperous with fullystocked armories  granaries whereas I am poor with poorlystocked armories  granaries I am not competent to stand against even one attack by himWhy dont I slip out of the city beforehandSo taking his chief consort he slipped out of the city beforehandThen King Brahmadatta conquering the troops vehicles lands armories  granaries of King Dīghīti lived in lordship over themMeanwhile King Dīghīti had set out for Bārāṇasī together with his consort andtraveling by stages arrived thereThere he lived with her on the outskirts of Bārāṇasī in a potters house disguised as a wandererNot long afterwards she became pregnantShe had a pregnancy wish of this sort She wanted to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swordsShe said to King Dīghīti Your majesty I am pregnant and I have a pregnancy wish of this sortI want to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swordsHe said My queen where is there for usfallen on hard timesa fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground and water used for washing the swords If I dont get this your majesty I will dieNow at that time the brahman adviser to King Brahmadatta was a friend of King DīghītiSo King Dīghīti went to him and on arrival said A lady friend of yours old friend is pregnant and she has a pregnancy wish of this sortShe wants to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swordsIn that case let me see herSo King Dīghītis consort went to King Brahmadattas brahman adviserWhen he saw her coming from afar he rose from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder and with his hands raised in salutation to her exclaimed three times Surely the king of Kosala has come to your womb Surely the king of Kosala has come to your womb Surely the king of Kosala has come to your wombDont be worried my queenYou will get to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swordsThen he went to King Brahmadatta and on arrival said to him Your majesty signs have appeared such that tomorrow at dawn a fourfold army armed  arrayed should stand on a parade ground and that the swords should be washedSo King Brahmadatta ordered his people I say then Do as the brahman adviser saysThus King Dīghītis chief consort got to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and got to drink the water used for washing the swordsThen with the maturing of the fetus she gave birth to a sonThey named him Dīghāvu LongLifeNot long afterwards Prince Dīghāvu reached the age of discretionThe thought occurred to King Dīghīti This King Brahmadatta of Kāsī has done us great harm He has seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granaries If he finds out about us he will have all three of us killed Why dont I send Prince Dīghāvu to live outside of the citySo King Dīghīti of Kosala had Prince Dīghāvu go and live outside of the cityLiving there he in no long time learned all the craftsNow at that time King Dīghītis barber had gone over to King BrahmadattaHe saw King Dīghīti together with his consort living on the outskirts of Bārāṇasī in a potters house disguised as a wanderer On seeing them he went to King Brahmadatta and on arrival said to him Your majesty King Dīghīti of Kosala together with his consort is living on the outskirts of Bārāṇasī in a potters house disguised as a wandererSo King Brahmadatta ordered his people I say then Go fetch King Dīghīti together with his consortResponding As you say your majesty to the king they went and fetched King Dīghīti together with his consortThen King Brahmadatta ordered his people I say then Having bound King Dīghīti  his consort with a stout rope with their arms pinned tightly against their backs and having shaved them bald march them to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evict them out the south gate of the city and there to the south of the city cut them into four pieces and bury them in holes placed in the four directionsResponding As you say your majesty to the king the kings people bound King Dīghīti  his consort with a stout rope pinning their arms tightly against their backs shaved them bald and marched them to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroadsThen the thought occurred to Prince Dīghāvu Its been a long time since I saw my mother  fatherWhat if I were to go see themSo he entered Bārāṇasī and saw his mother  father bound with a stout rope their arms pinned tightly against their backs their heads shaven bald being marched to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads and he went to themKing Dīghīti saw Prince Dīghāvu coming from afar and on seeing him said Dont my dear Dīghāvu be farsightedDont be nearsighted For vengeance is not settled through vengeance Vengeance is settled through nonvengeanceWhen this was said the people said to him This King Dīghīti has gone crazy Hes talking nonsenseWho is DīghāvuWhy is he saying Dont my dear Dīghāvu be farsighted Dont be nearsightedxFor vengeance is not settled through vengeance Vengeance is settled through nonvengeanceI say Im not crazy or talking nonsense He who knows will understandThen a second time a third time he said Dont my dear Dīghāvu be farsighted Dont be nearsightedFor vengeance is not settled through vengeance Vengeance is settled through nonvengeanceA third time the people said to him This King Dīghīti has gone crazyHes talking nonsenseWho is Dīghāvu Why is he saying Dont my dear Dīghāvu be farsighted Dont be nearsightedFor vengeance is not settled through vengeance Vengeance is settled through nonvengeanceI say Im not crazy or talking nonsense He who knows will understandThen the kings people having marched King Dīghīti together with his chief consort to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evicted them out the south gate of the city and there to the south of the city cut them into four pieces buried them in holes placed in the four directions stationed guards and leftThen Prince Dīghāvu having entered Bārāṇasī brought out some liquor and got the guards to drink itWhen they had fallen down drunk he collected sticks made a pyre raised the bodies of his mother  father onto the pyre set fire to it and then circumambulated it three times with his hands raised in salutationNow at that time King Brahmadatta had gone up to the terrace on top of his palaceHe saw Prince Dīghāvu circumambulating the pyre three times with his hands raised in salutation and on seeing him the thought occurred to him Doubtlessly this person is a relative or bloodkinsman of King Dīghīti Ah how unfortunate for me for there is no one who will tell me what this meansThen Prince Dīghāvu having gone into the wilderness and having cried  wept as much as he needed to dried his tears and entered Bārāṇasī Going to an elephant stable next to the kings palace he said to the chief elephant trainer Teacher I want to learn this craftIn that case young man you may learn itThen rising in the last watch of the night Prince Dīghāvu sang in a sweet voice and played the lute in the elephant stableKing Brahmadatta rising in the last watch of the night heard the sweetvoiced singing  luteplaying in the elephant stable On hearing it he asked his people I say Who was that rising in the last watch of the night singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stableYour majesty a young manthe student of suchandsuch an elephant trainer rising in the last watch of the night was singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stableI say then Go fetch that young manResponding As you say your majesty to the king they went and fetched Prince DīghāvuThen King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dīghāvu I say my young man Was that you rising in the last watch of the night singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stableYes your majestyI say then my young man Sing and play the luteResponding As you say your majesty to the king and seeking to win favor Prince Dīghāvu sang with a sweet voice and played the luteThen King Brahmadatta said to him I say You my young man are to stay and attend to meAs you say your majesty Prince Dīghāvu responded to the kingThen he rose in the morning before King Brahmadatta went to bed in the evening after him did whatever the king ordered always acting to please him speaking politely to himAnd it was not long before King Brahmadatta placed the prince close to him in a position of trustThen one day King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dīghāvu I say then my young man Harness the chariot Im going huntingResponding As you say your majesty to the king Prince Dīghāvu harnessed the chariot and then said to King Brahmadatta Your chariot is harnessed your majesty Now is the time for you to do as you see fitThen King Brahmadatta mounted the chariotand Prince Dīghāvu drove itHe drove it in such a way that the kings entourage went one way and the chariot anotherThen after they had gone far King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dīghāvu I say then my young man Unharness the chariot Im tired Im going to lie downResponding As you say your majesty to the king Prince Dīghāvu unharnessed the chariot and sat down crosslegged on the groundThen King Brahmadatta lay down placing his head on Prince Dīghāvus lapAs he was tired he went to sleep right awayThen the thought occurred to Prince Dīghāvu This King Brahmadatta of Kāsī has done us great harmHe has seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granariesAnd it was because of him that my mother  father were killedNow is my chance to wreak vengeance He drew his sword from his scabbardBut then he thought My father told me as he was about to die Dont my dear Dīghāvu be farsighted Dont be nearsightedFor vengeance is not settled through vengeance Vengeance is settled through nonvengeanceIt would not be proper for me to transgress my fathers words So he put his sword back in its scabbardA second time A third time the thought occurred to Prince Dīghāvu This King Brahmadatta of Kāsī has done us great harm He has seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granaries And it was because of him that my mother  father were killed Now is my chance to wreak vengeance He drew his sword from his scabbardIt would not be proper for me to transgress my fathers wordsA third time he thought My father told me as he was about to die Dont my dear Dīghāvu be farsighted Dont be nearsightedFor vengeance is not settled through vengeance Vengeance is settled through nonvengeanceIt would not be proper for me to transgress my fathers wordsSo once again he put his sword back in its scabbardThen King Brahmadatta suddenly got upfrightened agitated unnerved alarmedPrince Dīghāvu said to him Your majesty why have you gotten up suddenlyfrightened agitated unnerved  alarmedI say my young man Just now as I was dreaming Prince Dīghāvuson of Dīghīti king of Kosalastruck me down with a swordThats why I got up suddenlyfrightened agitated unnerved  alarmedThen Prince Dīghāvu grabbing King Brahmadatta by the head with his left hand and drawing his sword from its scabbard with his right said I your majesty am that very Prince Dīghāvu son of Dīghīti king of KāsīYou have done us great harmYou have seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granariesAnd it was because of you that my mother  father were killedNow is my chance to wreak vengeanceSo King Brahmadatta dropping his head down to Prince Dīghāvus feet said Grant me my life my dear DīghāvuGrant me my life my dear DīghāvuWho am I that I would dare grant life to your majestyIt is your majesty who should grant life to meIn that case my dear Dīghāvu you grant me my life and I grant you your lifeThen King Brahmadatta and Prince Dīghāvu granted one another their lives and taking one another by the hands swore an oath to do one another no harmThen King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dīghāvu In that case my dear Dīghāvu harness the chariot We will go onResponding As you say your majesty to the king Prince Dīghāvu harnessed the chariot and then said to King Brahmadatta Your chariot is harnessed your majesty Now is the time for you to do as you see fitThen King Brahmadatta mounted the chariotand Prince Dīghāvu drove itHe drove it in such a way that it was not long before they met up with the kings entourageThen King Brahmadatta having entered Bārāṇasī had his ministers  councilors convened and said to them I say then If you were to see Prince Dīghāvu the son of Dīghīti the king of Kosala what would you do to himDifferent ministers said We would cut off his hands your majestyWe would cut off his feet your majestyWe would cut off his hands  feet your majestyWe would cut off his ears your majestyWe would cut off his nose your majestyWe would cut off his ears  nose your majestyWe would cut off his head your majestyThen the king said This I say is Prince Dīghāvu the son of Dīghīti the king of KāsīYou are not allowed to do anything to himIt was by him that my life was granted to me and it was by me that his life was granted to himThen King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dīghāvu What your father said to you as he was about to dieDont my dear Dīghāvu be farsighted Dont be nearsightedFor vengeance is not settled through vengeance Vengeance is settled through nonvengeancein reference to what did he say thatWhat my father said to me as he was about to dieDont be farsightedDont bear vengeance for a long timeis what he was saying to me as he was about to dieAnd what he said to me as he was about to dieDont be nearsightedDont be quick to break with a friendis what he was saying to me as he was about to dieAnd what he said to me as he was about to dieFor vengeance is not settled through vengeance Vengeance is settled through nonvengeanceMy mother  father were killed by your majestyIf I were to deprive your majesty of life those who hope for your majestys wellbeing would deprive me of life And those who hope for my wellbeing would deprive them of life And in that way vengeance would not be settled by vengeanceBut now I have been granted my life by your majesty and your majesty has been granted your life by meAnd in this way vengeance has been settled by nonvengeanceThat is what my father was saying to me as he was about to dieThen King Brahmadatta said Isnt it amazingIsnt it astoundingHow wise this Prince Dīghāvu is in that he can understand in full the meaning of what his father said in brief So he returned his fathers troops vehicles lands armories  granaries to him and gave him his daughter in marriageSuch monks is the forbearance  gentleness of kings who wield the scepter who wield the swordSo now let your light shine forth so that youwho have gone forth in such a welltaught Dhamma  Disciplinewill be their equal in forbearance  gentlenessA third time the Blessed One said to the monks Enough monks Dont quarrel Dont argue Dont make strife Dont disputeA third time the nonDhammadeclaring monk said to the Blessed One Wait Lord Blessed One May the Master of the Dhamma dwell at ease devoted to a pleasant abiding in the hereandnow Lord Blessed OneWe will be the ones who deal with this argument quarrel strife and disputeThen the Blessed One These worthless men are hopelesstheyre not easy to convince got up from his seat and leftThe first recitation section on Dīghāvu Then early in the morning the Blessed One put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robes went into Kosambī for almsHaving gone for alms in Kosambī after returning from the almsround after the meal having set his dwelling in order taking his robes  bowl standing in the midst of the Saṅgha he recited these versesThe sound of the crowd men on the same level Noone thinks himself a foolThough the Saṅgha is splitting Noone can think of anything betterTotally forgotten the words of the wise declaring the right range of speechThey stretch out their mouths as far as they want Where it will lead they dont knowHe insulted me hit me beat me robbed mefor those who brood on this hostility isnt stilledHe insulted me hit me beat me robbed mefor those who dont brood on this hostility is

wilds Dhp The Case of Dīghāvu is finishedHaving recited these verses while standing in the midst of the Saṅgha the Blessed One went to Bālakaloṇakāraka VillageAt that time Ven Bhāgu was living near Bālakaloṇakāraka VillageVen Bhāgu saw the Blessed One coming from afar and on seeing him laid out a seat Having set out water for washing his feet a footstool and a footwashing block he went out to receive his robes  bowlThe Blessed One sat down on the seat laid out and washed his feetVen Bhagu having bowed to the Blessed One sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it agreeable monk Are you getting by Are you tired from going for almsIts tolerable Lord Im getting by And Im not tired from going for almsThen the Blessed One having instructed urged roused  encouraged Ven Bhagu with a Dhamma talk got up from his seat and went to the Eastern Bamboo ParkThe Discussion of Going to Bālakaloṇaka is finishedAt that time Ven Anuruddha Ven Nandiya and Ven Kimbila were staying in the Eastern Bamboo ParkThe park warden saw the Blessed One coming in the distance and on seeing him said to him Contemplative dont enter the parkThere are three young men living there desiring their own Dont make them uncomfortableVen Anuruddha heard the park warden conversing with the Blessed One and on hearing them said to the park warden Friend park warden dont keep out the Blessed OneOur Teacher the Blessed One has arrivedThen Ven Anuruddha went to Ven Nandiya and Ven Kimbila and on arrival said to them Come out venerables Come out venerables Our Teacher the Blessed One has arrivedThen Ven Anuruddha Ven Nandiya and Ven Kimbila went out to greet the Blessed One One received his robe  bowl Another laid out a seat Another set out water for washing his feet a footstool and a footwashing blockThe Blessed One sat down on the seat laid out and washed his feetHaving bowed down to the Blessed One they also sat to one sideAs they were sitting there the Blessed One said to Ven Anuruddha Is it tolerable for you Anuruddha Are you getting by Are you tired from going for almsIts tolerable Lord Were getting by And were not tired from going for almsBut Anuruddha are you living harmoniously cordially and without dispute blending like milk and water looking at one another with eyes of affectionIndeed Lord we are living harmoniously cordially and without dispute blending like milk and water looking at one another with eyes of affectionBut Anuruddha how are you living harmoniously cordially and without dispute blending like milk and water looking at one another with eyes of affectionHere Lord the thought occurs to us Its a gain for me a great gain that I am living with companions of this sort in the holy lifeWe are set on bodily acts of good will with regard to these other two venerable ones to their faces  behind their backs We are set on verbal and mental acts of good will with regard to these other two venerable ones to their faces  behind their backsThe thought occurs to us Why dont I having put aside my own thoughts conduct myself in line with the thoughts of these venerable onesAnd having put aside my own thoughts I do conduct myself in line with the thoughts of these venerable onesOur bodies are separate Lord but we are as if one in mindVen Nandiya and Ven Kimbila said to the Blessed One Here Lord the thought occurs to us also Its a gain for me a great gain that I am living with companions of this sort in the holy lifeWe are set on bodily acts of good will with regard to these other two venerable ones to their faces  behind their backs We are set on verbal and mental acts of good will with regard to these other two venerable ones to their faces  behind their backsThe thought occurs to us Why dont I having put aside my own thoughts conduct myself in line with the thoughts of these venerable onesAnd having put aside my own thoughts I do conduct myself in line with the thoughts of these venerable onesOur bodies are separate Lord but we are one in mind as it wereThis lord is how we are living harmoniously cordially and without dispute blending like milk and water looking at one another with eyes of affectionBut Anuruddha do you remain heedful ardent and resoluteIndeed Lord we remain heedful ardent and resoluteBut Anuruddha how do you remain heedful ardent and resoluteHere Lord whichever of us returns first from going to the village for alms arranges the seats sets out water for washing the feet a footstool and a footwashing block washes the refuse bucket and sets it out and sets out water for drinking and water for usingWhoever returns afterwards from going to the village for alms eats the leftoversif there are any and if he wants toand if not he throws them out in a place where there are no cropsor dumps them into water without living beings in itHe picks up the seats puts away the water for washing the feet footstool and footwashing block washes and puts away the refuse bucket puts away the water for drinking and water for using and sweeps the mealhallWhoever sees that the drinkingwater pitcher usingwater pitcher or rinsingwater pitcher are low or empty refills itIf it occurs to him Its too much for me calling another by wavingusing hand signalswe refill it Thus Lord we dont for that reason break out into speechAnd every five days we spend the whole night sitting together discussing the DhammaThats how we remain heedful ardent and resoluteThe Discussion of Going to the Eastern Bamboo Park is finishedThen the Blessed One having instructed urged roused  encouraged Ven Anuruddha Ven Nandiya and Ven Kimila with a Dhamma talk got up from his seat and set out on a wandering tour toward Pārileyyaka andwandering by stages arrived at PārileyyakaThere he stayed in Pārileyyaka in the protected forest grove at the root of the auspicious Sal treeThen when the Blessed One was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in his awareness Before I was living unpleasantly hemmed in by those Kosambī monksquarrelsome makers of strife makers of disputes makers of rumors makers of issues in the Saṅgha Now Im alone without a second I live pleasantly and in ease away from those Kosambī monksquarrelsome makers of strife makers of disputes makers of rumors makers of issues in the SaṅghaIt so happened that a certain bull elephant was living hemmed in by elephants cowelephants calfelephants  baby elephants He fed off grass with cutoff tips They chewed up his stash of brokenoff branches He drank disturbed water And when he went down to his bathingplace cowelephants went along banging up against his bodyThe thought occurred to him I now live hemmed in by elephants cowelephants calfelephants  baby elephants I feed off grass with cutoff tips They chew up my stash of brokenoff branches I drink disturbed water And when I go down to my bathing place cowelephants go along banging up against my bodyWhat if I were to live alone apart from the crowdSo the bull elephant leaving the herd went to Pārileyyaka to the protected forest grove and the root of the auspicious sal tree He went to the Blessed One and on arrival brought drinking water and washing water for the Blessed One with his trunk and kept the grass downThen this train of thought arose in the awareness of the bull elephant Before I lived unpleasantlyhemmed in by elephants cowelephants calfelephants  baby elephants I fed off grass with cutoff tips They chewed up my stash of brokenoff branches I drank disturbed water And when I went down to my bathing place cowelephants went along banging up against my bodyBut now Im alone without a second I live pleasantlynot hemmed in by elephants cowelephants calfelephants  baby elephantsThen the Blessed One realizing his own seclusion and knowing the train of thought in the bull elephants awareness on that occasion exclaimedThis harmonizes mind with mind the great ones with the great onesthe elephant with tusks like chariot poles that each finds joy alone in the forestThen the Blessed One having stayed at Pārileyyaka as long as he liked set out on a wandering tour toward Sāvatthī andwandering by stages arrived at SāvatthīThere at Sāvatthī he stayed in Jetas grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen the thought occurred to the layfollowers of Kosambī These masters the Kosambī monks have done us a lot of harmAnnoyed by them the Blessed One leftLets not bow down to them stand up to greet them salute them with hands placed palmtopalm over the heart honor them show them respect venerate them do homage to them or give them alms when they approach Thus not honored by us nor shown respect venerated nor done homage to being brushed off rudely will leave or disrobe or regain the confidence of the Blessed OneSo the layfollowers of Kosambī didnt bow down to the Kosambī monks stand up to greet them salute them with hands placed palmtopalm over the heart honor them show them respect venerate them do homage to them or give them alms when they approachedAnd the thought occurred to the Kosambī monks as they were not being honored by the layfollowers of Kosambī nor shown respect venerated nor done homage to and being brushed off rudely Friends lets go to Sāvatthī and settle this issue in the Blessed Ones presenceThe Discussion of Going to Pārileyyaka is finishedThen the Kosambī monks having set their lodgings in order taking their robes  bowls went to SāvatthīVen Sāriputta heard that They say that the Kosambī monks quarrelsome makers of strife makers of disputes makers of rumors makers of issues in the Saṅgha are coming to SāvatthīThen Ven Sāriputta went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down and sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One They say that the Kosambī monks quarrelsome makers of strife makers of disputes makers of rumors makers of issues in the Saṅgha are coming to SāvatthīHow am I to behave with regard to these monksIn that case Sāriputta take your stance in line

is not to be conveyed for anyone he was counterquestioned by Upālione faultless in virtue unification in the victors dispensationThe Kosambī Khandhaka is finishedThe Mahāvagga is completedThere are some recluses and brahmins who having directly known the Dhamma for themselves among things not heard before claim to teach the fundamentals of the holy life after having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledgeThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher at the gate of the city Saṅkassa with reference to many gods and menBut the story begins at RājagahaFor once upon a time a treasurer of Rājagaha went to the river Ganges to sport in the water To avoid the risk of losing his jewels and clothing and to prevent them from slipping away while his mind was otherwise occupied he put them in an openwork wicker basketNow a certain redsandalwood tree which grew on the bank of the Ganges above whose roots were washed by the waters of the Ganges fell into the Ganges was gradually broken up by the rocks in the river and went to piecesA fragment of the tree about the size of a waterjar which had been ground by the rocks and washed by the waves until it was round and smooth and which had been carried along by the current and in the course of time had become wrapped round and round with Sevala plants finally drifted against the treasurers wicker basket and was caught thereinWhat is this said the treasurer A fragment of a tree replied his companions The treasurer ordered it brought to him What kind of wood is it thought the treasurer In order to find out for himself he proceeded to pare it with the blade of an adzeand immediately discovered that it was a block of red sandalwood of the color of red lacNow the treasurer was neither orthodox nor heretical in his views but was impartial to bothHe thought to himself I have a great quantity of red sandalwood in my house what shall I do with thisThen the following thought occurred to him There are many men living in the world who say We are Arahats we are Arahats For my part however I know not a single ArahatI will have the lathe in my house started up and a bowl turned and this bowl I will suspend in the air by a cord from a series of bamboos sixty cubits from the ground Then I will make the following proclamation If any be an Arahat let him fly through the air and take the bowlIf any shall succeed in taking the bowl I will become his disciple and my son and my wife likewiseAccordingly he had a bowl turned suspended it from a series of bamboos and made the following proclamation If any in this world be an Arahat let him fly through the air and take this bowlSix religious teachers said to him This bowl is just the thing for us give it to usBut the treasurer replied Fly through the air and take itOn the sixth day the naked ascetic Nāthaputta said to his disciples Go say to the treasurer This bowl is just the thing for our teacher Do not insist on our flying through the air for the sake of a mere trifle Give us the bowlThey went and delivered his message to the treasurerNāthaputta himself desired to go Accordingly he gave orders to his disciples I will lift up a single hand and a single foot and act as though I were about to fly up Then you must say to me Teacher what are you doing Do not reveal hidden powers of Arahatship to the multitude merely for the sake of a wooden bowl So saying you must grasp me by the hands and feet pull me down and throw me on the groundThen Nāthaputta went and said to the treasurer Great treasurer this bowl is not at all the thing for others Do not insist on my flying through the air for the sake of a mere trifle Give me the bowlReverend Sir fly through the air and take it that is the only wayThen Nāthaputta said to his disciples Well then come away come away So saying he led them away Then he said I shall now fly up into the air So saying he lifted up a single hand and a single footThereupon his disciples said to him Teacher teacher what is it you are doing All for the sake of a wretched miserable wooden bowl why need you reveal hidden powers to the multitude Forthwith they grasped him by the hands and feet and dragged him down and threw him on the groundThen he said to the treasurer Great treasurer these my disciples will not permit me to fly up into the air pray give me the bowlFly up and take it Reverend SirThus did the six heretics strive for six days but for all their striving they did not succeed in obtaining the bowlOn the seventh day the Venerable Elder Moggallāna the Great and the Venerable Elder Piṇḍolabhāradvāja set out to make an almspilgrimage in Rājagaha and taking their stand on a flat rock they proceeded to robe themselves Just at that moment some gamesters began the following conversation Friends six religious teachers used to go about pretending to be Arahats But when seven days ago the treasurer of Rājagaha suspended a bowl and said If any be an Arahat let him fly through the air and take the bowl not one of those who pretended to be Arahats could fly through the airToday we know for certain that there are no Arahats in the worldHearing this talk the Venerable Moggallāna the Great said to the Venerable Elder Piṇḍolabhāradvāja Brother you have heard the conversation of these men they talk as though they were challenging the Religion of the BuddhaNow you are possessed of great magical power you are possessed of great supernatural power go fly through the air and take this bowlBrother Moggallāna you are known far and wide as Foremost of those that possess magical power you take this bowl if you take it I will take itMoggallāna replied You go brother Accordingly the Venerable Elder Piṇḍolabhāradvāja entered into the trance of the Supernatural Faculties and arising from the trance he encircled the flat rock three leagues in extent with the tip of his foot and then raising it aloft as easily as if it were silkcotton he walked seven times about in a circle over the city of RājagahaNow the city of Rājagaha was exactly three leagues in extent and the rock appeared like a covering over the cityThe residents of the city thought to themselves The rock will fall upon us and crush us and terrified with fear they placed winnowingbaskets on their heads and hid themselves here and thereThe seventh time the Elder encircled the city he rent the flat rock asunder and showed himself plainly before the peopleWhen the multitude saw the Elder they cried out Reverend Piṇḍolabhāradvāja take firm hold of the rock do not destroy us allThereupon the Elder kicked the rock away from himAnd the Elder lighted on the top of the treasurers houseWhen the Elder saw him he prostrated himself on his breast and said Master pray descend When the Elder had descended the treasurer provided him with a seat caused him to lower his bowl filled it with the four sweet foods and returned it to the ElderThe Elder took his bowl and set out in the direction of the monasteryThereupon all those who because of absence either in the forest or in the village had not seen that miracleSo the Elder repeated the miracle for them also and having so done continued his course to the monasteryThe Teacher who was following the Elder heard the noise of the multitude as they roared out their applause and asked the Elder nanda nanda who is it they are applauding Reverend Sir replied the Elder nanda Piṇḍolabhāradvāja flew up into the air and took the bowl made of red sandalwood and the multitude are applauding him So the Teacher summoned Bhāradvāja and said to him Is the report true that you have done this Yes Reverend Sir it is true Bhāradvāja why did you do this Thereupon the Teacher rebuked the Elder caused him to break that bowl to pieces and directed him to give the fragments to the monks to grind into powder for sandalpaste And he laid down a precept forbidding the exercise of the supernatural powers for such purposes in the futureWhen the heretics heard that the monk Gotama had caused that bowl to be broken to pieces and that he had laid down a precept forbidding his disciples to perform miracles they said Even if their lives depend upon it the disciples of the monk Gotama will not disobey the precept which he has laid down Moreover the monk Gotama will also keep that preceptNow is our chance  So they went through the streets of the city proclaiming It is our wont to keep our own powers hidden and it was for this reason that on a recent occasion we refused to display our own powers for the sake of a wooden bowl But the disciples of the monk Gotama displayed their powers to the multitude all for the sake of a paltry bowlThe monk Gotama in his wisdom caused that bowl to be broken to pieces and laid down a precept forbidding his disciples to perform miracles Henceforth we will perform miracles only with himKing Bimbisāra heard their talk went to the Teacher and said Reverend Sir is the report true that you have forbidden your disciples to perform miraclesYes great kingThe heretics are saying We will perform miracles with you what do you intend to do about thisIf they perform miracles I will do the sameHave you not laid down a precept forbidding the performance of miraclesGreat king I have not laid down a precept for myself the precept was intended to apply only to my disciplesDo you mean that the precept which you laid down was intended to apply to everyone but yourselfWell great king I will answer that question by another Great king it is true is it not that you have a pleasuregarden in your kingdomYes Reverend SirGreat king if the populace should eat the mangoes and other fruits in your garden what would you do to themI should inflict punishment upon them Reverend SirBut you would have the right to eat them yourselfYes Reverend Sir I am not liable to punishment I should have the right to eat whatever belongs to meGreat king even as your authority extends throughout your kingdom thirty leagues in extent and you are not yourself liable to punishment for eating mangoes and other fruits in your own garden while others are liable to punishment for so doing even so my authority extends throughout hundreds of thousands of millions of worlds and while I may overstep the precepts which I have myself laid down others may not so do therefore great king I shall perform a miracleWhen the heretics heard these words they said to each other Now we are lost the monk Gotama declares that the precept which he laid down was intended to apply to his disciples but not to himselfand he further declares that it is his intention to perform a miracle himself what are we to do And they took counsel togetherThe king asked the Teacher Reverend Sir when do you intend to perform this miracleOn the day of full moon of the month sāḷhi four months henceWhere will you perform it Reverend SirNear Sāvatthi great kingNow why did the Teacher appoint a place so far distantBecause Sāvatthi is the place where all the Buddhas have performed their great miracles it was likewise to permit the assemblage of a great multitude For these reasons the Teacher appointed a place far distantThe heretics hearing these words said to each other Four months hence the monk Gotama will perform a miracle at Sāvatthi Henceforth therefore we must pursue him unremittingly When the populace see us they will ask What does this meanand we will reply You will remember that we said We will perform a miracle with the monk GotamaWhen the Teacher had gone his round for alms in Rājagaha he came forth from the cityThe heretics likewise came forth in his train Wherever he took his meal there they lodged for the nightwherever he lodged for the night there they took their breakfastWhen the people asked them What does this mean they gave the same answer they had before agreed uponWe will see the miracle cried out the multitude and followed afterIn due course the Teacher reached SāvatthiThe heretics accompanied him thither On reaching the city they stirred up their retainers obtained for themselves a hundred thousand pieces of money caused a pavilion to be erected with pillars of acacia wood and caused it to be covered with blue lotus flowers Having so done they sat down and said Here we will perform a miracleKing Pasenadi Kosala approached the Teacher and said Reverend Sir the heretics have caused a pavilion to be erected shall I also erect a pavilion for youThere is no need of so doing great king I have a pavilionmakerReverend Sir who is there here besides me that can build a pavilion for youSakka king of the gods great kingReverend Sir where will you perform the miracleAt the foot of the mangotree which is called Gaṇḍas great kingThe heretics heard the words He will perform the miracle at the foot of the mangotree Straightway they tore up by the roots all of the mangotrees for a league around even those that had sprung up that very day and threw them all into the forestOn the day of full moon of the month sāḷhi the Teacher entered the cityOn the same day Gaṇḍa the kings gardener seeing a large ripe mango in a basket of leaves made by red ants drove away the crows which had been attracted by its savor and flavor picked up the mango and set out with it intending to take it to the king But seeing the Teacher by the way he thought to himself If the king eats this mango he will possibly give me eight or sixteen pieces of money for it and that will not suffice to keep me alive during one state of existencebut if I give this to the Teacherit will avail to my salvation time without endAccordingly he presented the ripe mango to the TeacherThe Teacher looked at the Elder nandaThe Elder removed the outer covering from the gift intended for the great king and placed the mango in the Teachers handsThe Teacher presented his bowl received the ripe mango and intimated that he desired to sit down right thereThe Elder spread his robe and presented itWhen the Teacher was seated the Elder strained water crushed the ripe mango made a sherbet and gave it to the TeacherWhen the Teacher had drunk the mangosherbet he said to Gaṇḍa Dig up the earth right here and plant the seed of the mangoThe gardener did as he was toldThe Teacher washed his hands over the place where the mango had been plantedThe very moment he washed his hands a mangotree sprang up with a stalk as thick as a plowhandle fifty cubits in heightFive great branches shot forth each fifty cubits in length four to the four cardinal points and one to the heavens aboveInstantly the tree was covered with flowers and fruits indeed on one side it bore a cluster of ripe mangoesApproaching from behind the monks picked the ripe mangoes ate them and then withdrewWhen the king heard that a mangotree so wonderful had sprung up he gave orders that no one should cut it down and posted a guardBecause the tree had been planted by the gardener Gaṇḍa it became known as Gaṇḍas MangotreeMen of the baser sort also ate the ripe mango fruits and cried out You rascally heretics when you heard that the monk Gotama would do a miracle at the foot of Gaṇḍas Mangotree you caused all the young mangoes for a league around even those that have sprung up this very day to be torn up by the roots yet here is Gaṇḍas mangotree So saying they took the seeds and cores of the mangofruits which remained and threw them at the hereticsSakka ordered the deity Windcloud Uproot the pavilion of the heretics with your winds and throw it into the cesspoolWindcloud did soThen Sakka ordered the Sundeity Check the course of the suns disk and scorch themThe Sundeity did soThen Sakka again ordered Windcloud Windcloud set the chariot of the wind in motion and go forthWindcloud did so Now the bodies of the heretics were streaming with sweat and Windcloud sprinkled them with a shower of dustuntil they looked like red antsThen Sakka again ordered Windcloud Cause countless great drops of rain to fallWindcloud did soNaked as they were they fled helterskelterAs they were running away a certain farmer who was a supporter of Pūraṇa Kassapa thought Tomorrow is the day when my noble teachers will perform their miracle I must go see the miracle So unyoking his cattle and taking with him a vessel of broth which he had brought with him early in the morning and a rope he set out to return home When he saw Pūraṇa running away in such wise he said to him Reverend Sir I set out with the thought in my mind I will go see my noble teachers perform their miracle Where are you goingPūraṇa replied Why should you wish to see a miracle Give me your waterpot and ropeThe farmer did so Pūraṇa took the waterpot and rope and going to the bank of the river tied the waterpot to his neck with the rope and threw himself into the stream There was a splash of waterbubbles and Pūraṇa died and was reborn in the Avīci HellThe Teacher created a jeweled walk in the airAs the shadows of evening drew on there assembled a multitude thirtysix leagues in extent The Teacher thinking to himself This is the time for me to perform the miracle came forth from the Perfumed Chamber and stood on the terraceAt that moment a female lay disciple named Gharaṇī a woman possessed of magical power who had attained the Fruit of the Third Path approached the Teacher and said Reverend Sir so long as you have a daughter like me remaining alive you will have no occasion to weary yourself I will perform a miracleGharaṇī what miracle will you performReverend Sir I will convert the great earth which lies inclosed within the circle of the world into water and then I will dive into the water like a waterbird and reappear at the eastern rim of the world Likewise will I reappear at the western rim and at the northern rim and at the southern rim of the world and at the centrePeople will ask Who is that and other people will answer That is Gharaṇī If such is the supernatural power of a mere woman what must the supernatural power of a Buddha be likeUnder such circumstances the heretics will flee away without so much as waiting to see youThe Teacher replied I know very well Gharaṇī that you are perfectly able to perform such a miracle as you describe but this basket of flowers was not prepared for you With these words he declined her offerGharaṇī said to herself The Teacher declines my offer doubtless there is some one else able to perform a greater miracle than that which I am able to perform So saying she stepped asideThought the Teacher to himself Thus will the merits of these persons also become manifest thus will they send up their shouts of applause in the midst of a company thirtysix leagues in extent And he asked yet others What manner of miracle will you performThus and thus will we perform a miracle Reverend Sir they replied and standing before the Teacher they sent up shouts of applauseThe story goes that among others Culla Anāthapiṇḍika thought to himself So long as the Teacher has a son like me alive a lay disciple who has attained the Fruit of the Third Path he will have no occasion to weary himself Accordingly he said to the Teacher Reverend Sir I will perform a miracle What manner of miracle will you perform asked the Teacher Reverend Sir I will assume a form like that of Mahā Brahmā twelve leagues in size and in the midst of this company with a sound like the roar of thunder that accompanies a heavy rainstorm I will shake the earth even as Mahā Brahmā shakes the earthThe multitude will ask What sound is that and the answer will be That is the sound of an earthquake produced by Culla AnāthapiṇḍikaThe heretics will say If such is the supernatural power of a layman what must be the supernatural power of a Buddha And they will flee away without so much as waiting to see youThe Teacher repeated the answer he had given to Gharaṇī I know that you possess this power and declined his offer to perform the miracleNow a certain sevenyearold girl a novice named Cīrā who had attained Fourfold Knowledge saluted the Teacher and said Reverend Sir I will perform a miracleWhat miracle will you perform CīrāReverend Sir I will fetch hither Mount Sineru and the range of mountains that encircles the earth and Himālaya likewise and I will set them up in a row and then I will soar like a wildgoose up and over the tops of these mountains without so much as touching them and return hither When the populace see me they will ask Who is that and the answer will be That is the female novice CīrāThe heretics will say It is a mere sevenyearold novice who possesses this supernatural power what must the supernatural power of a Buddha be like So saying they will flee away without so much as waiting to see youTo her likewise did the Exalted One reply I know your supernatural power and declined her offer to perform the miracleNow a certain novice named Cunda who although he had attained Fourfold Knowledge and Freedom from the Depravities yet was only seven years old saluted the Teacher and said Exalted One I will perform a miracle What miracle will you perform asked the Teacher Cunda replied Reverend Sir I will take upon my shoulder a great roseapple tree which is the emblem of the Land of the Roseapple and I will wave it back and forth and I will bring fragments of roseapple and give to this company to eat thereof and I will also bring flowers of the coral treeThen the nun Uppalavaṇṇā saluted the Teacher and said Reverend Sir I will perform a miracle What miracle will you perform asked the Teacher Reverend Sir replied Uppalavaṇṇā Before the eyes of a multitude extended twelve leagues on all sides I will surround myself with a retinue thirtysix leagues round about and I will take the form of a Universal Monarch and will come to you and will pay obeisance to youSaid the Teacher I know your supernatural power and declined her offer to perform the miracleThen the Elder Moggallāna the Great saluted the Exalted One and said Reverend Sir I will perform a miracle What miracle will you perform asked the Teacher Reverend Sir I will put Mount Sineru king of mountains between my teeth and crunch it like a kidneybeanWhat else will you doI will roll up this earth like a mat and thrust it between my fingersWhat else will you doI will cause the earth to revolve like a potters wheel and I will give the multitude the essence of earth to eatWhat else will you doI will place the earth in my left hand and I will remove all these living beings to another continentWhat else will you doI will use Mount Sineru as an umbrellastick uplift the great earth place it thereon and taking it in one hand even as a monk carries an umbrella in his hand walk about in the airSaid the Teacher I know your supernatural power but declined to permit him to perform the miraclesSaid Moggallāna Doubtless the Teacher knows of someone able to perform a miracle more wonderful than any that I am able to perform So saying he stepped asideThen said the Teacher to him Moggallāna this basket of flowers was not prepared for youThe burden which I bear is like the burden of none other mine is a burden which none other is able to bearIndeed it is not strange that there is now no one who can bear my burdenIn previous states of existence also in which solely through my own volition I was born as an animal no one was able to bear my burden When the Teacher had thus spoken the Elder asked him When was this Reverend Sir and how was thisThe Teacher then related in detail the Kaṇha Usabha Jātaka  Having related this Jātaka to make the matter clearerhe related in detail also the Nandi Visāla Jātaka Now when the Teacher had related these Jātakas he came down the jeweled walk His retinue extended twelve leagues before him to the east twelve leagues behind him twelve leagues on his left hand and twelve leagues on his rightAnd standing erect in the midst of this numerous company extending twentyfour leagues in all directions the Exalted One performed the Twin MiracleAccording to the Sacred Text the facts are to be understood as follows What is known regarding the Twin Miracle performed by the TathāgataOn this occasion the Tathāgata performed the Twin Miracle a miracle far more wonderful than any performed by his disciples From the upper part of his body proceeded flames of fire and from the lower part of his body a stream of waterFrom the lower part of his body proceeded flames of fire and from the upper part of his body a stream of waterFrom the front part of his body proceeded flames of fire and from the back part of his body a stream of water From the back part of his body proceeded flames of fire and from the front part of his body a stream of water Flames of fire and streams of water proceeded from his right and left eyes from his right and left ears from his right and left nostrils from his right and left shoulders from his right and left hands from his right and left sides from his right and left feet from the tips of his fingers and from the roots of his fingersThe Exalted One walked and a counterpart of him stood or sat or lay down  his counterpart lay down and the Exalted One walked or stood or satThis is the tradition regarding the Twin Miracle performed by the Exalted OneThis miracle therefore the Teacher performed as he walked up and down the jeweled walkBy means of a trance induced by meditation on the element of fire flames of fire proceeded from the upper part of his body and by means of a trance induced by meditation on the element of water a stream of water proceeded from the lower part of his bodyThe words From the lower part of his body and From the upper part of his body are used to show that from the same part of the body from which a stream of water proceeded from that part also flames of fire proceeded and that from the same part of the body from which flames of fire proceeded from that part also a stream of water also proceededThe same principle of interpretation applies also to the following expressionsNow the flames of fire were not mingled with the stream of water nor was the stream of water mingled with the flames of fireBoth the flames of fire and the stream of water shot upwards as far as the World of Brahmā and streamed thence to the rim of the CakkavāḷaWith reference to the six colors rays of six colors like molten gold running out of crucibles or like an ooze of kings yellow coming out of a tube shot upwards from the interior of one Cakkavāḷa to the World of Brahmā whence they streamed back to the rim of the CakkavāḷaThus each Cakkavāḷa was arched with rays of light shaped like a Ashaped rafter and the House of Enlightenment was suffused with an even lightOn that day the Teacher walked up and down performing his Twin Miracle and as he did so he preached the Law to the multitude from time to timeThereupon the multitude sent up shouts of applauseHearing the shouts of applause which proceeded from the multitude the Teacher straightway looked into the hearts of the great multitude and in sixteen ways perceived the disposition of mind of each oneSo quick is the movement of the mind of the BuddhasAs he thus preached the Law and performed miracles a great multitude of living beings obtained clear comprehension of the LawSince the Teacher saw in that vast throng none other than himself who understood his mind and could ask him questions he put forth his supernatural power and created a doubleWhile the Exalted One walked up and down his double occupied himself otherwise while his double walked up and down the Exalted One occupied himself otherwiseAs the Teacher performed his miracle he considered within himself Where have Buddhas of the past kept residence after performing this miracle Straightway he became aware of the following It has been their invariable custom to enter upon residence in the World of the Thirtythree and to expound the Abhidhamma Piṭaka to their mother Thereupon he lifted up his right foot and set it down on the summit of Yugandhara and then he lifted up his left foot and set it down on the summit of Sineruand thus in three strides setting his foot on the earth but twice he spanned sixtyeight hundred thousand leaguesOne must not conclude When the Teacher took those strides he lengthened his strideSakka saw the Teacher and thought to himself The Teacher will doubtless keep residence during the coming season of the rains on the Yellowstone Throne thus will he be of service to deities without number But if the Teacher enters upon residence here the other deities will not be able to lift even a handThis Yellowstone Throne is sixty leagues long and fifty leagues broad and even if the Teacher seats himself therein it will appear as if emptyThe Teacher perceiving the thought in his mind threw his own mantle over the stone throne completely covering itThought Sakka The robe he threw quite covers the throne to be sure but he himself will appear small indeed when he seats himself thereonThe Teacher perceiving the thought in his mind enfolded the Yellowstone Throne in a fold of his robe even as a big monk clad in refuseragrobes might cover a low stool with their skirts and when he had so done seated himself upon the Yellowstone ThroneAt that moment the multitude looked for the Teacher but saw him not it was as though the moon had just setThereupon the multitude saidHas he gone to Cittakāṭa or to Kelāsa or to YugandharaWe may not see the Supremely Enlightened One Prince of the World mightiest of menAs the multitude repeated this Stanza they wept and lamentedOthers said to themselves The Teacher delights in solitude and embarrassed at having performed such a miracle before such a throng has departed to another kingdom or country Shall we not see him again henceforth And weeping and lamenting they pronounced the following StanzaHe that delights in solitude he that is steadfast will not come back again to this worldWe may not see the Supremely Exalted the Prince of the World the mightiest of menThereupon they asked Moggallāna the Great Where has the Teacher gone Reverend SirAlthough Moggallāna the Great himself knew perfectly well where the Teacher had gone he thought to himself Of others also let the wondrous powers become known and therefore answered Ask the Elder AnuruddhaSo they asked the Elder Anuruddha Reverend Sir where has the Teacher goneThe Elder Anuruddha replied He has entered upon residence in the World of the Thirtythree seated upon the Yellowstone Throne he went thither to expound the Abhidhamma Piṭaka to his motherWhen will he return Reverend SirHe will spend these three months expounding the Abhidhamma and he will return on the day of the Terminal Festival Thereupon the multitude exclaimed We will not go away until we see the Teacher So then and there they pitched campwith the sky alone for their coveringAlthough the multitude was so great naught that issued from their bodies was noticeable on the ground for the earth opened and received all so that the surface of the earth was everywhere sweet and cleanBefore the Teacher ascended he addressed Moggallāna the Great Moggallāna do you expound the Law to this company and Culla Anāthapiṇḍika will provide foodAccordingly during those three months Culla Anāthapiṇḍika provided that company with water and riceporridge and hard food and likewise with betel and garlands and perfumes and ornamentsMoggallāna the Great expounded the Law to them and answered the questions of all who had come to see a miracleWhen the Teacher had entered upon residence in the World of the Thirtythree and had seated himself upon the Yellowstone Throne that he might expound the Abhidhamma to his mother the deities of ten thousand worlds surrounded him and waited upon himTherefore is it saidIn the World of the Thirtythree when the Buddha most exalted of beingsDwelt at the foot of the Coraltree seated on the Yellowstone ThroneThe deities of the Ten Worlds assembled together and waited uponThe Supremely Enlightened dwelling at the highest point of the heavensIn comparison with the Supremely Enlightened there was no deity who shoneThe Supremely Enlightened alone shone surpassing all of the other deitiesWhen those powerful deities assembled Aṅkura withdrew and sat down twelve leagues distant while Indaka sat down on the right hand of the TeacherThe Teacher surveyed them both and desiring to make known how great is the fruit that accrues in his dispensation to him who bestows offerings on those that are worthy of offerings said to Aṅkura After a long time although for ten thousand years you made a row of fireplaces twelve leagues in length and gave abundant offerings upon coming to my assembly you have sat down farthest removed of all twelve leagues distant What can be the cause of thisMoreover it is saidThe Supremely Enlightened looked upon Aṅkura and IndakaDeclaring who is worthy of offerings he uttered these wordsYou gave abundant offerings Aṅkura Yet after a long intervalYou sit afar offCome to meThe sound of these words reached the surface of the earthand all that multitude heard itWhen the Teacher had thus spokenRoused by the Righteous Teacher Aṅkura spoke thusWhat good have these gifts done me Is emptiness bestowed by him that is worthy of offeringsThis Yakkha Indaka gave but slender giftsYet he outshines us even as the moon outshines the hosts of starsNow when Aṅkura had thus spoken the Teacher addressed Indaka Indaka you sit on my right hand why do you sit there and depart notIndaka replied Reverend Sir like a farmer who has sown a little seed in a good field I have received the blessing of him that is worthy of offerings And making clear who are worthy of offerings and who are not Indaka saidEven as seed however abundant sown on a barren soilDoes not produce much fruit and does not delight the farmerSo also alms however abundant bestowed upon evil menDo not produce much fruit and do not delight the giverBut even as seed however little in amount sown in a good fieldProduces fruit after a heavy shower and delights the farmerSo also when done for the virtuous and righteous and holyA good deed however slight yields abundant fruitBut what was Indakas former deedThe story goes that on a certain occasion when the Elder Anuruddha entered the village to receive alms he gave him a spoonful of his own foodThis was Indakas work of merit Although Aṅkura had for ten thousand years made a row of fireplaces twelve leagues long and had given abundant alms Indakas deed received the greater rewardTherefore spoke Indaka as he didThereupon the Teacher said Aṅkura one should use discrimination in giving alms In that way alms like seed sown on good soil yield abundant fruitBut you did not do so Hence your alms did not become fruitful To make the matter clearer he saidAlms should be given with discrimination so given it yields abundant fruit They that give alms with discrimination go to heavenThe giving of alms with discrimination is extolled by the Happy OneAlms given to living beings here in the world who are worthy of offeringsYield abundant fruitlike seeds sown on good groundHaving thus spoken he expounded the Law further by pronouncing the following StanzasWeeds ruin a field lust ruins mankindTherefore alms given to those that are free from lust yield abundant fruitWeeds ruin a field hatred ruins mankindTherefore alms given to those that are free from hatred yield abundant fruitWeeds ruin a field delusion ruins mankindTherefore alms given to those that are free from delusion yield abundant fruitWeeds ruin a field inordinate desire ruins mankindTherefore alms given to those that are free from inordinate desire yield abundant fruitAnd thus for the space of three months without interruption he recited the Abhidhamma PiṭakaNow when it was time for him to go on his round for alms he would create a double and say to him Preach the Law until I return Then he would himself go to the Himālaya and after chewing a betel toothstick and rinsing his mouth in the waters of Lake Anotatta he would bring alms from Uttarakuru and seating himself in the garden of a man of wealth he would eat his mealThe Elder Sāriputta went to the World of the Tusita gods and waited upon the TeacherWhen the Teacher had finished his meal he said Sāriputta today I have recited the Law soandsofar therefore do you recite it to the five hundred monks who depend upon you and he taught it to the ElderWe are told that through faith in the Twin Miracle five hundred youths of respectable families became monks under the ElderWhen he had thus spoken he returned to the World of the Gods and preached the Law in person beginning at the place where the counterpart of the Buddha had left offThe Elder returned to the world of men and preached the Law to those monksWe are told that in the dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa they were little bats On a certain occasion as they hung over a mountaincave they overheard two monks reciting the Abhidhamma as they walked up and down their walk and straightway fell in love with their voicesAs for the expressions These aggregates of being these elements of being they did not know what they meant but solely because they had fallen in love with their voices when they passed from that state of existence they were reborn in the World of the Gods There for the space of an interval between two Buddhas they enjoyed celestial glory afterwards they were reborn in Sāvatthi in the households of families of distinctionReceiving faith in the Twin Miracle they became monks under the Elder and were the first to obtain mastery over the Seven BooksThe Teacher continued for the space of three months in the same way to recite the Abhidhamma PiṭakaAt the conclusion of his recitation of the Law eight hundred thousands of millions of deities obtained clear comprehension of the Law and Mahā Māyā was established in the Fruit of ConversionThat multitude thirtysix leagues in extent knowing that the Terminal Festival would occur seven days later approached the Elder Moggallāna the Great and said to him Reverend Sir is it not proper for us to know on what day the Teacher will descend We will not depart hence until we see the TeacherVenerable Moggallāna the Great replied Very well brethren and diving into the earth right there he went to the foot of Mount Sineru Then he willed Let the multitude behold me as I climb Then he climbed the side of Mount Sineru his form appearing like the thread of a yellow blanket pulled through a jewelThe multitude watched him and cried out from time to time He has climbed one league He has climbed two leagues When the Elder had climbed the mountain he prostrated himself before the Teacher uplifting the Teachers feet with the crown of his head and spoke thus to him Reverend Sir the multitude desire to go where they can see you when will you descendBut Moggallāna where is your older brother SāriputtaReverend Sir he is keeping residence at the gate of the city SakassaMoggallāna seven days hence I will descend for the great Terminal Festival to the gate of the city Sakassa those who desire to see me must go there Now the distance from Sāvatthi to Sakassa was thirty leagues and no one could supply the multitude with provisions for so long a journey So the Teacher said Tell them to take upon themselves the vows of Fastday and to go forth as though they were going to a neighboring monastery to hear the LawVery well Reverend Sir replied the Elder and returning to the multitude he told them what the Teacher had saidWhen the season of the rains had passed and the Terminal Festival had been celebrated the Teacher informed Sakka Great king it is my intention to return to the path of menThereupon Sakka created three ladders one of gold one of jewels and one of silverThe feet of these ladders rested against the gate of the city Sakassa and their tops against the summit of Mount SineruOn the right side was the ladder of gold for the deities on the left side the ladder of silver for Mahā Brahmā and his train and in the middle the ladder of jewels for the TathāgataOn the occasion of the Descent of the Gods the Teacher standing on the summit of Mount Sineru performed the Twin Miracle and looked up There was a clear view of the nine Worlds of BrahmāAs he looked down he had a clear view as far as the Avīci HellThen he looked forth to the four cardinal points and to the four intermediate points and there was a clear view of countless thousands of worldsGods looked upon men and men looked upon godsThe deities descended upon the ladder of gold Mahā Brahmā and his train descended upon the ladder of silver and the Supremely Enlightened One himself descended upon the ladder of jewelsPañcasikha the celestial musician took his yellow lute of Vilva wood and descending on the Buddhas right rendered honor to the Teacher with the notes of his sweet celestial lute Mātali the charioteer descending on the Buddhas left rendered honor to the Teacher with celestial scents garlands and flowers Mahā Brahmā held a parasol Suyāma a yaks tail fanWith this retinue did the Teacher descend and set foot on earth at the gate of the city SakassaElder Sāriputta approached the Teacher and paid obeisance to him And because he had never before seen the Teacher descend with such majesty the glorious majesty of a Buddha he spoke thusNever have I seen nor has any one ever heardThe Teacher speaking so sweetly now returned from Tusita with his followingWith this Stanza and with many others did Elder Sāriputta express his joy Having so done he said to the Teacher Reverend Sir today all gods and men hold you dear and seek after youThe Teacher replied Sāriputta with such virtues as these are the Buddhas endowed and therefore are they dear to gods and men alike So saying he expounded the Law by pronouncing the following StanzaThey that are devoted to meditation they that are steadfast They that delight in the tranquillity of retirement from the worldThey that are enlightened and mindful they are beloved even of the godsAt the four cardinal points and at the four intermediate points stood gods and men to the World of Brahmā above and below Nāgas and Supaṇṇas stood on the ground in an attitude of reverent supplication Said they Reverend Sir there is no one here who can answer this question consider it no furtherSaid the Teacher Sāriputta is perplexed to hear this question adapted to the comprehension of a BuddhaOf all that have weighed the Law and attained Arahatship Of all that are yet under training of all that have not yet attained the Fruit of ConversionAs to their walk and conversation do thou who knowest Being asked tell me Venerable SirThought the Teacher Although there is no doubt in Sāriputtas mind regarding the meaning of the question since he understands that I am asking a question relating to the walk and conversation of those who are yet under training and to those who have finished their training and attained Arahatship yet there is doubt in his mind regarding my purpose in asking the question and he is considering within himself Of the aggregates of being the elements of being and the organs and objects of sense by which one of these can I best grasp the intent of the Teacher Unless I give him a clue he will not be able to answer the question I will therefore give him a clue Therefore he said Sāriputta do you understand the expression This beingThen the following thought occurred to him So soon as Sāriputta grasps the thought that is in my mind he will answer the question in terms of the aggregates of beingNo sooner had the Teacher given him a clue than the question became clear in a hundred ways and a thousand wayswith the assistance of the clue which the Teacher had given him the Elder straightway answered the questionWe are told that with the sole exception of the Supremely Enlightened One there was no other able to answer the question which the Teacher asked the Elder SāriputtaTherefore we are told the Elder took his stand before the Teacher and said with a shout of triumph Reverend Sir I can count the number of drops of rain that have fallen into the great ocean during all the rains which have fallen during an entire cycle of time and likewise the number of drops of rain that have fallen upon the ground and likewise the number of drops of rain which have fallen upon the mountains and I can set down an exact reckoning thereofThe Teacher replied Sāriputta I know your power of reckoningIndeed there is nothing with which may be compared the learning of the Venerable Elder SāriputtaThat is why the Elder saidThe sands along the Ganges waste away the waters in the ocean waste awayThe particles of dust of the earth waste away the number thereof I can reckon by my knowledgeThus did a monk so richly endowed although at first he saw neither the beginning nor the end of the question asked him which lay within the range of the Buddhas knowledge by taking advantage of the clue given him by the Teacher answer the questionWhen the monks heard of this they began the following discussion The Commander of the Faith the Elder Sāriputta answered all by himself a question which no one else in the whole world was able to answerThe Teacher hearing the discussion said This is not the first time that the Elder Sāriputta has answered a question which the whole world was unable to answer he did the same thing in a previous state of existence And when he had thus spoken he related a Story of the PastThough a thousand and more should assemble togetherwho lack wisdom and prattle for a hundred yearsYet were a single man of wisdom superiorwho replied He only shall have the bowl who can fly through the air and take itwhereupon the rock settled in the same place in which it had lain beforegathered together and began to follow the Elder saying to him Reverend Sir show us also the miraclenow he is running away from us but since we are not willing that he should get away from us we are pursuing him and the heretics looked like mottled cowsone end of which rested upon the eastern rim of the world and the other upon the western rimfrom every pore of his body proceeded forth flames of fire and from every pore of his body proceeded forth a stream of water Sixcolored were they blue and yellow and red and white and pink and brilliantnot wearying them with uninterrupted discourse but giving them sufficient opportunity to refresh themselves from time to timethat in case any person took pleasure in any portion of the Law or in any miracle the Buddha preached the Law and performed a miracle in accordance with the temper and disposition of every such personthe double then asked him questions and the Teacher answered themSeeing the Teacher perform his miracle thus and hearing him preach the Law two hundred millions of living beings in that vast throng obtained Comprehension of the Lawthe true explanation is that when he lifted up his foot the mountains huddled under his feet and when he strode forward they rose again and stood in their proper placesAs he sat there outshining with the splendor of his own body all the other deities his mother approached from the Palace of the Tusita gods and sat down on his right hand Aṅkura on his left handthe deity Indaka likewise approached and sat down on his right hand and Aṅkura on his left handThen seated in the midst of the assembly of the gods for the sake of his mother the Teacher began the recitation of the Abhidhamma Piṭaka beginning with the words Those things which are good those things which are evil those things which are neither good nor eviland that it was with reference to these youths that the Teacher thus spokewhile the Teacher yet remained in the World of the Gods they mastered Seven Booksin all that assembly thirtysix leagues in circuit not one looked upon the glory of the Buddha that day but desired for himself the estate of a BuddhaIt is the invariable practice of all the Buddhas we are told after they have performed the Twin Miracle to spend the season of the rains in the World of the Gods and to descend to the world of men at the gate of the city SakassaAnd there marking the spot where they set their right foot on the ground there is a permanent shrineThere the Teacher took his stand and asked a question within the comprehension of those who had not yet attained the Fruit of Conversion Those who had not yet attained the Fruit of Conversion readily answered the question which was within their comprehension but were unable to answer the question adapted to the comprehension of those who had attained the Fruit of ConversionIn like manner those who had attained the Fruit of Conversion were unable to answer the question adapted to the comprehension of those who had attained the Fruit of the Second Path Similarly the rest of the Chief Disciples were unable to answer the question within the range of Moggallāna the Great Moggallāna the Great was unable to answer the question within the range of the Elder Sāriputta and the Elder Sāriputta was unable to answer the question within the range of the BuddhaThe Teacher looked first to the east and then to each of the other cardinal points It was one great courtNow at that time a new reception hall named Ubbhataka had just been built by the Pāvā Mallans and it had not yet been dwelled in by any contemplative brahman or anyone at all in human formthe five bhikkhus were disgusted and left me thinking The recluse Gotama now lives luxuriously he has given up his striving and reverted to luxuryAnd he related this Jātaka in detailif he understand that which another speaksBecause the load was heavy because the road was deep with mudThey harnessed Blackie and he straightway drew the loadOne should always speak kindly under no circumstances should one speak harshlyFor one who spoke kindly he drew a heavy loadAnd brought him wealth and all because he liked himas happens in one who abides diligent ardent and resoluteThe Pāvā Mallans heard The Blessed One they say wandering among the Mallans with a large Saṅgha of monksapproximately  monks in allhas arrived at Pāvā and is staying near Pāvā in Cunda the silversmiths mango groveSo the Pāvā Mallans went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they said to him Lord a new reception hall named Ubbhataka has just been built by the Pāvā Mallans and it has not yet been dwelled in by any contemplative brahman or anyone at all in human formMay the Blessed One be the first to use it When the Blessed One has used it first the Pāvā Mallans will use it afterwardsThat will be for their longterm welfare  happinessThe Blessed One acquiesced with silenceSensing his acquiescence the Pāvā Mallans got up from their seats bowed down to him circumambulated him and then went to the new reception hall On arrival they spread it all over with felt rugs arranged seats set out a water vessel and raised an oil lamp Then they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him stood to one sideAs they were standing there they said to him Lord the reception hall has been covered all over with felt rugs seats have been arranged a water vessel has been set out and an oil lamp raisedIt is now time for the Blessed One to do as he sees fitSo the Blessed Oneafter adjusting his under robe and carrying his bowl  outer robewent together with the Saṅgha of monks to the reception hall On arrival he washed his feet entered the hall and sat with his back to the central post facing eastThe Saṅgha of monks washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the western wall facing east ranged around the Blessed OneThe Pāvā Mallans washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the eastern wall facing west ranged around the Blessed OneThen the Blessed Onehaving spent most of the night instructing urging rousing  encouraging the Pāvā Mallans with a Dhamma talkdismissed them saying The night is far gone VaseṭṭhasDo what you think it is now time to doResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One the Pāvā Mallans got up from their seats and bowing down to him  circumambulating him leftThen not long after the Pāvā Mallans had left the Blessed Onesurveying the silent Saṅgha of monksaddressed Ven Sāriputta Sāriputta the Saṅgha of monks is free of drowsinessLet yourself be inspired by a Dhamma talk for themMy back achesI will rest itAs you say lord Ven Sāriputta responded to the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One having had his outer robe arranged folded in four lay down on his right side in the lions sleeping posture with one foot on top of the other mindful  alert having made a mental note to get upI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was wandering among the Mallans with a large Saṅgha of monksapproximately  monks in alland arrived at Pāvā a city of the MallansThere he stayed near Pāvā in Cunda the silversmiths mango groveNow on that occasion Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta had recently died in PāvāOn his death the Nigaṇṭhas

without dispute so that this holy life will endure  last a long time and that will be for the benefit  happiness of many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of devas  human beingsThen the Blessed One having gotten up said to Ven Sāriputta Excellent Sāriputta Excellent Its excellent how you have spoken to the monks of the sequence for reciting togetherThat is what Ven Sāriputta said the Teacher approved and gratifiedthe monks delighted in Ven Sāriputtas wordsI go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Icchanangala in the wood near IcchanangalaNow on that occasion a number of wellknown welltodo brahmins were staying at Icchanangala that is the brahmin Canki the brahmin Tarukkha the brahmin Pokkharasati the brahmin Janussoni the brahmin Todeyya and other wellknown welltodo brahminsThen while the brahmin students Vasettha and Bharadvaja were walking and wandering for exercise this discussion arose between them How is one a brahminThe brahmin student Bharadvaja said When one is wellborn on both sides of pure maternal and paternal descent seven generations back unassailable and impeccable in respect of birth then one is a brahminThe brahmin student Vasettha said When one is virtuous and fulfils the observances then one is a brahminBut the brahmin student Bharadvaja could not convince the brahmin student Vasettha nor could the brahmin student Vasettha convince the brahmin student BharadvajaThen the brahmin student Vasettha addressed the brahmin student Bharadvaja Sir the recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan is living at Icchanangala in the wood near IcchanangalaNow a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessedCome Bharadvaja let us go to the recluse Gotama and ask him about this matterAs he answers so we will remember it Yes sir the brahmin student Bharadvaja repliedThen the two brahmin students Vasettha and Bharadvaja went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished they sat down at one sideWe have attained full mastery Over all that the Vedic experts teachA dispute has arisen between us Gotama Concerning the question of birth and classSince neither of us could convince the other Or make him see his point of viewAs people turn with palms upraised Towards the moon when it reaches fullnessSo now we ask of you Gotama The eye uprisen in the worldExplain to us who do not know How we should recognise a brahminBuddha  I will explain to you  Vasettha said the Blessed OneThe generic divisions of living beings For many are the kinds of birthKnow first the grass and trees Though they lack selfawarenessNext come the moths and butterflies And so on through as far as antsThen know the kinds of quadrupeds Of varied sorts both small and largeKnow those whose bellies are their feet To wit the longbacked class of snakesKnow too the waterdwelling fish That pasture in the liquid worldNext know the birds that wing their way As they range in open skiesWhile in these births the differences Of birth make their distinctive markNor in the hairs nor in the head Nor in the ears nor in the eyesIn human bodies in themselves Nothing distinctive can be foundDistinction among human beings Is purely verbal designationWho makes his living among men By varied crafts you should knowWho makes his living among men By merchandise you should knowWho makes his living among men By serving others you should knowWho makes his living among men By stealing you should knowWho makes his living among men By archery you should knowWho makes his living among men By priestly craft you should knowWhoever governs among men The town and realm you should knowI call him not a brahmin Because of his origin and lineageIf impediments still lurk in him He is just one who says SirWho is unimpeded and clings no more He is the one I call a brahminWho has cut off all fetters And is no more by anguish shakenWho has cut each strap and thong The reins and bridleband as wellWho endures without a trace of hate Abuse violence and bondage tooWho does not flare up with anger Dutiful virtuous and humbleWho like the rain on lotus leaves Or mustard seed on the point of an awlWho knows right here within himself The destruction of all sufferingWho with deep understanding wise Can tell the path from the notpathAloof alike from householders And those gone into homelessnessWho has laid aside the rod Against all beings frail or boldWho is unopposed among opponents Peaceful among those given to violenceWho has dropped all lust and hate Dropped conceit and contemptWho utters speech free from harshness Full of meaning ever truthfulWho in the world will never take What is not given long or shortWho has no more inner yearnings Regarding this world and the nextWho has no more indulgences No more perplexity since he knowsWho by transcending all ties here About both merit and evil deedsWho pure as the spotless moon Is clear and limpid and in whomWho has passed beyond the swamp The mire samsara all delusionWho has abandoned sensual pleasures And wanders here in homelessnessWho has abandoned craving too And wanders here in homelessnessWho leaves behind all human bonds And has cast off the bonds of heavenWho leaves behind delight and discontent Who is cool and without attachmentWho knows how beings pass away To reappear in many a modeWhose destination is unknown To gods to spirits and to menWho has no impediments at all Before behind or in the middleThe herds leader perfected hero The great seer whose victory is wonWho knows his manifold past lives And sees the heavens and states of woeFor name and clan are assigned As mere designations in the worldFor those who do not know this fact Wrong views have long underlain their heartsOne is not a brahmin by birth Nor by birth a nonbrahminBy action is one a brahmin By action is one a nonbrahminFor men are farmers by their acts And by their acts are craftsmen tooAnd men are robbers by their acts And by their acts are soldiers tooSo that is how the truly wise See action as it really isLiving beings are bound by action Like the chariot wheel by the pinWhen this was said the brahmin students Vasettha and Bharadvaja said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master GotamaFrom today let Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone to him for refuge for lifeAnd I sat down thinking

River at the root of the Bodhi treethe tree of awakeningnewly awakenedAnd on that occasion he sat at the root of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of releaseAt the end of seven days he emerged from that concentrationThen a certain overbearing brahman went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he stood to one sideAs he was standing there he said to the Blessed One To what extent Master Gotama is one a brahman And which are the qualities that make one a brahmanThen on

 seriously illThen at a later time he recovered from his illnessWhen he had recovered from the illness the thought occurred to him What if I were to go into Rājagaha for almsNow on that occasion  devatās were in a state of eagerness for the chance to give alms to Ven Mahā KassapaBut Ven Mahā Kassapa turning down those  devatās early in the morning adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  robeswent into Rājagaha for alms along the streets of the poor the streets of the indigent the streets of the weaversThe Blessed One saw that Ven Mahā Kassapa had gone into Rājagaha for alms along the

nor spoke to himHis wife after going not far away was looking back and saw Ven Saṅgāmaji neither looking at the child nor speaking to him On seeing this the thought occurred to her The contemplative doesnt even care about his sonReturning from there and taking the child she leftThe Blessed Onewith his divine eye purified and surpassing the humansaw Ven Saṅgāmajis former wife misbehaving in that

let the Blessed One be disturbed by cold Dont let the Blessed One be disturbed by heat Dont let the Blessed One be disturbed by the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  creeping thingsThen with the passing of seven days the Blessed One emerged from that concentrationMuccalinda the nāga king realizing that the sky had cleared and was free of clouds unraveled his coils from the body of the Blessed One dropped his own appearance and assuming the appearance of a young man stood in front of the Blessed One with hands before his heart paying homageThen on realizing the significance of that the

on arrival sat down on a seat laid outSeated he addressed the monks For what topic are you sitting together here And what was the discussion that came to no conclusionJust now lord after the meal on returning from our alms round we were sitting gathered together here at the kareritree pavilion when this discussion arose They repeat what had been saidIt isnt proper monks that sons of good families

that concentration he surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened OneAs he did so he saw living beings burning with the many fevers and aflame with the many fires born of passion aversion  delusionThen on realizing the significance of that he on that occasion exclaimedThis world is burningAfflicted by contact it calls disease a selfBy whatever means it supposes anythingit becomes otherwise than thatBecoming otherwise the world is attached to becomingafflicted by becoming and yet delights in that very becomingWhere theres delight there is fearWhat one fears is stressfulThis holy life is lived for the abandoning of becomingWhatever contemplatives or brahmans say that liberation from becoming is by means of becoming all of them are not released from becoming I sayAnd whatever contemplatives or brahmans say that escape from becoming is by means of nonbecoming all of them have not escaped from becoming I sayFor this stress comes into play in dependence on every acquisition With the ending of every clingingsustenance theres no stress coming into playLook at this world Beings afflicted with thick ignorance are unreleased from passion for what has come to be All levels of becoming anywhere in any way are inconstant stressful subject to changeSeeing thisas its come to bewith right discernment one abandons craving for becoming and doesnt delight in nonbecomingFrom the total ending of cravingcomes fading  cessation without remainder unbindingFor the monk unboundthrough lack of clingingsustenance theres no further becomingHe has conquered Māra won

Meghiya what you think it is now time to doThen in the early morning Ven Meghiya adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  robeswent into Jantu Village for almsHaving gone for alms in Jantu Village after the meal returning from his alms round he went to the bank of the Kimikālā River As he was walking up  down along the bank of the river to exercise his legs he saw a pleasing charming mango groveSeeing it the thought occurred to him How pleasing  charming this mango groveIts enough for a young man of good family intent on exertion to exert himself in meditationIf the Blessed One gives me permission I would like to exert myself in meditation in this mango groveSo Ven Meghiya went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed OneJust now in the early morning I adjusted my under robe andcarrying my bowl  robeswent into Jantu Village for almsHaving gone for alms in Jantu Village after the meal returning from my alms round I went to the bank of the Kimikālā RiverAs I was walking up  down along the bank of the river to exercise my legs I saw a pleasing charming mango groveSeeing it the thought occurred to me How pleasing  charming this mango groveIts enough for a young man of good family intent on exertion to exert himself in meditationIf the Blessed One gives me permission I would like to exert myself in meditation in this mango groveIf the Blessed One gives me permission I would like to go to the mango grove to exert myself in meditationWhen this was said the Blessed One responded to Ven Meghiya As long as I am still alone stay here until another monk comesA second time Ven Meghiya said to the Blessed One Lord the Blessed One has nothing further to do and nothing further to add to what he has doneI however have something further to do and something further to add to what I have doneIf the Blessed One gives me permission I would like to go to the mango grove to exert myself in meditationA second time the Blessed One responded to Ven Meghiya As long as I am still alone stay here until another monk comesA third time Ven Meghiya said to the Blessed One Lord the Blessed One has nothing further to do and nothing further to add to what he has doneI however have something further to do and something further to add to what I have doneIf the Blessed One gives me permission I would like to go to the mango grove to exert myself in meditationAs you are talking about exertion Meghiya what can we sayDo what you think it is now time to doThen Ven Meghiya rising from his seat bowing down to the Blessed One and circling him to the right went to the mango grove On arrival having gone deep into the grove he sat down at the root of a certain tree for the days abidingNow while Ven Meghiya was staying in the mango grove he was for the most part assailed by three kinds of unskillful thoughts thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will and thoughts of doing harmThe thought occurred to him How amazing How astoundingEven though it was through faith that I went forth from home to the homeless lifestill I am overpowered by these three kinds of unskillful thoughts thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will and thoughts of doing harmEmerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now while I was staying in the mango grove I was for the most part assailed by three kinds of unskillful thoughts thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will and thoughts of doing harmThe thought occurred to me How amazing How astoundingEven though it was through faith that I went forth from home to the homeless lifestill I am overpowered by these three kinds of unskillful thoughts thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will and thoughts of doing harmMeghiya in one whose awarenessrelease is still immature five qualities bring it to maturityWhich fiveThere is the case where a monk has admirable people as friends companions  colleaguesIn one whose awarenessrelease is still immature this is the first quality that brings it to maturityFurthermore the monk is virtuous He dwells restrained in accordance with the Pāṭimokkha consummate in his behavior  range of activity He trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faultsIn one whose awarenessrelease is still immature this is the second quality that brings it to maturityFurthermore he gets to hear at will easily and without difficulty talk that is truly sobering and conducive to the opening of awareness ie talk on modesty contentment seclusion nonentanglement arousing persistence virtue concentration discernment release and the knowledge  vision of releaseIn one whose awarenessrelease is still immature this is the third quality that brings it to maturityFurthermore he keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and for taking on skillful qualities He is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualitiesIn one whose awarenessrelease is still immature this is the fourth quality that brings it to maturityFurthermore he is discerning endowed with the discernment related to arising  passing awaynoble penetrating leading to the right ending of stressIn one whose awarenessrelease is still immature this is the fifth quality that brings it to maturityMeghiya in one whose awarenessrelease is still immature these are the five qualities that bring it to maturityMeghiya when a monk has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues it is to be expected that he will be virtuous will dwell restrained in accordance with the Pāṭimokkha consummate in his behavior  range of activity and will train himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faultsWhen a monk has admirable people as friends  colleagues it is to be expected that he will get to hear at will easily and without difficulty talk that is truly sobering and conducive to the opening of awareness ie talk on modesty contentment seclusion nonentanglement arousing persistence virtue concentration discernment release and the knowledge  vision of releaseWhen a monk has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues it is to be

qualitiesWhen a monk has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues it is to be expected that he will be discerning endowed with the discernment relating to arising  passing awaynoble penetrating leading to the right ending of stressAnd furthermore when the monk is established in these five qualities there are four additional qualities he should develop He should develop contemplation of the unattractive so as to abandon passion He should develop good will so as to abandon ill will He should develop mindfulness of inout breathing so as to cut off thinking He should develop the perception of inconstancy so as to uproot the conceit I am For a monk perceiving inconstancy the perception of notself is made steadyOne perceiving notself attains the uprooting of the conceit I amunbinding right in the herenowThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedLittle thoughts subtle thoughtswhen followed stir up the heartNot comprehending the thoughts of the heartone runs here  there the mind out of controlBut comprehending the thoughts of the heartone who is ardent mindful restrains themWhen followed they stir up the heartone awakened lets them go without traceI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Upavattana the Mallan sal grove near KusinarāAnd on that occasion not far from the Blessed One many monks were staying in wilderness huts highstrung rowdy unruly talkative of loose words  muddled mindfulness unalert unconcentrated their minds scattered their faculties left wide openThe Blessed One saw those many monks staying in wilderness huts highstrung rowdy unruly talkative of loose words  muddled mindfulness unalert unconcentrated their minds scattered their faculties left wide openThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedBy leaving your body unprotected being immersed in wrong viewconquered by sloth  torpor you go under Māras swayTherefore with protected mind ranging in right resolvehonoring right view knowing risefallconquering sloth  torpor a monk leaves all bad destinations behindI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was wandering among the Kosalans with a large community of monksThen coming down from the road he went to a certain tree and on arrival sat down on a seat laid outA certain cowherd then went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged him with DhammatalkThe cowherdinstructed urged roused  encouraged by the Blessed Ones talk on Dhammasaid to him Lord may the Blessed One together with the community of monks acquiesce to my offer of tomorrows mealThe Blessed One acquiesced with silenceThen the cowherd understanding the Blessed Ones acquiescence got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and left circling him to the rightThen after the night had passed the cowherdhaving prepared in his own home a great deal of thick milkrice porridge  fresh gheeannounced the time of the meal to the Blessed One Its time lord The meal is readySo the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  robeswent together with the community of monks to the cowherds home On arrival he sat down on a seat laid outThe cowherd with his own hand served  satisfied the community of monks headed by the Blessed One with thick milkrice porridge  fresh gheeThen when the Blessed One had eaten and had rinsed his bowl  hands the cowherd taking a lower seat sat down to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged him with Dhammatalk then got up from his seat  leftNow not long after the Blessed Ones departure the cowherd was killed by a certain man between the boundaries of two villagesA large number of monks then went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they told him The cowherd who today served  satisfied the community of monks headed by the Blessed One with thick milkrice porridge  fresh ghee has been killed it is said by a certain man between the boundaries of two villagesThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedWhatever an enemy might do to an enemy or a foe to a foethe illdirected mind can do to you even worseI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryAnd on that occasion Ven Sāriputta and Ven Mahā Moggallāna were staying in Pigeon CaveThen on a moonlit night Ven Sāriputtahis head newly shavenwas sitting in the open air having attained a certain level of concentrationAnd on that occasion two yakkhas who were companions were flying from north to south on some business or otherThey saw Ven Sāriputtahis head newly shavensitting in the open airSeeing him the first yakkha said to the second Im inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the headWhen this was said the second yakkha said to the first Enough of that my good friend Dont lay a hand on the contemplativeHes an outstanding contemplative of great power  great mightA second time the first yakkha said to the second Im inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the headA second time the second yakkha said to the first

contemplative a blow on the headA third time the second yakkha said to the first Enough of that my good friend Dont lay a hand on the contemplativeHes an outstanding contemplative of great power  great mightThen the first yakkha ignoring the second yakkha gave Ven Sāriputta a blow on the headAnd with that blow he might have knocked over an elephant seven or eight cubits tall or split a great rocky cragBut right there the yakkhayelling Im burningfell into the Great HellNow Ven Moggallānawith his divine eye pure and surpassing the humansaw the yakkha give Ven Sāriputta a blow on the headSeeing this he went to Ven Sāriputta and on arrival said to him I hope you are well friend Sāriputta I hope you are comfortable I hope you are feeling no painI am well friend Moggallāna I am comfortable But I do have a slight headacheHow amazing friend Sāriputta How astoundingHow great your power  mightJust now a yakkha gave you a blow on the headSo great was that blow that he might have knocked over an elephant seven or eight cubits tall or split a great rocky crag But all you say is this I am well friend Moggallāna I am comfortable But I do have a slight headacheHow amazing friend Moggallāna How astoundingHow great your power  might Where you saw a yakkha just nowI didnt even see a dust devilThe Blessed Onewith the divine earproperty pure and surpassing the humanheard those two great beings conversing in this wayThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedWhose mind standing like rock doesnt shakedispassionate for things that spark

near Kosambī at Kositas monasteryAnd on that occasion the Blessed One lived hemmed in with monks nuns male  female lay followers kings royal ministers sectarians  their disciplesHemmed in he lived unpleasantly and not in easeThe thought occurred to him I now live hemmed in by monks nuns male  female lay followers kings royal ministers sectarians  their disciplesHemmed in I live unpleasantly and not in easeWhat if I were to live alone apart from the crowdSo early in the morning the Blessed One adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  robeswent into Kosambī for almsThen having gone for alms in Kosambī after the meal returning from his alms round he set his own lodgings in order and carrying his bowl  robes without telling his attendant without informing the community of monksalone  without a companionleft on a wandering tour toward PalileyyakaAfter wandering by stages he reached PalileyyakaThere he stayed in Palileyyaka in the protected forest grove at the root of the auspicious

herd went to Palileyyaka to the protected forest grove and the root of the auspicious sal treeto where the Blessed One was stayingThere he kept the grass down in the area where the Blessed One was staying and brought drinking water and washing water for the Blessed One with his trunkThen when the Blessed One was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to his awareness Before I lived hemmed in by monks nuns male  female lay followers kings royal ministers sectarians  their disciples Hemmed in I lived unpleasantly and not in easeBut now I live not hemmed in by monks nuns male  female lay followers kings royal ministers sectarians  their disciples Not hemmed in I live pleasantly and in easeAnd this train of thought appeared to the awareness of the bull elephant Before I

the Contented Tusita groupThats the way it is nanda Thats the way it is for the mothers of bodhisattas are shortlivedSeven days after the bodhisattas birth the bodhisattas mothers pass away and reappear among the Contented groupThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedThose who have come to be those who will beAll will go leaving the body behindThe skillful person realizing the loss of allshould live the holy life ardentlyI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryAnd on that occasion in Rājagaha there was a leper named Suppabuddha a poor pitiful wretch of a personAnd on that occasion the Blessed One was sitting surrounded by a large assembly teaching the DhammaSuppabuddha the leper saw the large gathering of people from afarand thought to himself Without a doubt someone must be distributing staple or nonstaple food thereWhy dont I go over to that large group of peopleand maybe there Ill get some staple or nonstaple foodSo he went over to the large group of peopleThen he saw the Blessed One sitting surrounded by a large assembly teaching the DhammaOn seeing this he realized Theres no one distributing staple or nonstaple food thereThats Gotama the contemplative surrounded teaching the DhammaWhy dont I listen to the DhammaSo he sat down to one side right there thinking I too will listen to the DhammaThen the Blessed One having encompassed the awareness of the entire assembly with his awareness asked himself Now who here is capable of understanding the DhammaHe saw Suppabuddha the leper sitting in the assemblyand on seeing him the thought occurred to him This person here is capable of understanding the DhammaSo aiming at Suppabuddha the leper he gave a stepbystep talk ie he proclaimed a talk on generosity on virtue on heaven he declared the drawbacks degradation  corruption of sensuality and the rewards of renunciationThen when the Blessed One knew that Suppabuddha the lepers mind was ready malleable free from hindrances elevated  clear he then gave the Dhammatalk peculiar to Awakened Ones ie stress origination cessation  pathAnd just as a clean cloth free of stains would properly absorb a dye in the same way as Suppabuddha the leper was sitting in that very seat the dustless stainless Dhamma eye arose within him Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessationHaving seen the Dhamma reached the Dhamma known the Dhamma gained a foothold in the Dhamma having crossed over  beyond doubt having had no more perplexity having gained fearlessness  independence from others with regard to the Teachers message he got up from his seat and went to the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed OneMagnificent lord MagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed Onethrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monksMay the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeThen Suppabuddha the leper having been instructed urged roused  encouraged by the Blessed Ones Dhamma talk delighting in  approving of the Blessed Ones words got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and left circling him to the rightNot long after his departure he was attacked  killed by a cow with a young calfThen a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they said to the Blessed One Lord the leper named Suppabuddha whom the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged with a Dhamma talk has diedWhat is his destination What is his future stateMonks Suppabuddha the leper was wise He practiced the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma and did not pester me with issues related to the DhammaWith the destruction of the first three fetters he is a streamwinner not subject to states of deprivation headed for selfawakening for sureWhen this was said one of the monks said to the Blessed One Lord what was the cause what was the reason why Suppabuddha the leper was such a poor pitiful wretch of a personOnce monks in this very Rājagaha Suppabuddha the leper was the son of a rich moneylenderWhile being escorted to a pleasure park he saw Tagarasikhin the Private Buddha going for alms in the cityOn seeing him the thought occurred to him Who is this leper prowling aboutSpitting and disrespectfully turning his left side to Tagarasikhin the Private Buddha he leftAs a result of that deed he boiled in hell for many years many hundreds of years many thousands of years many hundreds of thousands of yearsAnd then as a remainder of the result of that deed he became a poor pitiful wretch of a person in this very RājagahaBut on encountering the Dhamma  Vinaya made known by the Tathāgata he acquired conviction virtue learning relinquishment  discernmentHaving acquired conviction virtue learning relinquishment  discernment on encountering the Dhamma  Vinaya made known by the Tathāgata nowon the breakup of the body after deathhe has reappeared in a good destination a heavenly world in company with the devas of the heaven of the ThirtythreeThere he outshines the other devas both in beauty  in rankThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedAs one with eyes  having energy would treacherous uneven placesso a wise one in the

of boys on the road between Sāvatthī  Jetas Grove catching little fishSeeing them he went up to them and on arrival said to them Boys do you fear pain Do you dislike painYes lord we fear pain We

will do an evil deedyou wont escape pain catching up as you run awayI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryAnd on that occasion Ven Mahā Kaccāna was living among the people of Avantī on Pavatta Mountain near the Osprey HabitatAnd at that time the lay follower Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa was Ven Mahā Kaccānas supporterThen as Soṇa

lay followers of Pāṭali Village for a large part of the night with Dhammatalkdismissed them saying The night is far gone householders Do what you think it is now time to do So the lay followers of Pāṭali Village delighting in  approving of the Blessed Ones words got up from their seats bowed down to him and left circling him to the rightThen the Blessed One not long after they had left entered an empty buildingNow on that occasion Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha were building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the VajjiansAnd on that occasion many devas by the thousands were occupying sites in Pāṭali VillageIn the area where devas of great influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of great influence were inclined to build their homesIn the area where devas of middling influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of middling influence were inclined to build their homesIn the area where devas of low influence

consulted the devas of the Thirtythree Thats how Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha are building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the VajjiansJust now nandawith the divine eyepurified and surpassing the humanI saw many devas by the thousands occupying sites in Pāṭali VillageIn the area where devas of great influence occupy sites there the minds of the kings royal

the Ariyans extends as far as merchants roads extend this will be the supreme city Pāṭaliputta where the seedpods of the Pāṭali plant break openThere will be three dangers for Pāṭaliputta from fire from water and from the breaking of alliancesThen Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they stood to one sideAs they were standing there they said to him May Master Gotama acquiesce to our meal today together with the community of monksThe Blessed One acquiesced with silenceThen Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha understanding the Blessed Ones acquiescence went to their resthouse On arrival after having exquisite staple  nonstaple food prepared in their resthouse they announced the time to the Blessed One Its time Master Gotama The meal is readyThen the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  robeswent together with the community of monks to the resthouse of Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha On arrival he sat down on the seat laid outSunīdha  Vassakāra with their own hands served  satisfied the community of monks with the Buddha at its head with exquisite staple  nonstaple foodThen when the Blessed One had finished his meal and rinsed his bowl  hands Sunīdha  Vassakāra taking a low seat sat to one sideAs they were sitting there the Blessed One gave his approval with these versesIn whatever place a wise person makes his dwellingthere providing food for the virtuous the restrained leaders of the holy lifehe should dedicate that offering to the devas thereThey receiving honor will honor him being respected will show him respectAs a result they will feel sympathy for him like that of a mother for her child her sonA person with whom the devas sympathize always meets with auspicious thingsThen the Blessed One having given his approval to Sunīdha  Vassakāra with these verses got up from his seat and leftAnd on that occasion Sunīdha  Vassakāra followed right after the Blessed One By whichever gate Gotama the contemplative departs today that will be called the Gotama GateAnd by whichever ford he crosses over the Ganges River that will be called the Gotama FordSo the gate by which the Blessed One departed was called the Gotama GateThen he went to the Ganges RiverNow on that occasion the Ganges River was full up to the banks so that a crow could drink from itSome people were searching for boats some were searching for floats some were binding rafts in hopes of going from this shore to the otherSo the Blessed Onejust as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended armdisappeared from the near bank of the Ganges River and reappeared on the far bank together with the community of monksHe saw that some people were searching for boats some were searching for floats some were binding rafts in hopes of going from this shore to the otherThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedThose who cross the foaming floodhaving made a bridge avoiding the swampswhile people are binding raftshave already crossed  the wiseI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was journeying along a road in the Kosalan country with Ven Nāgasamāla as his junior companionVen Nāgasamāla while going along the road saw a fork in the pathOn seeing it he said to the Blessed One That lord Blessed One is the route We go that wayWhen this was said the Blessed One said This Nāgasamāla is the route We go this wayA second time A third time Ven Nāgasamāla said to the Blessed One That lord Blessed One is the route We go that wayAnd for a third time the Blessed One said This Nāgasamāla is the route We go this wayThen Ven Nāgasamāla placing the Blessed Ones bowl  robes right there on the ground left saying This lord Blessed One is the bowl  robesThen as Ven Nāgasamāla was going along that route thievesjumping out in the middle of the roadpummeled him with their fists  feet broke his bowl and ripped his outer robe to shredsSo Ven Nāgasamālawith his bowl broken his outer robe ripped to shredswent to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now lord as I was going along that route thieves jumped out in the middle of the road pummeled me with their fists  feet broke my bowl and ripped my outer robe to shredsThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedWhen traveling together mixed togetherwith a person who doesnt know an attainerofwisdomon realizing that the person is evil abandons himas a milkfeeding heron a bogI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migāras motherAnd on that occasion a dear and beloved grandson of Visākhā Migāras mother had diedSo

grandchildren as there are people in SāvatthīBut how many people in Sāvatthī die in the course of a daySometimes ten people die in Sāvatthī in the course of a day sometimes nine eight seven six five four three two Sometimes one person dies in Sāvatthī in the course of a daySāvatthī is never free from people dyingSo what do you think VisākhāWould you ever be free of wet clothes  wet hairNo lordEnough of my having so many children  grandchildren Visākhā those who have a hundred dear ones have a hundred sufferings Those who have ninety dear ones have ninety sufferings Those who have eighty seventy sixty fifty forty thirty twenty ten nine eight seven six five four three two Those who have one dear one have one suffering  Those who have no dear ones have no sufferings  They are free from sorrow free from stain free from lamentation I tell youThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedThe sorrows lamentationsthe many kinds of suffering in the worldexist dependent on something dearThey dont exist when theres nothing dearAnd thus blissful  sorrowlessare those for whom nothing in the world is anywhere dearSo one who aspires to the stainless  sorrowlessshouldnt make anything dear in the world anywhereI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen Ven

crosslegged in the sky in space Entering  emerging from the fire property he was totally unboundNow when Dabba Mallaputta rose up into the air and sitting crosslegged in the sky in space entered  emerged from the fire property and was totally unbound his body burned and was consumed so that neither ashes nor soot could be discernedJust as when ghee or oil is burned and consumed neither ashes

conventions They are assigned here and thereNot knowing they declare to us One is a brahmin by birthAnd men are merchants by their acts And by their acts are servants tooAnd men are chaplains by their acts And by their acts are rulers tooSeers of dependent origination Skilled in action and its resultsAction makes the world go round Action makes this generation turnAsceticism the holy life Selfcontrol and inner training By this one becomes a brahmin In this supreme brahminhood liesOne possessing the triple knowledge Peaceful with being all destroyedKnow him thus O Vasettha As Brahma and Sakka for those who understandTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryNow on that occasion the venerable Sariputta was wandering in the Southern Hills with a large Sangha of bhikkhusThen a certain bhikkhu who had spent the Rains at Rajagaha went to the venerable Sariputta in the Southern Hills and exchanged greetings with himWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideThe Blessed One is well and strong friendIs the Sangha of bhikkhus well and strong friendThe Sangha of bhikkhus too is well and strong friendFriend there is a brahmin named Dhananjani living in Rajagaha at the Tandulapala GateIs that brahmin Dhananjani well and strongThat brahmin Dhananjani too is well and strong friendIs he diligent friendHow could he be diligent friendHe plunders brahmin householders in the name of the king and he plunders the king in the name of the brahmin householdersHis wife who had faith and came from a clan with faith has died and he has taken another wife a woman without faith who comes from a clan without faithThis is bad news that we hear friend It is bad news indeed to hear that the brahmin Dhananjani has become negligentPerhaps sometime or other we might meet the brahmin Dhananjani and have some conversation with himThen having stayed in the Southern Hills as long as he chose the venerable Sariputta set out to wander towards RajagahaWandering by stages he eventually arrived at RajagahaThen when it was morning the venerable Sariputta dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Rajagaha for almsSo when the venerable Sariputta had wandered for alms in Rajagaha and had returned from his almsround after his meal he went to the brahmin DhananjaniThe brahmin Dhananjani saw the venerable Sariputta coming in the distanceand he went to him and said Drink some of this fresh milk Master Sariputta until it is time for the mealI shall be at the root of that tree for the days abidingYou may come thereYes sir he repliedAnd then after he had eaten his morning meal the brahmin Dhananjani went to the venerable Sariputta and exchanged greetings with himWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideHow can we be diligent Master Sariputta when we have to support our parents our wife and children and our slaves servants and workers when we have to do our duty towards our friends and companions towards our kinsmen and relatives towards our guests towards our departed ancestors towards the deities and towards the king and when this body must also be refreshed and nourishedWhat do you think Dhananjani Suppose someone here were to behave contrary to the Dhamma to behave unrighteously for the sake of his parents and then because of such behaviour the wardens of hell were to drag him off to hellWould he be able to free himself by pleading thus It was for the sake of my parents that I behaved contrary to the Dhamma that I behaved unrighteously so let not the wardens of hell drag me off to hell Or would his parents be able to free him by pleading thus It was for our sake that he behaved contrary to the Dhamma that he behaved unrighteously so let not the wardens of hell drag him off to hellNo Master SariputtaEven while he was crying out the wardens of hell would fling him into hellWhat do you think Dhananjani Suppose someone here were to behave contrary to the Dhamma to behave unrighteously for the sake of his wife and childrenNo Master SariputtaEven while he was crying out the wardens of hell would fling him into hellWhat do you think Dhananjani Who is the better one who for the sake of his parents behaves contrary to the Dhamma behaves unrighteously or one who for the sake of his parents behaves according to the Dhamma behaves righteouslyMaster Sariputta the one who for the sake of his parents behaves contrary to the Dhamma behaves unrighteously is not the betterDhananjani there are other kinds of work profitable and in accordance with the Dhamma by means of which one can support ones parents and at the same time both avoid doing evil and practise meritWhat do you think Dhananjani Who is the better one who for the sake of his wife and childrenMaster Sariputta the one who for the sake of refreshing and nourishing this body behaves contrary to the Dhamma behaves unrighteously is not the betterDhananjani there are other kinds of work profitable and in accordance with the Dhamma by means of which one can refresh and nourish this body and at the same time both avoid doing evil and practise meritThen the brahmin Dhananjani having delighted and rejoiced in the venerable Sariputtas words rose from his seat and departedOn a later occasion the brahmin Dhananjani became afflicted suffering and gravely illThen he told a man Come good man go to the Blessed One pay homage in my name with your head at his feet and say Venerable sir the brahmin Dhananjani is afflicted suffering and gravely illThen go to the venerable Sariputta pay homage in my name with your head at his feet and say Venerable sir the brahmin Dhananjani is afflicted suffering and gravely illThen say thus It would be good venerable sir if the venerable Sariputta would come to the house of the brahmin Dhananjani out of compassionYes venerable sir the man replied and he went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to the Blessed One he sat down at one sideThen he went to the venerable Sariputta and after paying homage to the venerable SariputtaThe venerable Sariputta consented in silenceI hope your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasingMaster Sariputta I am not getting well I am not comfortableMy painful feelings are increasing not subsidingJust as if a strong man were splitting my head open with a sharp sword so too violent winds cut through my headI am not getting wellI am not getting wellI am not getting wellI am not getting well I am not comfortableMy painful feelings are increasing not subsidingWhat do you think Dhananjani Which is better  hell or the animal malm The animal realm Master Sariputta Which is better  the animal realm or the realm of ghosts The realm of ghosts Master Sariputta Which is better  the realm of ghosts or the realm of human beings Human beings Master SariputtaWhich is better  human beings or the gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings The gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings Master Sariputta Which is better  the gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings or the gods of the heaven of the Thirtythree The gods of the heaven of the Thirtythree Master Sariputta Which is better  the gods of the heaven of the Thirtythree or the Yama gods The Yama gods Master Sariputta Which is better  the Yama gods or the gods of the Tusita heaven The gods of the Tusita heaven Master Sariputta Which is better  the gods of the Tusita heaven or the gods who delight in creating The gods who delight in creating Master Sariputta Which is better  the gods who delight in creating or the gods who wield power over others creations The gods who wield power over others creations Master SariputtaWhat do you think Dhananjani Which is better  the gods who wield power over others creations or the Brahmaworld Master Sariputta said the Brahmaworld Master Sariputta said the BrahmaworldThen the venerable Sariputta thought These brahmins are devoted to the BrahmaworldSuppose I show the brahmin Dhananjani the path to the company of BrahmaAnd he said Dhananjani I shall show you the path to the company of Brahma Listen and attend closely to what I shall say Yes sir he repliedThe venerable Sariputta said this  What is the path to the company of BrahmaHere Dhananjani a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with lovingkindness likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with lovingkindness abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill willThis is the path to the company of BrahmaAgain Dhananjani a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassionwith a mind imbued with appreciative joywith a mind imbued with equanimity likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with equanimity abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill willThis too is the path to the company of BrahmaThen Master Sariputta pay homage in my name with your head at the Blessed Ones feet and say Venerable sir the brahmin Dhananjani is afflicted suffering and gravely illThen the venerable Sariputta having established the brahmin Dhananjani in the inferior Brahmaworld rose from his seat and departed while there was still more to be doneThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus Sariputta having established the brahmin Dhananjani in the inferior Brahmaworld rose from his seat and departed while there was still more to be doneThen the venerable Sariputta went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one side and said Venerable sir the brahmin Dhananjani is afflicted suffering and gravely ill he pays homage with his head at the Blessed Ones feetSariputta having established the brahmin Dhananjani in the inferior Brahmaworld why did you rise from your seat and leave while there was still more to be doneVenerable sir I thought thus These brahmins are devoted to the Brahmaworld Suppose I show the brahmin Dhananjani the path to the company of BrahmaSariputta the brahmin Dhananjani has died and has reappeared in the Brahmaworldand the venerable Sariputta asked him Is the Blessed One well and strong friendand there he lived in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryNow at that time the brahmin Dhananjani was having his cows milked in a cowshed outside the cityMonks these two slander the TathagataWhich twoHe who explains a discourse whose meaning needs to be inferred as one whose meaning has already been fully drawn out And he who explains a discourse whose meaning has already been fully drawn out as one whose meaning needs to be inferredThese are two who slander the TathagataBhikkhus these two things pertain to true knowledgeWhat twoSerenity and insightWhen serenity is developed what benefit does one experienceThe mind is developedWhen the mind is developed what benefit does one experienceLust is abandonedWhen insight is developed what benefit does one experienceWisdom is developedWhen wisdom is developed what benefit does one experienceIgnorance is abandonedA mind defiled by lust is not liberated and wisdom defiled by ignorance is not developedThus bhikkhus through the fading away of lust there is liberation of mind and through the fading away of ignorance there is liberation by wisdomMonks I will teach you the level of a person of no integrity and the level of a person of integrityListen  pay close attentionI will speak As you say lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One saidNow what is the level of a person of no integrityA person of no integrity is ungrateful  unthankfulThis ingratitude this lack of thankfulness is advocated by rude peopleIt is entirely on the level of people of no integrityA person of integrity is grateful  thankfulThis gratitude this thankfulness is advocated by civil peopleIt is entirely on the level of people of integrity I tell you monks there are two people who are not easy to repayWhich twoYour mother  fatherEven if you were to carry your mother on one shoulder  your father on the other shoulder for  years and were to look after them by anointing massaging bathing  rubbing their limbsand they were to defecate  urinate right there on your shouldersyou would not in that way pay or repay your parentsIf you were to establish your mother  father in absolute sovereignty over this great earth abounding in the seven treasures you would not in that way pay or repay your parentsWhy is thatMother  father do much for their children They care for them they nourish them they introduce them to this worldBut anyone who rouses his unbelieving mother  father settles  establishes them in conviction rouses his unvirtuous mother  father settles  establishes them in virtue rouses his stingy mother  father settles  establishes them in generosity rouses his foolish mother  father settles  establishes them in discernment To this extent one pays  repays ones mother  fatherThus have I heard On one occasion the Venerable Mahakaccana was dwelling at Varana on a bank of the Kaddama LakeThen the brahmin Aramadanda approached the Venerable Mahakaccana and exchanged greetings with himWhen they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk he sat down to one sideand said to him  Why is it Master Kaccana that  khattiyas fight with khattiyas brahmins with brahmins and householders with householdersIt is brahmin because of adherence to lust for sensual pleasures bondage to it fixation on it obsession by it holding firmly to itthat khattiyas fight with khattiyas brahmins with brahmins and householders with householdersWhy is it Master Kaccana that ascetics fight with asceticsIt is brahmin because of adherence to lust for views bondage to it fixation on it obsession by it holding firmly to it that ascetics fight with asceticsIs there then anyone in the world who has overcome this adherence to lust for sensual pleasures holding firmly to itand this adherence to lust for views holding firmly to itAnd who is thatThere is brahmin a town to the east called SavatthiThere the Blessed One the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One is now dwellingThe Blessed One has overcome this adherence to lust for sensual pleasures bondage to it fixation on itobsession by it holding firmly to it and he has overcome this adherence to lust for views bondage to it fixation on it obsession by it holding firmly to itWhen this was said the brahmin Aramadanda rose from his seat arranged his upper robe over one shoulder lowered his right knee to the ground  reverently saluted in the direction of the Blessed One and uttered this inspired utterance three timesHomage to the Blessed One the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One Homage to the Blessed One the Arahantthe Perfectly Enlightened One Homage to the Blessed One the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened OneIndeed that Blessed One has overcome this adherence to lust for sensual pleasures bondage to it fixation on it obsession by it holding firmly to it and he has overcome this adherence to lust for views bondage to it fixation on it obsession by it holding firmly to itExcellent Master Kaccana Excellent Master KaccanaMaster Kaccana has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning up right what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see formsMaster Kaccana I now go for refuge to Master Gotama to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusLet Master Kaccana consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for lifeThe male and female householders saw the Blessed One sitting thereEnough brahminI have finished my meal for todayand the venerable Sariputta asked him Are you diligent Dhananjanifor the sake of his friends and companionsfor the sake of his kinsmen and relativesfor the sake of his guestsfor the sake of his departed ancestorsfor the sake of the deitiesfor the sake of the kingWould he be able to free himself by pleading thus It was for the sake of refreshing and nourishing this body that I behaved contrary to the Dhamma that I behaved unrighteously so let not the wardens of hell drag me off to hell Or would others be able to free him by pleading thus It was for the sake of refreshing and nourishing this body that he behaved contrary to the Dhamma that he behaved unrighteously so let not the wardens of hell drag him off to hellthe one who for the sake of his parents behaves according to the Dhamma behaves righteously is the betterfor the sake of his slaves servants and workersfor the sake of his kinsmen and relativesfor the sake of his friends and companionsfor

behaves according to the Dhamma behaves righteously is the betterhe pays homage with his head at the Blessed Ones feethe pays homage with his head at the venerable Sariputtas feetand said to the brahmin Dhananjani I hope you are getting well brahmin I hope you are comfortableand delivered his messagehe delivered his message sayingIt would be good venerable sir if the venerable Sariputta would come to the residence of the brahmin Dhananjani out of compassionThen the venerable Sariputta dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe he went to the residence of the brahmin Dhananjani sat down on a seat made readyand that their subsiding not their increase is apparenttheir increase and not their subsiding is apparentJust as if a strong man were tightening a tough leather strap around my head as a headband so too there are violent pains in my headJust as if a skilled butcher or his apprentice were to carve up an oxs belly with a sharp butchers knife so too violent winds are carving up my bellyJust as if two strong men were to seize a weaker man by both arms and roast him over a pit of hot coals so too there is a violent burning in my bodytheir increase and not their subsiding is apparenthe pays homage with his head at the Blessed Ones feetSoon after the venerable Sariputta had left the brahmin Dhananjani died and reappeared in the Brahmaworldfor the sake of his slaves servants and workersTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThen the brahmin Esukari went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideand said  Master Gotama the brahmins prescribe four levels of service They prescribe the level of service towards a brahmin the level of service towards a noble the level of service towards a merchant and the level of service towards a workerTherein Master Gotama the brahmins prescribe this as the level of service towards a brahmin a brahmin may serve a brahmin a noble may serve a brahmin a merchant may serve a brahmin and a worker may serve a brahminThat is the level of service towards a brahmin that the brahmins prescribeMaster Gotama the brahmins prescribe this as the level of service towards a noble a noble may serve a noble a merchant may serve a noble and a worker may serve a nobleThat is the level of service towards a noble that the brahmins prescribeMaster Gotama the brahmins prescribe this as the level of service towards a merchant a merchant may serve a merchant and a worker may serve a merchantThat is the level of service towards a merchant that the brahmins prescribeMaster Gotama the brahmins prescribe this as the level of service towards a worker only a worker may serve a workerThat is the level of service towards a worker that the brahmins prescribeWhat does Master Gotama say about thisWell brahmin has all the world authorised the brahmins to prescribe these four levels of service  No  Master Gotama Suppose brahmin a poor penniless destitute manI do not say brahmin that all are to be served nor do I say that none are to be servedFor if when serving someone one becomes worse and not better because of that service then I say that he should not be served And if when serving someone one becomes better and not worse because of that service then I say that he should be servedIf they were to ask a noble thus Which of these should you serve  one in whose service you become worse and not better when serving him or one in whose service you become better and not worse when serving him answering rightly a noble would answer thus I should not serve the one in whose service I become worse and not better when serving him I should serve the one in whose service I become better and not worse when serving himIf they were to ask a brahminto ask a merchantto ask a workeranswering rightly a worker would answer thus I should not serve the one in whose service I become worse and not better when serving him I should serve the one in whose service I become better and not worse when serving himI do not say brahmin that one is better because one is from an aristocratic family not do I say that one is worse because one is from an aristocratic family I do not say that one is better because one is of great beauty nor do I say that one is worse because one is of great beauty I do not say that one is better because one is of great wealth nor do I say that one is worse because one is of great wealthFor here brahmin one from an aristocratic family may kill living beings take what is not given misconduct himself in sensual pleasures speak falsely speak maliciously speak harshly gossip be covetous have a mind of ill will and hold wrong viewTherefore I do not say that one is better because one is from an aristocratic familyBut also brahmin one from an aristocratic family may abstain from killing living beings from taking what is not given from misconduct in sensual pleasures from false speech from malicious speech from harsh speech and from gossip and he may be uncovetous have a mind without ill will and hold right viewTherefore I do not say that one is worse because one is from an aristocratic familyHere brahmin one of great beautyone of great wealth may kill living beingsand hold wrong viewTherefore I do not say that one is better because one is of great beautyof great wealthBut also brahmin one of great beautyof great wealth may abstain from killing living beingsand hold right viewTherefore I do not say that one is worse because one is of great beautyof great wealthI do not say brahmin that all are to be served nor do I say that none are to be servedFor if when serving someone ones faith virtue learning generosity and wisdom increase in his service then I say that he should be servedWhen this was said the brahmin Esukari said to the Blessed One Master Gotama the brahmins prescribe four types of wealth They prescribe the wealth of a brahmin the wealth of a noble the wealth of a merchant and the wealth of a workerTherein Master Gotama the brahmins prescribe this as the wealth of a brahmin  wandering for alms a brahmin who spurns his own wealth wandering for alms abuses his duty like a guard who takes what has not been givenMaster Gotama the brahmins prescribe this as the wealth of a noble  the bow and quiver a noble who spurns his own wealth the bow and quiver abuses his duty like a guard who takes what has not been givenMaster Gotama the brahmins prescribe this as the wealth of a merchant  farming and cattlebreeding a merchant who spurns his own wealth farming and cattlebreeding abuses his duty like a guard who takes what has not been givenMaster Gotama the brahmins prescribe this as the wealth of a worker  the sickle and carryingpole a worker who spurns his own wealth the sickle and carryingpole abuses his duty like a guard who takes what has not been givenWhat does Master Gotama say about thisWell brahmin has all the world authorised the brahmins to prescribe these four types of wealth No Master Gotama Suppose brahmin a poor penniless destitute manI brahmin declare the noble supramundane Dhamma as a persons own wealthJust as fire is reckoned by the particular condition dependent on which it burns But recollecting his ancient maternal and paternal lineage he is reckoned according to wherever he is rebornIf he is rebornin a clan of workers he is reckoned as a workerIf brahmin anyone from a clan of nobles goes forth from the home life into homelessness and after encountering the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata he abstains from killing living beings from taking what is not given from incelibacy from false speech from malicious speech from harsh speech and from gossip and is uncovetous has a mind without ill will and holds right view he is one who is accomplishing the true way the Dhamma that is wholesomeIf brahmin anyone from a clan of brahmins goes forthWhat do you think brahmin Is only a brahmin capable of developing a mind of lovingkindness towards a certain region without hostility and without ill will and not a noble or a merchant or a workerNo Master GotamaWhether it be a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a worker  those of all four castes are capable of developing a mind of lovingkindness towards a certain region without hostility and without ill willSo too brahmin if anyone from a clan of nobles goes forthWhat do you think brahmin Is only a brahmin capable of taking a loofah and bath powder going to the river and washing off dust and dirt and not a noble or a merchant or a workerNo Master GotamaWhether it be a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a worker  those of all four castes are capable of taking a loofah and bath powder going to the river and washing off dust and dirtSo too brahmin if anyone from a clan of nobles goes forth What do you think brahmin Suppose a headanointed noble king were to assemble here a hundred men of different birthSo too brahmin if anyone from a clan of nobles goes forthWhen this was said the brahmin Esukari said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifefor the sake of refreshing and nourishing this body and because of such behaviour the wardens of hell were to drag him off to hellfor who else could serve a workerthey were to force a cut of meat upon and tell him Good man you must eat this meat and pay for itso too without the consent of those other recluses and brahmins the brahmins nevertheless prescribe those four levels of serviceThat is the wealth of a brahmin which the brahmins prescribeThat is the wealth of a noble which the brahmins prescribeThat is the wealth of a merchant which the brahmins prescribeThat is the wealth of a worker which the brahmins prescribethey were to force a cut of meat upon and tell him Good man you must eat this meat and pay for itso too without the consent of those other recluses and brahmins the brahmins nevertheless prescribe these four types of wealthBut recollecting his ancient maternal and paternal family lineage he is reckoned according to wherever he is rebornIf he is reborn in a clan of nobles he is reckoned as a noble if he is reborn in a clan of brahmins he is reckoned as a brahmin if he is reborn in a clan of merchants he is reckoned as a merchant if he is reborn in a clan of workers he is reckoned as a workerwhen fire burns dependent on logs it is reckoned as a log fire when fire burns dependent on faggots it is reckoned as a faggot fire when fire burns dependent on grass it is reckoned as a grass fire when fire burns dependent on cowdung it is reckoned as a cowdung fire so too brahmin I declare the noble supramundane Dhamma as a persons own wealthI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen a certain devatā in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jetas Grove went to the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down to him she stood to one sideAs she was standing there she said to him Tell me dear sir how you crossed over the floodI crossed over the flood without pushing forward without staying in placeBut how dear sir did you cross over the flood without pushing forward without staying in placeWhen I pushed forward I was whirled about When I stayed in place I sankAnd so I crossed over the flood without pushing forward without staying in placeAt long last I see a brahman totally unboundwho without pushing forward without staying in place has crossed over the entanglements of the worldThat is what the devatā saidThe Teacher approvedRealizing that The Teacher has approved of me she bowed down to him circumambulated himkeeping him to her rightand then vanished right thereNear SāvatthīThen a certain devatā in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jetas Grove went to the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down to him she stood to one sideAs she was standing there she said to himDo you know dear sir freedom liberation seclusion for beingsYes friend I know freedom liberation seclusion for beingsBut how dear sir do you know freedom liberation seclusion for beingsThe Buddha From the destruction of delight in becoming from the ending of perception  consciousness from the cessation stilling of feelings Thats how I know freedom liberation seclusion for beingsNear SāvatthīStanding to one side a devatā addressed the Blessed One with a verseThose in whom phenomena are unpenetrated who may be led by the teachings of othersAsleep are they they havent

radiance and it is possible to use all fire for the purposes of firehe is one who is accomplishing the true way the Dhamma that is wholesomeTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the venerable Udena was living at Benares in the Khemiya Mango GroveNow on that occasion the brahmin Ghotamukha had arrived in Benares for some business or otherAs he was walking and wandering for exercise he came to the Khemiya Mango GroveAt the time the venerable Udena was walking up and down in the openThen the brahmin Ghotamukha went up to the venerable Udena and exchanged greetings with himWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished still walking up and down with the venerable Udena he said this Worthy recluse there is no wanderers life that accords with the Dhamma so it seems to me hereWhen this was said the venerable Udena stepped down from the walk and went into his dwelling where he sat down on a seat made readyThen the venerable Udena said to him There are seats brahminWe did not sit down because we were waiting for Master Udena to speakFor how could one like myself presume to sit down on a seat without first being invited to do soThen the brahmin Ghotamukha took a low seat sat down at one sideBrahmin if you think any statement of mine is to be agreed with then agree with it if you think any statement of mine is to be argued against then argue against it and if you do not understand the meaning of any statement of mine ask me to clarify it thus How is this Master Udena What is the meaning of thisIn this way we can discuss this matterMaster Udena if I think any statement of Master Udenas is to be agreed with I shall agree with it if I think any statement of his is to be argued against I shall argue against it and if I do not understand the meaning of any statement of Master Udenas then I shall ask Master Udena to clarify it thus How is this Master Udena What is the meaning of thisIn this way let us discuss this matterBrahmin there are four kinds of persons to be found existing in the worldWhat fourBrahmin there are two kinds of assemblyWhat twoHere a certain assembly lusts after jewels and earrings and seeks wives and children men and women slaves fields and land gold and silverBut here a certain assembly does not lust after jewels and earrings but having abandoned wives and children men and women slaves fields and land gold and silver has gone forth from the home life into homelessnessNow there is this kind of person who does not torment himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself and who does not torment others or pursue the practice of torturing othersIn which of the two kinds of assembly do you usually see this person brahmin  in the assembly that lusts after jewels and earrings and seeks wives and children men and women slaves fields and land gold and silver or in the assembly that does not lust after jewels and earrings but having abandoned wives and childrenhas gone forth from the home life into homelessnessI usually see this kind of person Master Udena in the assembly that does not lust after jewels and earrings but having abandoned wives and childrenhas gone forth from the home life into homelessnessBut only just now brahmin we understood you to say Worthy recluse there is no wanderers life that accords with the Dhamma so it seems to me hereCertainly Master Udena it was in order to learn that I spoke those wordsThere is a wanderers life that accords with the Dhamma so it seems to me hereIt would be good if out of compassion Master Udena would expound to me in detail those four kinds of persons he mentioned in briefThen brahmin listen and attend closely to what I shall say Yes sir the brahmin Ghotamukha repliedThe venerable Udena said this Here a certain person goes nakedWhen this was said the brahmin Ghotamukha said to the venerable Udena Magnificent Master Udena Magnificent Master UdenaMaster Udena has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see formsFrom today let Master Udena remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeDo not go to me for refuge brahminGo for refuge to that same Blessed One to whom I have gone for refugeWhere is he living now that Master Gotama accomplished and fully enlightened Master UdenaThat Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened has attained final Nibbana brahminIf we heard that Master Gotama was within ten leagues we would go ten leagues in order to see that Master Gotama accomplished and fully enlightenedIf we heard that Master Gotama was within twenty leaguesthirty leaguesforty leaguesfifty leaguesBut since that Master Gotama has attained to final Nibbana we go to that Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusFrom today let Master Udena remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeNow Master Udena the king of Anga gives me a daily donation Let me give Master Udena a regular donation from thatWhat kind of regular donation does the king of Anga give you brahminFive hundred kahapanas Master UdenaIt is not allowable for us to accept gold and silver brahminIf it is not allowable for Master Udena I will have a monastery built for Master UdenaIf you desire to have a monastery built for me brahmin have an assembly hall built for the Sangha at PataliputtaI am still more satisfied and pleased that Master Udena suggests that I give a gift to the SanghaSo with this regular donation and another regular donation I shall have an assembly hall built for the Sangha at PataliputtaThen with that regular donation which he offered to Master Udena and another regular donation added to it the brahmin Ghotamukha had an assembly hall built for the Sangha at PataliputtaAnd that is now known as the GhotamukhiAnd Ghotamukha too stepped down from the walk and went into the dwelling where he stood at one sidesit down if you wishand said to the venerable Udena Worthy recluse there is no wanderers life that accords with the Dhamma so it seems to me hereand that may be because I have not seen such venerable ones as yourself or because I have not seen the Dhamma here But Master Udena the kind of person who does not torment himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself and who does not torment others or pursue the practice of torturing others who since he torments neither himself nor others is here and now hungerless extinguished and cooled and abides experiencing bliss having himself become holy  he does not torment and torture either himself or others both of whom desire pleasure and recoil from pain That is why this kind of person satisfies my mindwho since he torments neither himself nor others is here and now hungerless extinguished and cooled and abides experiencing bliss having himself become holyand that may be because I have not seen such venerable ones as yourself or because I have not seen the Dhamma hereand may Master Udena remember me to have spoken thusBrahmin what kind of person torments himself and pursues the practice of torturing himselfand abides experiencing bliss having himself become holyI go to Master Udena for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusa hundred leagues we would go a hundred leagues in order to see that Master Gotama accomplished and fully enlightenedand that may be because I have not seen such venerable ones as yourself or because I have not seen the Dhamma hereTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the country of the Anguttarapans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus with twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus and eventually he arrived at a town of the Anguttarapans named ApanaThe mattedhair ascetic Keniya heard The recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan has been wandering in the country of the Anguttarapans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus with twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus and he has come to ApanaNow a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effectThen the mattedhair ascetic Keniya went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himThe Blessed One instructed urged roused and encouraged him with a talk on the DhammaThen having been instructed urged roused and encouraged by the Blessed One with a talk on the Dhamma the mattedhair ascetic Keniya said to the Blessed One Let Master Gotama together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrows meal from meWhen this was said the Blessed One told him The Sangha of bhikkhus is large Keniya consisting of twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus and you place full confidence in the brahminsA second time the mattedhair ascetic Keniya said to the Blessed One Although the Sangha of bhikkhus is large Master Gotama consisting of twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus and although I place full confidence in the brahmins still let Master Gotama together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrows meal from meA second time the Blessed One told him The Sangha of bhikkhus is large KeniyaThe Blessed One consented in silenceThen knowing that the Blessed One had consented the mattedhair ascetic Keniya rose from his seat and went to his own hermitage where he addressed his friends and companions his kinsmen and relatives thus Hear me sirs my friends and companions my kinsmen and relatives The recluse Gotama has been invited by me for tomorrows meal together with the Sangha of bhikkhusMake the necessary purchases and preparations for meYes sir they replied and some dug out ovens some chopped wood some washed dishes some set out water jugs some prepared seatsNow on that occasion the brahmin Sela was staying at Apana He was a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies liturgy phonology and etymology and the histories as a fifth skilled in philology and grammar he was fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man and was teaching the recitation of the hymns to three hundred brahmin studentsAt the time the mattedhair ascetic Keniya had placed full confidence in the brahmin SelaThen the brahmin Sela while walking and wandering for exercise attended by his three hundred brahmin students came to the mattedhair ascetic Keniyas hermitageThere he saw some men digging out ovens some chopping wood some washing dishes some setting out water jugs some preparing seats while the mattedhair ascetic Keniya himself was setting up a pavilionWhen he saw this he asked the mattedhair ascetic Keniya What is Master Keniya to hold a marriage or a giving in marriage Or is there some great sacrifice Or has King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha been invited with a large retinue for tomorrows mealI will not be holding a marriage or a giving in marriage Master Sela nor has King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha been invited with a large retinue for tomorrows meal but I am planning a great sacrificeThe recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan has been wandering in the country of the Anguttarapans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus with twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus and has come to ApanaNow a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened buddha blessedHe has been invited by me for tomorrows meal together with the Sangha of bhikkhusDid you say Buddha KeniyaI said Buddha SelaDid you say Buddha KeniyaI said Buddha SelaThen it occurred to the brahmin Sela Even this word Buddha is hard to come across in this worldNow the thirty two marks of a Great Man have been handed down in our hymns and the Great Man who is endowed with them has only two possible destinies no otherIf he lives the home life he becomes a Wheelturning Monarch a righteous king who rules by the Dhamma master of the four quarters allvictorious who has stabilised his country and possesses the seven treasuresHe has these seven treasures the wheeltreasure the elephant treasure the horsetreasure the jeweltreasure the woman treasure the stewardtreasure and the counsellortreasure as the seventhHis children who exceed a thousand are brave and heroic and crush the armies of othersBut if he goes forth from the home life into homelessness he becomes an Accomplished One a Fully Enlightened One who draws aside the veil in the worldHe said My good Keniya where is Master Gotama the Accomplished One the Fully Enlightened One now livingWhen this was said the mattedhair ascetic Keniya extended his right arm and said There where that green line of the grove is Master SelaThen the brahmin Sela went with the three hundred brahmin students to the Blessed OneHe addressed the brahmin students Come quietly sirs tread carefully for these Blessed Ones are difficult to approach they wander alone like lionsWhen I am speaking with the recluse Gotama do not break in and interrupt meThen the brahmin Sela went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideHe saw more or less the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on the Blessed Ones body except twoThen it occurred to the Blessed One This brahmin Sela sees the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on me except twoThen the Blessed One worked such a feat of supernormal power that the brahmin Sela saw that the Blessed Ones male organ was enclosed in a sheathNext the Blessed One extruded his tongue and he repeatedly touched both ear holes and both nostrils and he covered the whole of his forehead with his tongueThen the brahmin Sela thought The recluse Gotama is endowed with the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man they are complete not incomplete But I do not know whether he is a Buddha or notHowever I have heard from elder aged brahmins who speak according to the lineage of teachers that those who are the Accomplished Ones Fully Enlightened Ones reveal themselves as such when their praise is spokenSuppose I extol the recluse Gotama to his face with fitting stanzasThen he extolled the Blessed One to his face with fitting stanzasThe features are seen one and all That distinguish a man as well bornWith eyes clear with countenance bright Majestic erect as a flameA bhikkhu so lovely to look on With skin of so golden a sheen You are fit to be a king a lord of chariots A monarch who makes the wheel turnBuddha I am already a king O Sela the Blessed One replied I am supreme king of the DhammaSela You claim full enlightenment the brahmin Sela said I am supreme long of the DhammaWho is your general that disciple Who follows in the Masters own wayWho is it who helps you to turn The wheel set in motion by youBuddha The wheel set in motion by me The Blessed One replied That same supreme Wheel of DhammaWhat must be known is directly known What must be developed has been developedSo let your doubts about me cease And let decision take their placeI am the one whose presence in the world Is very rarely come uponI am the holy one beyond compare Who has crushed all Maras teeming hordesSela O sirs hear this hear what he says The man of visionThat he is the holy one beyond compare Who has crushed all Maras teeming hordesNow let him follow me who wants And who wants not let him departFor I will go forth under him This man of lofty wisdomPupils If O sir you now approve This teaching of the Enlightened OneSela There are three hundred brahmins here Who with uplifted hands imploreBuddha The holy life is well proclaimed O Sela said the Blessed One To be seen here and not delayedThen the brahmin Sela and his assembly received the going forth under the Blessed One and they received the full admissionThen when the night had ended the mattedhair ascetic Keniya had good food of various kinds prepared in his own hermitage and had the time announced to the Blessed One It is time Master Gotama the meal is readyThen it being morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe he went with the Sangha of bhikkhus to the hermitage of the mattedhair ascetic Keniya and sat down on the seat made readyThen with his own hands the mattedhair ascetic Keniya served and satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with various kinds of good foodWhen the Blessed One had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl the mattedhair ascetic Keniya took a low seat and sat down on one sideThereupon the Blessed One gave him his blessing with these stanzasThen not long after their full admission dwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and resolute the venerable Sela and his assembly by realising for themselves with direct knowledge here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessnessThey directly knew Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingAnd the venerable Sela together with his assembly became arahantsThen the venerable Sela together with his assembly went to the Blessed One Having arranged his upper robe on one shoulder extending his hands in reverential greeting towards the Blessed One he addressed him with these stanzasIn these seven nights O Blessed One We have been tamed in your teachingYou are the Buddha you are the Teacher You are the Sage the conqueror of MaraHaving cut off all evil tendencies You have crossed and guide humanity acrossYou have surmounted all attachments You have removed all the taintsYou are a lion free from clinging You have abandoned fear and dreadHere these three hundred bhikkhus stand With hands held out in adorationO Hero extend your feet And let these great beings worship the TeacherNow it is good to see such arahantsand when this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideA third time the mattedhair ascetic Keniya said to the Blessed One Although the Sangha is large Master Gotamastill let Master Gotama together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrows meal from mewhile the mattedhair ascetic Keniya himself set up a pavilionover this earth bounded by the ocean he rules without a rod without a weapon by means of the Dhammabut wait until our talk is finishedand looked for the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on the Blessed Ones bodyhe was doubtful and uncertain about two of the marks and he could not decide and make up his mind about them about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tonguehe is doubtful and uncertain about two of the marks and he cannot decide and make up his mind about them about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongueSela O perfect in body well favoured Well fashioned and lovely to beholdO Blessed One golden is your colour And white your teeth you are strongThey are all to be found on your body These marks that reveal a Great ManWith beauty so rare why should you Be content with the life of a recluseWith warriors and great princes All devoted to your serviceO Gotama you should reign As ruler of men king above all kingsI make the Wheel of Dhamma revolve The wheel that none can stopI make the Wheel of Dhamma revolve  You tell me O GotamaSariputta the Tathagatas son Helps me in turning this wheelWhat must be abandoned has been abandoned Therefore brahmin I am a BuddhaFor it is always hard to gain Sight of the Enlightened OnesI am the Fully Enlightened One I O brahmin am the supreme physicianHaving defeated all my enemies I rejoice free from fearthe physician The mighty hero who roars Like a lion in the forestWho even though of outcast birth Would not believe him when he saw We too will go forth under him This man of lofty wisdomO may we live the holy life Under you O Blessed OneOne who trains with diligence Will find a fruitful going forthBurnt offerings are the glory of fires Savitri the glory of Vedic hymnsGlory of human beings a king Glory of flowing rivers the seaThe moon is the glory of the stars The sun is the glory of all that shineMerit is the glory of all who aspire The Sangha glory of those who giveWhen the Blessed One had given his blessing with these stanzas he rose from his seat and departedEight days have passed AllSeeing One Since we went to you for refugeIn the midst of this body of recluses You shine like the blazing sunA victor in all the four quarters And lord of the Jambutree GroveTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the country of the Videhans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus with five hundred bhikkhusNow on that occasion the brahmin Brahmayu was living at Mithila He was old aged burdened with years advanced in life and come to the last stage he was in his hundred and twentieth year He was a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies liturgy phonology and etymology and the histories as a fifth skilled in philology and grammar he was fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great ManNow a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect The Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessedHe declares this world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas this generation with its recluses and brahmins with its princes and its people which he has himself realised with direct knowledgeHe teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing and he reveals a holy life that is utterly perfect and pureNow it is good to see such arahantsNow at that time the brahmin Brahmayu had a young brahmin student named Uttara who was a master of the Three Vedasfully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great ManHe told his student My dear Uttara the recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan has been wandering in the country of the Videhans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus with five hundred bhlkkhusCome my dear Uttara go to the recluse Gotama and find out whether the report spread about him is true or not and whether Master Gotama is one such as this or notThus we shall know about Master Gotama through youBut how shall I find out sir whether

Great Man who is endowed with them has only two possible destinies no otherHe has these seven treasures the wheeltreasure the elephanttreasure the horsetreasure the jeweltreasure the womantreasure the stewardtreasure and the counsellortreasure as the seventhBut if he goes forth from the home life into homelessness he becomes an Accomplished One a Fully Enlightened One who draws aside the veil in the worldYes sir he replied He rose from his seat and after paying homage to the brahmin Brahmayu keeping him on his right he left for the country of the Videhans where the Blessed One was wanderingTravelling by stages he came to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideHe saw more or less the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on the Blessed Ones body except twoThen it occurred to the Blessed One This brahmin student Uttara sees more or less the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on me except twoThen the Blessed One worked such a feat of supernormal power that the brahmin student Uttara saw that the Blessed Ones male organ was enclosed in a sheathThen the brahmin student Uttara thought The recluse

the Master Gotama such he is and more than thatWhen this was said the brahmin Brahmayu rose from his seat and after arranging his upper robe on one shoulder he extended his hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and uttered this exclamation three timesHonour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedHonour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedPerhaps sometime or other we might meet Master GotamaThen in the course of his wandering the Blessed One eventually arrived at MithilaThere the Blessed One lived in Makhadevas Mango GroveThe brahmin householders of Mithila heard The recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan has been wandering in the country of the Videhans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus with five hundred bhikkhus and he has now come to Mithila and is living in Makhadevas Mango GroveNow a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effectThen the brahmin householders of Mithila went to the Blessed One Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side some exchanged greetings with him and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished sat down at one side some extended their hands in reverential salutation towards him and sat down at one side some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed Ones presence and sat down at one side some kept silent and sat down at one sideThe brahmin Brahmayu heard The recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from the Sakyan clan has arrived in Mithila and is living in Makhadevas Mango Grove in MithilaThen the brahmin Brahmayu went to Makhadevas Mango Grove with a number of brahmin studentsWhen he came to the Mango Grove he thought It is not proper that I should go to the recluse Gotama without first being announcedThen he addressed a certain brahmin student Come brahmin student go to the recluse Gotama and ask in my name whether the recluse Gotama is free from illness and affliction and is healthy strong and abiding in comfort saying Master Gotama the brahmin Brahmayu asks whether Master Gotama is free from illness abiding in comfort and say this The brahmin Brahmayu Master Gotama is old aged burdened with years advanced in life and come to the last stage he is in his hundred and twentieth year He is a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies liturgy phonology and etymology and the histories as a fifth skilled in philology and grammar he is fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great ManOf all the brahmin householders who live in Mithila the brahmin Brahmayu is pronounced the foremost of them in wealth in knowledge of the hymns and in age and fameHe wants to see Master GotamaYes sir   the brahmin student replied He went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him and when this courteous and amiable talk was finishedThe Blessed One said Now is the time for the brahmin Brahmayu to do as he thinks fitThen the brahmin student went to the brahmin Brahmayu and said Permission has been granted by the recluse GotamaNow is the time sir to do as you think fitSo the brahmin Brahmayu went to the Blessed OneThe assembly saw him coming in the distanceThen the brahmin Brahmayu said to the assembly Enough sirsI shall sit here next to the recluse GotamaThen he went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himHe saw more or less the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on the Blessed Ones body except twoThen the brahmin Brahmayu addressed the Blessed One in stanzasIs what should be concealed by cloth Hid in a sheath greatest of menThough called by a word of feminine gender Perhaps your tongue is a manly onePerhaps your tongue is large as well According to what we have been taughtPlease put it out a little bit And so O Seer cure our doubtAnd now we crave for leave to ask Something that we aspire to knowThen it occurred to the Blessed One This brahmin Brahmayu sees more or less the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on me except twoThen the Blessed One worked such a feat of supernormal power that the brahmin Brahmayu saw that the Blessed Ones male organ was enclosed in a sheathNext the Blessed One extruded his tongue and he repeatedly touched both ear holes and both nostrils and he covered the whole of his forehead with his tongueThen the Blessed One spoke these stanzas in reply to the brahmin BrahmayuWhat must be known is directly known What must be developed has been developedThen the brahmin Brahmayu thought Permission has been granted me by the recluse GotamaWhich should I ask him about good in this life or good in the lives to comeThen he thought I am skilled in the good of this lifeWhy shouldnt I ask him only about good in the lives to comeThen he addressed the Blessed One in stanzasHow has one the triple knowledge And how does one become a holy scholarHow does one become an arahant And how does one attain completenessHow is one a silent sage And how can one be called a BuddhaThen the Blessed One spoke these stanzas in replyWhen this was said the brahmin Brahmayu rose from his seat and after arranging his upper robe on one shoulder he prostrated himself with his head at the Blessed Ones feet and he covered the Blessed Ones feet with kisses and caressed them with his hands pronouncing his name I am the brahmin Brahmayu Master Gotama I am the brahmin Brahmayu Master GotamaThose in the assembly wondered and marvelled and they said It is wonderful sirs it is marvellousThen the Blessed One said to the brahmin Brahmayu Enough brahmin arise sit down in your own seat since your mind has confidence in meThe brahmin Brahmayu then rose and sat down in his own seatThe Blessed One then gave him progressive instruction that is talk on giving talk on virtue talk on the heavens he explained the danger degradation and defilement in sensual pleasures and the blessing of renunciationWhen he knew that the brahmin Brahmayus mind was ready receptive free from hindrances elated and confident he expounded to him the teaching special to the Buddhas suffering its origin its cessation and the pathJust as a clean cloth with all marks removed would take dye evenly so too while the brahmin Brahmayu sat there the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in him All that is subject to arising is subject to cessationThen the brahmin Brahmayu saw the Dhamma attained the Dhamma understood the Dhamma fathomed the Dhamma he crossed beyond doubt did away with perplexity gained intrepidity and became independent of others in the Teachers Dispensation  Then he said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master GotamaMaster Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see formsFrom today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeLet the Blessed One together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrows meal from meThe Blessed One consented in silenceThen knowing that the Blessed One had consented the brahmin Brahmayu rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One keeping him on his right he departedThen when the night had ended the brahmin Brahmayu had good food of various kinds prepared in his residence and he had the time announced to the Blessed One It is time Master Gotama the meal is readyThen it being morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe he went with the Sangha of bhikkhus to the brahmin Brahmayus residence and sat down on the seat made readyThen for a week with his own hands the brahmin Brahmayu served and satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with various kinds of good foodAt the end of that week the Blessed One set out to wander in the country of the VidehansSoon after he had gone the brahmin Brahmayu diedThen a number of bhikkhus went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him they sat down at one sideWhat is his destination What is his future courseBhikkhus the brahmin Brahmayu was wise he entered into the way of the Dhamma and he did not trouble me in the interpretation of the DhammaWith the destruction of the five lower fetters he has reappeared spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and will there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that worldThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThe brahmin Brahmayu heard The recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan has been wandering in the country of the Videhans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus with five hundred bhikkhusNow it is good to see such arahantsIf he

cannot decide and make up his mind about them about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongueNext the Blessed One extruded his tongue and he repeatedly touched both ear holes and both nostrils and he covered the whole of his forehead with his tongueHe has projecting heelsHe has long fingers and toesHis hands and feet are soft and tenderHe has netted hands

departsHonour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedperhaps we might have some conversation with himNow it is good to see such arahantshe stood at one sideand they at once made way for him as for one who was well known and famouslet each sit down in his own seatand when this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat downat one side and looked for the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on the Blessed Ones bodyhe was doubtful about two of the marks and he could not decide and make up his mind about them about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of

doubtful and uncertain about two of the marks and he cannot decide and make up his mind about them about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongueThe twoandthirty marks you learned That are the signs of a Great Man All on my body can be found So brahmin doubt no more on thatHomage to the Fully Enlightened Ones who see the ultimate meaning There are two causes two conditions for the arising of a hearers right view  they are anothers utterance sequential upon truth and reasoned attention in oneself Herein what is anothers utteranceIt is any teaching advice instruction talk about truth in conformity with truth from anotherThe Truths are four  they are Suffering Origin Cessation and the PathAny teaching showing divulging analysing exhibiting displaying these four Truths is called anothers utterance in conformity with truthHerein what is reasoned attention in oneselfWhat is called reasoned attention in oneself is any reasoned attention given to the True Idea as taught without adducing  any external object  this is called reasoned attentionThat mood when reasoned is a door way a directive a means Just as a man is capable of arriving at kindling when on dry ground he rubs a dry  sapless log with a dry upper firestickBecause of his arriving at fire with reasoningoccurring spontaneously as the three similes in the MahaSaccaka Sutta occurred to the Bodhisatta not having been previously heard previously unheard by himHerein anothers utterance and reasoned attention in oneself these are the two conditionsUnderstanding that arises owing to anothers utterance is called understanding consisting in what is heard And the two conditions mentioned firstHerein that one who does not cognize the meaning of anothers utterance when taught sequential upon truth will be one who experiences the meaning  no such instance is foundAnd that one who does not experience the meaning will give reasoned attention no such instance is foundBut that one who cognizes the meaning of anothers utterance when taught sequential upon truth will be one who experiences the meaning  such an instance is foundAnd that one who experiences the meaning will give reasoned attention  such an instance is foundThis is the cause this is the object this is the means for the hearers outlet there is no otherIf this hearing is not conjoined with cognizing the Threads meaning  then by following only the sound of the utterance without cognizing the meaning of anothers utterance no one can arrive at any morethanhuman idea worthy of a Noble Ones knowing and seeing Therefore meanings must be sought by one desirous of attaining extinction of lust hate and delusionThe Guide in the Search  Herein the consecutive order of the search is this  Sixteen Modes of

Origin is Suffering while the fruit of the Way Leading to Cessation of Suffering is CessationThese are the four noble Truths which were taught by the Blessed One at BenaresHerein while the letters the terms the phrases the moods the language and the demonstrations of the Noble Truth of Suffering are of ungauged measure  they are taught nevertheless by an explaining displaying divulging analysing exhibiting and describing of that very meaning And so of all the TruthsAccordingly each one of the Truths must be searched as to its letters terms phrases moods language and demonstrations of ungauged

Idea set rolling by him Nor is there anything whatever of the teaching of the Enlightened Ones the Blessed Ones that is outside the Wheel of the True Idea The whole of that Thread must be sought among

PathThese are the shared ThreadsAfter finding the way of entry as to the penetration of them and as to the characteristic of each by means of these shared Threads according as they are presented in the Threads cited other Threads can be demonstrated provided one does not misapply themVerse should be assessed by verses proseexposition by prose expositions And these shared Threads given above namely the  dyads and  triads  are ten of the possible twelve augmentationsThis is the miscellaneous demonstrationmake up the twelve TruthaugmentationsUp to this point however there has been actually no allinclusive Thread quotedBy one who is diligent that either proseexposition or  verse can after searching be demonstrated  without using the way of entry by these twelve augmentationsHere is a brief demonstrationA All Suffering meets together under seven termsAll Suffering can be demonstrated by the following terms  association with the loathed and dissociation from the loved It is also comprised by painfulness as pain painfulness in determinations and painfulness in change so this suffering is all comprised also by these three termsB Herein all Origin is threefold without fourth without fifthHow threefoldCraving view and actionHerein while craving is the origin of being it is actionSo any inferiority and superiority in the various kinds of being existence and destinations is  comprised by the three kinds of painfulness  and also the body with its consciousness belonging to one shut in by ignorance and fettered by craving for being  which body having been procured owing to the two roots craving and ignorance is comprised by the three painfulnesses tooLikewise view can be arrived at from perversionThat can be demonstrated as sevenfold Herein what is the single pervertingIt is distorted apprehension way of entry by rejection of the fact such that it apprehends distortedly that there is permanence in the impermanentWhile this perverting is one what is perverted is perception cognizance and viewWhat are the four objects of perversionThey are the body feeling cognizance and ideasWhen someone goes by the perversions thus his unprofitable cognizance increasesHerein the perversion of perception increases the unprofitable root hateHerein the fruit of the unprofitable root hate is the three wrongnesses namely wrong speech wrong action and wrong livelihood  the fruit of the unprofitable root greed is the three wrongnesses namely wrong intention wrong effort and wrong concentration  the fruit of the unprofitable root delusion is the two wrongnesses namely wrong view and wrong mindfulnessThus this unprofitable cognizance has cause and has condition  the perversions are the condition and the unprofitable roots are the cause  And these same perversion and root in their opposite neither less nor more can be demonstrated as the two conditions in the case of C Cessation and in the case of D the Path but the conditions are four  as well by assuming perversion in the oppositeHere is a mnemonic verse By ignorance is the world shut in And fetters in the Citta Thread who have reached perfection in the qualities beginning with virtueWhy is thatso too when he gives attention  to this teaching of the undistorted True Idea of Suffering Origin Cessation and Path this is called reasoned attentionNow the first two of the three similes beginning Whoever is not without lust for sensual desires  must be treated as applying to unreasoned attention but in the last  it is well  stated for application to reasoned attentionunderstanding that arises owing to reasoned attention in oneself is called understanding consisting in cogitation these are the two kinds of understanding recognizablethese are the two causes two conditions for the

has arrived at births destruction  A sage who knows by direct knowledgeWho knows his mind is purified Entirely freed from every lustWho has abandoned birth and death Who is complete in the holy lifeWho has transcended everything  One such as this is called a Buddhawhat great power and great might the recluse Gotama has for the wellknown and famous brahmin Brahmayu to make such a display of humilityI go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusand said Venerable sir the brahmin Brahmayu has diedTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Ujunna in the Kannakatthala Deer ParkNow on that occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Ujunna for some business or otherThen he told a man Come good man go to the Blessed One and pay homage in my name with your head at his feet and ask whether he is free from illness and affliction and is healthy strong and abiding in comfort saying Venerable sir King Pasenadi of Kosala pays homage with his head at the Blessed Ones feet and he asks whether the Blessed One is free from illnessand abiding in comfortAnd say this Venerable sir today King Pasenadi of Kosala will come to see the Blessed One after he has had his breakfastYes sire the man replied and he went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one sideThen while the meal was being served the two sisters went to the king and said Sire pay homage in our name with your head at the Blessed Ones feet and ask whether he is free from illnessand abiding in comfort saying Venerable sir the sisters Soma and Sakula pay homage with their heads at the Blessed Ones feet and they ask whether he is free from illnessand abiding in comfortThen when he had finished his breakfast King Pasenadi of Kosala went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one sideand delivered the message of the sisters Soma and SakulaVenerable sir the sisters Soma and Sakula heard Today King Pasenadi of Kosala will go to see the Blessed One after he has had his breakfastThen while the meal was being servedthe sisters Soma and Sakula came to me and said Sire pay homage in our names with your head at the Blessed Ones feet and ask whether he is free from illnessand abiding in comfortMay the sisters Soma and Sakula be happy great kingThen King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One Venerable sir I have heard this The recluse Gotama says There is no recluse or brahmin who is omniscient and allseeing who can claim to have complete knowledge and vision that is not possibleVenerable sir do those who speak thus say what has been said by the Blessed One and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact Do they explain in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that nothing that provides a ground for censure can be legitimately deduced from their assertionsGreat King those who speak thus do not say what has been said by me but misrepresent me with what is untrue and contrary to factThen King Pasenadi of Kosala addressed General Vidudabha General who introduced this story into the palaceIt was Sanjaya sire the brahmin of the Akasa clanThen King Pasenadi of Kosala told a man Come good man in my name tell Sanjaya the brahmin of the Akasa clan Venerable sir King Pasenadi of Kosala calls youYes sire the man replied He went to Sanjaya the brahmin of the Akasa clan and told him Venerable sir King Pasenadi of Kosala calls youMeanwhile King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One Venerable sir could something else have been said by the Blessed One referring to that and the person understood it wronglyIn what way does the Blessed One recall making that utteranceI recall having actually made the utterance in this way great king There is no recluse or brahmin who knows all who sees all simultaneously that is not possibleWhat the Blessed One has said appears reasonable what the Blessed One has said appears to be supported by reason There is no recluse or brahmin who knows all who sees all simultaneously that is not possibleThere are these four castes venerable sir the nobles the brahmins the merchants and the workersIs there any distinction or difference among themThere are these four castes great king the nobles the brahmins the merchants and the workersTwo of them that is the nobles and the brahmins are held to be superior since men pay homage to them rise up for them and accord them reverential salutation and polite servicesVenerable sir I was not asking about this present life I was asking about the life to comeIs there any distinction or difference among themGreat king there are these five factors of strivingHere a bhikkhu has faith he places his faith in the Tathagatas enlightenment thus The Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessed Then he is free from illness and affliction possessing a good digestion that is neither too cool nor too warm but medium and able to bear the strain of striving Then he is honest and sincere and shows himself as he actually is to his teacher and his companions in the holy life Then he is energetic in abandoning unwholesome states and in undertaking wholesome states steadfast launching his effort with firmness and persevering in cultivating wholesome states Then he is wise he possesses wisdom regarding rise and disappearance that is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering These are the five factors of strivingThere are these four castes great king the nobles the brahmins the merchants and the workersNow if they possessed these five factors of striving it would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long timeVenerable sir there are these four castes the nobles the brahmins the merchants and the workersNow if they possessed these five factors of striving would there be any difference among them here in that respectHere great king I say that the difference among them would lie in the diversity of their strivingSuppose there were two tamable elephants or tamable horses or tamable oxen that were well tamed and well disciplined and two tamable elephants or tamable horses or tamable oxen that were untamed and undisciplinedWhat do you think great king Would the two tamable elephants or tamable horses or tamable oxen that were well tamed and well disciplined being tamed acquire the behaviour of the tamed would they arrive at the grade of the tamedYes venerable sirAnd would the two tamable elephants or tamable horses or tamable oxen that were untamed and undisciplined being untamed acquire the behaviour of the tamed would they arrive at the grade of the tamed like the two elephants or horses or oxen that were well tamed and well disciplinedNo venerable sirSo too great king it is not possible that what can be achieved by one who has faith who is free from illness who is honest and sincere who is energetic and who is wise can be achieved by one who has no faith who has much illness who is fraudulent and deceitful who is lazy and who is not wiseWhat the Blessed One has said appears reasonable what the Blessed One has said appears to be supported by reasonThere are these four castes venerable sir the nobles the brahmins the merchants and the workersNow if they possessed these five factors of striving and if their striving was right would there be any difference among them in that respectHere great king in this respect I say that among them there is no difference that is between the deliverance of one and the deliverance of the othersSuppose a man took dry saka wood lit a fire and produced heat and then another man took dry sala wood lit a fire and produced heat and then another man took dry mango wood lit a fire and produced heat and then another man took dry fig wood lit a fire and produced heatWhat do you think great king Would there be any difference among these fires lit with different kinds of wood that is between the flame of one and the flames of the others or between the colour of one and the colours of the others or between the radiance of one and the radiances of the othersNo venerable sirSo too great king when a fire is kindled by energy lit by striving there is I say no difference that is between the deliverance of one and the deliverance of the othersWhat the Blessed One has said appears reasonable what the Blessed One has said appears to be supported by reasonBut venerable sir how is it are there godsWhy do you ask that great kingVenerable sir I was asking whether those gods come back to this human state or whether they do notGreat king those gods who are still subject to affliction come back to this human state those gods who are no longer subject to affliction do not come back to this human stateWhen this was said General Vidudabha asked the Blessed One Venerable sir can those gods who are still subject to affliction and who come back to this human state topple or banish from that place those gods who are no longer subject to affliction and who do not come back to this human stateThen the venerable Ananda thought This General Vidudabha is the son of King Pasenadi of Kosala and I am the son of the Blessed OneThis is the time for one son to talk with the otherHe said to General Vidudabha General I shall ask you a question in return Answer it as you chooseGeneral what do you think There is the whole extent of King Pasenadi of Kosalas realm where he exercises lordship and sovereignty now can King Pasenadi of Kosala topple or banish from that place any recluse or brahmin irrespective of whether that recluse or brahmin has merit or not and whether he leads the holy life or notHe can do so sirWhat do you think general There is the whole extent that is not King Pasenadi of Kosalas realm where he does not exercise lordship and sovereignty now can King Pasenadi of Kosala topple or banish from that place any recluse or brahmin irrespective of whether that recluse or brahmin has merit or not and whether he leads the holy life or notHe cannot do so sirGeneral what do you think Have you heard of the gods of the ThirtythreeYes sirAnd King Pasenadi of Kosala has heard of them tooGeneral what do you think Can King Pasenadi of Kosala topple the gods of the Thirtythree or banish them from that placeSir King Pasenadi of Kosala cannot even see the gods of the Thirtythree so how could he topple them or banish them from that placeSo too general those gods who are still subject to affliction and who come back to this human state cannot even see those gods who are no longer subject to affliction and who do not come back to this human state so how could they topple them or banish them from that placeThen King Pasenadi of Kosala asked the Blessed One Venerable sir what is this bhikkhus nameHis name is Ananda great kingAnanda joy he is indeed venerable sir and Ananda he appearsWhat the venerable Ananda has said appears reasonable what he has said appears to be supported by reasonBut venerable sir how is it are there BrahmasWhy do you ask that great kingVenerable sir I was asking whether those Brahmas come back to this human state or whether they do notGreat king any Brahma who is still subject to affliction comes back to this human state any Brahma who is no longer subject to affliction does not come back to this human stateThen a man announced to King Pasenadi of Kosala Great king Sanjaya the brahmin of the Akasa clan has comeKing Pasenadi of Kosala asked Sanjaya the brahmin of the Akasa clan Brahmin who introduced this story to the palaceSire it was General VidudabhaGeneral Vidudabha said Sire it was Sanjaya the brahmin of the Akasa clanThen a man announced to King Pasenadi of Kosala Sire it is time to departKing Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One Venerable sir we have asked the Blessed One about omniscience and the Blessed One has answered about omniscience we approve of and accept that answer and so we are satisfiedWe have asked the Blessed One about purification in the four castes and the Blessed One has answered about purification in the four castes we approve of and accept that answer and so we are satisfiedWe have asked the Blessed One about the gods and the Blessed One has answered about the gods we approve of and accept that answer and so we are satisfiedWe have asked the Blessed One about the Brahmas and the Blessed One has answered about the Brahmas we approve of and accept that answer and so we are satisfiedWhatever we asked the Blessed One that the Blessed One has answered we approve of and accept those answers and so we are satisfiedAnd now venerable sir we depart We are busy and have much to doNow is the time great king to do as you think fitThen King Pasenadi of Kosala having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones words rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One keeping him on his right he departedand delivered his messageThe sisters Soma and Sakula heard Today King Pasenadi of Kosala will go to see the Blessed One after he has had his breakfastBut great king could the sisters Soma and Sakula find no other messengerOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambi in Ghositas ParkThen the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one sideAnanda women are prone to anger women are envious women are miserly women are unwise This is why women do not sit in council engage in business or go to Kambojaand saidBhante why is it that women do not sit in council or engage in business or go to KambojaThey do not sit in council in the judgment hall for the purpose of passing judgmentThey do not engage in business  in major work such as agriculture trade and so forthThey do not go to Kamboja  they do not go to the Kamboja country for the purpose of carrying goodsThis is the mere heading The sense is that they do not go to any remote countryThere are these four castes venerable sir the nobles the brahmins the merchants and the workersWhat fiveI have heard of themand delivered his messageTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Sakyan country at a town of the Sakyans named MedalumpaNow on that occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Nagaraka for some business or otherThen he addressed Digha Karayana Dear Karayana have the state carriages prepared Let us go to the pleasure garden to see a pleasing spotYes sire Digha Karayana replied When the state carriages were prepared he informed the king Sire the state carriages are ready for youNow is the time to do as you think fitThen King Pasenadi mounted a state carriage and accompanied by the other carriages he drove out from Nagaraka with the full pomp of royaltyHe went thus as far as the road was passable for carriages and then dismounted from his carriage and entered the park on footAs he walked and wandered in the park for exercise King Pasenadi saw roots of trees that were lovely and inspiring quiet and undisturbed by voices with an atmosphere of seclusion remote from people favourable for retreatThe sight of these reminded him of the Blessed One thus These roots of trees are lovely and inspiring quiet and undisturbed by voices with an atmosphere of seclusion remote from people favourable for retreat like the places where we used to pay respect to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedThen he told Digha Karayana what he had thought and askedThere is sire a town of the Sakyans named MedalumpaHow far is it from Nagaraka to MedalumpaIt is not far sire three leagues There is still daylight enough to go thereThen dear Karayana have the state carriages prepared Let us go and see the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedYes sire he replied When the state carriages were prepared he informed the king Sire the state carriages are ready for youNow is the time to do as you think fitThen King Pasenadi mounted a state carriage and accompanied by the other carriages set out from Nagaraka towards the Sakyan town of MedalumpaHe arrived there while it was still daylightHe went thus as far as the road was passable for carriages and then he dismounted from his carriage and entered the park on footNow on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were walking up and down in the openThen King Pasenadi went to them and asked Venerable sirs where is he living now the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedWe want to see the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedThat is his dwelling great king with the closed doorGo up to it quietly without hurrying enter the porch clear your throat and tap on the panelThe Blessed One will open the door for youKing Pasenadi handed over his sword and turban to Digha Karayana then and thereThen Digha Karayana thought So the king is going into secret session now And I have to wait here alone nowWithout hurrying King Pasenadi went quietly up to the dwelling with the closed door entered the porch cleared his throat and tapped on the panelThe Blessed One opened the doorThen King Pasenadi entered the dwelling Prostrating himself with his head at the Blessed Ones feet he covered the Blessed Ones feet with kisses and caressed them with his hands pronouncing his name I am King Pasenadi of Kosala venerable sir I am King Pasenadi of Kosala venerable sirBut great king what reason do you see for doing such supreme honour to this body and for showing such friendshipVenerable sir I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practising the good wayNow venerable sir I see some recluses and brahmins leading a limited holy life for ten years twenty years thirty years or forty yearsBut here I see bhikkhus leading the perfect and pure holy life as long as life and breath lastIndeed I do not see any other holy life elsewhere as perfect and pure as thisThis is why venerable sir I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practising the good wayAgain venerable sir kings quarrel with kings nobles with nobles brahmins with brahmins householders with householders mother quarrels with child child with mother father with child child with father brother quarrels with brother brother with sister sister with brother friend with friendI do not see any other assembly elsewhere with such concordThis too venerable sir is why I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practising the good wayAgain venerable sir I have walked and wandered from park to park and from garden to gardenThere I have seen some recluses and brahmins who are lean wretched unsightly jaundiced with veins standing out on their limbs such that people would not want to look at them againI have thought Surely these venerable ones are leading the holy life in discontent or they have done some evil deed and are concealing it so lean and wretched are theysuch that people would not want to look at them againI went up to them and asked Why are you venerable ones so lean and wretchedsuch that people would not want to look at you againTheir reply was It is our family sickness great kingBut here I see bhikkhus smiling and cheerful sincerely joyful plainly delighting their faculties fresh living at ease unruffled subsisting on what others give abiding with mind as aloof as a wild deersI have thought Surely these venerable ones perceive successive states of lofty distinction in the Blessed Ones Dispensation since they abide thus smiling and cheerfulwith mind as aloof as a wild deersThis too venerable sir is why I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practising the good wayAgain venerable sir being a headanointed noble king I am able to have executed those who should be executed to fine those who should be fined to exile those who should be exiledYet when I am sitting in council they break in and interrupt meThough I say Gentlemen do not break in and interrupt me when I am sitting in council wait till the end of my speechBut here I see bhikkhus while the Blessed One is teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of several hundred followers and then there is not even the sound of a disciple of the Blessed One coughing or clearing his throatOnce the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of several hundred followersThereupon one of his companions in the holy life nudged him with his knee to indicate Be quiet venerable sir make no noise the Blessed One the Teacher is teaching us the DhammaI thought It is wonderful it is marvellousIndeed I do not see any other assembly elsewhere so well disciplinedThis too venerable sir is why I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practising the good wayAgain venerable sir I have seen here certain learned nobles who were clever knowledgeable about the doctrines of others as sharp as hairsplitting marksmenWhen they hear The recluse Gotama will visit such and such a village or townIf he is asked like this he will answer like this and so we will refute his doctrine in this way and if he is asked like that he will answer like that and so we will refute his doctrine in that wayThey hear The recluse Gotama has come to visit such and such a village or townThey go to the Blessed OneAfter they have been instructed urged roused and encouraged by the Blessed One with a talk on the Dhamma they do not so much as ask him the question so how should they refute his doctrineIn actual fact they become his disciplesThis too venerable sir is why I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practising the good wayAgain venerable sir I have seen here certain learned brahmins  Again venerable sir I have seen here certain learned householders  Again venerable sir I have seen here certain learned reclusesIn actual fact they ask the Blessed One to allow them to go forth from the home life into homelessnessNot long after they have thus gone forth dwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and resolute by realising for themselves with direct knowledge they here and now enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessnessThey say thus We were very nearly lost we very nearly perishedBut now we are recluses now we are brahmins now we are arahantsThis too venerable sir is why I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practising the good wayAgain venerable sir Isidatta and Purana my two inspectors eat my food and use my carriages I provide them with a livelihood and bring them fame Yet in spite of this they are less respectful towards me than they are towards the Blessed OneOnce when I had gone out leading an army and was testing these inspectors Isidatta and Purana I happened to put up in very cramped quartersThen these two inspectors Isidatta and Purana after spending much of the night in talk on the Dhamma lay down with their heads in the direction where they had heard that the Blessed One was staying and with their feet towards meI thought It is wonderful it is marvellousThese two inspectors Isidatta and Purana eat my food and use my carriages I provide them with a livelihood and bring them fame Yet in spite of this they are less respectful towards me than they are towards the Blessed OneSurely these good people perceive successive states of lofty distinction in the Blessed Ones DispensationThis too venerable sir is why I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practising the good wayAgain venerable sir the Blessed One is a noble and I am a noble the Blessed One is a Kosalan and I am a Kosalan the Blessed One is eighty years old and I am eighty years oldAnd now venerable sir we depart We are busy and have much to doNow is the time great king to do as you think fitThen King Pasenadi of Kosala rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One keeping him on his right he departedThe monuments to the Dhamma are beneficial bhikkhus and they belong to the fundamentals of the holy lifeThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsand proceeded towards the parkWhere is he living now the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedThe Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened is now living thereand proceeded towards the parkSeven red fish etcThis story was told by the Master while living at Jetavana about a gift of all the Buddhist requisitesA certain landowner at Sāvatthi they say provided all the requisites for the Brotherhood with Buddha at its head and setting up a pavilion at his house door he invited all the company of priests with their chief Buddha seated them on elegant seats prepared for them and offered them a variety of choice and dainty food And saying Come again tomorrow he entertained them for a whole week and on the seventh day he presented Buddha and the five hundred priests under him with all the requisitesAt the end of the feast the Master in returning thanks said Lay Brother you are right in giving pleasure and satisfaction by this charity For this is a tradition of wise men of old who sacrificed their lives for any beggars they met with and gave them even their own flesh to eat And at the request of his host he related this oldworld legendOnce upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares the Bodhisatta came to life as a young hare and lived in a woodOn one side of this wood was the foot of a mountain on another side a river and on the third side a bordervillageThe hare had three friendsa monkey a jackal and an otterThese four wise creatures lived together and each of them got his food on his own huntingground and in the evening they again came togetherThe hare in his wisdom by way of admonition preached the Truth to his three companions teaching that alms are to be given the moral law to be observed and holy days to be keptThey accepted his admonition and went each to his own part of the jungle and dwelt thereAnd so in the course of time the Bodhisatta one day observing the sky and looking at the moon knew that the next day would be a fastday and addressing his three companions he said Tomorrow is a fastday Let all three of you take upon you the moral precepts and observe the holy day To one that stands fast in moral practice almsgiving brings a great reward Therefore feed any beggars that come to you by giving them food from your own tableThey readily assented and abode each in his own place of dwellingOn the morrow quite early in the morning the otter sallied forth to seek his prey and went down to the bank of the GangesNow it came to pass that a fisherman had landed seven red fish and stringing them together on a withe he had taken and buried them in the sand on the rivers bank And then he dropped down the stream catching more fishThe otter scenting the buried fish dug up the sand till he came upon them and pulling them out cried aloud thrice Does any one own these fish  And not seeing any owner he took hold of the withe with his teeth and laid the fish in the jungle where he dwelt intending to eat them at a fitting time And then he lay down thinking how virtuous he wasThe jackal too sallied forth in quest of food and found in the hut of a fieldwatcher two spits a lizard and a pot of milkcurd And after thrice crying aloud To whom do these belong  and not finding an owner he put on his neck the rope for lifting the pot and grasping the spits and the lizard with his teeth he brought and laid them in his own lair thinking In due season I will devour them and so lay down reflecting how virtuous he had beenThe monkey also entered the clump of trees and gathering a bunch of mangoes laid them up in his part of the jungle meaning to eat them in due season and then lay down thinking how virtuous he wasBut the Bodhisatta in due time came out intending to browse on the kua grass and as he lay in the jungle the thought occurred to him It is impossible for me to offer grass to any beggars that may chance to appear and I have no oil or rice and such like If any beggar shall appeal to me I shall have to give him my own flesh to eatAt this splendid display of virtue Sakkas white marble throne manifested signs of heatSakka on reflection discovered the cause and resolved to put this royal hare to the test First of all he went and stood by the otters dwellingplace disguised as a brahminand being asked why he stood there he replied Wise Sir if I could get something to eat after keeping the fast I would perform all my priestly dutiesThe otter replied Very well I will give you some food and as he conversed with him he repeated the first stanzaSeven red fish I safely brought to land from Ganges floodO brahmin eat thy fill I pray and stay within this woodThe brahmin said Let be till tomorrow I will see to it by and bye Next he went to the jackaland when asked by him why he stood there he made the same answerThe jackal too readily promised him some food and in talking with him repeated the second stanzathe keepers evening meal I wrongfully did stealA lizard and a jar of curds Two spits to roast the flesh withalSuch as I have I give to thee O brahmin eat I pray If thou shouldst deign within this wood a while with us to staySaid the brahmin Let be till tomorrow I will see to it by and bye Then he went to the monkeyand when asked what he meant by standing there he answered just as beforeThe monkey readily offered him some food and in conversing with him gave utterance to the third stanzaAn icy stream a mango ripe and pleasant greenwood shadeTis thine to enjoy if thou canst dwell content in forest gladeSaid the brahmin Let be till tomorrow I will see to it by and bye And he went to the wise hareand on being asked by him why he stood there he made the same replyThe Bodhisatta on hearing what he wanted was highly delighted and said Brahmin you have done well in coming to me for food This day will I grant you a boon that I have never granted beforebut you shall not break the moral law by taking animal life Go friend and when you have piled together logs of wood and kindled a fire come and let me know and I will sacrifice myself by falling into the midst of the flamesand when my body is roasted you shall eat my flesh and fulfil all your priestly duties And in thus addressing him the hare uttered the fourth stanzaNor sesame nor beans nor rice have I as food to giveBut roast with fire my flesh I yield if thou with us wouldst liveSakka on hearing what he said by his miraculous power caused a heap of burning coals to appear and came and told the BodhisattaRising from his bed of kua grass and coming to the place he thrice shook himself that if there were any insects within his coat they might escape death Then offering his whole body as a free gift he sprang up and like a royal swan alighting on a cluster of lotuses in an ecstasy of joy he fell on the heap of live coalsBut the flame failed even to heat the pores of the hair on the body of the Bodhisatta and it was as if he had entered a region of frostThen he addressed Sakka in these words Brahmin the fire you have kindled is icycold it fails to beat even the pores of the hair on my body What is the meaning of thisWise sir he replied I am no brahmin I am Sakka and I have come to put your virtue to the testThe Bodhisatta said If not only thou Sakka but all the inhabitants of the world were to try me in this matter of almsgiving they would not find in me any unwillingness to give and with this the Bodhisatta uttered a cry of exultation like a lion roaringThen said Sakka to the Bodhisatta O wise hare he thy virtue known throughout a whole won And squeezing the mountain with the essence thus extracted he daubed the sign of a hare on the orb of the moon And after depositing the hare on a bed of young kua grass in the same wooded part of the jungle Sakka returned to his own place in heavenAnd these four wise creatures dwelt happily and harmoniously together fulfilling the moral law and observing holy days till they departed to fare according to their deedsThe Master when he had ended his lesson revealed the Truths and identified the BirthAt the conclusion of the Truths the householder who gave as a freegift all the Buddhist requisites attained fruition of the First PathAt that time nanda was the otter Moggallāna was the jackal Sāriputta the monkey and I myself was the wise hareand then on a later occasion I see them well groomed and well anointed with trimmed hair and beards enjoying themselves provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasureBut here I see bhikkhus living in concord with mutual appreciation without disputing blending like milk and water viewing each other with kindly eyesstill they break in and interrupt meand there a disciple of his cleared his throathow an assembly can be so well disciplined without force or weaponThen the wanderer Vacchagotta approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himWhen they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk he sat down to one sideAnd in the case of a disciple who was a person of the highest kind a supreme person one who had attained the supreme attainment when that disciple has passed away and died he also declares his rebirth thus That one was reborn there that one was reborn thereThis Makkhali Gosala This Nigantha Nataputta  This Sanjaya Belathiputta  This Pakudha Kaccayana This Ajita Kesakambali And in the case of a disciple who was a person of the highest kind a supreme person one who had attained the supreme attainment when that disciple has passed away and died he also declares his rebirth thus That one was reborn there that one was reborn thereBut in the case of a disciple who was a person of the highest kind a supreme person one who had attained the supreme attainment when that disciple has passed away and died he does not declare his rebirth thus That one was reborn there that one was reborn thereRather he declares of him He cut off craving severed the fetter and by completely breaking through conceit he has made an end to suffering There was perplexity in me Master Gotama there was doubt How is the Dhamma of the ascetic Gotama to be understoodIt is fitting for you to be perplexed Vaccha it is fitting for you to doubtDoubt has arisen in you about a perplexing matterI declare Vaccha rebirth for one with fuel not for one without fuelJust as a fire burns with fuel but not without fuel so Vaccha I declare rebirth for one with fuel not for one without fuelMaster Gotama when a flame is flung by the wind and goes some distance what does Master Gotama declare to be its fuel on that occasionWhen Vaccha a flame is flung by the wind and goes some distance I declare that it is fuelled by the windFor on that occasion the wind is its fuelAnd Master Gotama when a being has laid down this body but has not yet been reborn in another body what does Master Gotama declare to be its fuel on that occasionWhen Vaccha a being has laid down this body but has not yet been reborn in another body I declare that it is fuelled by cravingand said to the Blessed OneIn recent days Master Gotama a number of ascetics brahmins and wanderers of various sects had assembled in the debating hall and were sitting together when this conversation arose among them This Purana Kassapathe leader of an order the leader of a group the teacher of a group the well known and famous spiritual guide considered holy by many peopledeclares the rebirth of a disciple who has passed away and died thus That one was reborn there that one was reborn therewhen that disciple has passed away and died he also declares his rebirth thus That one was reborn there that one was reborn theredeclares the rebirth of a disciple who has passed away and died thus That one was reborn there that one was reborn thereThis ascetic Gotamathe leader of an order the leader of a group the teacher of a group the well known and famous spiritual guide considered holy by many peopleFor on that occasion craving is its fuelthey wander about as it were demolishing the views of others with their sharp witsthey formulate a question thus We will go to the recluse Gotama and ask him this questionand the Blessed One instructs urges rouses and encourages them with a talk on the DhammaThey do not so much as ask him the question so how should they refute his doctrineand he gives them the going forthfor formerly we claimed that we were recluses though we were not really recluses we claimed that we were brahmins though we were not really brahmins we claimed that we were arahants though we were not really arahantsOn one occasion the Venerable Sariputta and the Venerable Mahakofthita were dwelling at Baranasi in the Deer Park at IsipatanaThen in the evening the Venerable Mahakotthita emerged from seclusion and approached the Venerable Sariputta He exchanged greetings with the Venerable Sariputta andand said to him How is it friend Sariputta is the eye the fetter of forms or are forms the fetter of the eyeIs the ear the fetter of sounds or are sounds the fetter of the ear  Is the mind the fetter of mental phenomena or are mental phenomena the fetter of the mindFriend Kotthita the eye is not the fetter of forms nor are forms the fetter of the eyebut rather the desire and lust that arise there in dependence on both that is the fetter there The ear is not the fetter of sounds nor are sounds the fetter of the earbut rather the desire and lust that arise there in dependence on both that is the fetter there  The mind is not the fetter of mental phenomena nor are mental phenomena the fetter of the mindSuppose friend a black ox and a white ox were yoked together by a single harness or yokeWould one be speaking rightly if one were to say The black ox is the fetter of the white ox the white ox is the fetter of the black oxNo friendThe black ox is not the fetter of the white ox nor is the white ox the fetter of the black oxSo too friend the eye is not the fetter of formsnor are mental phenomena the fetter of the mindIf friend the eye were the fetter of forms or if forms were the fetter of the eye this living of the holy life could not be discerned for the complete destruction of sufferingfriend the ear were the fetter of sounds or if sounds were the fetter of the ear There exists in the Blessed One the eyeThere exists in the Blessed One the earthe Blessed One smells an odour with the noseThere exists in the Blessed One the bodyThere exists in the Blessed One the mindIn this way friend it can be understood how the eye is not the fetter of forms nor forms the fetter of the eye but rather the desire and lust that arise there in dependence on both is the fetter therewhen they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk he sat down to one sidebut rather the desire and lust that arise there in dependence on both that is the fetter therebut rather the single harness or yoke by which the two are yoked together that is the fetter therebut rather the desire and lust that arise there in dependence on both that is the fetter thereBut since the eye is not the fetter of forms nor are forms the fetter of the eye but rather the desire and lust that arise there in dependence on both is the fetter therethe living of the holy life is discerned for the complete destruction of sufferingIf the mind were the fetter of mental phenomena or if mental phenomena were the fetter of the mind this living of the holy life could not be discerned for the complete destruction of sufferingBut since the mind is not the fetter of mental phenomena nor are mental phenomena the fetter of the mindbut rather the desire and lust that arise there in dependence on both is the fetter therethe living of the holy life is discerned for the complete destruction of sufferingthe Blessed One sees a form with the eyeyet there is no desire and lust in the Blessed Onethe Blessed One is well liberated in mindThere exists in the Blessed One the noseThere exists in the Blessed One the tonguethe Blessed One savours a taste with the tonguethe Blessed One feels a tactile object with the bodythe Blessed One cognizes a mental phenomenon with the mindyet there is no desire and lust in the Blessed Onethe Blessed One is well liberated in mindhow the ear is not the fetter of sounds nor sounds the fetter of the earhow the mind is not the fetter of mental phenomena nor mental phenomena the fetter of the mind but rather the desire and lust that arise there in dependence on both is the fetter thereIn this way too friend it may be understood how that is sothe Blessed One hears a sound with the ear Since that is so I think it proper to do such supreme honour to the Blessed One and to show such friendshipThen soon after he had left the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus before rising from his seat and departing this King Pasenadi uttered monuments to the DhammaLearn the monuments to the Dhamma bhikkhus master the monuments to the Dhamma remember the monuments to the DhammaTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThen when it was morning the venerable Ananda dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Savatthi for almsNow on that occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala had mounted the elephant Ekapundarika and was riding out from Savatthi at middayHe saw the venerable Ananda coming in the distance Yes sire that is the venerable AnandaThen King Pasenadi of Kosala told a man Come good man go to the venerable Ananda and pay homage in my name with your head at his feet saying Venerable sir King Pasenadi of Kosala pays homage with his head at the venerable Anandas feetThen say this Venerable sir if the venerable Ananda has no urgent business perhaps the venerable Ananda would wait a moment out of compassionYes sire the man replied and he went to the venerable Ananda and after paying homage to him he stood at one sideThe venerable Ananda consented in silenceThen King Pasenadi went by elephant as far as the elephant could go and then he dismounted and went to the venerable Ananda on footAfter paying homage to him he stood at one side and said to the venerable Ananda If venerable sir the venerable Ananda has no urgent business it would be good if he would go to the bank of the river Aciravati out of compassionThe venerable Ananda consented in silenceHe went to the bank of the river Aciravati and sat down at the root of a tree on a seat made readyThen King Pasenadi went by elephant as far as the elephant could go and then he dismounted and went to the venerable Ananda on foot After paying homage to him he stood at one sideand said to the venerable Ananda Here venerable sir is an elephant rug Let the venerable Ananda be seated on itThere is no need great kingSit down I am sitting on my own matKing Pasenadi of Kosala sat down on a seat made readyNo great king the Blessed One would not behave with

sir it is marvellousFor what we were unable to accomplish with a question has been accomplished by the venerable Ananda with the answer to the questionWe do not recognise anything of value in the praise and blame of others spoken by foolish ignorant persons who speak without having investigated and evaluated but we recognise as valuable the praise and blame of others spoken by wise intelligent and sagacious persons who speak after having investigated and evaluatedNow venerable Ananda what kind of bodily behaviour is censured by wise recluses and brahminsAny bodily behaviour that is

marvellousAnd we are satisfied and pleased by what has been so well expressed by himVenerable sir we are so satisfied and pleased with what has been so well expressed by the venerable AnandaBut we know venerable sir that these are not allowable for the venerable AnandaBut there is this cloak of mine venerable sir which was sent to me packed in a royal umbrella case by King Ajatasattu of Magadha sixteen hands long and eight hands wideLet the venerable Ananda accept it out of compassionIt is not necessary great king My triple robe is completeVenerable sir this river Aciravati has been seen both by the venerable Ananda and by ourselvesIn this way our offering will overflowVenerable sir let the venerable Ananda accept the cloakThe venerable Ananda accepted the cloakThen King Pasenadi of Kosala said And now venerable sir we depart We are busy and have much to doNow is the time great king to do as you think fitThen King Pasenadi of Kosala having delighted and rejoiced in the venerable Anandas words rose from his seat and after paying homage to the venerable Ananda keeping him on his right he departedThen soon after he had left the venerable Ananda went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one sideThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus It is a gain bhikkhus for King Pasenadi of Kosala it is a great gain for King Pasenadi of Kosala that he has had the opportunity of seeing and paying respect to AnandaThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsWhen he had wandered for alms in Savatthi and had returned from his almsround after his meal he went to the Eastern Park to the Palace of Migaras Mother for the days abidingand asked the minister Sirivaddha That is the venerable Ananda is it notand said to the venerable Ananda Venerable sir King Pasenadi of Kosala pays homage with his head at the venerable Anandas feet and he says this Venerable sir if the venerable Ananda has no urgent business perhaps the venerable Ananda would wait a moment out of compassionand said Venerable Ananda would the Blessed One behave with the body in such a way that he could be censured by wise recluses and brahminsNow venerable Ananda does the Blessed One praise only the abandoning of all unwholesome statesHerein what is the Pattern of the Dispensationst Grouping  Type of Thread dealing with

Penetration The steadfast will never call that a strong bond  down to   And concern for a wife and for children as well  is corruption  is penetrationAnd and  and With these four  terms corruptionwith the four  in the negative paragraph penetrationHerein what is the type of Thread Dealing with Corruption Dealing with Penetration and Dealing with the AdeptVerse example This world is born to anguish and subject to painful contact It is sickness that it calls self For however it conceives it Tis ever otherwise than thatMaintaining its being other than that The world clings to being expectantly relishing only beingNow this divine life under the Blessed One  is lived in order to abandon beingWhoever  have declared escape from being to come about through love of nonbeing none of them I say escape from beingWhoever  have declared liberation from being to come about through love of some kind of being  none of them I say are liberated from beingIt is by depending on the essentials of existence  that this suffering has actual being  with exhaustion of assuming in all ways suffering has no actual being See this wide world subjected to ignorance Which is which delights to be never freed from being Yet whatever the kinds of being that occur in any way anywhere All these are determinations impermanent painhaunted inseparable from the idea of changeSo when a man thus sees With right understanding how it isCraving for being is abandoned He no more expectantly relishes nonbeingThat is the utter exhaustion of all craving That is the remainderless fading cessation that is extinctionThat bhikkhu being quenched through not assuming His being comes no more to a renewalNow as to the words  This world is born to anguish  down to  And what it fears is pain is corruption by craving  The passage Whoever have declared escape from being to come about through love of nonbeing none of them I say escapes from beingWhoever have declared liberation from being to come about through love of some kind of being none of them I say is liberated from being  is corruption by view That corruption by view and corruption by craving are both corruptionThen to go back again the words Now this divine life under the Blessed One is lived in order to abandon  being  down to  With exhaustion of assuming in all ways suffering has no actual being  are penetrationThe words That bhikkhu being quenched  down to  One such as this outstrips  all modes of being  deal with the AdeptProse example    One who goes with the stream  is corruption  One who goes against the stream are penetrationand  One who  stands of firm ground  is the Adept a planeHerein what is the type of Thread Dealing with Morality and Dealing with PenetrationMerit will grow for one who gives No risk is stored for one restrainedHere Merit will grow for one who gives No risk is stored for one restrained is moralityOne who is skilled abandons evil With exhaustion of lust hate delusion He attains complete extinction  is penetrationAnd Five rewards can be expected when ideas that have entered the ear are consolidated by word of mouth looked over by the mind and well penetrated by right view  Here someone has heard many ideas remembered and not forgotten them consolidated them by word of mouth looked over them with the mind penetrated them well by right view then when he devotes himself strives and makes efforts he reaches distinction here and now and if he reaches no distinction here and now he reaches it when illHerein he reaches  here and now is penetrationThat he reaches Hermit Enlightenment in a future existence is moralityThese are eight of the sixteen types of Thread  completely encompassing  all the DispensationAnd this ninefold Thread is for one with understanding not for one without understanding for one devoted not for one undevoted Discussion  Corruption kinds  Normally in the world corruption haunts even one who abides without actionThat corruption is threefold as corruption by craving corruption by view and corruption by misconductNow when he comes to stand out above that lastnamed type of corruption then corruption establishes itself in the ideas that he heard and it establishes itself in ideas belonging to the worldssince he is unskilled  as to what is seen there If he misapprehends that virtue owed to his climbing out of corruption by misconduct and that view then he has corruption by cravingBut if it occurs to him thus  then he has wrong view and that is his corruption by wrong view Morality  But if he is established in virtue and his  virtueandduty  is not misapprehended then he being virtuous that virtueand duty of his being taken in a reasoned manner  generates  And that good conduct thus  conduces to his morality that is to his moral progress either here and now or on the occasion of his completing his time  or in other categories  in some future existence That is why this is called the type of Thread Dealing with Morality Penetration  Herein when being steadied in the virtues his cognizance is without hindrances then the Blessed One teaches him that True Idea for the abandoning of the embodimentviewfinally he reaches the supreme goal  extinction he reaches the supreme extinction either with intervals between sessions or else in a single session he reaches all the six AcquaintanceshipsHerein those persons who first reach extinction in the Noble Ones True Idea are of two kinds  the Follower by Faith and the Follower by Ideas Herein the Follower by Ideas is while the Follower by Faith is Herein one who gains knowledge from a condensed statement is of two kinds one may have keen faculties and another blunt faculties And herein one who is guidable is of two kinds one may have keen faculties and another blunt facultiesHerein the typegainingknowledgefromacondensedstate ment with blunt faculties and the guidabletype with keen faculties when classed as above under the two types are unequal  in their facultiesbut when they are subtracted respectively from the typegainingknowledgefromacondensedstatement and from the guidabletype they being then regardable as equal in their faculties constitute a third type namely the These are thus the three persontypeswithout fourth and without fifth   the typegainingknowledgefromacondensedstatement the typegainingknowledgefromanexpandedstatement and the guidabletype   Herein the person of the typegainingknowledgefroma condensedstatement whether the faculties he obtains are blunt or keen when being teadiedon the plane of seeing he reaches the fruit of StreamEntry he is a SingleSeed the first type of StreamEnterer Herein the person of the typegainingknowledgefroman expandedstatement whether the faculties he obtains are blunt or keen when being steadied on the plane of seeing he reaches the fruit of StreamEntry he is a ClantoClan the second type of StreamEnterer Herein the person of the guidabletype whether the faculties he obtains are blunt or keen when being steadied on the plane of seeing he reaches the fruit of StreamEntry he is a Seventimesat Most the third type of StreamEnterer Now these three types of persons are steadied in the fruit of StreamEntry with diversity in their facultiesThis is the type of Thread Dealing with Penetration  The Adept  Now it is if someone makes efforts additional to that that he reaches the supreme goal  extinctionHerein the keenfacultied person of the typegainigknowledge fromacondensedstatement becomes two persontypes on reaching the NonReturn Fruit there is hewhoattainsextinctionearly in hia

UpStreamerBoundForTheNotJuniorGods   But by taking account of difference in their faculties in the cases of the typegainingknowledgefromacondensedstatement and the typegainingknowledgefromanexpandedstatementSo the five kinds of NonReturner the OnceReturner as sixth and the three kinds of StreamEnterer  make up nine kinds of InitiateHerein the keenfacultied

is OneLiableToFallAway  or else owing to his being OneCertainInAction  he becomes a LevelHead   These are nine types of Arahants  This is the fourfold Thread namely that Dealing with Corruption   that Dealing with the AdeptThe  Powers of a Perfect One  Now a Perfect One has a tenfold Power  that occurs with regard to these persontypesHow tenfoldHere when the Enlightened Ones the Blessed Ones have not yet set rolling the Wheel of the True Idea  gods sons of great influence issue forth  to implore them thus And he  the newly Enlightened One on surveying the world with the unsurpassed Enlightened Ones eye sees three classes of creatures  the certainofrightness the certainofwrongness and the notcertain  Knowledge of Instance and NonInstance  Herein that the certainofrightness class might enter into wrong mindfulness   no such instance is found That it might attain extinction  without a teacher  no such instance is found That it might enter upon an attainment of concentration  such an instance is foundHerein that the certainofwrongness class will practise noble right practice   no such instance is found That it will practise ignoble wrong practice  such an instance is foundHerein that the notcertain class when rightly practising will go to the certainofrightness class   such an instance is found That when wrongly practising it will go to the certainof rightness class   no such instance is foundThat when rightly practising it will go to the certainofwrongness class  no such instance is found  That when wrongly practising it will go to the certainofwrongness class   such an instance is found That anyone will in accordance with a True Idea accuse me thus  You  a Fully Enlightened One who are surveying these three classes with the unsurpassed Enlightened Ones eye have not discovered these ideas   no such instance is found   That anyone will in accordance with a True Idea accuse me claiming as I do to be without lust of having taints still unexhausted  no such instance is found  That after the teaching of the True Idea to this notcertain class it will not be seen to conduce to the complete exhaustion of suffering in him who gives it effect   no such instance is found   That a hearer of mine belonging to the notcertain class being thus  advised will not verify any progressive distinction  no such instance is found That whoever of the many kinds of gods nagaserpents or spirits with their many languages  a Stilled One tames  in those languages will go to a further shore other than the further shore  stated  by the definition of ideas in the language of the texts  no such instance is foundThe Discrimination of Ideas That a Stilled One should not master those languages uttered by creatures as their language  no such instance is foundThe Discrimination of MeaningsThat wherein  quieting  of these is therein  non quieting of these is no such instance is foundThat wherein  destruction of these is not therein  destruction of these will be  no such instance is foundAnd as for Origin so for Cessation  The ten unprofitable and profitable courses of actionThat womankind will be Mara or Sakka Ruler of Gods or a High Divinity or a Perfect One or a WheelTurner Monarch no such instance is found That a male may be a WheelTurner or Sakka Ruler of Gods  such an instance is foundSo such power such knowledge as this is called the Knowledge of Instance and NoInstance the first Power of a Perfect OneThat can be demonstrated by the three classes  the four Intrepidities  the four Discriminations  Dependent Arising in its occurrence and standstill and what happens in unprofitable and profitable ripening  and for the female and the male on reappearance   Knowleilge of the Way that Leads Anywhere  Now as to the certainofrightness class out of those three classes which were mentioned above  this is not  the Way that Leads Anywhere this is the way that leads only to extinctionLikewise also  the certainofwrongness class which is not the Way that Leads Anywhere this is only the way leading to origin of embodimentIt is this notcertain class which when steadied in a way going here or there goes  to extinction goes  to the state of unease and goes  to the divine and human statesor may go anywhere according to whatever way it may practise this is the Way that Leads AnywhereKnowledge of how it is herein is called Knowledge of the Way that Leads Anywhere the second Power of a Perfect One  Knowledge of Difference of Belief  Now this Way that Leads Anywhere is followed by those of differing beliefs some believe in sensual desires  and some in performance of difficult feats some are devoted to self torment  some rely on belief in purity through the roundabout of rebirths  some believe in ineffectuality  of action Knowledge of how creatures come to be bound down  by the habit of this or that kind of temperament understands how the worlds varied field of beliefs  comes to beThis is the third Power of a Perfect One Knowledge of the Different Elements  Herein when creatures are of such a belief  that belief of theirs they repeat keep in being and make much ofwhen they repeat it  thus believing in itWhat is that  It is the sensualdesire element the renunciation element the illwill element the nonillwill element the cruelty element  and the noncruelty element that are believed inAny other element beyond namely the undetermined element beyond the determined element  they do not see  obstinately misapprehending  and insisting upon that alone they assert Only this is the true the other is wrong  as was said by the Blessed One to Sakka Ruler of GodsKnowledge of how it is hereinis called the fourth Power of a Perfect One Knowledge of Ripening of Action  Herein whatever element  they believe best that they instigate through the body and through speechThe instigation is mental choice while the choiceasaction is is bodily and verbal  Because of the mentalness of the instigation  a Perfect One understands the actionsequence thus  By this creature who has such elements such action was done that being in the past period  with this as cause such ripening of it is ripening now or will ripen in the future period He understands the presently arisen period thus  This person who has such elements is doing this actionthrough craving and view with this as cause its ripening will be generated not only here and now but also either on the next reappearance or in some future state He understands the future period thus  This person will do such action  with this as cause such ripening of it will be generated There are  this kind of undertaking  of action has presently arisen pleasure and ripens as pleasure in the future   etc     So he understands this past future and presently arisen undertaking of action as to cause and as to instance and the variety in its ripening and the highness and lowness the inferiority and superiority of creatures This is called the Knowledge of Ripening of Action the fifth Power of a Perfect One Knowledge of Corruption etc in the cases of the Meditations etc  Herein whatever undertaking of action creatures are undertaking therein he understands thus When a person is a believer in efficacy of action and of lusting temperament his cognizance  comes to fulfilment by means of the renunciation element When he is occupied  with the field of lust his first meditation  is corrupted  but if he again makes further efforts then he is pursing the way dealing with distinction but doing so on the mental level whose field of cleansing is the first meditation for his meditation  is then still only of the kind dealing with lossOnce steadied in the first meditation then the second meditation comes to be his cleansing And then when he desires to enter upon the third meditation the joy faculty invades his cognizance and remains steady That happiness  of his remains steady indicating the third meditation but not as dealing with distinctionIf he understands how the escape is in its casethen in the same way the fourth  meditation comes to be the cleansing too Now there are the ideas namely the factors of the third meditation that deal with the loss of the fourth meditation  and where these ideas are produced it is by the surmounting of them that the fourth meditation is indicated  as the cleansingSimilarly the Formless Attainments the four Concentrations   the three Gateways to Liberation and the eight Liberations Meditations  the four Meditations Liberations the eight liberations and the three Gateways to Liberation  Concentration the four kinds of concentration  namely concentration through will concentration through energy concentration through cognizance and concentration through inquiry  Attainments the four Formless Attainments So when a person is of lusting temperament such is the corruption of his meditations liberations concentrations and attainmentsLikewise for one of hating temperament and for one of deluded temperamentAnd when a person is of lusting temperament such is his cleansing  So knowledge of how it is herein which is not shared by disciples Knowledge of the Disposition of Creatures Faculties  Herein a Perfect One understands thus  Ideas belonging to worlds and ideas dissociated from worlds acquire the name  faculty  when dealing with keepinginbeing in dependence upon the plane of respective predominanceThey acquire the name power in dependence upon the mindfaculty as confirmed mindfaculty they acquire the name  energy in dependence upon the element of instigation so such being his  knowledge he also made the teaching of the True Idea thus  These persons are possessed of these ideasThis is called Knowledge of Variety in the Faculties Powers and Energy of other creatures other persons the seventh Power of a Perfect One The Recollection of Past Life  The Heavenly Eye  Herein by means of two powers a Perfect One understands the destination in the planes and the worlds etc of those who have fetters and of those who are Initiates understanding it in the past roundabout by means of the Recollection of Past Life and understanding their decease and reappearance now in this presently arisen rondabout by means of the Heavenly Eye Thus these two powers are directed  to the Heavenly Eyethat which  was the Heavenly Eyes province in the past period becomes Mindfulnesss province now  So there is knowledge of his own past life in various ways and different aspects and of others in the present period by means of the Heavenly Eye These are two Powers of a Perfect One  Past Life the eighth and the Heavenly Eye the ninth Knowledge of Exhaustion of Taints  Again a Perfect One understands the meditation of noble persons to be a cleansing and dealing with penetration thus  This person having by means of this Path by means of this Way here and now verified and entered upon the heartdeliverance and understandingdeliverance that are taintless through exhaustion of taints abides therein Such is the knowledge about the exhaustion of his own taints and the appropriate fourplane knowledge of those coefficient with view  exhausted by the StreamEnterer down to that of those exhausted on the plane of the nine kinds of Arahants  the exhaustion of taints occurring limitedly  for Initiates and unlimitedly for ArahantsHerein heartdeliverance is taintless with respect to two taints namely the taint of sensual desire and the taint of being while understanding deliverance is taintless with respect to two taints namely the taint of views and the taint of ignorance  The knowledge of these two deliverances  how they come to be is called Knowledge of Exhaustion of Taintsthe tenth Power of a Perfect OneThe  Types of Thread as  Types  Steadied in these ten Powers a Perfect One teaches the Dispensation in five types of teaching thus that dealing with corruption that dealing with morality that dealing with seeing that dealing with keeping in being and that dealing with the Adept  Corruption  Herein nongreed is the escape from corruption by craving WhyBecause there are these three kinds of mental misconduct namely covetousness ill will and wrong viewHerein covetousness as mental misconduct assists the bodily action consisting in takingwhatisnotgiven and it aids all the speechaction anchored thereto namely false speechall speech that denies reality and what is all contempt and domineeringand it aids covetousness as a root of unprofit In the case of the corresponding good conduct the good conduct is the choice of abstention  from the false speech from the takingwhatisnotgiven and from the covetousness  Herein ill will as mental misconduct aids the bodily action consisting in killingbreathingthings and it aids all that verbal action consisting in refuting by dragging to and dragging fro and jolting up  and malicious speech and harsh speech  Wrong view as mental misconduct gives purpose to wrong view covetolsness and ill will and in one who has any wrong view at all his misconduct  whether born of lust or born of hate is all given being by wrong view It is for this reason that wrong view  aids misconduct in sensual desires The speechaction it aids is gossipThese are the three kinds of misconduct As to the unprofitable roots the covetousness is greedthe ill will is hateThese aid the eight WrongnessesIt is when these three unprofitable roots are curbed that the tenfold profitable  comes to fulfilment From that threefold corruption by misconduct the type of Thread Dealing with Morality is the escapeHerein  this demonstration is based on the plurality  of covetousness ill will and wrong view  and it is in order for the greed hate and delusion also to correspond that greed has prominence here for that reason or else greed has it because it is normally so described among those three ideas considered as roots Morality  Herein the unprofitable root delusion is ignorance That has insisted on form in four ways  one who goes by ignorance Herein the first  term in each of the four conjectures in the embodimentview belongs  with annihilationism in the following ways  the noexistence of giving etc view  the fortuitous arising view  and the view that The last three terms of the selfconjectures  in the EmbodimentView belong with eternalism in the following way  and the nocausists fall under this head because of the likelihood that the doctrine of nooughttobedone will being suffering  and also the ineffectuality of actions  so  is included Herein the liveoutthesoulists  describe eightysix kinds of purification  through the roundabout misapprehending it thus Herein just as the embodimentview has four grounds in form  so it has twenty grounds in all the five categoriesThe soulisanotherists belong  with the eternalness of the embodiment view and belong with the holders of the eternalist doctrine They misapprehend virtue and duty thus  This is misapprehension of virtue and dutyHerein in the embodimentview  and he doubts is uncertain disbelieves is not confident about whether  in the future period and in the past period  this is imperfection in one steadied in matters only dealing with moralitya Seeing  Herein he abandons all uncertainty by means of the faith faculty He sees rise and subsidence by means of the understanding faculty He gives cognizance singleness by means of the concentration faculty He instigates by means of the energy facultyBy means of these five  faculties as a follower by Faith he arouses the straightresulting concentration  since he is certain  in the confidence that is due to undergoing and by means of these faculties when purified as a Follower by Ideas  he arouses the straightresulting concentration owed to independence of others   and so with the other three Truths  This is the type of Thread Dealing with Seeingb KeepinginBeing  Herein of the five hitherside fetters  three fetters are abandonable by Seeing  while the other two are altogether abandoned  when done by two persontypesHerein the three roots of unprofit abandonable by Keeping inBeing discarded in the progressively higher stages still generate six kinds of beingHerein when among these three roots covetousness and ill will have been attenuated and six kinds of being have come to grips  with exhaustion while two kinds of being  still remainWhen this covetousness and ill will are altogether exhaustedNow although here in the Arahant Path which is the last stage of the Initiate there are also the other four furtherside fetters besides conceit namely the defilements of lustforform lustforbeing ignorance and agitation since these are given their being by conceit as positionality all these seven kinds of Initiate have no power to stop the conceit I am and so one should instigate the abandoning of the conceit  I am But he whose taints are exhausted  by his reaching the Arahants Fruit is beyond this   The Adept  While the type of Thread Dealing with Seeing  has regard to five kinds of Initiate persons  and the type of Thread Dealing with KeepinginBeing has regard to three who are practising the way and two who stand in the fruit beyond these there is the type of Thread Dealing with the Adept which has regard to the plane of Him Who Has Done and this is the fifth type of ThreadThe Ninefold Thread  General  This Thread  in general is taught of three types of persons of the ordinary man of the Initiate and of the Adept That Dealing with Corruption and that Dealing with Moralityare taught of the ordinary man that Dealing with Seeingand that Dealing with KeepinginBeing of the five kinds of InitiatesNow  this Thread shown above as fivefold can be sought in the twentyseven moods Again with abbreviation  that Thread falls into fifty  moods which fifty moods demonstrated in the Dispensation when abbreviated fall into ten  moods whichinto the four unshared and four shared which are the plane of the Modes of Conveying in Combined Treatment  These when abbreviated fall into the five types of Threadsinto that Dealing with Corruption that Dealing with Morality that Dealing with Seeing  that Dealing with KeepinginBeing  and that Dealing with the AdeptThese when abbreviated fall into the four types of Threadsinto that Dealing with Corruption that Dealing with Morality that Dealing with Penetration and that Dealing with the Adept These when abbreviated fall into three types of Threads into that Dealing with the Ordinary Man that Dealing with the Initiate and that Dealing with the Adept These when abbreviated fall into two types of Threads into that Dealing with Penetration and that Dealing with Previous Devotion according as it was said by the Blessed One  Herein bearing in mind the idiosyncrasies of ones own understanding  in regard to the eightfold Threadabbreviation the construing can be done here and there wherever one is ableNo one can demonstrate how the Threads meaning is without having lent an ear  Now if thou art afraid  of pain And pain thou findest disagreeableThen do no sort of evil act In public or in secrecy    Herein what is Fruit The True Ideal guards him that walks therein As does a big umbrella in

a noble hearer is liberated from birth  etc  and despair   Here also the threeHerein what is Gratification and This is GratificationHerein what is Disappointment  If his desires elude him He becomes as deformed as if pierced by a barb and the Simile of the Mountain in the Pasenadi Samyutta  This is DisappointmentHerein what is EscapeHe that shuns desires as a snakes head with his footAnd is mindful evades this attachment to the world  and the Thread in the Samyutta the Paricckattaka tree  with the bleached foliage with the spear  foliage  This is EscapeHerein what is Gratification and Disappointment Herein what the evildoer experiences is Disappointment while what the doer of good experiences is  Gratificationwhile the gain fame praise and pleasure these are the GratificationHerein what is Gratification and Escape Merits ripening is pleasant And brings success to ones intentThe  merits ripening  and the  success to ones intent  are the Gratificationwhile that one can  soon reach the peace supreme that is extinction  is the EscapeAnd  From If he lives on in the household life he becomes a Wheel Turning Monarch   down to   he lives on after con quering   is GratificationIf he goes forth from the household life into homelessness is the Escape from all gratification   This is Gratification and EscapeHerein what is Disappointment and Escape Knowing fear of that assuming

One while at Jetavana about a wealthy BrotherTradition tells us that on the death of his wife a squire of Sāvatthi joined the BrotherhoodWhen he was joining he caused to be built for himself a chamber to live in a room for the fire and a storeroom and not till he had stocked his storeroom with ghee rice and the like did he finally joinEven after he had become a brother he used to send for his servants and make them cook him what he liked to eat He was richly provided with the requisites having an entire change of clothing for night and another for dayand he dwelt aloof on the outskirts of the monasteryOne day when he had taken out his cloths and bedding and had spread them out to dry in his chamber a number of Brethren from the country who were on a pilgrimage from monastery to monastery  came in their journeying to his cell and found all these belongings Whose are these  they askedMine sirs he repliedWhat sir  they cried this uppercloth and that as well this undercloth as well as that and that bedding too is it all yoursYes nobodys but mineSir said they the Blessed One has only sanctioned three cloths and yet though the Buddha to whose doctrine you have devoted yourself is so simple in his wants you forsooth have amassed all this stock of requisites Come we must take you before the Lord of Wisdom And so saying they went off with him to the MasterBecoming aware of their presence the Master said Wherefore is it Brethren that you have brought the Brother against his willSir this Brother is welloff and has quite a stock of requisitesIs it true Brother as they say that you are so welloffYes Blessed OneBut why Brother have you amassed these belongingsDo not I extol the virtues of wanting little contentment and so forth solitude and determined resolve Angered by the Masters words he criedThen Ill go about like this  And flinging off his outer clothing he stood in their midst clad only in his waistclothThen as a moral support to him the Master said Was it not you Brother who in bygone days were a seeker after the shamefacedness that fears to sin and even when you were a waterdemon lived for twelve years seeking after that shamefacedness How then comes it that after vowing to follow the weighty doctrine of the Buddha you have flung off your outer robes and stand here devoid of shame At the Masters word his sense of shame was restored he donned his robes again and saluting the Master seated himself at the sideThe Brethren having asked the Blessed One to explain to them the matter he had mentioned the Blessed One made clear what had been concealed from them by rebirthOnce on a time Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares in KāsiThe Bodhisatta having come to birth in those days as the kings son by the queenBy the time he could run about a second son was born to the king and the name they gave this child was Prince Moonwho was his joy and delight and their love was crowned with the birth of yet another prince whom they named Prince SunIn his joy at the birth of the boy the king promised to grant her any boon she might ask on the childs behalfBut the queen treasured up the promise to be fulfilled at her own good time hereafterLater when her son had grown up she said to the king Sire when my boy was born you granted me a boon to ask for him Let him be kingNay said the king two sons have I radiant as flaming fires I cannot give the kingdom to your son But when he saw that undaunted by this refusal the queen kept plaguing him time after time to grant her request the king fearing lest the woman should plot evil against his sons sent for them and said My children when Prince Sun was born I granted a boon and now his mother wants the kingdom for himI have no wish to give him the kingdom but women are naturally wicked and she will be plotting evil against you You had better retire to the forest to return at my death to rule in the city which belongs by right to our house So saying with tears and lamentations the king kissed his two sons on the head and sent them forthAs the princes were leaving the palace after their adieux to their father who should see them but Prince Sun himself who was playing in the courtyard And no sooner did he learn what was the matter than he made up his mind to go with his brothers So he too went off in their companyThe three came to the region of the Himalayasand here the Bodhisatta who had turned aside from the road and was sitting at the foot of a tree said to Prince Sun Run down to the pool yonder Sun dear drink and bathe there and then bring us too some water back in a lotusleafNow that pool had been delivered over to a certain watersprite by Vessavaṇa  who said to him With the exception of such as know what is truly godlike all that go down into this pool are yours to devourOver those that do not enter the waters you have no power granted to youAnd thenceforth the watersprite used to ask all who went down into the pool what was truly godlike devouring everyone who did not knowNow it was into this pool that Prince Sun went down quite unsuspiciouslyO yes said he the sun and moonYou dont know said the monster and hauling the prince down into the depths of the water imprisoned him there in his own abodeFinding that his brother was a long time gone the Bodhisatta sent Prince MoonHe too was seized by the watersprite and asked whether he knew what was truly godlikeOh yes I know said he the four quarters of heaven areYou dont know said the watersprite as he hauled this second victim off to the same prisonhouseFinding that this second brother too tarried long the Bodhisatta felt sure that something had happened to them So away he went after them and tracked their footsteps down into the water Realising at once that the pool must be the domain of a watersprite he girded on his sword and took his bow in his hand and waitedNow when the demon found that the Bodhisatta had no intention of entering the water he assumed the shape of a forester and in this guise addressed the Bodhisatta thus Youre tired with your journey mate why dont you go in and have a bathe and a drink and deck yourself with lotuses You would travel on comfortably afterwardsRecognising him at once for a demon the Bodhisatta said It is you who have seized my brothersYes it was was the replyWhyBecause all who go down into this pool belong to meWhat allNot those who know what is truly godlike all save these are mineAnd do you want to know the godlikeI doIf this be so I will tell you what is truly godlikeDo so and I will listenI should like to begin said the Bodhisatta but I am travelstained with my journeyThen the watersprite bathed the Bodhisatta and gave him food to eat and water to drink decked him with flowers sprinkled him with scents and laid out a couch for him in the midst of a gorgeous pavilionSeating himself on this couch and making the watersprite sit at his feet the Bodhisatta said Listen then and you shall hear what the truly godlike is And he repeated this stanzawho shrink from sin The whitesouledAnd when the demon heard this he was pleased and said to the Bodhisatta Man of wisdom I am pleased with you and give you up one of your brothers Which shall I bringThe youngestMan of wisdom though you know so well what the truly godlike is you dont act on your knowledgeHow soWhy you take the younger in preference to the elder without regard to his seniorityDemon I not only know but practise the godlikeIt was on this boys account that we sought refuge in the forestWith us came this boy nor ever thought of turning back againNot a soul would believe me if I were to give out that he had been devoured by a demon in the forest and it is the fear of odium that impels me to demand him at your handsExcellent excellent O man of wisdom cried the demon in approval you not only know but practise the godlike And in token of his pleasure and approval he brought forth the two brothers and gave them both to the BodhisattaThen said the latter to the watersprite Friend it is in consequence of your own evil deeds in times past that you have now been born a demon subsisting on the flesh and blood of other living creatures and in this present birth too you are continuing to do evil This evil conduct will for ever bar you from escaping rebirth in hell and the other evil states Wherefore from this time forth renounce evil and live virtuouslyHaving worked the demons conversion the Bodhisatta continued to dwell at that spot under his protection until one day he read in the stars that his father was dead Then taking the watersprite with him he returned to Benares and took possession of the kingdom making Prince Moon his viceroy and Prince Sun his generalissimo For the watersprite he made a home in a pleasant spot and took measures to ensure his being provided with the choicest garlands flowers and foodHe himself ruled in righteousness until he passed away to fare according to his deedsHis lesson ended the Master preached the Truths at the close whereof that Brother won the Fruit of the First PathAnd the Allknowing Buddha having told the two stories made the connexion linking the two together and identified the Birth by saying The welltodo Brother was the waterdemon of those days nanda was Prince Sun Sāriputta Prince Moon and I myself the eldest brother Prince Mahiṃsāsawas duly named Prince Mahiṃsāsabut by the time he could run about the Bodhisattas mother died Then the king took another queenwith the result that he was seized by the watersprite who said to him Do you know what is truly godlikeThose only godlike call tranquil votaries of Goodit was for him that his mother asked the kingdom from our father and our father refusing to fulfil her demand consented to our flight to

momentary combinationsWhat eighteen imperfections ariseWhen he goes in with mindfulness after the beginning middle and end of an inbreath his cognizance becomes distracted internally and that is an obstruction to concentrationWhen he goes out with mindfulness after the beginning middle and end of an outbreath his cognizance becomes distracted externally and that is an obstruction to concentrationSuch behaviour of craving as hope for and attachment to inbreath is an obstruction to concentrationSuch behaviour of craving as hope for and attachment to outbreath is an obstruction to concentrationAny longing for outbreath in him when he is fatigued by too long or too short inbreath is an obstruction to concentrationAny longing for inbreath in him when he is fatigued by outbreath is an obstruction to concentrationAnd those who know not liberation Perforce must trust in others wordsAre such as will prevent release Of cognizance that they distractThese six defects in concentration Based upon mindfulness of breathingThe longing for inbreath in one Who is by outbreath much fatiguedThe longing for outbreath in one Who is by inbreath much fatiguedExpecting distraction

likewise in his cognizanceWhen one whose cognizance is purified from those hindrances mentioned in Section i develops concentration by mindfulness of breathing with sixteen grounds these eighteen imperfections arise in him in momentary combinationsOverexerted or enticed Or repelled is unconcentratedAre such that when they stain his thought He knows not Higher CognizanceOne whose mindfulness of breathing Has been developed and perfectedHe is then excited in his body And likewise in his cognizanceFinds perturbation of his body Likewise of his cognizanceOne whose mindfulness of breathing Is

cognizance overexerted and attacked by agitation both his body With cognizance enticed and attacked by greed both his body With cognizance repelled and attacked by illwill both his body and his cognizance are disquieted perturbed and excitedWhat are the thirteen kinds of knowledge of cleansingCognizance that runs after the past breaths is attacked by distraction by avoiding that he concentrates it in one place thus cognizance does not become distractedCognizance that looks forward to the future breaths is shakable by avoiding that he composes it there thus also cognizance does not become distractedSlack cognizance is attacked by indolence by exerting it he abandons indolence thus also cognizance does not become distractedOverexerted cognizance is attacked by agitation by curbing it he abandons agitation thus also cognizance does not become distractedEnticed cognizance is attacked by greed by being fully aware of that he abandons greed thus also cognizance does not become distractedRepelled cognizance is attacked by illwill by being fully aware of that he abandons illwill thus also cognizance does not become distractedIn these six aspects cognizance becomes purified and bright and arrives at the unitiesWhat are these unitiesThey are the unity consisting in establishing the willtorelinquish a gift in the act of giving the unity consisting in establishing the sign of serenity in concentration the unity consisting in establishing the characteristic of fall in insight the unity consisting in establishing cessation in the pathThe unity consisting in establishing the willtorelinquish a gift belongs to those resolute on giving up The unity consisting in establishing the sign of serenity belongs to those devoted to the Higher Cognizance The unity consisting in establishing the characteristic of fall belongs to those practising insight The unity consisting in establishing cessation belongs to Noble Persons  In these four instances cognizance arrived at unity enters into purification of the way is intensified in equanimity is satisfied by knowledgeWhat is the beginning the middle and the end of the first jhanaOf the first jhana purification of the way is the beginning intensification of equanimity is the middle and encouragement is the endOf the first jhana purification of the way is the beginningThe beginning has three characteristicsAnd in that cognizance is purified of obstructions and because it is purified cognizance makes way for the central state of equilibrium which is the sign of serenity and because it has made way cognizance enters into that stateThese are the three characteristics of the beginningHence it is said that thefirst jhana is good in the beginning which possesses three characteristicsOf thefirst jhana intensification of equanimity is the middleThe middle has three characteristicsAnd in that he now looks on with equanimity at cognizance that is purified and looks on with equanimity at it as having made way for serenity and looks on with equanimity at the establishment of unity that intensification of equanimity is the middle of thefirst jhanaThese are the three characteristics of the middleHence it is said that thefirst jhana is good in the middle which possesses three characteristicsOf the first jhana encouragement is the end encouragement in the sense that there was nonexcess of the ideas arisen therein encouragement in the sense that the faculties had a single function  encouragement in the sense that the appropriate energy was effective encouragement in the sense of repetitionare the encouragement in the end of the first jhanaHence it is said that the first jhana is good in the end which possesses four characteristicsCognizance that has reached the triple cycle of beginning middle and end thus and is good in the three ways and possesses the ten characteristics also possesses the five jhana factors of appliedthought and sustainedthought and happiness and pleasure and steadiness as well as the five faculties and powers of faith and energy and mindfulness and concentration and understandingWhat is the beginning the middle and the end of

placed on the level piece of groundAs the mans mindfulness established by the saws teeth where they touch the tree trunk without his giving attention to the saws teeth as they approach and recede though they are not unrecognized by him as they do so and so he manifests endeavour carries out a task and achieves a distinctive effectWhat is the endeavourThe body and the cognizance of one who is energetic become wieldy this is the endeavourWhat is the taskImperfections come to be abandoned in one who is energetic and his appliedthoughts are stilled this is the taskWhat is the effectFetters come to be abandoned in one who is energetic and his underlying tendencies come to be done away withSo these three things are not the supporting object of a single cognizance and they are nevertheless not unrecognized and cognizance does not become distracted and he manifests endeavour carries out a task and achieves a distinctive effectWhose mindfulness of breathing in And out is perfect well developedWhen he breaths in it is established in him when he breathes out it is established in himPerfect perfect in the sense of embracing jhana insight and path perfect in the sense of the mutual equipment of all ideas connected therewith perfect in the sense of perfectionWell developed There are four kinds of development development in the sense of nonexcess of ideas arisen therein  development in the sense of single function of the faculties  development in the sense of effectiveness of appropriate energy development in the sense of repetitionThese four kinds of development in

bringing to very sameness in the sense of single function of the faculties bringing to very sameness in the sense of effectiveness of appropriate energy bringing to very sameness owing to verisimilar abolition of defilements opposed theretoVery sameness  there is sameness and very sameness What is samenessIdeas there arisen that are blameless and partake of enlightenment this is samenessWhat is

to himHow is it Master Gotama does all exist All exists this brahmin is the oldest cosmologyThen Master Gotama does all not exist All does not exist this brahmin is the second cosmologyHow is it Master Gotama is all a unityAll is a unity this brahmin is the third cosmologyThen Master Gotama is all a pluralityAll is a plurality this brahmin is the fourth cosmologYWithout veering towards either of these extremes the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma by the middle When this was said that brahmin said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeNow venerable Ananda does the Blessed One praise only the undertaking of all wholesome stateshow well that has been expressed by the venerable Anandathat if the elephanttreasure were allowed to him we would give it to himif the horsetreasure were allowed to him we would give it to himif the boon of a village were allowed to him we would give it to himwhen a great cloud has rained heavily on the mountains then this river Aciravati overflows both its banks So too venerable sir the venerable Ananda can make a triple robe for himself out of this cloakand he can share out his old triple robe among his companions in the holy liferelated to him his entire conversation with King Pasenadi of Kosalaand presented the cloak to the Blessed OneTHUS HAVE I HEARD

more desire to work or to eatHe kept going to the charnel ground and crying My only child where are you My only child where are youThen that householder went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him sat down at one sideThe Blessed One said to him Householder your faculties are not those of one in control of his own mind Your faculties are derangedHow could my faculties not be deranged venerable sir For my dear and beloved only son has diedSince he died I have no more desire to work or to eatI keep going to the charnel ground and crying My only child where are you My only child where are youSo it is householder so it isSorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are born from those who are dear arise from those who are dearVenerable sir who would ever think that sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are born from those who are dear arise from those who are dearVenerable sir happiness and joy are born from those who are dear arise from those who are dearThen displeased with the Blessed Ones words disapproving of them the householder rose from his seat and leftNow on that occasion some gamblers were playing with dice not far from the Blessed OneThen the householder went to those gamblers and said Just now sirs I went to the recluse Gotama and after paying homage to him I sat down at one sideWhen I had done so the recluse Gotama said to me Householder your faculties are not those of one in control of his own mindThen displeased with the recluse Gotamas words disapproving of them I rose from my seat and leftSo it is householder so it isHappiness and

told Queen Mallika This is what has been said by the recluse Gotama Mallika Sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are born from those who are dear arise from those who are dearIf that has been said by the Blessed One sire then it is soNo matter what the recluse Gotama says Mallika applauds it thusJust as a pupil applauds whatever his teacher says to him saying So it is teacher so it is Be off Mallika away with youThen Queen Mallika addressed the brahmin Nalijangha Come brahmin go to the Blessed One andjpay homage in my name with your head at his feet and ask whether he is free from illness and affliction and is healthy strong and abiding in comfort saying Venerable sir Queen Mallika pays homage with her head at the Blessed Ones feet and asks whether the Blessed One is free from illnessand abiding in comfortThen say this Venerable sir have these words been uttered by the Blessed One Sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are bom from those who are dear arise from those who are dearLearn well what the Blessed One replies and report it to meYes madam he replied and he went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideand said Master Gotama Queen Mallika pays homage with her head at Master Gotama  s feet and asks whether he is free from illnessand abiding in comfort And she says this

lamentation pain grief and despair are born from those who are dear arise from those who are dearIt can be understood from this brahmin how sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are born from

put away covetousness and grief for the worldHe dwells contemplating feelings as feelings He dwells contemplating cognizance as cognizance He dwells contemplating ideas as ideas ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the worldThese are the four foundations of mindfulness How does he dwell contemplating the body as a bodyHere someone contemplates the earth body as impermanent not as permanent as painful not as pleasant as not self not as self he becomes dispassionate does not delight he causes greed to fade away does not inflame it he causes cessation not arising he relinquishes does not graspWhen he contemplates as impermanent he abandons perception of permanence when he contemplates as painful he abandons perception of pleasure when he contemplates as not self he abandons perception of self when he becomes dispassionate he abandons delight when his greed fades away he abandons greed when he causes cessation he abandons arising when he relinquishes he abandons grasping cf TrI He contemplates the body in these seven aspectsThe body is the establishment  but it is not the mindfulnessMindfulness is both the establishment and the mindfulnessBy means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he contemplates that bodyHence Development of the Foundation of Mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body is said cf TrIII Development there are four kinds of development development in the sense of nonexcess of ideas produced therein development in the sense of single function of the faculties development in the sense of effectiveness of the appropriate energy and development in the sense of repetition TrI Here someone contemplates the water body    the fire body    the air body    the headhair body    the

contemplating cognizance as cognizanceHow does he dwell contemplating ideas as ideasHere someone contemplates all ideas excluding the body excluding feeling and excluding cognizance as impermanent not as permanent he abandons grasping cfTrIII He contemplates ideas in these seven aspectsIdeas are the establishment but they are not the mindfulnessMindfulness is both the establishment and the

contemplates cognizance in these seven aspectshe abandons graspingThus I heard At one time the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthi in Jetas Grove Anāthapindikas ParkThere he addressed the bhikkhus thus BhikkhusVenerable Sir they repliedThe Blessed One said thisBhikkhus when a bhikkhu sees all formations as impermanent it is possible that he shall make a choice in conformity with actuality and making a choice in conformity with actuality it is possible that he shall enter upon the certainty of lightness and by entering upon the certainty of lightness it is possible that he shall realize the fruit of streamentry or the fruit of oncereturn or the fruit of nonreturn or the fruit of arahantshipBhikkhus when a bhikkhu sees any formation as pleasant it is not possible that he shall make a choice in conformity and and so on as in  up to or the fruit of arahantshipBhikkhus when a bhikkhu sees all formations as painful it is possible that he shall make a choice in conformity and and so on as in  up

painful it is not possible that he shall make a choice in conformity and  and so on as in  up to or the fruit of arahantshipBhikkhus when a bhikkhu sees nibbana as pleasant it is possible that he shall make a choice in conformity and  and so on as in  up to  or the fruit of arahantship In how many aspects does he choose in conformity with actuality In how many aspects does he enter upon the certainty of lightnessHe chooses in conformity with actuality in forty aspects He enters upon the certainty of lightness in forty aspectsIn what forty aspects does he choose in conformity In what forty aspects does he enter upon the certainty of lightnessHe sees the five aggregates as impermanent as painful as a disease a boil a dart a calamity an affliction as alien as disintegrating as a plague a disaster a terror a menace as fickle perishable unenduring as no protection no shelter no refuge as empty vain void not self as a danger as subject to change as having no core as the root of

kinds of contemplation of not self does he haveFive and twenty contemplations of not self And fifty contemplations of impermanenceEnd of Treatise on insightBhikkhus when a bhikkhu sees any formation as permanent it is not possible that he shall make a choice in conformity with actuality and without making a choice in conformity with actuality it is not possible that he shall enter upon the certainty of lightness and without entering upon the certainty of lightness it is not possible that he shall realize the fruit of streamentry or the fruit of oncereturn or the fruit of nonreturn or

Seeing the five aggregates as connected with the idea of defilement he chooses in conformity with actualityseeing how the cessation of the five aggregates is nibbana which is without defilement he enters upon the certainty of lightnessHerein what are the Threads Terms of Expression They are  Expression in terms of greed   hate  delusion  nongreed  nonhate  nondelusion  bodily action  verbal action  mental action  the faith faculty  energy faculty  mindfulness faculty  concentration faculty  understanding facultyHerein what is that expressed in terms of greed With a man engrossed in thoughts And strong in lust and beauty seeingThen grows his craving more and more The while he makes his bondage firm  With a man engrossed in thoughts is lust for sensual desires And beauty seeing  is the object of the lust for sensual desires Then grows his craving more and more  is craving for sensual desires The while he makes his bondage firm  is lust In this way whatever the idea presented as the Root that idea alone should be taken up here  for the Blessed One does not teach an idea other than the idea he is instigated byOf someone who thinks sensualdesire thinking he demonstrates that same thinking by sensualdesire thinkingBy  strong in lust  he demonstrates that same thinkings objectBy and beauty seeing Then grows his craving more and more he demonstrates that same lust as craving for sensual desiresBy  The while he makes his bondage firm he demonstrates that same lust as the fetter of cravingThat is how it should be assessed in the case of versesHerein the Blessed One demonstrates a single idea in three ways as to Outcome as to Cause and as to Fruit For example When giving a man is dear and many frequent him The name he gets is goad his fame increasesHe enters an assembly undismayed  A man intrepid without avarice When giving any gift which is the ground for making merit consisting in givingthis is the Cause herein many frequent him  and thatwith the words good name  a good name spreads abroad in the world and that he is dear and agreeable to many peopleThat on the dissolution of the body he reappears among the gods is the FruitThis is expressed in terms of greedHerein what is that expressed in terms of hateSomeone who kills a breathing thing Who speaks false speech Someone who kills a breathing thing   one who is affected by hate kills a breathing thing Who speaks false speech  also one who speaks false speech owing to vexation by hate Who has the habit to indulge In drinking spirituous liquor   there is a source for hateUnless he these five risks abandons refers to the transgression  of the five training precepts  and this is a description of them when they are all hateborn  And this idea too can be demonstrated as to cause as to outcome and as to fruit Herein that he is aggressive by body or by speech this is his state of a doer of the ill done And that he intends the mental misconduct consisting in illwill this is his  state of a  cogitator of the illcogitated Since he is possessed of these fools characteristics he exists with the three types of pain and grief correspondingly born therefrom And when he has gone to a meeting or gone to an assembly he talks the type of talk born therefromAnd when this tenfold course of unprofitable action  beginning with killing breathing things comes into being with that as source he experiences pain and griefFurthermore when he sees a felon who has offended the king  arrested by the king and put to death then it occurs to him  If the king knew  about me he might have me put to death too   and with that as source he experiences pain and griefFurthermore  with that as source he experiences pain and grief  Accordingly the fools characteristic is the causethe three corresponding kinds of pain born therefrom are the outcomeHerein what is that expressed in terms of delusionHe who is pursuing the roundabout of births which has no recognizable end  has ignorance for his causeAnd the purposes of determinativeacts have ignorance for their condition That the unseeing of the Buddhas word is ignorance is demonstrated in the Thread tooAnd in so far as he who is ignorant treats  determinations as self and allows the five views  in regard to the five categories thus  this Thread is consequently presented under ignoranceNow the Master  presents it thus in the Thread under ignoranceAnd so there must only be demonstrated there the unshared idea by which he demonstrates itnot any other  and the rest of the four Truths in detail  Now the nonunderstanding herein is suffering this is the outcome When not understanding he determines  the various kinds of determinations this is the cause In so far as he misapprehends the type of views thus  this too is the outcomeThe renewal of being that he generates is the fruitAnd so this idea too is demonstrated as to cause as to fruit and as to outcomeBut here in the case of these three some ideas that is fruit and outcome may appear shared in commonand then only  the cause as a beginning will be presented in a ThreadHow would that be  For example Herein when someone goes a bad way through will and goes a bad way through fear this is the unprofitable root greed Thus these three unprofitable roots should be regarded as only a beginning that is as causelikewise two likewise  three  for when not presented as a beginning  no cause or outcome or fruit can be demonstratedAnd the verse here is this Herein will and fear  are greed as demonstrated aboveThis is expressed in terms of delusionHerein what is that expressed in terms of nongreed  Who contemplating ugliness Abides with faculties restrainedHerein the scrutiny of ugliness is the giving up of gratification through perception of beauty by seeing the disappointment in sensual desiresThat he has restrained his faculties is the fulfilment  of that same nongreed by not assuming any grieving for those sensual desires regarded as mine So when this nongreed is remembered as the basis for the state of a contemplator of ugliness that nongreed is a causeWhen remembered as the province of guardedness in the faculty doors and when remembered besides as that of the state of knowing the right amount in eating then this is the outcomeThat  Him Miira sure no more can shake Than can the wind a rocky peak is the fruitSo it is the same idea presented in the beginning that is also in the middle and the end  Bhikkhusfor the nonarising of unarisen will for sensual desires for the abandoning of arisen will for sensual desires I see no idea other than the sign of uglinessHerein in one wlio gives the sign of ugliness attention the unarisen will for sensual desires  does not arise and the arisen is abandoned  But in so far as it is only unarisen lust for sensual desires that is gripped in this way the fruit has both lust for form and lust for the formlessSo this idea too has been demonstrated as to cause as to outcome and as to fruitThis is expressed in terms of nongreedHerein what is that expressed in terms of nonhate Should a man with no hate  in liis heart kindlylove One breathing thing only by that he is skilledBut when he feels pity for all breathing things He has infinite scope in the merit he makes Should a man with no hate  in his heart kindlylove One breathing thing only  this nonhateis gratification through counteraction  By that he is skilled   it is owing to his being associated with that skilful idea that he comes under the description in terms of ideas He has infinite scope in the merit he makes   the ripening of that is ripening only of the kind of action belonging to the worlds not of that dissociated from worldsHerein the kindlyloving is the causeThe great merit he produces extending as far as the plane of nonillwill  does is the fruitSo in the case of nonhate too  it has been demonstrated as to cause as to outcome and as to fruit Herein the  heartdeliverance of lovingkindness  which in the ideas of the Noble Ones is the  is the cause on the plane belonging to the worlds That he  these eleven ideas are the outcomeAnd that he arises in the body of the Retinue of High Divinity as One Who Has Not Yet Done This is expressed in terms of nonhateHerein what is that expressed in terms of nondelusion Best  is understanding is the basis  for nondelusion The kind that deals with penetration  is the kind that deals with extinction since  it penetrates how things are The kind that rightly understands The exhaustion of birth and death  is nondelusionThe understanding is the causeThat he understands is the outcomeThe exhaustion of birth and death is the fruitSo non delusion has been demonstrated by cause by outcome and by fruit Herein what is the Ishallcometoknowfinallytheasyetnotfinallyknown facultyHere bhikkhus a bhikkhu arouses will for the actualizing of the as yet unactualized Noble Truth of Suffering and he makes efforts instigates energy exerts his cognizance and endeavours   Herein what is the actoffinalknowing facultyHere bhikkhus a bhikkhu understands how it is that  This is Suffering  down to  the Path  This is actoffinalknowing faculty  Likewise here as in   the understanding is the causeThat he arouses will and makes efforts and that  he understands is the outcomeThat whereby there is entire exhaustion  of taints is the cause That knowledge of exhaustion arises and also knowledge of nonarising is the outcomeThe Arahantship is the fruitHerein the words Birth is exhausted for me the divine life has been lived out done is what was to be done  refer to knowledge of exhaustionThese are the three faculties So nondelusion too has been demonstrated as to cause as to outcome and as to fruit This is expressed in termns of nondelusionThese have been demonstrated by unshared quotations Herein what are those where the profitable roots are sharedHerein what is the root of the profitableHerein what is the profitableHerein the three roots of the profitable are the causeHerein the nonhate is the cause
